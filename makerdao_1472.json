                    "content": "MakerDAO\u2019s delegate compensation is paid out based on a quadratic formula. Each increasing MKR that is delegated to an individual Recognized Delegate (RD) is worth less when it comes to calculating compensation until 10k MKR is delegated, at which point each additional MKR is valued at zero and the comp maxes out. Due to this math, there is a considerable incentive for individuals or organizations to attempt to game the delegation compensation system by creating multiple Recognized Delegate addresses under pseudonyms. For instance, it is far more lucrative to have 2 Recognized Delegate accounts with 5k MKR delegated to each (comp: 16,970 DAI/mo) as opposed to 1 account with 10k MKR delegated (comp: 12,000 DAI/mo). As political factions grow within the DAO, there is also more opportunity for 1 person, with 1 unique set of principles, to create multiple pseudonymous RD accounts, feigning different sets of DAO-related values to appease various ideologies when it comes to the future of the DAO. Gitcoin has faced a very similar situation over the past few years and created this nice 2-minute explainer of the problem:     To pursue stronger incentive alignment and a more genuine governance system, should the DAO consider putting new and existing RDs through some sort of sybil resistance check (i.e. Gitcoin Passport) to work toward ensuring that each RD is a unique human or organization and that it\u2019s more difficult for a single human/org to benefit from more than 1 RD account?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     NOTE: Restarted the poll after being live for 10 min because I failed to enable public voting initially. ",

The Gitcoin model is to give options to have your social reputation vouched for in a way that would allow people like Hasu to easily pass, and keep someone who created an anon identity specifically to only use on the Maker forum out of the RD program. Gitcoin Passport docs are a good place to start learning more about easy ways to implement this. ",

I felt the simplest way to handle the MKR sybil compensation issue was to both unify MKR compensation (for all governance participants) and to make rewards linear to MKR voting as per my delegate thread post.   Put simply sybil\u2019s only matter when one deviates from rewards being linear to MKR held or capped in some way.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:   Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal.  Simple gover\u2026     The above suggestion for how to handle compensation handles a number of governance issues but doesn\u2019t address what I consider larger governance issues pointed out in other posts on the subject.     [Informal Poll] Potential Issue with Protocol Paid Delegates Governance   @Spidomo Great question and something I didn\u2019t even think about when considering another post with suggested changes to the delegate process so we could consider fair compensation for delegates.  I am going to have to think about your question a bit and probably do some research before coming back with an answer.  I do think if delegates have sufficient MKR to pass an executive they basically have the power to alter their own pay structures.   This becomes a potential conflict of interest.   I t\u2026      and a thread on the general subject that never went anywhere at the time.    Suggested changes to Maker Delegation system. Governance       I was thinking about the Maker MKR delegate compensation and talking about this with a friend who is a former elected official.  https://forum.makerdao.com/t/delegate-compensation-informal-poll  As a delegate my own conflict of interest on this poll is that I stand to gain some \u2018compensation\u2019.  Whether a delegate or not, as a MKR holder I think if a delegate can self elect and then delegate to themselves their own MKR to \u2018earn compensation\u2019 this will be a potential system abuse vector.  Governan\u2026     I did not address the sybil issue at all in the above posts because I felt this ultimately would come up with a more general discussion regarding anonymous actors in MakerDAO that hasn\u2019t really happened yet either.

What problem does it solve? And how will it become an essential building block for a decentralized society? Let's dive in! \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udc47 1...\u2026      Found a solid thread on Github Passport. It\u2019s more or less a web-of-trust model where your personal score increases by verifying the legitimacy of other participants. It looks like to initially onboard, users have the option of connecting an ENS, Google, or a Proof of Humanity account.  TLDR: \u201cGitcoin Passport is an identity aggregator that allows users to verify personhood, help defends against the Sybil attack, and encourage DAO to build more on a one-human-one-vote scheme.\u201d  Passport utilizes \u201cQuadratic funding\u201d (QF), which allocates funds based on the sum of an individual or team\u2019s contribution to each project.  image1200\u00d7549 71.1 KB  The main benefit of QF is that the number of contributions (to a grant) matter more than the amount funded, pushing protocol power closer to the edges.  Per the thread, the best way to handle Sybil resistance is to increase the cost of the attack - be it time, money, or effort. This can be accomplished in a number of ways.  Identify adversarial patterns that force attackers to place increased effort into the impersonation of legit ID. Increase the transaction or entry fee. ID and personhood verification.  Great post @ChrisBlec, and whether or not Passport is specifically used, I\u2019m in favor of the web of trust model as a future implementation. ",

I would prefer a solution allowing anons to verify unique humanity if possible as that would be more in keeping with the ethos of a DAO.   I suppose there is a world where you can have shadow delegates shelter the anon-friendly delegates and recognized delegates go through some form of proof of humanity gate. However, I worry that the more we roll out exceptions and complications the harder it will be to manage what is already quite a substantial piece of governance infrastructure. And gating compensation only to doxed delegates is probably not great for incentivizing broader participation. ",
