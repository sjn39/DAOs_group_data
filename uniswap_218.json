As it stands, Gauntlet currently has two addresses that have UNI delegated to it: EOA: 0x6626593C237f530D15aE9980A95ef938Ac15c35c Multi-Sig: 0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02 We\u2019re in the process of consolidating all delegations to one address (multi-sig). If you are currently delegating to the EOA, we are asking you to re-delegate to the multi-sig address. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me here or on Twitter (@mattdobel, @gauntletnetwork). Thanks for your support. ",
