                    "content": "A few days ago I came across this list of unsolicited advice. Without looking for it, I found myself reading Kevin Kelly\u2019s 68 life lessons. I confess that some of them I have not yet understood, others have reinforced ideas that I already had and others have directly made me rethink what I thought I knew. Simple and elegant. When I read it I thought it should be shared, and I think this community is the right place to do it. So I highly recommend you treat yourself with these unsolicited life lessons. I drop the link here and if you want you can share which of these unsolicited pieces of advice you are willing to try to follow. For my part, I will try to follow the first one as soon as I can understand number 22.  68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice  \u2022 Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe. \u2022 Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points. \u2022 Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better. \u2022 Don\u2019t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it. \u2022 Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them \u201cIs there more?\u201d, until there is no more. \u2022 A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can\u2019t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier. \u2022 Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at. \u2022 Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It\u2019s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends. \u2022 Don\u2019t trust all-purpose glue. \u2022 Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations. \u2022 Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don\u2019t be in debt to losers. \u2022 Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes. \u2022 Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed. \u2022 Don\u2019t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you. \u2022 Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time\u2019s answer is close to the truth. \u2022 Don\u2019t be the best. Be the only. \u2022 Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead. \u2022 Don\u2019t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It\u2019s amazing how often a second try works. \u2022 The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing. \u2022 Promptness is a sign of respect. \u2022 When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your \u201cworst\u201d lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won\u2019t be afraid of the worst case scenario. \u2022 Trust me: There is no \u201cthem\u201d. \u2022 The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested. \u2022 Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away. \u2022 To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them. \u2022 The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues. \u2022 If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you\u2019re done with it, don\u2019t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it. \u2022 Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth. \u2022 To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It\u2019s astounding how powerful this ownership is. \u2022 Never get involved in a land war in Asia. \u2022 You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further. \u2022 Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up. \u2022 Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can\u2019t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don\u2019t select. While you sketch, don\u2019t inspect. While you write the first draft, don\u2019t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement. \u2022 If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting. \u2022 Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you\u2019ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom. \u2022 Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat. \u2022 This is true: It\u2019s hard to cheat an honest man. \u2022 When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm\u2019s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you\u2019ll find it. \u2022 You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on. \u2022 If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it. \u2022 Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison. \u2022 There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with. \u2022 Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete. \u2022 When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation. \u2022 Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed\u2019s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving. \u2022 For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its life. \u2022Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It\u2019s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows. \u2022 When crisis and disaster strike, don\u2019t waste them. No problems, no progress. \u2022 On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first, bypassing the cities. You\u2019ll maximize the shock of otherness in the remote, and then later you\u2019ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back. \u2022 When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter. \u2022 Don\u2019t say anything about someone in email you would not be comfortable saying to them directly, because eventually they will read it. \u2022 If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss. \u2022 Art is in what you leave out. \u2022 Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will. \u2022 Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn\u2019t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you\u2019ll almost always get your answer. \u2022 How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely. \u2022 Don\u2019t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise. \u2022 When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the conflict. \u2022 Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures. \u2022 You really don\u2019t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person. \u2022 Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time. \u2022 A vacation + a disaster = an adventure. \u2022 Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford. \u2022 Learn how to take a 20-minute power nap without embarrassment. \u2022 Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don\u2019t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is \u201cmaster something, anything\u201d. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is. \u2022 I\u2019m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today. \u2022 Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don\u2019t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems. \u2022 The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia. ",
