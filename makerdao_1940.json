                    "content": " BlockTower Credit: PECU Comment  Introduction BlockTower in partnership with Centrifuge are seeking to launch a new RWA offering as part of the BlockTower Credit RWA-010, 011, 012, 013 proposal. Due to a slightly different technical implementation being used on-top of MIP21, PECU wanted to add additional context to CES\u2019s already comprehensive Technical Assessment. This post will therefore expand upon items surfaced by CES, with the goal of ensuring that the community is aware of the concerns being raised for their due diligence and consideration as MKR voters.  Maker Vault Design & Reporting Maker vaults were originally designed for crypto native collateral, where vaults are triggered for liquidation when their collateral becomes undercollateralized. This is done by determining the collateral value through oracles, applying a per-second stability fee, and if the collateral ratio is breached, then the collateral will be liquidated into a secondary market. When the on-chain collateral is replaced with RWAs, some differences appear - it no longer becomes possible to determine the real time value of RWAs, and so the true collateral value must be assumed. The assumption that the debt is not impaired and remains serviceable in illiquid secondary markets must be provided through off-chain reporting either by a core unit or a 3rd party. It should also be explicitly called out that the ability to determine whether accrued stability fees will actually be realized can only be determined once the vault has been closed or the underlying drop tokens are wound down. This approach has already been approved by MKR voters and is common with existing RWA deals, however the size of this deal makes reporting and transparency much more prudent.  Junior Capital Requirements Junior capital should cover the accrual of stability fees over the duration of the loan, however, again, as it is not possible to provide a realtime collateral value, it becomes challenging to guarantee that the junior capital provided is sufficient over the duration of the loan. This can of course be supported via off-chain agreements, but introduces trust assumptions and again relies on continued ongoing reporting. Again, this is nothing new and in current deals is supported by 3rd party entities, but as is the nature of off-chain agreements, PECU felt it is warranted to call this out to voters.  Vault Duration It is also worth calling out that historically the Tinlake contracts were designed for funding short term trade and accounts receivable deals which is different from the longer-term financing and larger deal flow that is seen in this proposal. This is relevant because although the implementation and interest accrual will be the same as in previous deals, the reporting will need to be managed over a period of years and with greater scrutiny relative to the risk - so again presenting a cautionary requirement for off-chain reporting and trust in 3rd parties. It is also worth considering what the loss would be for liquidating this facility early in the event that market conditions or the Endgame stance dictate such action midway through the term.  Collateral Adapter & Multiple Vaults Moving into the technical space, a further difference in this particular deal is to use a single collateral adapter to support each of the four vaults (4 Tinlake manager adapters) within the Maker protocol, where one vault is of investment grade credit (bonds), and the remaining three are a variety of private credit. Each vault will have the same stability fee, junior capital conditions, and TIN/DROP conditions that users are familiar with in existing deals - where DROP (senior) to TIN (junior) capital is represented 70/30. Putting this into practice, it means that BlockTower will be required to deposit junior capital of 64M across the vaults, in order to withdraw 150M. This varies from previous implementations where there was always only one collateral adapter and one collateral type. Reiterating the previous reporting needs, this change shifts additional monitoring overhead to Maker to ensure that the collective value of the vaults remain in good standing, and that the junior capital representing this diversified pool of loans remains sufficient. The above description also introduces the potential for new bespoke management rules across vaults that are not on-chain and may not be fully transparent, including; monitoring levels of junior capital collateralization, the status of the debt service coverage covenant, and the minimum vault performance covenant. Similarly, the reporting will need to take into account that if any three of the four vaults default, then the entire portfolio must be triggered for liquidation. It is our understanding that a 3rd party, Ankura trust, will ensure that the junior capital is present. The designed structure in theory meets all these reporting requirements, however PECU is again flagging the real world trust assumptions required for collateral value calculation. It is our understanding that legal reasons prohibit the commingling of assets and cash flows within a single vault at Maker which has led to this proposed design. The design is technically feasible, however the burden of reporting and complexity being shifted from Centrifuge to MakerDAO should be a factor for consideration. Similarly, the introduction of potential technical debt for a new pattern may introduce future maintenance work. The alternative would be reworking this to surface the four vaults on the Centrifuge side.  Conclusion Protocol Engineering supports the official Technical Assessment from CES and its risk classification as Medium. This technical solution utilizes the already live MIP21 and MIP22 Centrifuge contracts. As per prior Centrifuge collateral onboardings, the Centrifuge TinLake liquidation contracts are out of the scope of our comment. The risks described in our MIP22 Assessment still stand for this proposal and should be considered in light of the larger debt ceilings being discussed. PECU therefore hopes that this additional commentary will help inform Maker voters that in addition to the initial vault setup, there is an ongoing reporting, technical and maintenance risk overhead that will need to be maintained throughout the life of the vaults to ensure ongoing due diligence is satisfactory.
