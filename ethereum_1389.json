One approach is to make sure that working topics have a web presence, a temp chat room is created, the topic champion updates and monitors that room.  @boris tweet-replied:  I setup an EthMagicians Matrix room as listed on the livestream page so that questions can be relayed. There may be some remote presenters. Don\u2019t have enough facilitators or infrastructure or experience for call-ins this time. Discussions will be technical in nature.  And then\u2026  I have some ideas around ongoing live/interactive \u2014 eg a weekly or every other week \u201cpresent my new EIP\u201d video \u2014 but that will require commitment from more people volunteering. Role of @EthMagicians / needs of ETH community will evolve.  ",
