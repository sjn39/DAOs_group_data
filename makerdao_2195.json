                    "content": "I am expressing my concern regarding Maker and the intensity of regulators lately. Many countries are moving away from using the dollar for international trade, and the US economy is having serious problems with inflation. Also, the government can\u2019t raise rates as much as it had done in the Volcker era due to many of its citizens living in debt. CBDC is more and more at the door. Analyzing all this data makes me think that it is very likely that the government shortly before the CBDC era will stop, destroy or make an aggressive change in some way to Coinbase, Circle, and Paxos, as these hinder the absolute control that the government intends to have with CBDC, possibly even think that if inflation gets out of hand and stop fighting it, citizens react by taking refuge in Btc or Eth further accelerating inflation, so I believe the government will try to hurt crypto as much as possible so that citizens will find it more difficult to see crypto as they used to see gold. USDC is a solution to the instability of DAI, and it is okay, but I think it is necessary to develop another as soon as possible another solution to have a stable DAI. Then to get USDC off our backs charge a minimum interest to those who are using the PSM so that they close those positions, plus forget all business with Coinbase or any other company in which if the government harms it it will also damage part of the Maker economy. These are dangerous times in which the government will take down part of the economy of this ecosystem, and I want Maker to come out unscathed. ",
