For further information about the scope of Oracles in Maker Teleport please review the Teleport Oracle Overview document.  Attestation Addresses The addresses which will provide attestations for Maker Teleport are indicated below. These addresses are the same ones that Maker Governance has already approved to be Feeds for the DAO\u2019s Oracles (minus two addresses, which will be addressed in a subsequent proposal). 0xaC8519b3495d8A3E3E44c041521cF7aC3f8F63B3 0x4f95d9B4D842B2E2B1d1AC3f2Cf548B93Fd77c67 0xE6367a7Da2b20ecB94A25Ef06F3b551baB2682e6 0xFbaF3a7eB4Ec2962bd1847687E56aAEE855F5D00 0x16655369Eb59F3e1cAFBCfAC6D3Dd4001328f747 0xC9508E9E3Ccf319F5333A5B8c825418ABeC688BA 0xA8EB82456ed9bAE55841529888cDE9152468635A 0x83e23C207a67a9f9cB680ce84869B91473403e7d 0xDA1d2961Da837891f43235FddF66BAD26f41368b 0x4b0E327C08e23dD08cb87Ec994915a5375619aa2 0xfeEd00AA3F0845AFE52Df9ECFE372549B74C69D2 0x8aFBD9c3D794eD8DF903b3468f4c4Ea85be953FB 0x8de9c5F1AC1D4d02bbfC25fD178f5DAA4D5B26dC 0xd94BBe83b4a68940839cD151478852d16B3eF891 0xa580BBCB1Cee2BCec4De2Ea870D20a12A964819e 0x75ef8432566A79C86BBF207A47df3963B8Cf0753 0xD27Fa2361bC2CfB9A591fb289244C538E190684B 0x60da93D9903cb7d3eD450D4F81D402f7C4F71dd9 0x71eCFF5261bAA115dcB1D9335c88678324b8A987 0x77eb6cf8d732fe4d92c427fcdd83142db3b742f7 0x8ff6a38A1CD6a42cAac45F08eB0c802253f68dfD 0x130431b4560Cd1d74A990AE86C337a33171FF3c6 0x3cb645a8f10fb7b0721eabae958f77a878441cb9 0xd72ba9402e9f3ff01959d6c841ddd13615ffff42   Quorum As was suggested in the aforementioned Teleport Oracle Overview, the Oracle Core Unit is recommending a quorum of 13 attestations necessary for Teleport execution. This mirrors the quorum requirements used by the Maker Oracles that were ratified by Maker Governance. The Oracle Core Unit will monitor Maker Teleport usage closely and may suggest configuration changes in the future to finetune Maker Teleport to optimize for qualities such as cost and security. ",
