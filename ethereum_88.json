                    "content": " Abstract This EIP separates the ERC-721 NFT\u2019s commercial usage rights from it\u2019s ownership to allow for the independent management of those rights.  Motivation Most NFTs have a simplified ownership verification mechanism, with a sole owner of an NFT. Under this model, other rights, such as display, or creating derivative works or distribution, are not possible to grant, limiting the value and commercialization of NFTs. Therefore, the separation of an NFT\u2019s ownership and user rights can enhance its commercial value. Commercial right is a broad concept based on the copyright, including the rights of copy, display, distribution, renting, commercial use, modify, reproduce and sublicense etc.  With the development of the Metaverse, NFTs are becoming more diverse, with new use cases such as digital collections, virtual real estate, music, art, social media, and digital asset of all kinds. The copyright and authorization based on NFTs are becoming a potential business form.

The authorizeUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint duration) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The authorizeUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, string[] rights; uint duration) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The extendDuration(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint duration) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The updateUserRights(uint256 tokenId, address user, string[] rights) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The getExpires(uint256 tokenId, address user) function MAY be implemented as pure or view. The getUserRights(uint256 tokenId, address user) function MAY be implemented as pure and view. The updateUserLimit(unit256 userLimit) function MAY be implemented aspublic or external. The updateResetAllowed(bool resetAllowed) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The checkAuthorizationAvailability(uint256 tokenId) function MAY be implemented as pure or view. The resetUser(uint256 tokenId, address user) function MAY be implemented as public or external. The authorizeUser event MUST be emitted when the user of a NFT is changed or the authorization expires time is updated. The updateUserLimit event MUST be emitted when the number of users that can be authorized per NFT is updated.  Rationale First of all, NFT contract owner can set the maximum number of authorized users to each NFT and whether the NFT owner can cancel the authorization at any time to protect the interests of the parties involved. Secondly, there is a resetAllowed flag to control the rights between the NFT owner and the users for the contract owner. If the flag is set to true, then the NFT owner can disable usage rights of all authorized users at any time. Thirdly, the rights within the user record struct is used to store what rights has been authorized to a user by the NFT owner, in other words, the NFT owner can authorize a user with specific rights and update it when necessary. Finally, this design can be seamlessly integrated with third parties. It is an extension of ERC-721, therefore it can be easily integrated into a new NFT project. Other projects can directly interact with these interfaces and functions to implement their own types of transactions. For example, an announcement platform could use this EIP to allow all NFT owners to make authorization or deauthorization at any time.  Backwards Compatibility This standard is compatible with ERC-721 since it is an extension of it.  Security Considerations When the resetAllowed flag is false, which means the authorization can not be revoked by NFT owner during the period of authorization, users of the EIP need to make sure the authorization fee can be fairly assigned if the NFT was sold to a new holder. Here is a solution for taking reference: the authorization fee paid by the users can be held in an escrow contract for a period of time depending on the duration of the authorization. For example, if the authorization duration is 12 months and the fee in total is 10 ETH, then if the NFT is transferred after 3 months, then only 2.5 ETH would be sent and the remaining 7.5 ETH would be refunded.

As it stands, this EIP does not provide legally binding separation of the ownership classes and is, at most, a measure of signaling that only adds cost overhead. Today, one can already achieve highly granular on-chain usage permissions with the help of something like Delegatable ETH. Typically, an EIP does not provide use-case nuances, and implementation details as an EIP define an interface, not the following implementation. With the large amount of opinion that has been included with things such as duration and rights[], this EIP will be unusable on anything that isn\u2019t an L2 the second any individual wants to write more than a sentence into the array. The chain is not a database and storing strings as if it is, is incredibly bad practice and reflective that this EIP is far from adoptable. This continues with functions such as updateUserLimit, updateResetAllowed, resetUser are not vital to the functioning of the EIP and, again, are an implementation detail that should not be standardized (especially given the lack of detail put into a clearly defined interface) This is again reaffirmed by the lack of events defined and only functions.   For such a complex situation, a standard must be better defined than 5585. Is there a reason that the traditional way of building an EIP has been forgone in preference of the proposal here today?   What about the needs from 5585, make one incapable of using a far more powerful and better-defined standard to achieve the same results such as EIP-4337   A legally binding contract is defined (generally) by the existence of an offer, consideration, and acceptance (while maintaining competency). That cannot be done on the blockchain, especially not with this EIP. Is the aim of this EIP to enable signaling rather than an agreement that is legally binding?   ",

Agree that this EIP is pretty short on modeling a legally binding contract. But it\u2019s not necessarily true that it couldn\u2019t be done. I believe the UK (including commonwealth territories such as the BVI, where a lot of projects are registered) and the State of New York both have cleared on-chain records as legal contracts. There are a number of companies in Singapore that make the assumption that on-chain contracts are valid, assuming they cover the legal properties for defining a contract as you\u2019ve stated. There is a considerable number of abandoned projects that have attempted to implement Ricardian contracts and the list of prior literature is somewhat long. https://iang.org/papers/intersection_ricardian_smart.html For the OP, if you haven\u2019t already, spending some time to read up on Monax and check out Hyperledger Burrow, it would be time well spent. Burrow is EVM compatible framework for implementing legal contracts. I\u2019m still not quite sure why more EIPs haven\u2019t borrowed from the ideas there, but copyright might be a good place to start. ",

                    "content": "Hi, @CHANCE , very appreciate for your suggestions, here are our ideas for discussion. First of all, 5585 is an application layer protocol rather than a pure technical protocol. Our starting point for this protocol are: (1) What problems need to be solved in the next stage of the development of the NFT market? (2) What factors influence the promotion of commercialization and applications? And these are also the problems we are facing in our projects now. A conclusion from our extensive communication with NFT enthusiasts, operators, commercial customers and lawyers in the copyright field in North America and Asia is that it is necessary to be able to use NFTs more simply, conveniently, openly and transparently, and at the same time, to be able to clarify and protect the rights of users. The current standard is designed and considered based on these recommendations and optimized to the greatest extent possible. Secondly, there are many excellent NFTs in the market now, such as BAYC, Azuki, Doodle, etc. These NFT projects have authorized some of the rights of NFT to the owners, and binds relevant rights based on the ownership on-chain. Recently a16z has also launched a series of on-chain NFT license agreements to provide a set of standardized NFT rights, and these are the basis for us to make the rights of NFT owners and users more transparent. We believe that with the development of the industry, a set of standards for NFT rights will be formed, which can play a greater value to the market. Now we are cooperating with some global lawyer teams and commercial companies to promote the development in this area. We can provide NFT operators with the ability to choose rights and specifications that are more suitable for them. And we also welcome growing numbers of people to participate and contribute together. We believe it will facilitate the future development of the NFT industry. BAYC Terms & Conditions: BAYC Thirdly, regarding the standard of application, how to encourage NFT operators willing to participate but with the lowest cost, we provide some interfaces for them to manage rights. At the beginning, we suggest that the easiest way of using rights is just set it to ALL, which means all the rights of owner will be authorized to users. With the wider adoption of the a16z protocol and the specification of industry development, rights will have a set of standards, which can support NFT owners to manage their rights more flexibly to maximize benefits. a16z\u2019s copyright agreement : The Can\u2019t Be Evil NFT Licenses - a16z crypto Finally, regarding your ideas and technical suggestions, we have considered during our EIP design, some of them are absolutely correct and helpful, we are just trying to find a balance between technology and business, because the commercialization of NFT needs a whole picture to be implemented. So 5585 is still under continuous improvement. We hope that more experts in the field of technology, law, business and NFT enthusiasts can participate, so as to promote the development and extention of 5585 to support the NFT market. We believe it will play a broader role in the combination of on-chain and off-chain, on-chain games and Metaverse. At the same time, it can be compatible with the copyright related laws of various countries to better protect the rights of users. ",
