I would encourage anyone that is interested in contributing to do so. I\u2019ve included links in the readme to help with on-boarding and setting up a development environment to the point where you can easily work on the theme. The setup took me approximately an hour, I imagine it will go faster now that all the appropriate guides and links are in one central location. In terms of expertise, if you know CSS you will be capable of doing about 80% of the work. There is some scripting and more advanced features that would require more expertise, this probably makes up the remaining 20%. I\u2019m currently in the \u2018can just about barely work with CSS\u2019 camp, so any additional contributions would be greatly appreciated. ",
