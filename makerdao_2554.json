                    "content": "This is a MIP6 Proposal for the addition of New Silver\u2019s tokenized real estate backed loans to MCD by New Silver. New Silver originates and administers the asset collateralization using Centrifuge. This is the continuation of a joint pilot together with the Maker Foundation in summer 2019 where we tokenized a first mortgage as a pilot transaction. Much of how Centrifuge works has been covered in the previous MIP6 proposals [CF-DROP,PC-DROP]. In the following we have added a few links that go into more detail on the technical topics.  1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The asset originator, New Silver, is represented by Kirill Bensonoff (@prankstr25, [email\u00a0protected], Managing Partner at New Silver) and Alex Shvayetsky ([email\u00a0protected] Managing Partner at New Silver). Centrifuge is providing the technology and framework for bringing real-world assets to MCD. The main contact on Tinlake for the application is Lucas Vogelsang (@spin, [email\u00a0protected]) of Centrifuge as well as Lea Schmitt ( username:_LS, [email\u00a0protected]).  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token We will start with a brief summary of New Silver, the Asset Originator, and provide information on the Tinlake Protocol, the technology that Centrifuge has built and how they interact with Maker later. The asset type we are proposing for inclusion in MCD is slightly different to the majority of collateral applications: the Asset Originators will be using MCD directly as a line of credit to originate new loans against asset-backed real estate. This means they will add large amounts of debt likely using up the assigned debt ceiling for the collateral type while paying a stability fee in return that is in par with industry standard rates. In fact, New Silver is proposing a slightly more conservative rate to ease real-estate backed loans into the system: the yield on the collateral is projected to be around 6% (our current warehouse line is 5.25%). New Silver is convinced that these rates can be securely lowered over time and DeFi will evolve into a cost effective competitor to the traditional financial system. About New Silver Founded in 2018, New Silver is a technology enabled non-bank lender primarily focused on providing real estate-backed financing for the United States \u2018fix and flip\u201d market with a concentration on single-family residential assets. New Silver\u2019s proprietary technology automates loan originations and speeds up underwriting, while using data science to reduce loan default risk. Furthermore, New Silver\u2019s FlipScout tool uses intelligence in order to help find projects with the highest ROI. These assets have the following characteristics:  Collateral: US-based residential real estate Average Loan Size: $ 176,898 Maturity: 12-24 months Historic Loan Default Rate: 0% Advance Rate: Up to 85% Interest rate charged to Borrowers: As of today, from 10.875%-13% per year Types of Advances: Fix and Flip, Refinance  The following describes an exemplary use case of a rehab loan (also referred to as a fix and flip loan). Rehab loans allow real estate investors to finance both the purchase and the construction, or in some cases, refinance an existing investment property with sufficient equity.  New Silver Flow Chart879\u00d7483 50.9 KB  Overview of Tinlake Smart Contracts Centrifuge is building a full stack of tools to bring real-world assets into DeFi:  Centrifuge provides the technology stack to tokenize real-world assets in the form of an NFT. Each NFT represents one unique real-world asset, a loan, with a unique default risk that is priced by an off-chain oracle. Tinlake is the securitization protocol that handles the bundling of these individual loans and issues an interest bearing ERC20 token against the pool to allow investors with different risk profiles to invest into the pool. For the New Silver asset pool these tokens will be called [NS-TIN] and [NS-DROP] [NS-TIN] represents the junior tranche and takes first loss. For New Silver the ratio is set at 20% to establish confidence in this asset class. For comparison, New Silver\u2019s current warehouse line with a bank merely requires 10% equity. Please find the documentation on our tranche structure here and the forum thread about how they work within MCD. We propose [NS-DROP] with a 6% stability fee for the MCD inclusion  Legal Setup Along with the necessary technical infrastructure to bring these assets into DeFi, the Asset Originator sets up a legal structure that provides the necessary support to ensure that anyone that owns a DROP token has a legal claim to the underlying assets. This is done with a legal structure very commonly used in the traditional financial system: The collateral for the individual loans are assigned to a legal entity, the \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d and investors get an ownership interest in the entire portfolio of this entity (with this entity the assets are in an a bankruptcy remote structure that is not influenced by the Asset Originators).  3. Provide a brief history of the project About New Silver Kirill and Alex, the New Silver co-founders, have known each other for many years. Over the last 20+ years, Alex has worked his way up to a CFO at a large commercial real estate operation in Connecticut. Kirill has started and exited a number of technology companies (such as Unigma by Kaseya and StratusPointIT ). Both co-founders were introduced to the \u201cfix and flip\u201d market by a mutual friend who ran a fund that invested in these projects, where Kirill and Alex joined as Limited Partners. After exploring the technology landscape of the vertical, the partners decided they can add value on three fronts - making the loan origination process faster and easier by providing instant, online loan decisioning; using data to reduce default risk; and building value-add tools to help investors be more profitable. To date, the company originated over $30mm loans and had no defaults. Prior to Covid19, the company was originating $3-5mm per month, and took a pause during the pandemic to assess market risk. Today, the management team is confident in the single family residential (SFR) market - consumer mortgage rates at all time lows, mortgage applications are near their all time highs and increasing while home mortgages in forbearance are decreasing and foreclosures for the year are lower than in the past years. While the commercial real estate market may be temporarily affected by the pandemic, the management team feels strongly that the SFR market is substantially different and will continue to have a scarcity of supply thus driving demand and price appreciation. New Silver anticipates to originate around $50M in the next 12 months. New Silver strongly believes in DeFi and its revolutionary effect on financial systems. DeFi will eventually touch every corner of the economy, and real estate backed loans will not be the exception. Single family residential assets are a strong asset class that has been performing well over the past decade, and will add value and diversification to the MCD collateral portfolio. For New Silver, MakerDAO will provide a bank-alternative financing option that we hope will expand sustainably over time. About Centrifuge Centrifuge has been working on enabling businesses to borrow money using their assets in DeFi since the project was founded in 2017. It was founded by a team of experienced entrepreneurs who at their previous company, Taulia, built supply chain finance products for over 120 of the Global 2000 companies focusing on financing assets in the global supply chain. Centrifuge has received $8.2M in VC funding from a list of experienced & reputable investors and its core mission is to change the rules of global commerce by bringing fairer financing options to business around the world. With Tinlake we are building the tools to make these assets liquid and truly DeFi native. Centrifuge shares Rune\u2019s vision that real-world assets in MCD will be the essential driver to scale adoption to the masses while diversifying risk. We are closely working with the community on how real-world assets should be integrated into MCD and how we aim at minimizing trust as we bring these assets live. Centrifuge and the Maker Foundation have collaborated on helping numerous asset originators prepare for bringing real-world assets into DeFi. Centrifuge is currently actively supporting the onboarding process of the two asset classes that have received the most votes of the Community Greenlight of the first MCD governance cycle (see CF-DROP,PC-DROP) and preparing more asset types to come - such as real estate-backed loans.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Technical documentation about Tinlake can be found here:  Github: GitHub - centrifuge/tinlake: bringing individual, non-fungible assets to DeFi  Tinlake Documentation A detailed walkthrough of the Tinlake smart contracts; Recording: here    5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Centrifuge has conducted several audits of its technology stack. The audits can be found here: security/audits at master \u00b7 centrifuge/security \u00b7 GitHub  6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.   Centrifuge Discourse Forum Participating in Maker Community Calls [1], [2] We are hosting occasional Collateral Onboarding Calls with the Maker community; the recording of previous calls can be found here: [1], [2], [3], [4]   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? Centrifuge Tinlake has been in development since early 2018 and is evolving rapidly. We currently have three active pools with three different Asset Originators and a total transaction volume of more than 1.6 million DAI. Find both active and closed pools on https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/. New Silver DROP tokens in DeFi:   Summer 2019: First test transaction. In summer 2019 New Silver funded a real-estate backed loan of 70,000 SAI to real estate developers. This was one of the first transactions we did testing Tinlake (v1). The Tinlake smart contracts have evolved and have been audited since then. Funds for this txs were provided by the Maker Foundation.   July 22nd, 2020: Tokenized Current Fund. A couple of weeks ago we tokenized a portfolio of seven 12-24 month real estate bridge loans that are extended to real estate developers. The total volume makes up 1,021,597 DAI. Find more details here.   Inclusion in MCD: In the coming weeks the 1.02M DAI fund already in existence will be opened up to external investors. Upon onboarding to MCD New Silver intends to include Maker as one of their senior investors using the NS-DROP as collateral to open a Vault on MCD.    8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? New Silver has incorporated New Silver Pilot LLC, a Delaware (USA) limited liability company (the special purpose vehicle, \u201cSPV\u201d). This SPV has been formed to finance New Silver\u2019s assets. This SPV structure creates a bankruptcy-remote entity whereby owners, debt holders or interested parties of this newly created SPV are left unaffected by the parent\u2019s financial, operational and/or legal health.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The SPV enters into a subscription agreement with investors who are receiving DROP from the SPV in turn for providing DAI. The DROP token can be redeemed against the cash flows of the underlying collateral directly from the SPV by any DROP holder. This is ensured by the Tinlake smart contracts and the primary way for interacting with these tokens.  10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We do not have any materials we can provide at this time.  11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Determining the correct price of a real-world asset behaves differently from pricing Ethereum native collateral tokens. In order to adequately price a real estate-backed loan several factors must be considered (please read our fundamentals of pricing real-world assets for additional information). Tinlake requires not just an accurate price of the overall pool but details on a loan by loan basis. As these form the basis as well for the DROP token, we will start outlining the pricing for those first: In approving clients and determining a risk score, New Silver utilizes a strict process and prudent thresholds with respect to:   FICO score of the borrower   Borrower experience   Borrower liquidity   Appraised property value   Automated Property Valuation   Average days on market in Zip Code   Standard deviation from median sales price in zip code   FHFA HPI Maximum Yearly Decrease 2006-2018 in County and State vs National   ZHVI (Zillow Home Value Index)   Median sale price for zip code to ARV %   Monthly sales count by zip code   Census data - average household income, town population   The risk score calculated from these inputs is used to determine approval, advance and interest rates. The Tinlake contracts then use these per NFT values to control how much money borrowers can withdraw. To determine the value of the entire portfolio (simplified the sum of the market value of all loan NFTs) is usually by doing a net-asset-value (NAV) calculation across the portfolio. Centrifuge is implementing the NAV model in smart contracts that can calculate this information based on individual pricing information in real time based on the NFT price information.  13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. The way this collateral type is used varies from how standard vaults are opened: DROP tokens have a stable USD price and any small fluctuations in the loan portfolio performance should be covered by the insurance provided by the TIN tranche. This means that under normal operation, the Asset Originator would not see their Vault get liquidated. A liquidation would only occur if a large amount of defaults occur across the portfolio that the risk model did not calculate. In case the Vault gets liquidated, the Tinlake contracts enforce a rebalancing of the pool to bring it back to its required collateralization ratio and will not allow issuing any new loans. Instead the Tinlake contracts are from this point on taking all of the cash flows generated by the borrowers and disbursing these to DROP token holders. New Silver provides financing for real-estate bridge loans with an average 12-24 months terms. So far New Silver did not have distressed loans in their portfolio. If required, however, the following companies have a longstanding history of buying distressed loans to name but a few: Fortress, Apollo, Ares ",

Yes, you are right, as a keeper bidding on these assets if you don\u2019t have the ability to get a legal recourse over these assets would not be a good idea. This does exclude some keepers but there are definitely keepers that are willing to do so. Keepers today are also KYCing with centralized exchanges to get liquidity today.     monteluna:  Can MakerDAO see these tranches? After 2008 I think this could very easily slip into something extremely odd with tranche debt packages that seriously have no way to accurately value the underlying loans?   Yes, Tinlake\u2019s tranches are transparent and visible to anyone on chain. Their existing portfolio of DAI 1.02M in loans is here: https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/0xeb33ab19d17d62950b16e843005fcdda62d5f551/assets The information presented here is very minimal but more details can (and will be) made available both by the asset originator and by third party oracles. One key difference between 2008 and what we are doing with Tinlake is the transparency. In 2008 mortgage backed securities were often layered many times and completely intransparent. The ratings agencies that gave these assets a classification had every incentive to give them a rating without anything at stake if they mispriced them. The difference here is that New Silver will take part of the junior tranche, having the most direct exposure to the portfolio taking any first losses. ",

                    "content": "    prankstr25:  mortgage applications are near their all time highs and increasing while home mortgages in forbearance are decreasing and foreclosures for the year are lower than in the past years. While the commercial real estate market may be temporarily affected by the pandemic, the management team feels strongly that the SFR market is substantially different and will continue to have a scarcity of supply thus driving demand and price appreciation. New Silver anticipates to originate around $50M in the next 12 months.   I have a number of friends in the SFR market.  A few are smaller players but we have connections to some very large players that are in both the SFR market and Commercial markets (apartments as well as businesses).    General discussion both with these players and various realitors they have been dealing with are as follows:   WHile forbearance has decreased, expect it to increase substantially over the next year to two as covid plays out and the free money to folks unemployed runs out.   There is a substantial legal lag for a good number of reasons that has not come forward yet and is expected to build dramatically.   This has not shown up in actual numbers but is starting to show up in some of these players cash flow bottom lines whether eviction processes are stalled and tenants simply are not paying.   Interest rates are expected to pretty much stay at all time lows and this probably will keep prices stable or edge higher I don\u2019t think I saw a loan to property value rate profile?    You are advancing up to 85% but what is the size of these loans relative to the property backing value.   Is the pool going to be a single pool of all the assets or just pieces?    What I am concerned about is location risk here.   Are the properties expected to have broad geographic components in this(these) pool(s) or are they going to have geographic risk?   How does the various intermediaries make money, and what does their risk profiles look like here.   I have been looking at a few of these tokenized realestate vehicles and I have not seen risk/backing profiles that are well balanced with firms doing them against the investors taking on the risk.   How much stake does New Silver have in any of this that they stand to lose as a % against what they are expecting investors to pick up?   Is there any component of your business that is highly dependent on bank rates?   What is the total number of loans made so far?   How many have fully matured?   How many are still maturing?   What is your effective capital usage % against current fees as a % of total loans   Exactly how does New Silver manage borrowers so that bad borrowers never get back into the system?   How are valuations set and then checked on the properties so that loans are sufficiently over collateralized.   Would New Silver engage or not in running a keeper on these assets?   Why or Why not?   What is the typical minimum value of these assets.   We have seen some indications in liquidations if the vault value is too high that the bids for liquidations are poor at best?   What about liquidation fees of 13%?   Typically this means a LR of at least 120% to be able to have any hope of any collateral coming back to a vault.   Even at a LR of 150% often times in distressed markets vaults will not return collateral.   Is there a suggested LR that works for these assets or are there any concerns if the LR or LF is too high this doesn\u2019t work?   In general I like this application for real estate a bit more than doing something on invoices. I think the whole issue here is going to center on NFT valuations, pricing oracles, and in the end keepers with sufficient capital to actually take on the liquidation risk/cost/legal hassles.  I am also a bit weary about how young this company is and what these markets are going to be doing over the next 12-24 months generally.   I also am hoping there isn\u2019t geographic risk in these pools but will wait for an answer on these questions.    Given the size of the players in this arena my friends and I have had the pleasure to sit with it will be interesting to take what you guys are doing and see how they react. So here is a general question.   Is there any kind of good explanation document I could print and hand off to a guy who has like $10M and as much as 1B in real estate assets to give them a good heads up as to what you guys are doing.  If so please post a link, please and thank you. ",

                    "content": "Hi All, Thanks for submitting this collateral onboarding application. Before I get into my questions, I\u2019ll take the time to point others to my prior write-ups on questions about Centrifuge and their Tinlake model. You can read those chains regarding Consulfreight and Paperchain. @Planet_X also touched on a core issue for Centrifuge above, namely liquidations (I would add Emergency Shutdown, too, as an open question because it seems that it was never experimented with during the Pilots that Centrifuge writes about frequently). Regardless, I want to focus on New Silver and including these real estate-linked assets in the Maker Protocol. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity, for sure, if done correctly and in compliance with the applicable regulations. FWIW, I am not a real estate investment expert, so please excuse my ignorance if I am asking a \u201cstupid\u201d question or two. That said, could the New Silver team respond to a few items that popped up while I did due diligence on this application and its backers:   As stated on its website, New Silver is a \u201chard money\u201d direct lender. My assumption was that most hard money lenders operating in the US were required to hold state lending licenses. (Here\u2019s this article for high-level background).   I went through the applicable real estate licensing websites for some of the states mentioned on NS\u2019s home page (Montana, Iowa and Florida), and I couldn\u2019t find information for \u201cNew Silver.\u201d Can you please let us know if New Silver carries any licenses in the thirty-nine (39) states where it operates? Admittedly, I probably don\u2019t know the name of the correct entity, but if you can give some color to clear this up that would be great.   If New Silver doesn\u2019t carry licensure in any of those states, can you please explain why? I understand that there might be a reason why the lending you do does not require a license. Still, in my opinion, the DAO should be aware of that while it reviews the collateral.   Also, if New Silver or an affiliated entity has lending licenses, can you please provide the license and registration numbers state-by-state? I\u2019m sure some DAO members and MKR holders, aside from me, would also like to verify.   Lastly, I did some searching on Google and came across information on a recent venture by New Silver\u2019s founders (led by Kirill Bensonoff), Caviar. It appears that the Massachusetts Securities Division brought an enforcement action against Caviar (here\u2019s the administrative complaint) and its founders in January 2018 for an ICO/unregistered securities offering. Here\u2019s another story and another I found regarding the matter for any DAO members who are interested.   Can New Silver (or Mr. Bensonoff) provide some insights on what came of the Massachusetts Securities Division lawsuit and whether (and how) it was resolved? Also, can you please confirm if the lawsuit is still ongoing?   I believe it\u2019s important to look into Caviar for several reasons. First, the Caviar enforcement action runs quite close to the founding of New Silver (the state filed its complaint in January 2018, and New Silver was founded \u201cin 2018\u201d). Second, it seems that there is overlap in the corporate ownership of both Caviar and New Silver (Mr. Bensonoff was the CEO of Caviar and is the managing partner of New Silver).   What\u2019s more, I am worried that negative consequences from the litigation for Caviar may color the operations of New Silver. And an enforcement against Caviar could complicate the ability of New Silver\u2019s leadership team to provide collateral for the Maker Protocol.   Evaluating projects and their prospective collateral requires us to look at tokens, their development and economic modeling and the backgrounds of the project teams. On that note, though I think New Silver\u2019s application is interesting, the DAO should address these questions as part of the green lighting process. ",

In terms of licensing, the resource you pointed to is not correct (it also appears they are in the business of helping companies secure licensing). We provide business purpose (non-consumer) loans secured by real estate, and licensing is not required in 40 of the 50 states. We do not operate in states where licensing is required, and the states listed on the Locations page are states where we operate. This information was confirmed to us by our law firm Geraci, which focuses on law for our industry. Happy to expand with more specifics on this if necessary. On your questions around Caviar, this was a company I was involved in in 2017-18. Caviar and New Silver are totally different entities and have no business overlap. Caviar performed a compliant fund-raise outside of the United States, reliant upon Reg S exemption from registration. However, the Massachusetts Securities Division, headed by Secretary of State Bill Galvin (who was up for re-election in 2018 and facing a tough opponent), used the ongoing hype around cryptocurrencies as a PR platform to get media exposure to help his campaign. He announced that he did not like Bitcoin because it \u201cdid not pass his smell test\u201d and waged an aggressive campaign against blockchain startups. Unfortunately, we were one of those startups and were caught in the cross-hairs. The only allegation the state made was that we had conducted our \u201coffering\u201d improperly and targeted MA residents by advertising to them on social media. Their only evidence to this was that their investigator saw one of our ads, and this happened because they were \u201cre-targeted\u201d by Google (the investigator first went to our website and then saw our ad by being re-targeted). Our marketing company, while excluding US and some other countries from our ads, did not turn off re-targeting US users. After the re-election of Galvin and the Bitcoin crash of 2018, the state lost interest and went dark on us. We did no want to litigate and waste time and money, and decided to settle in February of 2019, paid a fine and agreed to refund any investor from the state of MA (of which there were not any). As a result, we also decided to close Caviar and provided refunds to all investors. This was from a time long ago and has no bearing on our activities today and in the future.

                    "content": "Thanks for your question, I put together a reply to each of the parts below.   This is a very good question and is certainly at the forefront of our thinking, which I can share here. We believe that in the medium to long term, the fundamentals of the SFR asset class are strong \u2013 US is still a top economy, creating innovation and attracting skilled workers, who at some point start a family and want the American dream of homeownership (or an SFR rental in the suburbs). In the shorter term, things are a bit more uncertain. We have not seen any pressure to the downside yet, actually, we have seen price appreciation due to low inventory. We are guided by data, and one of the better recent data analysis was done by Zillow in this publication. Zillow economists predict a 2-3% price decline. We have analyzed other data and we are guided by a potential price decline of 0-5%. Most of our loans are 12 months, and the exit strategy for borrowers is a consumer sale, and this should be robust while mortgage rates are so low (we put our long term product Rent on hold for now). So given the short term loan duration, when we are underwriting loans, we look at areas where the highest price drops occurred in the last recession, and often times will reduce the loan leverage or the collateral value by up to 5% to compensate for the potential price decrease.   If  I understand your question correctly, you are asking about loan to value? We go up to 85% Loan To Value, and we only advance the money for purchase upfront. The borrower then needs to begin construction using their own funds, and after construction is partially complete, we send an inspector who reviews and puts a value on the amount of work completed, and we reimburse the owner for that partial work according to the terms of their loan.   It will be a pool of loans from different geographies   There will be 2 tranches, senior (represented by the DROP token) and junior (represented by the TIN token). We propose MakerDAO to participate in the senior tranche (NS-DROP), and New Silver and other investors will have direct stake in the pool by participating in the junior tranche, which takes first loss.   No, though we may use a bank credit facility in conjunction with other credit. Bank facility costs are very low right now, and we don\u2019t anticipate them increasing by much any time soon.   We originated 123 loans   39 have been paid off   84 are still outstanding   I would like to provide clarity on this but don\u2019t understand what you are asking. Can you give more context?   Our system tracks all applications, if a person applies again, we will know they were denied previously and review why. There might be times when they were denied because of poor credit, and it has improved, so we may consider them again.   The collateral is valued with at least 2 independent data points \u2013 the first being an AVM (Automated Valuation Model) which we source from a partner (Clear Capital), the second being an on-site appraisal performed by an independent appraiser. If there is a large price discrepancy, we use other sources to either review the appraisal (desktop review) or use a third valuation source to confirm value.   We are open to discussing a \u201cbring your own keeper\u201d scenario, but we are also connected with multiple third parties who buy distressed loans, so we can facilitate a process with them.   The average loan amount has been $177,000   We anticipate that the liquidation fee can be lower than 13% as the assets are much more stable compared to current crypt-collateral - but of course the risk team and the MakerDAO governance should be involved in this process to determine the precise parameters.

As a consultant with a Big 4 accounting firm, I assisted top 10 banks in the late 00s value/bid on major, headline worthy acquisitions.  Besides pricing individual resi loans, I structured and traded whole loan pools, and structured and traded MBS.  Some of the remarks about the motivations of the rating agencies and rationale for the 2008 collapse belie the fact that risk was mis-priced.  Whose fault that was is for history to decide. Full disclosure, I love what the Centrifuge team is putting together and kudos to Maker Foundation for encouraging this great fintech laboratory. In theory, there\u2019s no reason why the proposed structure cannot work.  On the pricing side, the unsophisticated DeFI community would likely mis-price risk, unless they treated all of these as unsecured investments. At that point, New Silver should always get better priced financing from a traditional lender who understands the nuances of real estate loans. Alternatively, if the DeFI community under-priced the risk to see some action, then there is reputation risk when all the losses get driven right to their wallets. Perhaps allowing only qualified lenders to trade these tokens or ask Centrifuge to setup an unsecured tranche for folks to fund would be a good start. On the recourse side, it would be nice to see an example where a court, anywhere, enforced recourse based on token ownership. I imagine the first time will be drawn out and expensive, but someone will have to pick that fight eventually so that precedent can be established. All in all, a great idea and something that I think is a forgone conclusion in the space. ",

On the pricing side, I believe the DeFi community has become fairly sophisticated, and in addition, the risk team would be heavily involved. Also, the plan is to have a junior tranche in a first loss position. The loan leverage is consistent with market conditions and takes into account various factors on the borrower and the collateral with the effort to reduce risk. We believe the risk to the network should be very small. On the recourse, just to be clear, in addition to tokens, there is a legal agreement that gets signed, so any court enforcement should be fairly standard. ",

Pricing wise, with any mature asset class you have scores of folks that work at institutions whose job it is to optimize returns. That means understanding not only the collateral, the borrower, and the market, but also understand the interplay between all the parties to game the system as much as possible. If you work as an asset aggregate and you are searching for a source of funds you are going to do everything possible to borrow short safe and lend long risky.  Depending on the asset class and level of risk, pricing as far off as 50 basis points would cause folks to drive a train through it. We would love to help if you could think of where the greatest need is. ",

This topic is still some time off before we in the community will have to deal with it but it is on the radar so to speak. There is also the issue of the community work situation. Right now we have two handfuls of crypto collateral with parameters set rather roughly. For crypto that is OK and as far as I know we have received few complaints. That will however change when we start onboarding fiat collateral where every 0.25% matters. Collateral type A pays a 4.25% stability fee while Collateral type B must pay 4.5%?! Expect the team behind Collateral type B to complain often and loudly. Multiply that by half the number of onboarded teams and you get a lot of noise, not optimal for a group of people who work largely for free. There is also a bandwidth problem with how many collateral types the community is capable of onboarding per month while maintaining a sufficient level of quality. Pricing off by 50 basis points? That is going to happen at times, the question is what steps we can take to identify and change these situations quickly when they happen. ",

On the licensing issues, do you all need licensed real estate agents to effectuate the lending? Does your team have individuals/teams brokering and lending in the different states where NS operates? If your organization employs or works with licensed individuals, can you please provide their names and licensing information? On your time with Caviar, your team (which, if the internet is correct, involved you and your current partner in New Silver, Mr. Shvayetsky), settled with the MSD. Was that settlement public? I was unable to find it online. Before the DAO considers onboarding New Silver\u2019s assets, we should also understand, in my opinion, if the Massachusetts Securities Division placed any restrictions on you or Mr. Shvayetsky with regard to raising capital from the sale of securities. Can you please confirm that the MSD imposed no such restrictions? However, if the MSD did impose restrictions, can you provide more information? And again, I want to thank you for your time and answering everyone\u2019s questions diligently. For sure, those efforts should not be overlooked. As a high point, it\u2019s really great that founders and team members make the effort to get in the forums and go over these matters with the DAO. I won\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I certainly appreciate (and even enjoy!) the back and forth of reviewing the onboarding applications. ",

Intro: I am a creditor rights\u2019 and real estate litigation attorney in Nebraska and Iowa, for over 20 years.  I own MKR although it\u2019s not locked into the governance contract; I note that so it is understood underlying what I am about to say I have a vested interest in seeing the MKR/DAI lending system work, and part of that should involve RWA collateral lending. Kirill I would like you to respond to the following concern given what you said about there being no need for licensing.  There are people and companies in your industry that specifically do only commercial lending and expressly state they are not a financial institution so as to avoid federal regulation like RESPA.  They then do lending in states that as you say do not require licensing.  But they then wrongfully conflate not having to be licensed with not being subject to state lending law.  The moment a lender avoids being subject to federal lending law, it loses the benefit banks have of not being subject to state lending law.  I presently am in litigation with one of your competitors who made a loan to upgrade an apartment complex in Omaha, and they proceeded with interest rates not in accordance with Nebraska law, accepted payments without applying to the principal and interest balance contrary to Nebraska law, and billed the borrower for its attorney\u2019s fees also contrary to Nebraska law.  They believed they could do all this because Nebraska did not have licensing requirements for commercial lending - which all that means is anyone can do commercial lending without advance permission from the State.  There are still rules. These loans you are making would be subject to state law.  Analyzing for a just a few minutes as to Nebraska, the 13% liquidation fee likely violates Nebraska law because our nonjudicial foreclosure process permits only certain limited fees incurred to sell - publication and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and recording fees - to be added onto the borrower\u2019s balance.  If you are unlucky enough to have not done the paperwork correctly to qualify to do a nonjudicial foreclosure, the judicial foreclosure process can take 18 months or more and you do not recover attorney\u2019s fees.  Nebraska law forbids an interest rate of greater than 16% to an individual for any purpose and fees charged up front (stabilization fees perhaps?) and compounding are factored in to determine if more than 16% is actually being charged.  The latter usury issue can be solved by always lending to a corporate entity and never an individual - a Nebraska lawyer that works in this field knows that but would the DeFi community?  I think not, and rather that they would be relying on you to make sure that each loan made fully complies with the applicable state law. So my questions are is there an understanding that your loans need to comply with applicable state lending law, and what efforts are you making to make sure of that - e.g., retention of local attorneys to advise on loan structures and draft loans?

But I get your point about being subject to state law. We are well aware of usury limits and our loans are well under those. We use a 3rd party servicer (FCI) which is licensed as a loan servicer in all of the states and they are responsible for making sure payments are processed correctly and servicing is done according to law. We utilize two different law firms for closings and doc prep, who in turn have local partners, whether a law firm or a settlement agent of the title company, to review docs and close. We only lend to other corporate entities, for business purpose only. I believe the chances of wrongdoing on our part are very small, though one can never be 100% protected against a litigious borrower.

                    "content": "On urging of @PaperImperium and some previous discussion with others and reviewing the above post by @Howard_Krieger I want to reiterate a basic question because I have seen this come up in reference to whether a Token is classified as a security or not.   Exactly who is the legal party that has the property lien that can take legal action if a loan goes into default? Maker by design basically can\u2019t sign legal documents and so to be able to give loans on property has to have a bound counter party under contract to perform this \u2018service\u2019.   In the 6s structure the escrow agent basically has this legal component.    The escrow agent can\u2019t be the broker or even an affiliated company due to conflict of interest.  It has to be a registered and well known 3rd party agent. Who is this agent that is independent of New Silver that acts on behalf of Token holders to steward over the property escrow (and liquidation if necessary) managing this so that proceeds return to Maker properly? My problem here is a statement by @Howard_Krieger     Howard_Krieger:  On the recourse side, it would be nice to see an example where a court, anywhere, enforced recourse based on token ownership.   There is no such example AFAIK because Tokens are not registered securities.   This is why 6s Capital went through such great pains to find and secure agreement of a well known escrow agent (Wilmington) that could manage the liquidation of the collateral if terms and conditions of the loan are not met.  In effect Wilmington acts as the legal representative managing the interests of Maker so there is little to no question of how recourse is actioned. What I don\u2019t see is a proper recourse model for Maker here with the TinLake Tokenized assets.   As the @omahalawyer points out there are deeper legal issues here that could easily crop up on these assets should they come under litigation in various states that would require significant legal research to understand much less deal with in a foreclosure process. Can the team @prankstr25 point me to documentation regarding what legal entity holds the rights to the property that would be foreclosed/liquidated and what their legal obligation is to Token holders to compensate them?    My problem here is that each property is its own NFT which basically means that Token Holders could be holding a very empty bag if a particular loan is liquidated or worse needs to be litigated over even if law sides with Token holders having securities rights.

Yeah was just thinking about this.   As RegD offerings they have a number of exemptions that basically leave the investor holding a bag.   This is why filers usually go for RegD as they are much higher risk which limits who they can get financing from.     Tosh9.0:  And doesn\u2019t this concern bleed through all the Centrifuge-connected collateral types \u2013 NS, Paperchain, the People\u2019s Company and something called \u201cPanda Drop\u201d?   Yep it does, but only if the collateral custody chain lands at New Silver vs. a truly independent auditable and licensed escrow entity that under contractual and licensing obligations is answerable to the RegD security holders (RegD holders who btw have to be entites within jurisdictions that can be represented legally.)  6s solves this for us by using the escrow agent who acts under a Maker Rep/team advisement (this part of the legal structure to connect Maker DAO rep to legal represenative agent in a jurisdiction is what is hard imo). I had less concern over these if the DCs were small and we could absorb the loss.  I spent a lot of time understanding the 6s structure which looked far cleaner in this respect than the very complicated Tin Lake and other Tokenized RWA instruments. I know 6s (calling @mrabino1 just to be aware of the discussion) went through a lot of complicated effort to set up a clean legal structure in this regard that looked reasonable on my cursory review of his legal documents and structures.    New Silver just didn\u2019t look as clean to me in this regard. This reminds me of the issues with bundled RE tranches that were rebundled over and over again and courts trying to figure out who actually had the legal rights to the underlying collateral.  It was so bad that a significant number of breaks in collateral custody chains occurred severing the right to foreclose on borrowers effectively freeing them from debt obligations (creditors held bags).  It was a nasty mess both financially and in litigation (because each chain had another State jurisdiction to go through in litigation where the custody chain could sever).   I don\u2019t think these Tokenized assets are as complex but as these things go through intermediaries the same chain of collateral rights has to follow legally otherwise it can and will be severed in courts leaving creditors with no collateral to liquidate to recover debt.   Maker as a non-legal entity only has rights to anything via intermediaries and contract obligations.   The same is true of RegD Token holders and even then it will likely come after litigation not contract execution. ",
