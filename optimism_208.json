It is worth mentioning that through the double mining activities, iZUMI Finance brought 80% of the USDC/USDT pool on Uniswap V3@Polygon, and LiquidBox on Arbitrum hit $16M TVL in 24 hours. Optimism alignment iZUMi Finance is a multi-chain DeFi protocol providing One-Stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), with innovatively designed liquidity mining modules of the \u201cConcentrated liquidity mining\u201d model for stable assets with a fixed price and \u201cDynamic Range\u201d model for non-stable tokens. These structured models would support any blockchain project to better implement liquidity incentives with much higher capital efficiency and enable liquidity providers to earn extra rewards. Optimism effectively reduces costs and increases accessibility as one of the largest Layer 2 protocols. It brings convenience to users, and this concept is well integrated with iZUMi Finance. We want to integrate Layer 2 and at the same time, we can help optimistic accumulate more TVL by using double rewards liquidity mining campaigns. As the largest liquidity mining platform in the Uniswap V3 ecosystem, iZUMi Finance already accounts for up to 80% of the USDC/USDT pool on Uniswap V3@Polygon. LiquidBox on Arbitrum hits $16M TVL in 24 hours. Therefore Optimism can also leverage its partnership with the iZUMi Finance platform to open trading pairs like ETH-USDC, and USDT-related stable trading pairs on Uniswap V3@Optimism. We can build a faithful community to sustainably boost Optimism and run with a good level of liquidity in the future. ##Proposal for token distribution How will the OP tokens be distributed? Liquidbox of iZUMi Finance will distribute OP tokens to liquidity providers to incentivize liquidity and usage of Optimism How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? OP tokens will be 100% allocated to liquidity providers as mining incentives to help boost APR and abstract TVL. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Due to the feature of the high capital efficiency of UniswapV3, liquidity providers can still obtain more commission income even without incentives compared to the V2 model. In addition to that, Izumi Finance has experienced no security issues. Several institutions also audit it. Users can still retain the money without security issues. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? iZUMi Finance will seek to incentivize growth on Optimism sustainably. The double rewards incentive mining campaign is expected to run for eight to twelve months. The exact period of distribution will depend on when the proposal gets passed. How much will your project match in co-incentives? iZUMi Finance is targeting to migrate 20 million TVL to Optimism in order to expand the ecosystem. Besides, iZUMi Finance will provide iZi as incentives to help OP boost APR. In this case, the pool becomes more attractive for the liquidity provider. iZUMi Finance Docs: https://docs.izumi.finance/ ",

Firstly, the time of liquidity mining campaign conducted on Polygon and Arbitrum is too short to maintain the LPs. Therefore, we have adjusted the duration to 8 - 12 months for Optimism for this time. In this case, we can bring more lasting TVL to Optimism. Secondly, pools on Polygon and Arbitrum are dominated by stablecoins which have low yield. The proposal will also adjust it on Optimism. ",
