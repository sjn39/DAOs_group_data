Is there anything we can do ? What are your thoughts about it? I view it as very dangerous and here is my reasoning behind it:   It will allow to short MKR for another collateral and by that manipulate it\u2019s price and by that may lower a total cost of attack on the MakerDAO system   It will allow to vote for someone who did not own MKR just borow some.   Imagine scenario. Someone lock in compound lot\u2019s of USD Coin, Borrow lots of MKR, sell half, causes panick on market, to add on that votes in some irresponsible way to cause eeven more panick. Buys MKR back at lower price (at the bottom of panic) and profit ",

We had a chance to contemplate it early as we asked ourselves the same questions regarding allowing other project\u2019s governance tokens into our system and what affect that would have on their ecosystems.     Adam_Skrodzki:  Is it something we should be worried about?   I don\u2019t think worried. We need to watch it closely and continue to think about potential mitigation and look for evidence of tampering with the governance process.     Adam_Skrodzki:  Is there anything we can do ?   If you mean to stop them, no. This whole crypto thing is predicated on assuming that the ecosystem is hostile and mechanisms need to be robust or they need to be improved.     Adam_Skrodzki:  It will allow to vote for someone who did not own MKR just borow some.   The rules are that one MKR equals one vote, there are currently no expectations that people have to be long term holders. I imagine there will be a lot of discussions around \u2018proof of commitment\u2019 soon. There is also no reason to assume that benevolent actors won\u2019t borrow MKR to vote as well. ",

It\u2019s not about short versus long holding. Borrowing instead to owning changes incentives dramatically. Now person being in control (not owning) of some MKR can actually profit from harming MKR, Rational best interest of MKR borrower might be opposite to best interets of MakerDAO. If Maker owner (longtime or short time does not matter) wants to harm MakerDAO he will need to accept some loss to do so. Maker borrower can harm system and profit from that harm. ",

Maybe if voting were compensated with a portion of the stability fee I.e. MKR that would not be burned.

So if you want to sell MKR you have to wait three months without voting before your MKR is released from lock up.
