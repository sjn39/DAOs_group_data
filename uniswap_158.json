            "body": "Authors: [Noodles](https://twitter.com/crypto_noodles) + [Crema](https://twitter.com/0xCrema) + [Vertex](https://twitter.com/0xVertex) \n\nRelated Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)\n\n### What is Rage Trade?\n\n[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.\n\n### Why do we need an additional use grant?\n\nOur proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3\u2019s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap\u2019s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. \n\n### What changes have we made that require additional use?\n\nWe have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap\u2019s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):\n\n- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap\u2019s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.\n- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.\n- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.\n- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.\n\n\n ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?\n\n1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.\n\n2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve\u2019s tricrypto.\n\n3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nRage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap\u2019s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.\n",

            "body": "Dear Uniswap Community,\n\nA few weeks ago, Voltz submitted a proposal to request for an \u201cAdditional Use Grant\u201d from the Uniswap Community.

                    "content": "TL;DR Voltz is a new defi primitive that brings interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. This is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the use of concentrated liquidity pioneered in Uniswap v3 (ref). However, since v3 is subject to a Business Source License, Voltz needs an Additional Use Grant to allow us to use aspects of the v3 code base within the Voltz AMM (ref). We recognise the significant R&D that went into v3. As a result, we would like to offer the Uniswap Treasury 1% of Voltz\u2019s future token supply. Beyond the financial benefit for Uniswap token holders, if approved, this will also represent a first for DeFi and set precedent for future Additional Use Grant requests. In addition, we also believe there are a number non-financial benefits to Uniswap, including: 1. Interest Rate Swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems. By supporting Voltz, Uniswap is helping create a fundamental DeFi primitive, which will ultimately help fuel the growth of the entire sector. This will benefit everyone wanting decentralised finance to become the future financial system for billions of people around the world. 2. Uniswap continues to be seen as the grandfather of DeFi. By allowing a non-competing and innovative protocol to leverage the Uni v3 codebase, not only will it help the whole sector grow, it will also further strengthen Uniswap\u2019s reputation as one of the core enablers of the decentralised finance movement. 3. Voltz will help amplify the ecosystem\u2019s understanding of how concentrated liquidity provisioning works. Having a non-competing AMM leveraging Uni v3 code helps to further educate the market on how to LP via Uni v3. This should have a second-order impact on liquidity that ends up deployed on Uni v3 directly. As a result, we humbly request Uniswap\u2019s community to consider this proposal in depth. We look forward to having a fruitful conversation with the Uniswap community and look forward to answering your comments and questions. About Voltz Voltz is a noncustodial automated market maker for Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). The protocol uses a concentrated liquidity virtual AMM (vAMM) for price discovery only, with the management of the underlying assets performed by the Margin Engine. The combined impact of these modules means counterparties can create and trade fixed and variable rates through a mechanism that is up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative interest rate swap models. Critically, Voltz has figured out how to trade fixed and variable rate exposures through a two-axis AMM, leveraging the concept of concentrated liquidity pioneered in Uniswap v3. Whilst Voltz uses some of the v3 code base, there are a large number of additional complex innovations that had to be unlocked in order to create an Interest Rates Swap specific AMM. These innovations have a number of important consequences when considering the merit of providing Voltz with an Additional Use Grant: 1. Voltz and Uniswap are complementary not competitive Interest Rate Swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems. By bringing Interest Rate Swaps to DeFi, Voltz should help accelerate DeFi\u2019s displacement of traditional finance. In turn, this will help boost the growth of the sector, whilst also unlocking a new wave of financial primitives, structured products and trading strategies for the whole ecosystem. Uniswap is not an Interest Rate Swap AMM. As a result, Voltz and Uniswap don\u2019t compete. Instead they can be complementary to each other - where one grows, the ecosystem grows, which in turn helps the other grow too. By providing Voltz with an Additional Use Grant, Uniswap can help accelerate the growth of a fundamental primitive that\u2019s needed within DeFi. 2. Voltz cannot route trades via Uni v3, instead the code is native to Voltz AMM There are numerous additional innovations required to create an Interest Rate Swap specific AMM. Whilst parts of the v3 code base are required to create the concentrated liquidity logic, trades can\u2019t simply be routed via Uni v3 since the v3 AMM is not designed for Interest Rate Swaps. Instead the concentrated liquidity logic is native to the Voltz AMM, meaning an Additional Use Grant is required. It\u2019s possible for the Voltz Labs team to implement concentrated liquidity logic in a way that doesn\u2019t utilise some of the Uniswap v3 code base. However, the v3 code is battle-tested and already optimised to enable concentrated liquidity to exist in the most efficient way. As a result, the cleanest and most logical option is to request an Additional Use Grant. 3. Uniswap cannot adjust their AMM to create an IRS market Following the above - the creation of an Interest Rate Swap specific AMM requires a significant amount of new code and innovation. As a result, we think it\u2019s highly unlikely Uniswap can simply adjust the v3 code base to enter the interest rate swap market - meaning Voltz and Uniswap will remain complementary rather than ever becoming competitors. Alongside this, Voltz is also highly aligned with the values of Uniswap, decentralised finance and the broad web3 ecosystem more generally. Voltz Protocol will be managed by the VoltzDAO. This will enable Voltz to effectively become a public good that is owned and managed by the community that uses it. In turn this will continue to support the wider movement of DeFi to build a more transparent, more equitable and more efficient financial system. Our Proposal We recognise the significant R&D that went into developing the concentrated liquidity logic used within Uniswap v3. Therefore, we would like to offer the Uniswap Treasury 1% of Voltz\u2019s future token supply for the Additional Use Grant. Voltz Tokens will be provided to Uniswap Treasury following the Voltz Token Generation Event. Beyond the financial benefit to Uniswap token holders, this will also represent a first for DeFi and set a precedent for future Additional Use Grant requests. In addition, we also believe there are a number non-financial benefits to Uniswap, including those outlined in the TL;DR. Conclusion We\u2019d like Uniswap\u2019s community to consider this proposal in depth. Not just based on the merits of the proposal itself, but also on the precedent this sets as an industry first for DeFi. We look forward to having a fruitful conversation with the Uniswap community and look forward to answering your comments and questions. Note: we wanted to share this proposal with the community for digestion and feedback. If feedback is directionally positive, we\u2019ll initiate the Temperature Check on Snapshot in the new year. ",

We have done the majority of the dev work on Enzyme Finance, where among other things we have built integrations that allow Enzyme vault managers to trade and provide liquidity on both v2 and v3 of Uniswap. We are generally supportive of this proposal and the precedent it sets. The Business Source License was implemented in Uniswap v3 to protect the Core codebase and allow for the Uniswap community to build an ecosystem around it (according to the blog post anyway, we weren\u2019t in the strategy conversations) without having to fend off another vampire attack. Importantly, the post goes on to mention that \u201cUniswap governance can \u2026 grant exemptions to the license at any time\u2026\u201d. In our opinion, we should not interpret the protection this license confers not as \u201cno one can build on the core codebase except Uniswap Labs\u201d but rather \u201cno one can build on the Core codebase except members of the Uniswap community as decided by Uniswap governance\u201d. Granting the Uniswap treasury a meaningful portion of the Voltz token supply provides at the very least an economic alignment of the two protocols that we think is a meaningful signal that Voltz fits the bill as a community member. And given that  Voltz Protocol will be managed by the VoltzDAO  the grant presumably enables Uniswap to have a say in how Voltz grows. That said, we\u2019d be interested to know what governance mechanisms you\u2019ll be using @simonj? ",

If I hypothetically value Voltz in the future at 1 billion dollars market capital, then the license fee for V3 license and additional value to the Uniswap Treasury is around 10 million dollars. This 10 million as a fee seems pretty good to me as it equates to a 3 cent EPT (earning per token, 290k holders~ /10million) for very low engagement other than the initial vote. However, the 1% stake in Voltz might not be enough at stake for UNI governance to actively engage participants around Voltz DAO proposals in the future. This is a bigger unknown with DAO voting on other DAO\u2019s and how to incentives participation. The 1% is good for just  the narrow scope of the V3 Additional Use Grant, with future incentive for UNI treasury/ or UNI holder\u2019s to engage in active participation in the Voltz Governance. Also, Thank you for answering my questions on the Additional Use Grant. I am not familar with how it is suppose to be used. Your research look like it is the right interpretation. ",

This is the reputational risk the community is undertaking. That\u2019s why I think 1% is immaterial for the community to take this risk. If the project is valued between 100mm-1bn, the marginal value to the uniswap treasury is only 1-10mm, but if a reputational damaging event happened, a 10-20% sell off can cause a few bn market cap loss for Uniswap.

That said, it\u2019s not clear to me how a (hypothetical) hack of Voltz would cause rational actors to sell off 10-20% of Uni without first checking the underlying cause of the exploit. In addition, if a hack were to occur then the likelihood of it being caused by Uni\u2019s codebase (before digging into the details) is only around 5% given that only c.5% of our code is like-for-like from v3, with another c.15% refactored to make it work for interest rate swaps / our model. So it feels like the downside risk to Uniswap is extremely low. But when looking at the upside, it\u2019s worth adding that derivative trading volumes tend to be orders of magnitude higher than spot volumes. So if Voltz has the potential to be worth 1bn, then arguably we\u2019d have found product-market-fit and have the potential to be worth $20-100bn, meaning the \u201copportunity\u201d is heavily skewed to the upside for the Uni community. That\u2019s before accounting for all the additional second-order benefits of helping the whole ecosystem grow and what that means to Uniswap over the long-term. ",

It\u2019s within the scope of governance to determine exemptions to the V3 code license. We have one request for Voltz team. Prior to the temperature check, it would be great if you can host a voice call on the Uniswap Discord bi-weekly community call to discuss the proposal and answer any community questions that come up. Let\u2019s connect you with Boris so we get that put together. One question that was asked on this thread we\u2019d like to follow up on is what governance model you are intending to use with Voltz. Do you have any intentions for Uniswap\u2019s future DAO2DAO relationship and role in Voltz governance? On that topic, we have one suggestion to offer, drawing from our experience with the GitcoinDAO / Akita token situation earlier this year. Should this proposal move forward, it may be advantageous to consider having Uniswap\u2019s future votes in Voltz governance delegated to one specific Uniswap governance member. In our view, qualifications for this would be a delegate who is familiar with the Uniswap V3 codebase and relevant tokenomics. ",

Great to see your support and appreciate the detail on your understanding of the license! On the governance mechanism for VoltzDAO - this hasn\u2019t been finalised yet, but what we do end up implementing will clearly be in the best interest of the community (which, if this proposal is approved, Uniswap governance would then be a part of). It\u2019s worth adding that we take a research-first approach to everything we do. So, until we complete the research, I can\u2019t confirm the exact mechanism we\u2019ll use. It is worth adding that Voltz transition to a DAO will be incremental, meaning Voltz protocol will go through the process of progressive decentralisation. We\u2019ll likely make our research on the governance mechanics open source at the point we start transitioning Voltz to a DAO to ensure we collect sufficient feedback from our community. Appreciate you may have a few Q off the back of this answer? ",

Apologies in advance if this info is out there, and feel free to answer these at whatever level of detail you feel comfortable:   What\u2019s current state?

Interested in hearing about both the product side and the governance side, and how those two might overlap   With the understanding that it\u2019s subject to change based on the way the Voltz governance discussion progresses, what does the high-level token distribution look like? (I\u2019m thinking messari-style pie chart here)   My opinion hasn\u2019t changed on this proposal btw, I think it\u2019s a great use case for the grant.

This is a completely new sort of deal, so there\u2019s not a lot of precedent to base the allocation from. It might be helpful for the Uniswap community to have some details about Voltz recent funding round(s) to get an idea of what 1% of token supply cost to your investors, as this would allow Uniswap to put a tentative dollar value on the license grant. This should help UNI holders make an informed opinion on whether 1% of supply is sufficient.  Do you envision any restrictions on further use of the v3 codebase outside of the described rate swap AMM mechanism?  What I\u2019m getting at here is, this deal will only work from Uniswap\u2019s perspective if we can be assured that you won\u2019t launch a competing general purpose concentrated liquidity AMM. Maybe this question should be directed at Uniswap Labs legal team - is it possible to grant a limited purpose exception to the license (just for IRS AMM) without opening up the risk of a full fork of Uniswap v3? Appreciate any color you can give here! Both of the above concerns feel like they should be solvable, and I look forward to seeing how this proposal develops! ",

Re the 1% number, in chatting this through with @tobyshorin and bryan from Otherinternet last week, I sort of settled on thinking of the grant in similar terms as what you would pay to non-founding technical employee number 1 at a startup. In my experience and from my research,  0.50% / 3.00% is probably the range so 1% is defensible. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right, but honestly I don\u2019t know that it matters all that much. In my view, the point of the license isn\u2019t to run a seed fund where Uniswap trades permission for token allocations. It\u2019s a forcing function to make sure that the code is used to better the defi ecosystem without diluting the value of Uniswap itself. To that end, your question about further restrictions is definitely important and it would be great to have someone from Labs weigh in about that issue in particular but also this proposal more generally.

These questions probably make sense to respond to together, though will use your question structure @eek637.  Our understanding is that to \u2018action\u2019 the Additional Use Grant, Voltz use case needs to be \u201clisted and defined at v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth\u201d [reference]. We believe this could clearly state that the license is being awarded to the VoltzDAO, but whilst the VoltzDAO is being established it will be held on a temporary basis by Voltz Labs. Within this, we also believe it could clearly state that the grant is only being provided to enable the creation of an Interest Rate Swap AMM that does not compete with Uniswap. Happy to agree this language, including ensuring it addresses your concern @monet-supply. However, we\u2019d also appreciate input from the Uniswap Labs team to make sure our interpretation is correct first. Voltz Labs will decentralize the protocol over a period of time. We have a number of tentative initiatives on the product roadmap (e.g. perpetuals, L2 scaling, etc.), along with the launch of governance, which is likely to happen at some point through 2022. Audits of our contracts are already underway and we plan on being on testnet later this quarter, subject to a successful Uniswap Governance vote and successful completion of the audit process. Our current thinking is that token distributions will be broadly equivalent to that of Uniswap\u2019s. This means we\u2019d have c.60% for the community (o/w c.5% may be for a corporate treasury), c.20% for investors and c.20% for the Voltz Labs team. Worth highlighting that this may be subject to change as thinking and requirements develop. For completeness, we were counting the 1% distribution to Uniswap Governance as part of the community allocation.  Finally on your point about valuation @monet-supply. I\u2019d need to check if we can disclose that publicly, but what I can say is that it was high for a seed round (!). This was primarily driven off the fact that interest rate swaps are a core pillar of functioning financial systems (there\u2019s c.$1,000tn of notional exchanged each year in TradFi IRS). So if we\u2019re successful in building out an interest rate swap AMM and helping DeFi displace TradFi, then the Voltz \u201cslice\u201d of that new system has the potential to be one of the largest and most important of all the defi protocols. Or in simpler terms, a good outcome for Voltz could easily be a valuation of c.$100bn. At this point the 1% is really meaningful, before including the non-financial benefits. Let me know if you have additional questions! We\u2019re also going to be on the Uniswap discord community call this Wednesday at 16:00 EST, so can answer follow-up questions there too if you\u2019re able to join! ",

                    "content": "Following up on the last conversation, this is Other Internet and Avantgarde Finance\u2019s proposal for how a future Uniswap-Voltz relationship might work. Authors: Toby Shorin (tobyshorin), Bryan Lehrer (bryanlehrer), Erin Koen (eek637) What we\u2019re solving for We\u2019re overall in support of Voltz\u2019s proposal to license Uniswap V3 codebase. However, should the proposal pass, we want to ensure there are proper governance structures in place to ensure the success of the relationship between these two communities. In proposing such a framework, our goal is to ensure that the governance rights that come along with the token grant are 1) in fact used and 2) that their use does not come at a cost to Uniswap\u2019s own governance. Instances of the first concern are obvious and widespread. Voter fatigue and lack of governance participation on important issues is a common criticism of tokenholder voting. When those issues are related to a different protocol altogether, it\u2019s reasonable to expect participation to drop even further, and we\u2019ve seen instances such as Index Coop\u2019s metagovernance where this is the case. They have taken similar steps to what we are proposing here, and have empowered a small group to vote on issues when token holders do not reach a quorum. The second concern is a bit less common but potentially more destructive. We have found that when a significant amount of Project A token and voting power is granted from to Project B, it is costly to use regular tokenholder voting to determine actions taken with those tokens. For example, in May 2021, a significant portion of the AKITA token supply was donated to the brand new GitcoinDAO treasury by Vitalik. Without a plan for how to handle this, the entire Gitcoin steward community got embroiled in discussion over how to handle the tokens, hijacking the governance process and leading to steward churn. We suggest that Voltz and Uniswap will have a more successful relationship if Voltz voting power is delegated to a small committee of Uniswap community members. Proposed delegation committee  Three individuals from the Unsiwap community are selected to represent Uniswap\u2019s interests in Voltz governance votes. Let\u2019s call this the Uniswap Voltz Committee. Committee members are selected through a process that includes 1) an open nomination process, 2) a brief interview to prevent sybil attacks, and 2) a snapshot to elect the three committee members. The total amount of voting power in Voltz governance is delegated equally to each individual. In this format each individual has 1/3 of voting power. (We are opting not to use a multisig for flexibility). The Uniswap Voltz Committee is a paid position, compensated with $1,200 per person, per quarter, denominated in equal parts UNI and Voltz tokens. Members of the committee will hold one-year terms that must be renewed by Uniswap governance annually, beginning on the date of delegation. Full responsibility for voting is delegated from the community to the Committee. To facilitate transparency in representation, a new thread on the Uniswap governance form should be created for the Committee to post updates when it conducts a vote. It may also solicit feedback from the community using that thread at its own discretion.  We believe this proposal will ensure the Uniswap community\u2019s interests in Voltz are represented, while also de-risking the token allocation from Voltz\u2019s perspective to ensure that there is a party responsible for the significant amount of voting power it is offering to Uniswap. Furthermore we believe that this framework can be reused for similar types of partnerships in the future where a licensing deal is struck in exchange for a percentage of the licensee\u2019s governance tokens. Next steps We\u2019d like to get feedback on this proposal in the thread below. Voltz governance is not live yet, so we intend to put together a proper temperature check for this proposal closer to the date of Voltz\u2019s token launch that will incorporate any feedback collected here. Provided we sense support for this proposal, we\u2019ll put forward a new comment or post with self-nomination guidelines for being part of the committee, and start a search process for members. People who are knowledgeable about tokenomics, have a broad understanding of the DeFi landscape and tokenized financial products, and prior governance experience (especially in Uniswap!) will be very well qualified. This will be a first-of-its kind committee, so it will be a great opportunity to gain governance experience and participate in a meaningful community partnership. Looking forward to feedback on this.

A few questions of clarity on your proposal:   The total amount of voting power in Voltz governance is delegated equally to each individual. In this format each individual has 1/3 of voting power. (We are opting not to use a multisig for flexibility).   Can you expand a bit more on technicals of how this would work? The Voltz tokens would be in the Uniswap treasury; so would the tokens have to be split into three address within the treasury in order for the community to set each delegate to each committee member? The Voltz allocation would not be leaving the treasury to any committee member controlled address correct?   The Uniswap Voltz Committee is a paid position, compensated with $1,200 per person, per quarter, denominated in equal parts UNI and Voltz tokens. Members of the committee will hold one-year terms that must be renewed by Uniswap governance annually, beginning on the date of delegation.   Are the Voltz coming out of the 1% allocated to Uniswap treasury or is this payed by Voltz treasury to the comittee members? Since Uniswap is paying the committee from its treasury, should Voltz also pay this fee outside of the 1% allocation?  Voltz governance is not live yet, so we intend to put together a proper temperature check for this proposal closer to the date of Voltz\u2019s token launch that will incorporate any feedback collected here.  Is this a Proposal Merge? Would this new temperature check be a combination of the \u201cOther Internet and Avantgarde\u201d proposal outline which sets a precident for future license grants and Voltz (i.e. Other Internet/Avantgarde: Voltz V3 Additional Use Grant Proposal)? A merger of two proposals into one to then be put up for an eventual vote? ",

And happy to clarify, though everything is up for discussion:  Presuming that Voltz governance is similar to those systems we\u2019ve seen so far, the tokens would never leave the Uniswap treasury and instead their voting power would be delegated in equal portions to each delegate\u2019s wallet. There\u2019s a lot of precedent for this type of governance delegation (e.g. the University blockchain clubs) Re compensation, tokens would come out of Uniswap treasury, not Voltz No, this is not a proposal merge. Based on the Community Call yesterday, I think the Voltz proposal to license the code will move to a snapshot at some point next week. We\u2019ve posted the above in this thread to provide context, and to help form an answer to a question we were having ourselves.  ",

From a Voltz perspective we\u2019d be supportive of this proposal - we\u2019d be keen to ensure the Uni-Voltz relationship is successful and the Uniswap community has an effective mechanism to vote in Voltz governance decisions. Though we appreciate the mechanism used is ultimately a Uniswap governance decision. We\u2019d also be supportive of this taking place in the build up to the Voltz Token Generation Event - though again appreciate this is a decision for the Uni community. To respond to your comment about the Temperature Check snapshot on our Additional Use Grant proposal. It was great to talk to the Uniswap community on Wednesday - off the back of that conversation we\u2019ll be looking to start the Temperature Check next week. We\u2019ve also reached out to the Uniswap Labs team to clarify their interpretation of the language that will need to be used at v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth. In the event there is a successful Temperature Check vote, we (Voltz) will suggest this language to Uniswap governance in advance of the Consensus Check. Any comments or thoughts in the meantime, we\u2019d look forward to responding to. Otherwise, we\u2019re excited to make this happen!  ",

After the proposal successfully passed both the Temperature Check and Consensus Check, we are now getting ready to initiate the final Governance Proposal vote. As a result, we have outlined below the draft code that will be executed by the Uniswap Timelock if the vote is successful. Through the rest of this week we are testing this code in a simulator: https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt. When complete, we\u2019ll post the final code that will be proposed to the Timelock. Should the community have any feedback we\u2019d be excited to receive it. Otherwise, we plan on initiating the final vote on Monday 28th February. We have been humbled and thrilled with the support of the Uniswap community so far! We\u2019re excited about the prospect of making this happen and setting a precedent for future DAO2DAO collaboration!

We were delighted and humbled by the response from the Uniswap community with over >99% voting in favour of the proposal. The Temperature Check also met the 25k UNI Yes threshold required to pass. Following this successful vote, the Voltz Labs team is now getting ready to initiate the Consensus Check on Snapshot. We\u2019re mindful that within the Temperature Check post there was a request for Voltz Labs to provide clarity on the language that we\u2019re requesting be added to v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth in the event the proposal is successful. As a result, we\u2019ve outlined below language that we believe reflects the nature of the request and discussion on the Temperature Check forum. We look forward to any additional comments from the Uniswap Community. If there aren\u2019t any additional comments, we\u2019ll look to initiate the Consensus Check in the coming week.
