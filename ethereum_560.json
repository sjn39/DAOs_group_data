I feel that till we know where we are , its hard to make improvements. So here are my initial thoughts and I will try to test run at in the next few weeks with few devs to get feedback early and re-iterate. Here it is, these are tactical next steps to do.  Schedule 30min converstaion remote or F2F to collect answers and collate/distribute. We are doing a grass root assessment of what type of organizational support is required for core devs, so that we do not create beurocracy, and provide value and ease their jobs in terms of communication and organization. With that we would like to go through some basic questions to understand what is done now and how devs communicate and organize today, where pain points are and where we can help. At the same time we want to make sure that support people are in no way inferior to the core devs and everyone is treated with respect that everyone deserves.  What forms of communications are used?  (Email, text, forums, chats)  What tools or applications are used?  (Telegram, skype, what\u2019s up, signal, slack, reddit etc)   Does the comm channel change depending on the type of the comms?   What do you like and not like about the current process of comms?   What would you change? How?   How often are dev core meetings?   Are you happy how they are organized?   What would you change?   We have a team of volunteers willing to help core devs with organization and comms, where do you think they would add most value?   One of the proposed solutions: Would it be helpful to organize a ring of Comms and Org people that you know that you can always pull into various meetings to collect notes, organize and disburse comms etc?
