Quote from the README:  The current EIP and ECIP process basically composes of \u201cchangelogs\u201d. We define, as informal specifications, about what is changed when the EIP is applied. This works well for simple changes such as gas cost modification and opcode addition, because the change is only at a single point and assumed not to affect the rest of the system. However, totally relying on changelog format has its expressiveness limit. For pressing issues on Ethereum we\u2019re facing nowadays, many structual and potentially complex changes of the EVM are required. When writing them under EIP \u201cchangelog\u201d format, it\u2019s both hard for authors to express themselves, and for readers to understand the specification. This has led to confusions and implementation consensus issues in the past. What\u2019s more, some of the previously-thought single point changes turned out to affect a larger part of the EVM, such as EIP-1283 and EIP-1884, relying on changelog format solely made it harder for readers to review those effects. The Core Paper Project of EVM is an attempt to address those issues. Instead of one-step \u201cchangelog\u201d process as in EIP and ECIP, here feature upgrades are defined under a two-step process:   Refactoring: Any new feature upgrades is identified as a \u201cmodule change\u201d. We first refactor the whole EVM specification to get a functionally equivalent specification.  Module change: We then add the module change, and write the \u201cchangelog\u201d simply as the actual module change.  As an example, to add new EVM features that require additional validation step in the beginning, we first refactor the whole EVM specification to have a no-op validation step, which is functionallly equivalent to what we have now. After that, the new feature can simply be added as an additional module. This process is much more clear compared with the changelog process. At the same time, we hope the modular design and specification allow reusibility outside of the context of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, and can encourage better standardization, for EVM features that are not designed for Ethereum or Ethereum Classic mainnet.  The current goal is to define account versioning using the core paper format, and see how it goes. ",

At our RUNEVM, we had already talked to eg. Monax (Hyperledger Burrow) and other non-core-ETH teams about this. I can point some of them at this, but I still think the formal verification path of Jello Paper is a better direction. ",
