We are excited to begin supporting Uniswap at our fullest capacity, offering a unique delegate experience for the community and stakeholders. As a user and longtime supporter of Uniswap, we are committed to helping the protocol\u2019s decentralization and multi-chain growth. Specifically, our focus will be on:  Ensuring the safe deployment of V3 across multiple chains, ensuring target chains are net beneficial to the protocol and token holders. Researching and putting forward proposals to address potential areas of improvement such as governance participation, governance processes, growth, grants, etc. Provide input and recommendations regarding protocol parameters from a trading and LP perspective. Streaming important votes and proposals and their impact across our institutional and corporate channels.   Introduction Wintermute is a leading crypto-native algorithmic trading firm, specializing in creating efficient markets across centralized and decentralized exchanges. Wintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market-making desks. Since our inception, we have traded over $2.85T and expanded our presence across 80+ (de)centralized exchanges and various (non)EVM chains, continuously supporting and providing liquidity throughout the ecosystem for our partners and their communities. Alongside our trading arm is Wintermute Ventures, which enables us to support projects where we know we can be true value-adding, develop a partnership and help influence a positive outcome. Importantly, we do not target large ownership stakes; decentralized ownership is an important prerequisite to transitioning to a robust future.  Why us We believe that a decentralized world needs robust and progressive governance systems. Our goal is to support DAOs along their journey towards such a state through objective, long-term value-add decision-making. Alongside active governance participation, Wintermute\u2019s goal is to support Uniswap\u2019s growth in a sustainable and robust manner, providing research when needed and proactively creating proposals to address areas of improvement (e.g. dYdX LP Reward Restructure). We\u2019ll also happily leverage our internal infrastructure from both our trading and venture arms to support the DAO in areas such as simple treasury maintenance, to bespoke cross-chain liquidity management. Outside of Uniswap, we\u2019re contributors to Aave, dYdX, Index Coop, and 1inch. We intend to expand our presence across many more DAOs in the near future. Our Core Values: Long-term value creation over short-term opportunism. For example, we do not support short-term rent-seeking token distribution programs; or the redistribution of tokens that carry no positive second-order effects. In contrast, we do support and encourage purpose-driven mechanisms that incentivize positive behaviour and are value-maximizing; or that improve alignment between token holders and the protocol. Transparency, alignment, and proactivity. We are proactive in providing clear and consistent reasoning behind our decision-making and proposals, ensuring the protocol\u2019s sustainability is at the heart of all governance discussions. Objective data-driven decision-making. We use data and research to ensure our final decision is objectively value-accretive for the protocol. We look forward to actively contributing to Uniswap alongside fellow delegates and thank all future delegators who choose to support Wintermute and the greater decentralization of Uniswap!

The urgency surrounding the expiry of the V3 BSL should not be understated. While we also understand the caution in the community regarding bridge providers, we believe LayerZero (the heavily supported alternative to the Binance Chain deployment) poses no significant risk to the protocol.
