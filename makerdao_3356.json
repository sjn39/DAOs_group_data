The yoga teacher for the off-site meetings? Please let us know. Doing so will help direct new Core Units forming and nudge adjacent Core Units could take over the responsibility. Happy to talk to discuss it in private if you feel like remaining anonymous. Your Operational Support team. PS, if no Core Unit can take over the responsibility, Operational Support will do it. @amyjung is already learning Kubernetes while I struggle with Vyper.

CommDev has been responsible for this up until now and MakerDAO isn\u2019t going to suddenly stop having a relationship with the community just because CommDev is going away. In this new paradigm, I could see \u2018community\u2019 encompassing things like events, bounties and project-based jobs, recruitment, customer support, contests, and opportunities to feature community-created content. Some of these functions fall within the mandate of core units that have been proposed but maybe it would be helpful to have a Core Unit to centralize at least some of these efforts? Whether it\u2019s a Core Unit or just a project coordinated between members of different Core Units, I think we should continue to have a group responsible for community management. 2. Legal @layerzero Any update on how things are coming with the Legal Core Unit? I think it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s best interest to have a well-compensated legal department responsible for mitigating legal risk for other Core Units and the DAO itself. 3. Tech Ops What digital properties are going to be managed by the Dai Foundation vs Core Units? How are tech, content, and design going to work together to maintain web properties like makerdao.com?

                    "content": "One thing I haven\u2019t seen yet, which is present in most public companies, is an oversight function. Usually, there is a board of directors with a senior management team being held accountable to them fulfills this role. With MakerDAO that Board is replaced with MKR voters, but how do MKR voters know that Core Units are being managed well? Are there standards? Should there be a dedicated Oversight CU to set those standards and report on them? Or can we take a different approach? Does a Governance Communications Core Unit make sense instead? The GCCU is in RFC, with a mandate that is being revised by its author(me). One focus of our mandate is to work with CU facilitators to set standards for CU reporting. Between that and the part of the mandate that involves forming relationships with MKR holders, it seems like we are naturally positioned to replace the oversight function with standards and transparent reporting. If facilitators are failing or underperforming, MKR voters need to know and understand why or at least what the failed results are and whether the facilitator is able to bounce back or carry on. In practice, governance communications not only provides a platform for shared updates and reporting but also help sharpen the accountability side of MakerDAO by understanding MKR voter needs and working to set reasonable standards for reporting. MakerDAO is still in early crypto-company mode. If it wants to be taken seriously by a wider range of stakeholders, new investors, and the world it needs to set the bar high for reporting and accountability to MKR holders. Anyway, these are just some late night thoughts. The scope for Governance Comms includes other things that I didn\u2019t mention here, so this isn\u2019t the full picture of that CU. This was just a rant on accountability to voters and the necessity of getting our practices up to par. ",
