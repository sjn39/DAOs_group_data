I would like to gauge to communities interest in subsidizing governance participation (on-chain MKR votes) through the system surplus. This would involve creating a MIP I believe so before work begins on that I wanted to start a discussion with polling to see if this is something people think would promote more participation and whether its even worth it (especially with Governance Module v2 coming sometime down the pike/pipe). The details of how this would be achieved have not been fleshed out yet so this is more of a general question as opposed to the how (which can be discussed here!) Receiving input from Foundation members would be helpful to know what future gas prices might be expected to look like. I\u2019m sure executives will always require on-chain voting though so subsidizing that would still be on the table I presume. Should we subsidize governance polls/executives with system surplus?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This Poll will run until 2020-08-30T04:00:00Z ",

All the old arguments about incentives causing people to just vote for any option just to get a reward still apply. However a functioning delegation system would go a long way towards mitigating this. BUT it should be free to vote, its trivial to work out how much gas has been spent to vote and refund this amount in Dai from the System Surplus. NFT\u2019s for participation in governance may be hip but can not be used to pay for gov transactions. Low participation in the LRC vote et.el. can probably be attributed to 200Gwei + gas prices and YAM/CRV mania. Of the roughly 200 polls over the past 12 months, how many would have had a different outcome if more voters had participated? ",
