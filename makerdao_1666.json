                    "content": "It is extremely common for contributors within the DAO to contribute to other DAOs and has been brought up both publicly and privately in the past. If you or anyone in the DAO would like to discuss this subject, I would request posting in the aforementioned linked thread where this was brought up. Many DAO members from CUs and Delegates alike participate in other DAOs which positively impact Maker, while some have even launched protocols that are direct competitors. There have also been Core Unit contributors that also served as Delegates, at the same time. Regarding Lido specifically, until Lido launches it\u2019s own stablecoin and Maker launches it\u2019s own staking as a service business, I don\u2019t believe they are competing. Indeed, I believe the projects complement each other and having contributors active in both DAOs would only increase Maker\u2019s success long term, especially once the End Game Plan passes in which MakerDAO will accumulate significant amounts of stETH.     CodeKnight:  There do seem to be a confluence of conflicts of interests here. Strategic Finance members will be earning a significant salary from Lido, while also manually administering the purchase of stEth on behalf of MakerDAO and acting as a \u201cProtector MetaDAO\u201d with broad powers in collateral onboarding. Wrapped up in this, MakerDAO is being asked to consider a large Lido token purchase.   I\u2019m happy to address any concerns publicly or privately, but given the significance of this MIP I would request that such discussions occur in the previously linked thread. I have been discussing MetaDAOs with @rune for the past several weeks and we have discussed how the SFCU could fit within the End Game Plan - such discussions have been extremely fluid and continue to evolve. Given that Rune is a significant LDO holder, I also discussed the idea of part of SF providing services similar to what we perform for MakerDAO, for LidoDAO. Regarding the acquisition of stETH by MakerDAO - SF will still write proposals to the community in the event of the Endgame Approval MIP Set passing to seek community feedback for ensuring the DAO can acquire stETH at the best possible price. This is not something I have discussed with Rune, as he mentioned on the DVC call today, but sounds like something we could use DssKiln for. Related to the Protector MetaDAOs and collateral onboarding - we deeply appreciate the trust and autonomy to support the DAO with Rune\u2019s sub-proposal to move forward with onboarding proposals that will help facilitate the Endgame Plan and Protector Clustering. There are some very exciting MIPs currently being drafted that we believe will provide the DAO with the resources needed to successfully launch the Endgame Plan and MetaDAOs. Throughout the onboarding process, we will be as transparent as possible and provide frequent updates to the DAO. ",

                    "content": "Firstly, to clarify a minor point: SF is not onboarding at Lido . We are developing Steakhouse Financial, a small DAO-to-DAO partnership with a mission to democratize complex information for a broad base of stakeholders. We envision this as a niche platform with a very small number of DAOs that grows organically, leveraging contributors and community members who are already on the inside, and for protocols we are invested in and care about deeply. This platform should allow embedded groups of passionate contributors to grow with their DAOs in a modular and scalable way that aligns incentives for all participants. Needless to say, it is not going to be a high-growth FAANG tech company that will one day compete with Maker. It is a group of DAO contributors with enough brain damage from working in the space who want to organize a little bit more than before.    Endgame Approval MIP Set - next steps   Two issues I find with this, rather surprising, discovery: 1.) We learned about this not from SF CU disclosing their plans to MakerDAO up front, but from a recognized delegate\u2019s diligent research. 2.) In the Lido forum Stakehouse Financial proposes to: build out full financial statements; develop, manage, and execute payroll processes end-to-end in concert with operations and legal workstreams; create standardized financial reports for the entire DAO including cash flow, grants, operating expenses; I feel that we could use plenty of that here in MakerDAO, and am wondering whether SF CU feels not compensated well enough or otherwise necessitated to seek alternative income with existing personell.   1:  Given how public our proposal at Lido is and how we had envisioned fencing off responsibilities, we thought it would not be relevant discussing publicly at Maker until the proposal passed  Rune has, however, been aware of this proposal for some time Clearly these two alone missed the mark and may have given the wrong impression to people, and we regret not posting earlier     Strategic Finance is not asking to be onboarded to Lido  The proposal for Lido involves two members of Strategic Finance (Mark and Adrian), in a supervisory capacity, and two independent members, (Danny and Pipko) Pipko was a summer intern with us at Strategic Finance but this internship has come to an end as his school year restarts and McNut has never been part of a CU at Maker There are members of StratFi who are not part of the proposal   It does not take a lot of diligence to uncover this information  When we presented the proposal to the Lido community, we did not make any effort nor have any desire to hide who we are Our pfps and usernames are exactly the same, we are doxxed there as we are here and we specify clearly we are contributors at MakerDAO    2:  We have developed:  Full financial statements Standardized financial reports Cash flow forecasts Operating expenses reports and processes Further work on balance sheet management frameworks with developments and proposals incoming over the next few weeks Invite you to consult our monthly updates for more information on other initiatives   We are proud of this work as it is widely recognized as some of the best in the industry and we have begun collaborating with other industry participants and academics on the discussion around more broadly recognized standards for accounting practices  Tunnel vision at Maker may obscure the fact that people inside and outside MakerDAO greatly value and follow this information on a regular basis      twitter.com    Justin Trollip @jtrollip  This is inspirational.

It\u2019s just ridiculous considering the amount of money you get as salaries. When we (MakerDAO) pay full salaries, we expect a full time commitment.

But I am not comfortable paying the high salaries we currently pay and then discover (form the independent research of a forum user (@welsh ) that they are also working for    There is no MIP mandate that requires Core Units be exclusive employees of the protocol and Maker does not provide employment  Unless Maker also wants to pay social security charges, maternity and paternity leave, arbitrate in employment tribunals, issue jurisdiction-specific working contracts and open branches in countries where contributors are located   Other Core Units and Delegates regularly work for other protocols and companies  Broadly speaking this should be fine provided there are no overlapping positions of meaningful decision authority in either DAO, and even then the line is blurry Token holders are ultimately the decision-makers, if they prefer to have CUs with exclusive dedication they should voice that desire - but it would be one of the few to require it Some disclose it openly others don\u2019t.   SF - including members who are not part of the Lido proposal - has an active offboarding post, from an anon account, that has only been addressed by a single delegate  We could be offboarded in weeks with no recourse, as there is no contractual or employer agreement with the DAO, as is the nature of working for a DAO Our future in the DAO is quite volatile and the opposite of an implied bargain to exclusivity        CodeKnight:  There do seem to be a confluence of conflicts of interests here. Strategic Finance members will be earning a significant salary from Lido, while also manually administering the purchase of stEth on behalf of MakerDAO and acting as a \u201cProtector MetaDAO\u201d with broad powers in collateral onboarding. Wrapped up in this, MakerDAO is being asked to consider a large Lido token purchase.    Our first thought on stETH is to not operate it actively  We learned about this plan at the same time as everyone else, reading this post Based off our experience with Makershire, our instinct is to not actually take ownership of the buy order but run it through a permissionless vault, such as a PSM or DSS Kiln, where final decision authority would remain with token holders   None of us has any decision authority in either DAO, nor do we have enough tokens to make any sort of meaningful decision in any camp  General Comment: Often the tone of discussions at Maker is for things to happen then nothing happens then all of a sudden it blows up for some reason and outrage is produced. The Lido proposal has been on their forums and their twitter accounts for some time now. Often this outrage tends to be coordinated by anon accounts. While we are obviously welcoming of all identities who may not have the desire to dox themselves while interacting here, these interactions also tend to be very short on substance, some of whom have significant conflicts of interest themselves. With some notable exceptions incl. @iammeeoh despite his evident disappointment. Let\u2019s have a discussion on the issues to resolve them diligently and leave outrage at the threshold. We\u2019ll be on the G&R to discuss our Offboarding Proposal though I am certain there are far more pressing matters to talk about for Maker than one more round of human drama. This thread is meant to be about the Endgame Plan and we would appreciate getting back to the matter on hand, as well as moderator\u2019s help in merging this with the External Work thread or, even better, a new thread altogether.

In fact, the Maker protocol allows even anonymous contributors who in theory the community doesn\u2019t even know they are engaged in other entities / protocols. However, if the CU or the members are under performing because they have to juggle between different roles, then the community and the governance will take notice and take actions. I think for now, SF CU has been functioning well but you can imagine if the performance deteriorate in the future, they would be encouraged to readjust their prioritization. ",

It\u2019s notable in this case that SF used their same names/identities in their Lido proposal (a public post) even though nothing really would have stopped them from doing so under other identities, or consulting privately, etc. As Aes says, we do not require CUs to work exclusively for Maker and there are plenty of examples of other CUs doing work for other protocols. It would be unfair to hold SF to a standard we haven\u2019t held any other CU to. If we want to  have exclusive workers at the DAO, that should be its own broad conversation on a DAO-wide scale, rather than assert some kind of implied fidelity/contract on an ad-hoc basis. The other point I would make, though, is that this general practice (of CUs contributing work to multiple DAOs) seems like the direction of travel in any case for Maker. Take the possible shift to Project-Based Budgeting, for instance, where contributors\u2019 tie to Maker would presumably be to complete a discrete scope of work. The Endgame Plan also envisages most CUs working as contributors to autonomous MetaDAOs, at arms\u2019 length from the core protocol. None of this means that conflicts of interest won\u2019t exist in the future, but the very nature of Maker\u2019s workforce is fluid and evolving, which seems like important context for this discussion.

                    "content": "Folks time to be real here on some basic issues.  As contractors to MakerDAO as far as I know CUs have never had to sign any form of non-compete agreement (which actually is common in a lot of tech companies for many reasons).   Not even sure who could co-sign on this for the DAO actually. Many companies now as a condition of employment restrict employees from being employed elsewhere.  This is less common than (1) but it is a growing trend as far as I know. If one looks at contractors for the DAO as consultants then one has to consider it natural for these contractors to solicit and work for other clients.   In fact if you think there will be high variability on the work for these people you sign them with a \u2018retainer\u2019 so they continue to be available over periods of time vs. them just deciding they no longer have to work for you.  It was always my expectation that CUs would and should start to look like MakerDAO spinoff business units (BUs).  MakerDAO until the MetaDAO concept never really grasped the idea, much less practically, how to do BUs.  Given the complete lack of jurisdiction and legal accountability between a DAO and anything (except RWA through a trust, etc.) I couldn\u2019t see how MakerDAO could actually spin off BUs and retain ownership/control via ownership stakes.    The point here is why would Maker spend millions on CU contractors to effectively start their own BUs and not retain any ownership stakes? Rune seems to think MetaDAOs solve the above.  Time will tell. I come back to something @PaperImperium said over a year ago now and I am paraphrasing him.   DAOs are basically are the worst of all organizations I will add that Maker failing to home in any jurisdiction is equivalent to floating a pirate flag on its business ship. The real issue here is that MakerDAO contractors have no explicit rules for conduct and no jurisdictional or legal frameworks to fall back on should agreements be broken.  This involves disclosure of conflicts of interest, non-disclosure agreements, non-compete, etc. No matter what is decided here - one thing should emerge - a uniform and equal treatment of all MakerDAO individuals within particular classes (whether this is contractors, vault owners, DAI holders, delegates or MKR holders) which in the case of CUs as contractors will mean a general rules of conduct for contractors equally applicable to all contractors.

The cost/productivity/value of many CUs is obviously an issue for Maker as a whole and can/should be addressed separately. The issue here is that SF seems to be involved with the administration and (this part is not clear to me) possibly the strategic usage of a protocol that they are (or will be) getting paid by.  This is as if the US government hired a firm to manage a new fighter jet program and the firm they hired was also on Lockheed\u2019s payroll (or if RWF was on HVBanks payroll).  That would be absurd and the firm could not be expected to neutrally carry out those duties.  If SF is getting paid by Lido, they should not be involved in purchasing assets that directly benefit Lido or in making strategic decisions/recommendations that directly benefit Lido. ",

What Maker really needs is quality work product and throughput, not FTEs per se (although I think having people who are \u201cfull time\u201d committed to Maker has big, intangible benefits). Risk of the engagement seems low as SF actions must be thoroughly justified to pass governance, and SF team does not have the power to control protocol assets independently. If any conflict starts to emerge (eg favoring Lido at the expense of competitors or against the best interests of MakerDAO), I think this can be identified and corrected on a case by case basis, rather than preemptively based on the potential for future conflicts. Key DAO services may become cheaper over time if we let our CUs grow in scale by serving more organizations. Particularly in SFs case, I think generating financial statements and financial planning could benefit from supply side economies of scale. To the extent that DAI/MKR budgets are being justified to MakerDAO based on a certain number of FTEs, it does matter that these people are actually working for Maker full time. But in some cases the better solution may be rethinking our budget setting standards rather than discouraging work for external protocols. An alternative model for external protocol work is billing external protocols for benefit of MakerDAO (eg. risk team\u2019s recent proposals at Aave and Compound included payments to MakerDAO). This may not work in all cases and maybe isn\u2019t the best mechanism in the long run (eg would it be better for service providers / CUs to bill other protocols directly and be able to charge Maker less?) but worth considering.

But in some cases the better solution may be rethinking our budget setting standards rather than discouraging work for external protocols   I totally agree with this, and I don\u2019t want to discourage any possible arrangement for work, as each has its PROs/CONs and can be useful for a given set of people/situations. My point is that with the current way most CUs have set up, that is  stating FTE positions in their budget proposals, and receiving MKR compensation  it\u2019s not appropriate to just do additional paid work (with a commitment of a non-negligible hours/week) for other DAOs, especially if it is not well advertised in the forum and accepted by governance. In my view taking a role as a \u2018full time\u2019 at Maker, being paid pretty well (MakerDAO\u2019s salaries are quite generous), receiving MKR compensation on top of it\u2026 and then coming up with a \u201cuhm, technically we are not employees\u201d and \"working for other DAOs brings value to the ecosystem and to maker\u2019 etc is borderline intellectually dishonest. This, of course, is just my personal point of view. One last comment:     luca_pro:  the double/ triple/ quadruple standards in this DAO are hilarious.   This is the first time I noticed this behaviour (additional paid work for other DAOs on top of a FTE commitment at Maker). Surely due to my lack of attention. I have absolutely nothing specific against SF and I would just repeat myself on all other similar situation given the same circumstances. Let me quote myself:     iammeeoh:  @Aes I am not attacking you or any specifics, as this event sets a precedent (and therefore nobody can be explicitly blamed).   ",

Understood, OCU will be applying to be the Oracle Core Unit for every other DeFi protocol from now on and pocketing the money. Thank you for clarifying! ",
