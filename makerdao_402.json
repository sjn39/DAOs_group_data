Summary - Calculations - Processed MKR-By-Day - Raw MKR-By-Day Credits  Huge thanks to @piotr.klis from the Data Insights CU for the raw data shown here. Even huger thanks to @Patrick_J for setting up the calculations and formula in the sheet linked above.   Comments  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Delegate\u2019s MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR delegates are credited with is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day as a maximum of 10,000 in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000. We\u2019ve applied pro-rata scaling to compensation for delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Metric Cut-offs As mentioned elsewhere, the metric cut-off is pretty harsh, and this ended up in a pretty negative outcome for @MakerMan . We\u2019re looking to address this for future payouts, and may run a signal to retroactively pay MakerMan even though he didn\u2019t technically meet the thresholds required.  Last Minute Rush Due to some bad planning on my part, getting this together for the exec was a bit rushed. I\u2019m confident that the sheet is accurate and contains all the relevant information with respect to transparency, but we\u2019ll try to polish it up some in January when we do the December payouts.

So when building the delegates program we were pretty clear that we didn\u2019t think it should require a full-time commitment. The ultimate goal for the delegation program is to have delegates voting for people that delegate to them, and communicating their positions so current delegators (and future ones) can decide who will represent their interests best. We can talk about adding levels or requirements to compensation, but ultimately it\u2019s important that we can attract delegates that will collect otherwise idle MKR. Delegates can go above and beyond these requirements, and perhaps there should be other ways to reward that compensation. But for this first iteration of delegate compensation, I think it\u2019s pretty important that it is tied to objective metrics concerning voting and communication. ",

More than a delegate, he is an evangelist. In the name of everyone at Maker, thank you. Other vital things might be going unrewarded. @ultraschuppi collaborates in a hundred groups, while @MakerMan has been an excellent resource for us for the longest time (including a superb BT analysis).  We should not raise the expectations for Delegates. This raises the barriers to entry, and we want more delegates (at least for now). We once had an overachiever delegate that started lobbying with a major government.   We might want to compensate great contributors We need to be looking at things that we value and reward the great people taking care of those. An Evangelist Program? The UltraSchuppi Award of the Month?

Ultimately I\u2019m hopeful that having more delegates and competition will smooth out items like this in the longer-term. We\u2019re already in a situation where Flip Flop Flap has 32k MKR delegated, and Feedblack has 10k MKR delegated, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019re already seeing this work. Given the current MKR delegated, we could raise the upper threshold parameter from 10,000 MKR to a higher value. This would result in Flip Flop Flap receiving more compensation than Feedblack. However, I don\u2019t believe this is worthwhile in the current climate. I mentioned this briefly on the governance call yesterday, but I don\u2019t think that we should react too heavily to the current layout of delegates and delegated MKR because we\u2019re still at a point where we\u2019re expecting semi-rapid changes due to:  Larger MKR Holders soon-to-begin delegating. More delegates coming online (both sourced from the community, and from some of those larger MKR Holders.)  Once things have settled down some, I think we\u2019ll take another look at the parameter settings in MIP61 and that are being used for the trial and see if it makes sense to tweak them. It\u2019s possible that the upper threshold should be a result of some function of the total MKR delegated, and the number of recognized delegates in order to target a certain level of distribution between the delegates. But not sure, I need to think more about it once we have more data. ",

This would result in Flip Flop Flap receiving more compensation than Feedblack.   One possibility is to flip the curve convexity for delegates with really large amounts of MKR. For example, library(ggplot2) df <- data.frame(mkr=seq(0,30000,100)) df$comp <- pmin(1,sqrt(df$mkr)/sqrt(10000))*144000 +   pmin(1,(pmax(0,df$mkr-15000))^2/10000^2)*144000 ggplot(df, aes(x=mkr, y=comp)) + geom_line()   mkr889\u00d7441 7.53 KB   I think that compensation should not rise between 10k and some larger amount (15k here) because it will be difficult for MKR holders to coordinate to hit a particular amount delegated. If we allow for a big range (5k here) then it\u2019s easier for MKR holders to decide that a delegate should be compensated at 144k/year but not unlock bonus compensation. I don\u2019t think we should change the compensation for 0-10k MKR. That part of the curve works well for starting delegates and delegates who are not superstars. It\u2019s enough money to compensate a single part-time or full-time person. For me, part of the expectation for bonus compensation is for superstar delegates to hire additional staff to help them perform even better. That\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of a stair-step pattern for bonus levels. Each higher threshold (for example 25k MKR) would provide another 144k/year to hire another staffer. If we add bonus compensation then MKR holders who want to delegate are forced to pay delegates more. This is in contrast to the current situation where compensation is capped and additional MKR does not increase compensation. Maybe the delegation smart contract could be made more flexible to allow for MKR holders to choose whether their delegated MKR will unlock bonus compensation.  Here\u2019s what another bonus step might look like, library(ggplot2) df <- data.frame(mkr=seq(0,40000,100)) df$comp <- with(df, pmin(1,sqrt(mkr)/sqrt(10000))*144000 +   pmin(1,(pmax(0,mkr-15000))^2/5000^2)*144000 +   pmin(1,(pmax(0,mkr-25000))^2/5000^2)*144000) ggplot(df, aes(x=mkr, y=comp)) + geom_line()   mkr889\u00d7441 7.9 KB  ",

Summary - Calculations - Processed MKR-by-Day - Raw MKR-by-Day Credits Huge thanks to @piotr.klis from the Data Insights CU for the raw data.  Comments  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Delegate\u2019s MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR delegates are credited with is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day as a maximum of 10,000 in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000. We\u2019ve applied pro-rata scaling to compensation for delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Performance Modifier The vote to introduce a Performance Modifier passed on-chain. This month, all Recognized Delegates that qualified for compensation achieved a minimum of 90% in both metrics, so the Performance Modifier was not used. It is likely that it will be used for the first time in January.  Distribution Delegate Compensation will be distributed as part of the first Executive Vote of the month.  Previous Compensation Breakdowns  November 2021   Delegate Compensation MIP MIP61 which defines Delegate Compensation remains in RFC.
