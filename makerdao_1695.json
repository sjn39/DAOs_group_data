                    "content": " MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards  Preamble MIP#: 81 Title: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards Author(s): @CB_Institutional  Contributors: Tags:  Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2022-09-06 Date Ratified: 2022-10-24 Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mipxx-coinbase-usdc-institutional-rewards/17703 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbMaQ9A   Sentence Summary MIP81 will onboard an account representing MakerDAO to Coinbase Prime and transfer 33% / ~1.6B of the PSM\u2019s USDC into custody to earn USDC rewards with Coinbase.  Paragraph Summary MIP81 onboards a portion of the PSM\u2019s USDC to Coinbase Prime in order to participate in Coinbase\u2019s USDC Institutional Rewards program. This MIP outlines the terms for reward calculation and the process for payment to MakerDAO through 2022.  Motivation This proposal responds to the ratified Declaration of Intent MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-term Bonds, wherein MakerDAO governance requested that collateral assets be deployed in a manner that incorporates evaluative criteria of: safety, cost structure, and flexibility. Coinbase is uniquely situated to offer a USDC Rewards Program to MakerDAO that meets this evaluative criteria. Specifically, Coinbase is an established, reputable, and regulated company.  Coinbase has been a longstanding partner of Maker\u2019s, most recently collaborating with the Growth Core Unit (GRO-001) and the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) to understand what opportunities would be of interest to the broader DAO community. Maker\u2019s balance sheet is largely exposed to USDC \u2014 in exchange for zero holding reward. Maker believes it is beneficial to safely be rewarded for holding collateral in USDC. This MIP outlines a clear path to providing up to 1.5% APY on USDC in the form of USDC Rewards and optimizing liquidity at zero cost to, and industry-leading security for, Maker.   Component Summary MIP81c1: USDC Onboarding Process & Rewards Program Terms This component outlines the process for onboarding to Coinbase via an appropriate legal structure and governance framework and the terms of Coinbase\u2019s rewards program. MIP81c2: Legal Verification & Oversight This component contains the requirements of legal oversight and disclosure to the Maker community.  Specification  MIP81c1: USDC Onboarding Process & Rewards Program Terms USDC Onboarding Process  If MIP81 is approved, a subsequent Signal Request must be posted by the Strategic Finance Core Unit, CES Core Unit, or Growth Core Unit, and passed to onboard a legal entity approved by Maker Governance. A Strategic Finance Core Unit facilitator will seek approval for a specific legal entity (the \u201carranger\u201d) in the weekly cycle to serve as permissioned actors on the account. The legal entity structure, governance framework, and necessary contractual arrangements must be appropriate to act as a large-scale custodian to Maker. This includes, but is not limited to:  No ability by third parties to access the funds or change the terms of the legal structure. Maker Governance has complete ability to trigger a liquidation with a successful executive vote encoding an instruction to the authorized account users of the legal entity. It should not be possible for a single third party to block the ability of Maker Governance to make decisions or modify the structure. There must be no apparent weak links or edge cases that allow funds to get misappropriated or stuck.   The arranger is responsible for ensuring all standard KYC and AML due diligence requirements have been met in accordance with Coinbase\u2019s obligation as an entity offering Prime Services. Consistent with the standard Coinbase Prime offering, the arranger will be authorized to deposit and withdraw assets between the PSM and Coinbase so long as they\u2019re successfully onboarded and authenticated. Their permissions will be limited to the actions described in this proposal: USD <> USDC transactions to and from the PSM. In the future, Coinbase and Maker will automate transactions between the PSM and Prime account via smart contract or API. Maker Governance\u2019s approval will facilitate onboarding to Coinbase Prime.  Coinbase\u2019s USDC Institutional Rewards Program  Maker will pay zero custody fees on USDC held with Coinbase Prime. Maker Governance will be able to freely mint, burn, withdraw, and settle almost instantaneously in USDC (<6 mins), consistent with Coinbase Prime\u2019s standard offering. Rewards from the USDC account with Coinbase will be calculated based on the weighted average of assets on the platform each month and paid on the 5th business day of the following month. Each month, Coinbase will calculate the weighted average holding of the account. Coinbase will pay rewards based on our USDC Institutional Rewards POC program rates:  100bps APY on first 100mm 10bps more APY on each 100mm thereafter Rewards rate will be paid based on the highest tier the client falls into Rewards are not to exceed 150bps APY   USDC Institutional Rewards POC will be in effect until the end of 2022, and the final payment will be made on the subsequent month. Assuming the pilot program continues beyond 2022, Maker will remain enrolled for 2023 and beyond. Terms could become variable, but Coinbase Institutional will provide an update to the Maker Forum at least 30 days prior to any changes. Rewards will be paid into the client\u2019s account in USDC.   MIP81c2: Legal Verification & Oversight  At least one community member, with legal credentials, must, through a public forum post, verify that the proposed entity is appropriate to onboard to Coinbase Prime. A CES facilitator must, again through a public forum post, provide a verification of the technical appropriateness of the MIP81 designated solution. Should the verification not be forthcoming, this MIP will not move forward. A member of the CES Core Unit will verify the address destination and the legal entity\u2019s Prime account prior to transfer of funds. A test transaction will take place to ensure the receiving address is correct prior to any release of funds. If CES is not satisfied with the security of fund transfer, the deal would be halted until these concerns were rectified.  ",

This proposal, if appropriately structured, could represent a lower risk profile with potentially a high level of transparency (on-chain verification). Also, the lower risk removes the necessity for more active capital markets treasury management, which as a Dao, will be difficult and we are not staffed for. In addition, there is the possibility of other intangible/meta benefits. And it will be interesting to see the debate this generates amongst regulators.

Layer upon layer upon layer of existential centralized risk just so that the DAO can justify continued overspending? Even while a large portion of the DAO understands that USDC-PSM is posting an existential threat that needs to be eliminated asap? Do you understand that moving the USDC to Coinbase will add yet another regulatory attack vector that the DAO needs to worry about? Circle won\u2019t even need to blacklist the PSM any more. The government can just force Coinbase to seize the funds and kill DAI instantly. So much easier for the government to understand. Fits so much more neatly into existing framework than creepy \u201cblacklisting\u201d. A vote for this proposal is a vote to place the entire fate of DAI and MKR in the hands of Coinbase, a publicly-traded corporation that does not have aligned interests with the not-so-decentralized MakerDAO.  If that\u2019s what you want\u2026 then honestly\u2026 why are you even here? Should we just sell the entire DAO to Coinbase instead at this point? I mean\u2026 what exactly are we doing here? I absolutely reject the premise of what\u2019s being proposed here and I am also now thinking that we should discuss a proposal to offboard Growth CU. Growth CU\u2019s incentives do not seem to be aligned with decentralization nor with the long-term survival of Maker. Proposals like this are putting CU jobs & salaries ahead of the long-term well-being of Maker and DAI. This was bound to happen as the humans of MakerDAO tipped the balance of power from the smart contracts to themselves. Maker needs to figure out how to get rid of the USDC as quickly as possible, it needs to cut costs dramatically and immediately, and it needs to develop a roadmap to full automation within 2 years.

How much would 1.50% APY move if  Net Leverage: How much gross and net leverage will the strategies used to get this return take on?

What I found indicated these funds are mixed and so if Coinbase/Centre goes bankrupt for some reason USDC holders stand in a list of creditors getting funds if assets are liquidated. Coinbase warns customers they may lose crypto if company goes bankrupt  (this link talks about crypto assets in custody, but I think same applies to capital backing of USD to USDC) With that in mind I remember the Coinbase/Centre report showing the composition of their USD (ala backing USDC) investments which were composed of a small amount of fairly high risk yield bonds (corporate I think).    circle.com    USD Coin (USDC) | Crypto that\u2019s held to a higher standard | Circle People and businesses use USD Coin (USDC) because it's a faster, safer, and more efficient way to send and spend money around the globe.

I want to make a few points. $24M/yr at this point more than doubles Maker Revenue and only uses 1/2 the PSM USDC.   No matter how one turns the potential blacklisting or sanctions (USDC in the PSM or USDC sent back to Coinbase to provide earnings)  still comes under the same possible legal encumbering.

I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the same risk as Coinbase in case of insolvency.   Not exactly - the USDC is issued by Centre https://www.centre.io/ (founding members Circle/Coinbase), which invests the USDC in short-term money market instruments and holds these investments in custody with various institutions in the US (this is their latest attestation report chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.centre.io/hubfs/PDF/USDC%202022_Circle%20Examination%20Report%20July%202022.pdf?hsLang=en). Currently, any income on investment by Centre is not distributed to USDC holders. I suspect that the motivation for this proposed deal is customer retention. Instead of converting our USDC into dollars (thereby reducing the total supply of USDC) - it is locked into custody with no impact on the supply of USDC. Instead, Coinbase is sharing some of the investment income received on Centres\u2019 short-term investments - (that indirectly they will probably receive in some form from profits made by Centre - my speculation). Therefore, the level of risk is a function of the custody arrangements. Generally, as I understand it, Coinbase provides segregated custody and cannot re-hypothecate or use the USDC Maker would custody for any purpose. So they won\u2019t be using the USDC to make any income - it just sits in custody until Maker removes it - so there wouldn\u2019t be any \u201ccelsius\u201d type risks. Assuming MKR token holders want to proceed with onboarding this proposal, I am sure that a complete MakerDao legal assessment of the proposed custody arrangements would be completed to determine to what extent other parties could have claims on Maker\u2019s assets - say, in a bankruptcy situation and the necessary information provided by @Growth-Core-Unit, and @strat-fin-core-unit regarding the nature of the custody arrangements.

Do you want to move USDC OFF-CHAIN to a 3rd party entity (CEX) just to make ~25 mil USD a year for token holders? We need to get out of USDC. This is basically just asking for the government to call up Brian or Jeremy and freeze things even more effortlessly than onchain. Circle itself is a bit more safer, but this is effectively moving from a bank to a broker who has the highest risk of getting screwed by the government in the next five years. Having USDC in a PSM is better than having it in some holding account with the U.S. government by proxy. So this is taking us backward and even more centralized. It makes zero sense. I agree with everything @ChrisBlec says. @RoFz The benefits you get are exposing your ass further and going further away from crypto ethos to get more yield. That is really stupid.

Sometimes it feels the project is languishing and not really going anywhere.  From the perspective of a smaller investor who really does want MKR to succeed, I encourage the community to take this offer.  With how slow the RWA efforts are going, Coinbase is giving you a lifeline to strengthen the balance sheet and lessen the time pressures you\u2019re faced with while you figure out how to better decentralize your assets.  In one fell swoop you can put all your assets to work without losing that all important liquidity.  Yes, Coinbase is still a centralized entity but it\u2019s also tied deeply to this space and I\u2019d like to believe that this proposal is one that partially comes from a desire to help MKR and strengthen the entire defi ecosystem.  Use this opportunity to get profitable and stay there while you work. To Coinbase, I wonder what happens to the institutional rewards POC (what is this?) rates at the end of 2022.  We\u2019re pretty close to the end of 2022 so it would be wise to figure out how the terms might change in 2023. ",

Three questions come to my mind: 1.) Where does the yield structure come from? Any way to negotiate these numbers upward? Or make it variable to match the market? As Rekt suggested\u2026     rekt:  I would like to see the 1.5% be a variable rate to match the market, with the potential to increase as DeFi starts to see higher APR on stables again post cryptowinter.   2.)     luca_pro:  I am a fan of this proposal personally, but I struggle to see something more regulatory-dependant than dealing with a regulated, listed, American firm.   I second that, although we do have exposure to US regulation with USDC as it is. This is the fly in the soup for me. The proposal would generate yield but would not diversify our existential risks. If anything, it increases them. We would then have two US companies controlling large parts of our assets instead of one. 3.)     CB_Institutional:  USDC Institutional Rewards POC will be in effect until the end of 2022, and the final payment will be made on the subsequent month.   Given that we do not have an arranger for this MIP yet and that it would probably be wise to ramp up the amount the arranger handles over time, I was wondering what @CB_Institutional\u2019s plans in 2023 and onwards are?

I will of course be supporting it fully and help to vote it through, alongside the other major yield proposals in the works, as they are fully aligned with the Endgame Plan and the strategy of Pigeon Stance - first we need to double down on RWA and focus on generating as much short term income as possible, that we can use to accumulate Staked ETH to give us the option to later switch to a more defensive stance if/when the risk of RWAs become too high. The estimates I\u2019ve seen is that we should expect 70-80 million in yearly revenues with just this first wave of yield generation activities. That doesn\u2019t mean we should keep splurging on the current badly structured version of the Decentralized Workforce, rather we need to reduce the recurring budget as much as possible so we maximize the surplus that can be used to accumulate decentralized collateral with the Protocol Owned Vault. If we can get revenue to 80 million per year, and reduce costs to 25 million per year, that gives us a yearly surplus of 55 million. The current version of the Protocol Owned Vault Emulation MIP specifies a leverage of 1.8x, which means we would be able to use this cashflow to accumulate almost 100 million USD worth of Staked ETH per year. Add to that that there is still more Dai demand available to allocate into higher yielding opportunities, and that with the Endgame Plan we would begin driving Dai demand through MetaDAO yield farming, our changes of accumulating a decently sized protocol owned vault over the next 3 years are looking good.

ChrisBlec:  I absolutely reject the premise of what\u2019s being proposed here and I am also now thinking that we should discuss a proposal to offboard Growth CU. Growth CU\u2019s incentives do not seem to be aligned with decentralization nor with the long-term survival of Maker.   This is a bit of knee-jerk reaction wouldn\u2019t you say? Maker also incentivises delegates, should we look to reduce delegate incentives based on how much opportunity they create?     ChrisBlec:  Maker needs to figure out how to get rid of the USDC as quickly as possible, it needs to cut costs dramatically and immediately, and it needs to develop a roadmap to full automation within 2 years.   True, cutting expense is one way, but we also need to generate more rev. What would you say the roadmap and items within look like?     pcfreak30:  @RoFz The benefits you get are exposing your ass further and going further away from crypto ethos to get more yield. That is really stupid.   Let\u2019s face it, IT IS about money. Show me one person who is willing to put in the work for zero monetary return. All the drama that has unfolded inside is the DAO has been to grab cash, from upset aspiring facilitators who would happily badmouth Maker to anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with losing their valuable position that\u2019s making them a sweet bit of living.

This MIP takes on MakerDAO\u2019s intent to invest in short-term bonds, as formally expressed through MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-term Bonds. This proposal aims to use 1/3 of the USDC in the PSM to get Institutional Rewards in Coinbase Prime with up to 1.5% APY on USDC. Maker will pay no custody fees on USDC held with Coinbase Prime. An arranger selected by SF-001 will act as a permissioned actor on MakerDAO\u2019s Coinbase Prime account. The arranger will be responsible for ensuring all standard KYC and AML due diligence requirements; furthermore, they will be authorized to deposit and withdraw assets between the PSM and Coinbase so long as they\u2019re successfully onboarded and authenticated. USDC Institutional Rewards POC will be in effect until the end of 2022, and the final payment will be made in the subsequent month. Maker Governance has the complete ability to trigger a liquidation with a successful executive vote encoding an instruction to the authorized account users of the legal entity. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here. This MIP is eligible to enter the October Governance Cycle.  ",

Just to name a few. Good to see most of the comments thus far are positive. Coinbase has been a leader in the industry, since crypto\u2019s genesis, and continues to empower both centralized and decentralized communities. I am ok with the \u201crisk\u201d for the influx of cash. Coinbase is a legit counter-party, forced to adhere to strict reporting standards. There is always a risk of bankruptcy - but does the return outweigh the risk? IMO, the answer, in this case, is yes. Furthermore, it helps legitimize MakerDAO with US regulators - bringing awareness to DAI and establishing a greater relationship with a policy-leading organization. @dbkcan seemed to best outline the proposal - as well as the chart from @SebVentures, both great resources to better understand where this all fits within our current structure. Agreed with this in reaction to initial excitement about no longer a need to \u201ccut costs:\u201d     rune:  That doesn\u2019t mean we should keep splurging on the current badly structured version of the Decentralized Workforce   A nice kick in the butt and an opportunity for Maker to capitalize on a similar risk profile.

This means the ERC20 that is DAI, would free float to the collateral basket and need to be migrated.

By keeping USDC onchain, at Coinbase, they are able to earn a return on the FIAT backing the collateral. If MKR converts the USDC to anything else (Bonds or USD) that would trigger withdrawals from USDC - Fiat collateral thus reducing their revenue. So its essentially Coinbase/Circle sharing some of those returns with Maker for providing them stability. ",

Hope is not a strategy for success in managing our business here. We will have the Lehman anniversary in 8 days and as some of you know I was a lawyer for the commodities & energy trading business in the belly of that beast. So, I must dis-abuse anyone who thinks a large public firm going under is not something to really worry too much about.   Of course it\u2019s possible.  In fact, that\u2019s why I referenced the fact that they lost a billion dollars in a quarter.  It\u2019s extremely possible.  What I\u2019m saying is that public companies are more regulated and should theoretically provide more transparency.  This is a good thing and helps decisions down the road.  But yes, there are many examples of public companies that have misled the public so your point is not without merit.  I guess it all comes down to a question of risk and trust which really is the root of many, many discussions on these forums. If MKR wants to get rid of all the expensive RWA efforts and just go back to simple roots of cryptocollateral without a PSM, I think the protocol could survive quite well.  Sure you\u2019ll have stability issues that might undermine some DAI demand but limiting all your collateral to decentralized crypto solves all your trust issues. However, with the PSMs, the RWA exposure, the larger workforce we\u2019ve created a protocol that\u2019s much larger in scope, ambition, and unfortunately exposure to centralized counterparties.  So I\u2019ve accepted the RWA plan and to me that means finding a way to transition while you\u2019re figuring it all out.  With RWA the surplus buffer matters greatly in how much you can scale to meet DAI demand.  That\u2019s why I focus on profitability.  Because in order to reduce reliance on USDC, you need to lend and in order to lend safely, you need more money in the SB, and in order to get a bigger SB, you have to take a little bit of risk.  How much risk is the question we\u2019ll never stop arguing but the reward here is quite appealing and let\u2019s not forget that it scales up and down with PSM size.  Ultimately, we want yield from better and more diversified products\u2026this just helps us get there. In terms of what happens in the Coinbase bankruptcy scenario, actually I agree with you.  I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything reckless.  I fully support due diligence and looking for guarantees that even in a bankruptcy scenario, MKR would be able to receive its funds back.  Again, I think Coinbase being a public company helps you in those analyses. ",

This is a separate topic to whether Maker wants to become a bank or not.       fumoffuXx:  So essentially, CB is arbitrage with interest rate hikes? Taking USDC from MAKERDAO and withdrawing for cash to buy into FD or T-Bonds? If thats the case why do we need a middle man?   Just to address these questions, the main benefit I see to this proposal is the promised liquidity.  MKR plans to invest a portion of its USDC in short term treasuries themselves, however you can\u2019t invest all of it because treasuries aren\u2019t meant to be immediately withdrawn.  Coinbase is promising 6 minute withdrawals of USDC which allows MKR to generate yield from the remaining USDC held in the PSMs without compromising the ability for the PSMs to exchange USDC for DAI when called upon.

                    "content": "Overall this is a well thought out proposal and I really appreciate the thoughtful discussion!  While there may not currently be consensus on whether Pigeon Stance and USDC are the best for DAI, assuming some of the bankruptcy and regulatory risks are no different than the status quo, this aligns with the Pigeon Stance proposal and is a no brainer in that regard. My personal view is there should be a governance vote on whether RWA should continue and/or the MIPS related to the EndGame timeline prior to a vote on MIP81. Across the forum posts there is a real split among delegates and stakeholders as to whether USDC collateral should be retained and this is leaking in to all the discussions. To move forward in a productive way, I think it would be best to vote on that specific issue and put it to bed to ensure better alignment on MIP81 and any future MIPS.  Further Questions on MIP81     CodeKnight:  \u201cWhats in it for Coinbase?\u201d   This was my major question as well. I think @CB_Institutional answered most of the other questions well here, here and here. The only other questions I have remaining are: 1. What happens to those funds in the event of a Coinbase, Coinbase Custody International and/or Circle bankruptcy? For Circle (as described here)  Money transmission laws provide that Circle maintains legal title to the USDC reserves, but does not have an equitable interest, unlike a bank or exchange or an unregulated institution. This distinction matters. USDC reserves are assets that belong to USDC holders, not Circle, and are wholly held in segregated accounts designated \u201cfor the benefit of USDC holders.\u201d Circle is not allowed to use the USDC reserves for any other purpose. Unlike a bank or an exchange or an unregulated institution, we cannot lend them out, we cannot borrow against them, and we cannot use them to pay our bills. In the most unlikely and extreme stress case of a Circle bankruptcy, segregated USDC reserves should remain redeemable at face value, shielded from Circle creditors, and separated from a bankruptcy estate per the protections afforded under state money transmission laws (e.g., Section 651 of the New York Banking Law) and applicable federal bankruptcy laws (ask your bankruptcy counsel about the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541(b)(1) and 541(d)). To be clear - the USDC reserves are separate from the rest of Circle\u2019s business and operations and are protected by laws and regulations.  Does this custody relationship mean that Coinbase or Coinbase Custody International would be the beneficiary? Would Maker (via a legal entity)? Would it be DAI holders or MKR holders?     Traster_Tray:  in a bankruptcy scenario, as a debt holder, MKR would be first in line to receive its funds back.   Not a lawyer, but I\u2019m not 100% convinced this is the case. As we\u2019re seeing with Voyager and Celsius, the more intermediaries there are, the more complex the rightful beneficiary chain gets if there is a bankruptcy. Especially depending on the terms and the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy proceeding. I\u2019m unsure if this Maker \u2192 CBI \u2192 CB \u2192 Circle layering jeopardizes that or actually further insulates Maker\u2019s risk. More details needed here and I would recommend an independent legal opinion alongside a response from @CB_Institutional. 2. DAI Sanctions or Security Classification Risk (as better described by @0xbocaJ below )     0xbocaJ:  how would you treat our deposits if (I) another user of DAI was added to the OFAC sanctions list, (II) the PSM address or another address closely associated with this deal were added to the list, or (III) a major MKR holder or governance related address were added to the list?   The same questions could be posed if the SEC decides to rule DAI a security. What happens then? 3. Does this change the regulatory capture of DAI or MKR? As discussed here, DAI or MKR holders having a claim to an interest bearing asset (yield on USDC) may constitute an investment contract and therefore increase the likelihood that MKR and/or DAI are classified as a security. My personal view (not a lawyer) is this increases the likelihood of DAI being classified as a security or derivative and then question #2 above applies. 4. What insurance coverage is there for $1.6B? What would it cover? My understanding is that no one in the crypto industry has an insurance tower to cover this much value in crypto, in either hot or cold. Unless self insurance is occurring\u2026 While FDIC only covers up to $250k (if structured correctly) from my understanding Circle is trying to split fiat deposits across different banks to maximize this coverage and reduce counterparty risk at the bank level. While that\u2019s a pittance compared to $1.6B I\u2019m curious if parking $1.6B in USDC with CBI adds additional protection or negates it. Further clarification would be great!   Cases for rejecting MIP81 Apart from the risks associated with the outstanding questions above, I see 2 higher level questions that impact the acceptance of this MIP and haven\u2019t really been adequately addressed.   Is there alignment on the End Game Pigeon Stance strategy around using USDC and other RWA to generate more protocol owned value? If not, then this should obviously be rejected.   Can Maker do this better and reduce counter-party/regulatory risk by putting treasury to work directly? Even if it can, would that align with the long term decentralized goal? If the answer to both of these questions is \u201cyes\u201d then it should be rejected in favour of Maker being more vertically integrated.   The second set of questions is dependent on the outcome of the first, hence why I think it\u2019s best to get consensus on Pigeon Stance first.  On More Vertical Integration of RWA @Arby articulates the same thing I\u2019ve been hinting at in other forum posts      Arby:  may I ask why the need for a middleman? Maker as a DAO has sufficient presence within the space to incorporate itself in a much more favourable jurisdiction than that offered by Coinbase? If MakerDAO was forced to choose a jurisdiction in which to incorporate and asset selection for 1.6B of exposure, I would assume that a better decision could be made. This is a separate topic to whether Maker wants to become a bank or not.   If the plan during Pigeon Stance is to do RWA and maximally grow revenues over a three year period, then why not set up a regulatory compliant entity for 3 years to interface directly with a bank, reduce  counter-party risk and increase revenue? This would likely also reduce your regulatory risk because you\u2019ll have to be vetted and approved by the bank\u2019s compliance teams and have a proper legal and custody structure to undertake the yield earning opportunities without having to worry about the risk of a rapid shut down from being classified as a security. This has the potential to make the Pigeon Stance period longer and more flexible. Since it seems a legal formation will be required to execute this MIP and the expectation is that funds don\u2019t need to be super liquid anyway, it seems like this option should be considered if Pigeon Stance MIP is approved.  Once an entity is set up, Maker could redeem the $1.6B USDC via Circle and take the USD to multiple reputable banking partners outside the US to hedge risk. You\u2019d be able get better interest rates via more direct T-Bill, Money Market fund or Eurodollar lending exposure. I can introduce to reputable banks that would gladly do this for a portion of the $1.6B. The downside to this is it may take longer and be more work than MIP81 to execute and unwind if Eagle Stance were activated.  In Summary I think it is great to at least see this proposal exist! Even if it doesn\u2019t materialize, it has very quickly surfaced a thoughtful discussion on the pros/cons which can be used to guide future MIPS and decisions. I appreciate @rune commenting on how he thinks it aligns with the End Game because initially it seemed to be slightly divergent than what has been discussed in other MIPS and governance posts.  I\u2019m still of the belief that DAI has the potential to split the difference between how USDC and USDT operate, and be a better alternative to both (more decentralized and more transparent/automated). There is more than one way to skin a cat and this could be an important step along this journey but a few more details are needed and I think we need to vote on other End Game MIPS first. Looking forward to seeing more details  ",

It sounds like the USDC would be held in segregated accounts, but in which entity\u2019s name? Also, if it is right that \u201cgovernance can choose to transfer assets off-platform [\u2026] almost instantaneously in USDC (<6 mins)\u201d, are they really in secure cold storage? Overall, I am stoked to see this proposal and grateful for the parties on each side responsible for setting this up.

This conjecture by @TRUEMAKER makes sense given that CB will keep the USDC onchain (but custody in cold storage). There is no burning of USDC for fiat here, just a rev share (investment returns from USDC\u2019s fiat backing) between the two from which Maker has a cut. Strategically, this could be a defence to Binance\u2019s recent USDC ban (a day before this MIP). ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m trying to understand the economic rationale for this proposal. Clearly the core team needs money to operate this protocol that is foundational for crypto; I just don\u2019t understand how this proposal is good for Maker. Finance is essentially about return and risk. A quick look at alternative returns shows that Maker could get 2.31% in the overnight repo market, or $36.96 million annually. Compared to the $22.5 million offered by Coinbase, this leaves $14.46 million in lost revenues to Maker. But, actually, risk needs to be taken into account, so this return is too low since Coinbase isn\u2019t as secure as lending to the US government. Coinbase has a junk rating (S&P BB with a negative outlook). So, it is better to compare similar expected returns for BB credits. In this case, an investor would demand a 4.92% return (not the 2.31% demanded if lending to the US government). This would mean that a BB borrower would pay $78.75 million per year. By going with Coinbase and not what is available in the market, Maker would be losing $56.25 million per year. Actually, it is worse than that. Bond holders are in a secure position, at the top of the liquidity preference in the event of insolvency. With Coinbase, Maker\u2019s deposit is unsecured. Meaning that all other lenders to Coinbase would have a preferential distribution in bankruptcy. So, unsecured lenders would ask more than 4.92% for taking on this additional risk. But, it is actually worse than that. Bond documents set out a use of funds. So, for example, you have to use funds to build a plant. With Coinbase, there is no use of funds clause. Actually, depositors don\u2019t have use of funds protection rights; Coinbase can do whatever they want with deposited funds. It isn\u2019t clear to me how they generate the returns or what the use of funds are, but it seems like a traditional finance prime brokerage type operation, where Maker\u2019s funds would be loaned out to counter-parties of Coinbase. So, there is a further credit risk, but this cannot be evaluated. You don\u2019t know and you just need to trust them (even if Coinbase is an impressive organization). I see that the proposal is a response to MIP13c3-SP12. This is about investing in short-term bonds. It seems misleading to suggest that this proposal satisfies a resolution to invest in bonds, as bonds have a very different risk profile than an unsecured deposit in Coinbase. In reality, bonds would give Maker a much safer risk exposure and much higher returns. I\u2019m not a Maker insider and I find the Maker terminology extremely hard to understand. I just don\u2019t know why anyone would even consider a proposal like this. From a finance perspective, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Maker can do much better. But, I must be missing something. Maybe someone can help. I\u2019m actually thinking of making an alternative proposal about how Maker can earn revenue while keeping to a decentralized philosophy (and align risk and return). I see DAI as so fundamental to a healthy crypto industry. But, if I have got my analysis wrong, maybe someone can help me before I waste my time. I\u2019m also not an insider, like I said, and if proposals can only come from insiders who can figure out the terminology I won\u2019t bother. I\u2019ve seen some comments about holding USDC in treasury being the same as accepting Coinbase\u2019s proposal. Legally, this is completely untrue. An asset that you own and have possession of is completely different than depositing (unsecured lending) that asset. Essentially, you go from owning the asset to legally transferring title (ownership) of that asset to someone else. If you hold it you are the owner. If you lend it, you are an unsecured creditor and Coinbase owns it. I also don\u2019t understand the principle of DeFi going to TradFi to get returns. Isn\u2019t the whole principle of DeFi that it offers better returns than TradFi, so TradFi will come to DeFi? If DeFi has to go to TradFi for yield, what is the point of DeFi? If this proposal were to be accepted, wouldn\u2019t DAI just become a digitally wrapped version of the US dollar? A much worse version, since it comes with higher risk and lower returns. Maybe someone can tell me where I\u2019m wrong, so I don\u2019t waste my time with an alternative proposal. Here is a quick analysis I did.

MIP65 is also very scalable and would likely get closer to market rate, but it seems to me like it will not be nearly as convenient as this when it comes to redeploying the money elsewhere. Right now we should be more focused on how much of the idle USDC we can deploy, rather than how high we can squeeze the rates. Once all of it is properly deployed into something that pays any kind of safe yield and can be easily withdrawn again, then it starts to make sense to increase the yield further by optimizing in smaller chunks with things that are a bit more complicated. This proposal, based on my current understanding of it, is basically as simple as it gets: \u201cget rev share of the USDC collateral\u201d. Will be interesting to see the review of the question of bankruptcy protection - though even if it is indeed unsecured credit as some are claiming I think it is worth it to get the yield until we get something safer. The worst outcome is to keep sitting around with billions of USDC doing nothing. ",

                    "content": "@RobertSharrat, your analysis takes the perspective that it is a secured loan. Under this assumption, your conclusions are probably valid - i.e. not enough return given the risk profile of Coinbase. However, as I understand it, this will not be structured as a secured loan arrangement; there will be no loan agreements or security -  and Coinbase is not being provided loan proceeds to do as they choose. Instead, Maker would fund a Real World trust that would solely take direction from Maker token holders and will be approved to deal with Coinbase concerning the management and opening of a Coinbase Prime Account and the movement of funds to the trading/custody account from the PSM. Given this, and until the proposal has been explored in further detail and more information on structure determined - I think it is premature to conclude anything about the adequacy of the proposed rewards. As I understand it, the Coinbase Prime Account - generally provides two sub-accounts 1) a trading account (I assume some hot wallet) and 2) a Custody account provided by Coinbase Custody International - which is supposedly a segregated custody account - which Maker would have sole control over - i.e. Coinbase cannot touch or move these funds only Maker (or, possibly a bankruptcy court, in the case of a Coinbase bankruptcy based on the intended legal nature of the proposed arrangements). Regarding risk, each month\u2019s rewards will be paid by Coinbase Inc. based on the balances in the Coinbase Prime accounts.  So assuming an aggregate balance of ($1.6 bn).  The risk for this stream of reward income would be approx. US2mm per month. If this is not paid or it appears that it will not be paid, Maker would be free to move the entire balance out of Coinbase - which would take approximately 6 minutes from when an instruction is given. The critical risk issue is concerning any underlying USDC balance we have in Coinbase Custody - if we cannot get an opinion that in a bankruptcy scenario, Maker Funds would not be segregated from other Coinbase unsecured creditors - then the risk of being able to withdraw under this scenario is a Coinbase Inc. risk - in which case some of the arguments you are making about the yield not being sufficient may be valid. However, if we can\u2019t get adequate legal comfort on the nature of the custodial arrangement  - maybe there are technical ways some of Maker\u2019s concerns could be addressed that meet the objectives of both parties, which could be further explored. For example, what if a smart contract can be developed to hold funds in the Coinbase Custody account that automatically returned funds to Maker\u2019s PSM -  in the event of non-payment of rewards by a specific date? Or under this smart contract, Coinbase is only permissioned to move funds to the PSM and Maker approved addresses - so they retain control (but limited to Makers approved addresses). If such an arrangement were possible and automated, it would be a different risk profile - where the proposed rewards might be an attractive return for the risk profile. All the preceding are likely worth exploring by the entity that becomes the arranger/maker\u2019s real-world trust administrator and Maker specialists. But it would probably require an underlying understanding of the technical nature of Coinbase Custody arrangements and any APIs in place to manage those funds. So, ignoring the debate over whether Maker should be interacting with the real world, I think it would be remiss at this time to make any conclusions about whether the risk-return profile is acceptable - until we have a better understanding from risk and technical specialists about what exactly is the risk profile of this proposed arrangement.     RobertSharratt:  I see that the proposal is a response to MIP13c3-SP12. This is about investing in short-term bonds. It seems misleading to suggest that this proposal satisfies a resolution to invest in bonds, as bonds have a very different risk profile than an unsecured deposit in Coinbase. In reality, bonds would give Maker a much safer risk exposure and much higher returns.   Concerning the above, you are correct that the above MIP was about investing in bonds - the context and motivation being to redeploy the approx. US$4bn USDC sitting in the PSM and earning no income for Maker. In that respect, this proposal is somewhat related to the motivation behind the referenced MIP. It is perhaps something that could be implemented in the short term as it will take some time to off-board Maker\u2019s stablecoin balance and redeploy to a bond trading operation - let alone ensure we have the required treasury management personnel to manage a bond portfolio/several portfolios.

If concepts like treasuries or the repo market come on-chain some day, then a lot of the friction would go away.  But right now, in order to get access to yields and be able to lend, you have to either lend DAI collateralized by crypto on-chain or go through third parties and buy bond etfs or handle the lending process.  All of the third party stuff takes a lot of work with cuts taken by every middleman in the process.  Coinbase is offering something as close to the overnight repo as we can get and removing a lot of that work for Maker (in fact, seemingly even more liquid which is what Maker needs).  Yes, they\u2019re going to take a substantial cut.  But I would say it\u2019s worth it to allow Maker\u2019s workforce to focus on other types of collateral. Fleshing out the bankruptcy risks is important but at least Coinbase seems well capitalized for now.  They lost 1.1 billion last quarter but 446 million of that was a one time impairment loss from the crash in prices.  Since then there has been talk of cost cutting as well so one would project future losses to be smaller.  From their past earnings call - \u2026 we did set a guardrail that if we went into a winter that we would operate to a $500 million loss. Based on that statement and their 6.2 billion in cash, they should be able to operate fine for at least a few years before having to raise more capital or cut costs further. ",

If Maker decided to convert the USDC to any other liquid invesment, then Coinbase/Circle would lose out on 100% of those revenues since USDC would be sold for USD. In anticipation of MKR investing its assets (i.e. USDC) they are passing some of that revenue to us and in the way keeping at least some of the revenue. I would compare this program to a deposit and not a secured/unsecured lending transaction. Excess deposits at bank are not lent, and the bank is earning interest in the interbank market and passing some of that interest to its depositors. ",

If there were a way to go from DAI in crypto directly into a bank account in the real world, there would be no need to pass by Coinbase. That is what scares them: that the Maker community finds a way to access normal yields in the traditional space and therefore not to be beholden to Coinbase to exchange from crypto to fiat. I guess a bigger question is: why do these exchanges have to exist? In my analysis, the opportunity cost of putting $1.6 billion with Coinbase is a loss to the Maker token holders of $56.25 million per year. Also, on a technical point: bank deposits are also legally unsecured loans to the bank. They are often protected by capped depositor insurance, but they are a transfer of title to the bank. You can see it in banks\u2019 balance sheets: deposits are an asset (owned by them). The IOU is a bank account, which is a liability of the bank. ",

For sure the core team should not be doing financial engineering; they should be focused on building Maker. And, I agree that they need money right away to operate this fundamental protocol. I think that this issue raises an existential issue for crypto: if you cannot easily move from the on-chain world to the traditional world, what is the point of crypto? If you cannot spend your DAI to buy coffee (or invest in bonds), how is it going to change the world? Same the other way: if you want to buy DAI with USD why is it so hard? I recently bought just over $500,00 worth of DAI. I have an institutional account at Genesis Global Trading and my tech team has integrated their APIs. Confirming the trade took seconds. Great. But, then we have to wire them the money through the traditional banking system. I bought on the Friday before Labor Day and the wire didn\u2019t get to their US bank from us here in Switzerland until Tuesday, because of the holiday. I had set up an experimental DAI - digital dollar pool on Balancer on Arbitrum, so people could buy DAI directly from their bank account with us using fiat currency. And it ran out of DAI, as so many people on-ramped (selling fiat currency to buy DAI, so we had no DAI left). I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to continue with it, as the process is such a hassle. Imagine if to access the internet you had to go through some centralized choke point every time. That is basically what Coinbase, Binance, etc are and it is the biggest impediment to crypto adoption, I think.

Same the other way: if you want to buy DAI with USD why is it so hard?   I can disagree with your point of view with the utmost respect and answer your questions. The main point of a cryptocurrency is very simple \u201cno centralized institutional dependency\u201d is the biggest fear of the traditional financial system, that cryptocurrencies are really what they were created for, that in the course of that thought of anarchy has been diverted is something else. The use of a P2P market using DAI does not depend specifically on Maker, but on the performance of the user if at the moment he needs to use a stable currency or not, I give an example of countries with emerging economies such as Argentina or Venezuela that always try to change their currency local to dollars and as the cash restriction is notable to buy stable currencies, including DAI, so he thought of the user if you high DAI to create a P2P market for the purchases and sales of products, that MakerDAO can help a little more adoption quickly, yes of course, but it will be exclusively up to the user if he uses DAI or USDT to protect his capital, and as I say in the same way, the change from DAI to USD is very simple in emerging countries because they need it, stable currencies will not be used in globally until the traditional system becomes obsolete as happened in the countries mentioned above. So if it can change the world, the point is that they need to pay much more attention in countries where they really need to use a stable currency as an exchange and not just as a loan guarantee. ",

                    "content": "This is all great discussion and analysis but we\u2019re kind of bike-shedding at this point.  Apologies for repeating myself but I think there are two questions that need to be resolved before this moves forward: 1. Should Maker continue to have RWA exposure? More specifically, USDC exposure? @rune makes the case for \u201cyes\u201d in Pigeon Stance and previous MIPs have already been approved that say \u201cyes\u201d, but there is clearly a lot of contention on these two points. @rune would you or someone from Governance CU be willing to put this up for a vote in order to streamline future discussions?    Endgame Approval MIP Set - next steps   I have been working on the MIPs and will post most of them in a few hours. Any that remain will be posted tomorrow to ensure they all can enter RFC and be edited to completion in time for the October voting cycle.   Have yet to see these MIPs (apologies if missed them). Not trying to be pushy but IMHO putting this issue to bed will greatly increase execution efficiency and seems like the logical next step while we wait for @CB_Institutional to respond.  2. If yes, does MIP81 have a better risk reward profile than the current way PSM USDC is held? As many have already articulated, addressing concerns around loss of funds in the event of bankruptcy/loss in the custody/issuer chain and/or the implications in the event a sanctions or securities ruling occurs against DAI/MKR is critical to making a fair assessment here. If the proposed arrangement with Coinbase doesn\u2019t materially differ from the status quo in these scenarios and there is consensus on the proposed Pigeon Stance plan, then I agree with @rune here - lack of action is objectively worse than acting.     rune:  FWIW I think it is quite likely that we can find better deals elsewhere over time - but there is no doubt to me that this is the only deal available to us that can be scaled to a billion+ within a relatively short amount of time. MIP65 is also very scalable and would likely get closer to market rate, but it seems to me like it will not be nearly as convenient as this when it comes to redeploying the money elsewhere. Right now we should be more focused on how much of the idle USDC we can deploy, rather than how high we can squeeze the rates. Once all of it is properly deployed into something that pays any kind of safe yield and can be easily withdrawn again, then it starts to make sense to increase the yield further by optimizing in smaller chunks with things that are a bit more complicated.   Earning ~150bps with Coinbase vs. 0 with Circle is clearly better than the status quo if all risks are considered equal. If this is the case, MIP81 should have unanimous support from the camp that supports RWA and USDC because there is only upside compared to the existing risk profile. While there may be other RWA opportunities that provide a better yield (which there are few MIPs), this would very clearly move faster than any other option. My suggestion is that anyone with concrete alternatives put forward their own MIP as opposed to further polluting this thread. I will submit a draft once I\u2019ve seen a vote that determines how much current support there is for continued RWA and/or USDC support. If there isn\u2019t enough support, all this is just a waste of everyone\u2019s time.  Speaking from experience dealing with many TradFi firms, regulators, and banks with regards to crypto-assets, a crypto-native institution like Coinbase will move way faster than one that is crypto curious because they already understand the technology, the risks and have the operational expertise. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing details on the aforementioned issues and contract terms so we can put to a vote ASAP. Time is not on our side with currently proposed MIP\u2026     CB_Institutional:  USDC Institutional Rewards POC will be in effect until the end of 2022, and the final payment will be made on the subsequent month.   Lots of people are excited about the idea of earning X millions per year, but there seems to be an assumption that this is a multi-year deal. Unless there are private discussions happening that contradict the original proposal, MIP81 is presently only until the end of 2022, which is effectively only 3 months of yield (maybe) if this slots into the October voting cycle. Realistically, we\u2019re squabbling over just $6MM in USDC rewards, which is going to start decreasing as soon as October 1, 2022 is hit unless the USDC is in Coinbase custody. $6MM in protocol revenue is not nothing but is not the $23MM+ that previous comments are touting. The longer this discussion goes on, without an extension into 2023, the risk/reward profile changes rapidly. As each day passes we\u2019ll end up closer to the same spot we\u2019re currently in - $0 in revenue with the same USDC risk profile. To make this worth anyone\u2019s time we should have responses/opinions on the custody & default risk ASAP or the proposal gets extended beyond 2022.     CB_Institutional:  Institutional Rewards in 2023 and beyond may be variable and updated for all participating clients on a periodic basis. To your point, this means it is possible that the APR will fluctuate in the future, and potentially rewards will become higher, or lower than 1.5%. Of course, all changes will be communicated with reasonable advance notice.   @CB_Institutional eluded to this being a possibility, so it would also be good if they can comment on the likelihood of extension and the terms/conditions of that. Patiently awaiting End Game MIPs and more details\u2026  ",

Coinbase funds the inventory from its own purchases of USDC from Circle, from purchases of USDC from users of the Coinbase platform, and from payments that Coinbase receives pursuant to its revenue sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of USDC.   Thanks - can you clarify this further? Coinbase won\u2019t be converting Maker\u2019s USDC to cash or t-bills or anything at all (USDC will be held as USDC), and Coinbase has an \u201cinventory of USDC\u201d that it uses to pay rewards to incentivize institutional custody. Is this another way of saying that the rewards earned by Maker will be paid out of Coinbase\u2019s corporate coffers? What benefit does Coinbase gain from this deal? Also, @CB_Institutional can you provide some sort of legal note, put up a bond, etc to guarantee that Coinbase will never lock up or seize MakerDAO\u2019s USDC collateral for any reason whatsoever? Assuming you can\u2019t do this, can you please explain why you believe that MakerDAO entrusting $1.6 billion to Coinbase is a smart move? Thanks - appreciate the dialog.   I\u2019m bumping my entire post for visibility. I know that these are difficult questions but they\u2019re also vital questions so I\u2019m going to have to insist that @CB_Institutional answer them. A. What benefit(s) does Coinbase derive from this arrangement? Please list them all. B. Can Coinbase provide any sort of guarantee to Maker that all funds will be returned upon demand, even in the face of pressure from a government or state actor? Does Coinbase have any concern about the fact that Maker is unable to comply with OFAC sanctions? ",

Centre invests the assets backing USDC in low-risk investments, makes A%, (indirectly) shares A-B=C% with Coinbase, then Coinbase shares C-D=E% with Maker. If instead Maker redeems $100 MM in USDC for USD (for demonstration purposes), then Centre has $100 MM less than before = bad for them. B: this is effectively impossible to promise. Suppose law enforcement wanted to break into the data centers and seize the private keys, then what? Practically, there is regulator risk by just being a USDC holder, but being an account holder incrementally increases regulatory exposure. Coinbase surely wouldn\u2019t promise to give a middle finger to all regulators, nor would Maker have a recourse if they reneged on that. ",

                    "content": "Hi Everyone, Thank you for your thoughtful comments and dialogue. It\u2019s exciting to see so many community members committed to finding the right solution for MakerDAO, and we want to help you achieve your goals by offering a secure, low-risk means of generating value on a portion of the assets otherwise sitting idle in the PSM. We appreciate that not everyone in the community shares the same vision; as such, we\u2019ll aim to empower your discourse with facts. There seems to be some misconceptions about the structure of this deal and its risk profile, so we\u2019d like to clarify those points, then address some broader themes.   Deal structure: Some commentators have speculated that Coinbase would control Maker\u2019s assets or erroneously assumed there is some type of \u201cloan\u201d arrangement. This is not a loan and there is no unsecured lending proposed here. We do not control your assets. This is a proposal to transfer ~1.6B USDC to Coinbase Prime which will earn a 1.5% reward. The assets would remain under the sole discretion of Maker. Coinbase will NOT sell, transfer, loan, rehypothecate, or otherwise alienate client assets credited to the client\u2019s Trading Account or Coinbase Custody wallet unless explicitly instructed to do so. Assets held in our vaulted solutions are held in segregated accounts, specifically named on behalf of the client owner.   Risk profile: There seems to be a misconception that holding USDC in custody at Coinbase adds risk. There\u2019s two components to consider here: a) the inherent risk of USDC, and b) any incremental risk associated with holding USDC at Coinbase.     a) Just like Maker and Circle, Coinbase complies with the applicable law, which includes sanctions implemented by OFAC. This is why Coinbase is restricted from interacting with wallets that are designated by OFAC on its Specially Designated Nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) List and must take certain action if it comes in possession of assets belonging to such wallets. In general, this will only become an issue if the PSM wallet address interacting with Coinbase becomes designated by OFAC or is somehow associated with a sanctioned actor.   We also want to highlight that Coinbase shares the same interests and values as many in the Maker community regarding economic freedom and technology as a form of free speech - and views the TC sanctions as a threat to DeFi and web3. Specifically, Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions of the Tornado Cash smart contracts. See more here and here about how we are standing with the broader crypto community.   b) A main purpose of Custody is to provide additional safety and security for assets. From a risk standpoint, Coinbase is one of the largest and most trusted crypto custodians. Assets stored in the Coinbase Vault storage solution are secured by a comprehensive system that goes beyond consumer grade hardware wallets and is comprised of physical security, consensus computation, and strict process controls. Custody vault wallets combine cold storage and multiparty computation technologies. Our systems are designed for multi-user operations, ensuring that no individual or small group can act maliciously or be coerced into executing unauthorized transactions and instructions. We offer battle tested security measures which include but are not limited to 2FA YubiKey hardware, video call approval for cold storage withdrawals, activity logs, multi-user consensus approval for sensitive actions, and more.   Coinbase offers some of the broadest and deepest insurance coverage in the crypto industry under a program it has run continuously since 2013. Coinbase offers clients coverage through Commercial Crime ($320M) and Cyber Crime ($3M) insurance policies. The Commercial Crime insurance program covers both cold and hot storage assets held by Coinbase Global, Inc. (\u201cCoinbase Global\u201d) and all its subsidiaries. Fwiw, since our inception in 2013, we\u2019ve never been hacked - while various smart contracts have been.   As for the broader themes, I\u2019ll address these in an FAQ format: 1. Q) What happens to Maker\u2019s assets in the event of a Coinbase bankruptcy? A) You are smart to be concerned about your assets. So are we. The best protection for this, is knowing that the possibility of a Coinbase bankruptcy is highly unlikely. We have a strong balance sheet, audited financials, and are a public reporting company that provides this information publicly here. Our Chief Legal Officer also provided a blog post on this matter, available here. But, we understand: trust - but verify. We place great importance on safeguarding crypto assets we custody and protecting them from the claims of our general creditors. Our client agreements are explicit that Coinbase does not have a property interest in the digital assets we hold for customers. We believe that digital assets held by Coinbase would not be considered Coinbase\u2019s property and would not be subject to the claims of our creditors. Specifically, the contractual terms between the parties provide that digital assets held in custody with Coinbase Custody International Limited (CCI) are held in a segregated custody account, segregated from the assets held by CCI as principal and the assets of other customers of CCI, and will not be treated as general assets of CCI. The parties also agree that the client digital assets constitute custodial assets and client property and are held by CCI in trust for the client. On this basis, we believe a court will conclude that there is a trust relationship between CCI and the client and, therefore, assets held on trust would not form part of the estate of CCI upon the insolvency of CCI. Further, with regard to assets held in custody at Coinbase Inc. under the contractual terms between the parties, they agree that digital assets held by Coinbase will be treated as \u201cfinancial assets\u201d under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d). UCC Article 8 provides that financial assets held by Coinbase are not property of Coinbase and not subject to the claims of its general creditors. In light of UCC Article 8, we believe that a court would not treat custodied crypto assets as part of our general estate; however, due to the novelty of crypto assets, courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied crypto assets. 2. Q) How secure are our assets / is our USDC going to be at Coinbase? A) Assets will be held at Coinbase Prime with vaulted assets held at Coinbase Custody International and trading balance assets held at Coinbase, Inc. All Client assets held at Coinbase Prime are treated as custodial assets. This means Coinbase has a duty to safekeep and protect these assets on behalf of its clients. Coinbase Custody International, a private company limited by shares and incorporated under the laws of Ireland, is not registered or licensed in any jurisdiction. Coinbase Custody International offers custodial services to clients in jurisdictions where registrations and/or licenses are not required to offer such services. Coinbase, Inc. is a registered money services business with FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, a licensed money transmitter in numerous U.S. states and territories, a licensee under New York State Department of Financial Services\u2019 Virtual Currency Business Activity Regime, commonly referred to as a BitLicense. Assets held in our vaulted solutions are held in segregated accounts, specifically named on behalf of the client owner. Client assets cannot be deemed as Coinbase assets and are not subject to any claims from Coinbase creditors. No Coinbase entity will sell, transfer, loan, rehypothecate, or otherwise alienate client assets credited to the client\u2019s Trading Account or Coinbase Custody wallet unless explicitly instructed to do so. Within Prime Trading Balance, Coinbase keeps the majority of assets in cold storage to maximize security and manages the percentage of assets kept in hot wallets to facilitate rapid withdrawals. The percentage of assets maintained in cold versus hot storage is determined by ongoing risk analysis and market dynamics. Factors that impact rebalancing include insurance coverage, client activity, and market activity. We seek to ensure client liquidity needs are balanced with optimizing assets in the most secure storage possible for those needs. All assets held within the Prime Vault Custody are kept in a 100% offline cold storage environment. Coinbase Custody International offers the same industry leading crypto asset storage that has made Coinbase Custody the world\u2019s leading custodian. The international entity is designed to meet the needs of institutional investors in Europe. 3. Q) Where do the \u201crewards\u201d come from? A) The USDC that Coinbase uses to pay USDC Rewards comes from Coinbase\u2019s inventory of USDC. Coinbase funds the inventory from its own purchases of USDC from Circle, from purchases of USDC from users of the Coinbase platform, and from payments that Coinbase receives pursuant to its revenue sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of USDC. 4. Q) What assets back USDC Institutional Rewards? A) The USDC that Coinbase uses to pay USDC Rewards comes from Coinbase\u2019s inventory of USDC. Each USDC is backed by one dollar or asset with equivalent fair value, which is held in accounts with US regulated financial institutions. USDC Reserves are managed by Circle, the issuer of USDC.  Circle audits its financial statements annually in addition to monthly USDC Reserve attestation reports which are published on Circle\u2019s website showing the size and composition of the USDC Reserves. For more information, see USD Coin (USDC) | Crypto that\u2019s held to a higher standard | Circle. 5. Q) What does Coinbase get out of this partnership? A) Coinbase and Maker share a longstanding partnership that we value, as Jenn articulated. What\u2019s more, Coinbase is committed to supporting USDC initiatives given that we powered the launch of USDC by co-founding the Centre Consortium. We firmly believe that USDC is critical to bridging the gap between crypto and fiat, and understand that Maker, as the largest holder of USDC, is in need of a reliable, trusted, collaborative partner who can provide an on- and off-ramp to USDC at no cost. We also consistently seek out innovative ways to support and service DAOs and see this program as a model that potentially can be leveraged going forward. Coinbase Custody International (CCI), like all custody businesses, is also seeking to grow its custodied assets. Through this USDC Institutional Rewards program, CCI is able to partner and support a significant crypto market participant, MakerDAO, in further establishing itself as the industry leading crypto custodian. As some of you have correctly speculated, Coinbase is uniquely suited to streamline USD <> USDC conversion and onboarding. In fact, Coinbase is already facilitating frictionless execution of USDC initiatives at Maker. A great example is MakerDAO\u2019s move to invest $500M in bonds and treasuries - an entity representing MakerDAO is converting USDC <> USD through its Coinbase Prime account in order to execute the transaction. We offer instantaneous settlement (<6 mins), providing high liquidity and high-touch support to our partners. Some have argued that Maker should actively manage its PSM balances. Maker could go and purchase other assets (bonds, treasuries, overnight repo etc.). But, in doing so, Maker would incur heavy administrative and service fees that TradFi institutions extract. Additionally, there is liquidity friction inherent in traditional forms of settlement that is not present with USDC. Coinbase seeks to be a one-stop shop for supporting frictionless transactions across the entire horizon of MakerDAO\u2019s needs. 6. Q) What entity is being onboarded to represent Maker? A) Per guidance from the Maker Growth Core Unit and Maker Strategic Finance Core Unit, it is up to the discretion of Maker Governance to identify a suitable entity to onboard. We have a committed team of Institutional Onboarding specialists ready to assist and streamline the process for Maker. We handle all the heavy lifting so that Maker\u2019s core units can remain focused on strategic matters. ",

I personally don\u2019t have any more questions and my opinion doesn\u2019t materially differ than what I already wrote here. If Maker voters want to continue to earn yield from USDC in the PSM in alignment with the proposed Pigeon Stance this seems like a very good option considering the risks between the current situation and this proposal don\u2019t seem to be materially different, and there are only a few other RWA options at present. I for one feel that Brian and Coinbase are more likely to go to bat for Maker and DAI than most other orgs in the world and they are definitely better set up operationally and more mission aligned than any other TradFi company and even most crypto ones.  I\u2019ve voiced enough of my opinions as of late, and am a small vote that doesn\u2019t move the needle so I will be supportive of either direction with regards to maintaining USDC exposure or eliminating it. If USDC is  maintained and there isn\u2019t a concrete alternative proposal, I will support this MIP. No option is risk free and there are too many variables outside of our control to accurately predict outcomes. The highest risk option is indecision and stagnation that maintains the status quo. ",

If the DAI smart contract addresses or DAI or Maker itself are banned, DAI usage and circulating supply will significantly contract regardless of the collateral backing. Possibly the contraction is so severe that it kills DAI entirely. Maybe not. No one knows. One could argue that by working with multiple regulated entities that have capital and skin in the game, that risk to DAI decreases because it would have much more systemic risk if it failed or was banned. I made this case here. On the flip side, as I made the case above, this could also increase the likelihood of regulatory capture. The real answer is, no one knows. So instead of incessant debate about hypotheticals outside of our control, we should make decisions over things we can control, with the knowledge we have.  @pcfreak30 by all other posts of yours I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t want USDC backing and are for maximal censorship resistance and decentralization. Lots of others share your same viewpoint including many advocating for this MIP. I also align with you and feel conflicted. But constantly repeating the same thing is not helpful. This is why I made the case in other posts and will repeat here. Maker has 4 options:   Eliminate USDC and RWA ASAP and try to be as algorithmic and maximally decentralized and censorship resistant as possible;   Retain USDC and RWA and embrace regulation. Maybe rethink the notion of decentralization by becoming too big to fail and either forming its own regulated entities or working with existing ones.   Do both in parallel and hedge your bets. Keep current DAI decentralized and inline with option 1. Launch DAIv2 inline with option 2. People can work on the one they are most philosophically aligned with like a decentralized workforce should.   Do nothing.   I think most will agree option 4 is the worst. To me option 3 is the best. @rune is advocating for option 2 first and then option 1 later with his End Game plan. Because there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns with all of them, at some point you just gotta pick and roll with it.  \u201cThe enemy of progress is indecision\u201d  ",

It\u2019s clear you thoroughly read through the posts here and responses like these do help build a lot of trust in a community that really has a hard time with trust.     CB_Institutional:  In general, this will only become an issue if the PSM wallet address interacting with Coinbase becomes designated by OFAC or is somehow associated with a sanctioned actor.   This is probably going to be the most significant risk.  If OFAC directly sanctioned Makers holdings, they would be directly attacking the entire defi ecosystem.  I\u2019m more concerned with the association with a sanctioned actor part.  If this proposal goes through, maybe MKR should try to understand how this association would work.  If custodied assets really only interact with a MKR smart contract, perhaps the risk of being declared associated with sanctioned addresses is lower?  Well, we already have risk of OFAC sanctions through circle so to me, rejecting this proposal doesn\u2019t really change the risk calculus much (maybe you could say there\u2019s one less attack vector). As to the rest of this post, I think it does address bankruptcy concerns as it seems that Coinbase doesn\u2019t plan on doing anything with the usdc other than holding it for Maker.  They make the case that creditors shouldn\u2019t be able to go after custodied assets even in case of bankruptcy.  If that\u2019s how the courts interpret things, then Maker\u2019s custodied assets would seem pretty safe.  Unfortunately, that previous sentence did start with if.  Perhaps our lawyers can chime in with what stance courts might take in hypothetical bankruptcy proceedings. The big takeaway for me though - Coinbase actually does just want to do this to help out Maker.  A thriving defi ecosystem helps them and DAI is obviously a big part of that.  This could be a win-win deal. ",

The latest from Gensler in reaction to the Merge opens up a new front for our consideration! Should have seen this coming, but honestly I had not been thinking lately about how important (from a U.S. financial services legal perspective) is the core distinction between proof-of-work, characterized clearly as \u201ctrade or business,\u201d vs proof-of-stake, potentially more like an investment activity. This has sweeping implications. I look forward to hearing @CB_Institutional views on the SEC chair\u2019s statements quoted in this article and their comments on my numbered questions below:    WSJ    Ether\u2019s New \u2018Staking\u2019 Model Could Draw SEC Attention SEC chair says system used by ether following software update could trigger securities laws.        What has been Coinbase\u2019s internal discussion to date on how replacing Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Stake may change the regulatory analysis of whether ether is a commodity or an investment contract?   How does the Chairman\u2019s analysis map to Coinbase\u2019s current regulatory authority to offer the services/product proposed here?   If the characterization of ether changes from commodity to security because of its new proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, would this \u201ctaint\u201d all crypto assets operating on the Ethereum network?   How do any of the above observations factor in Coinbase\u2019s internal risk assessment of proceeding with the proposed services/product?   From the article:  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said Thursday that cryptocurrencies and intermediaries that allow holders to \u201cstake\u201d their coins might pass a key test used by courts to determine whether an asset is a security. Known as the Howey test, it examines whether an asset is bought by investors hoping to earn a return based on the efforts of others. \u201cFrom the coin\u2019s perspective\u2026that\u2019s another indicia that under the Howey test, the investing public is anticipating profits based on the efforts of others,\u201d Mr. Gensler told reporters after a congressional hearing. He said he wasn\u2019t referring to any specific cryptocurrency.   If an intermediary such as a crypto exchange offers staking services to its customers, Mr. Gensler said, it \u201clooks very similar\u2014with some changes of labeling\u2014to lending.\u201d The SEC has repeatedly signaled over the past year that firms offering crypto-lending products need to register with the agency and in February BlockFi Lending agreed to pay a $100 million penalty for failing to do so.   What relationship does the current product proposed have with the services Coinbase decided to discontinue a year ago?

                    "content": "Hello everyone. Please note that the author has updated the MIP, which now matches the MIP template. GovAlpha still has some concerns about this MIP from the governance side that we would like to see addressed before we present this MIP to MKR voters for approval. Please note that GovAlpha\u2019s concerns are about process and governance procedure rather than concerned with the principle of whether or not Maker should deposit funds with Coinbase. While we have a neutrality mandate, we are also mandated to comment on governance process when we perceive issues. Some of this may seem like semantics, but it is important to have completeness in a MIP as our mandate requires us to carry out the instructions within a MIP, as written. So if a MIP passes asking us to send 1.6 billion DAI to x address without oversight, that is what we will be including in an executive vote. GovAlpha cannot, and should not, be placing barriers in place when executing on MIPs that have been approved by MKR voters. Our primary concerns are as follows:   There is no detail on how Maker Governance can request a return of the funds. This is our most significant issue with the proposal. The MIP states that Maker can ask for the funds to be returned, which on receipt of the instruction, Coinbase can carry out within 6 minutes. However, there is no description of how MKR voters should signal this or how Coinbase should receive that message. This lack of clarity sets us up for a situation where we have a desire for the return of the funds, no access to signal requests which may be made obsolete in the coming month, and governance is therefore unclear on how to proceed further. We recommend adding a dedicated process component that specifies how Maker Governance can request their deposit be returned. Ideally, this would also provide for \u201croutine\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d requests for return, although this is not strictly necessary. The MIP has been updated to include a provision for a legal assessment from the Maker side. We think this is a good step. However, there is no mention of what happens if this assessment is negative. For example, does the transfer proceed regardless? Or is it blocked from happening?  There is no provision for a technical assessment from the Maker side. We recommend CES should do this. We suggest this includes verifying that the addresses on the Coinbase end are safe and assessing the best method for the return of interest payments and USDC deposits to MakerDAO. For example, how does USDC interest make its way into the Maker Surplus Buffer? Does a returned deposit go straight into the PSM? Does either of these processes need a module to interface with? Suppose this requires further technical work to deploy any modules to facilitate this. In that case, this work should be authorized by this MIP. Similarly, we request details on what happens if CES are not satisfied with the technical aspects of the proposal. Are we to proceed and send funds regardless? Or should the deal be halted until these concerns are rectified?  To clarify, we will allow the MIP to be voted on it\u2019s current state but as per our mandate, GovAlpha is raising these governance issues to the community and voters to make sure they are as informed as possible and strongly recommends the author considers addressing them before formally submitting their proposal.  cc: @CB_Institutional @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates @strat-fin-core-unit @collateral-core-unit @Growth-Core-Unit ",

At the extreme, choosing not to earn means boosting revenue generation at Circle which in turn can help boost the competitive position for USDC. So, it makes sense to explore a way to boost returns of USDC holdings. With the US Federal reserve hiking the Fed Funds rate, the CME Fed Funds futures indicates an average rate of 4.25% for 2023. Expect Circle to make slightly higher than this on the USDC issued based on the choice of investments. Circle shares a portion of this earnings with Coinbase (to the extent USDC is custodied at Coinbase) as highlighted by @CB_Institutional in a previous post. This can be validated from Circle\u2019s SEC filings - search for income sharing in PDF. The exact proportion of the rate shared with Coinbase is not clear & can be queried during the Q&A. Also, since Circle\u2019s costs do not increase based on the Fed Funds rate, there is a case to be made for a larger proportion of the higher interest rate to be passed on to Circle & subsequently to Maker via Coinbase Rewards. The competitive changes in the stablecoin industry (see BUSD/Binance shifts) could also favour an increase in payouts. ",

It\u2019s quite simple, Coinbase and Growth, and formerly the BD team at the Foundation, have been in fairly regular contact since 2018 if not prior with BD goals starting with getting DAI listed and used across their products ( a very \u201ctextbook\u201d Partnership relationship). As mentioned on the call, CB brought this opportunity to us mid summer. It\u2019s a standard for Growth to have many conversations with prospective protocols and current partners about new ideas on collaboration (ie using DAI in something, or using Maker in some way in another dapp/platform). Often times the ideas proposed to us are not a fit from a technical perspective and we help to explain that. Part of Growth is educating people on how Maker works. Not everyone is a Maker expert believe it or not and we don\u2019t ignore people who come to us with ideas regardless if the idea proposed makes sense. I think the Growth CU would have a pretty poor reputation if thats how we operated externally. Further, Growth will sometimes be a conduit to partners for other Core units. For example, adding a vote delegation contract to CB has been requested by MKR holders, DUX (who created the vote delegation contract) and we help to facilitate those conversations, even if CB does not want to integrate it. To be very clear there are ZERO non public arrangements financial or otherwise proposed by Maker CU and Coinbase. That being said, Growth has no influence on if people love or hate their proposal.  CB could\u2019ve easily posted their MIP without sharing the idea with us first but it was naturally helpful for them to ask us. In particular, asking how to create/ post a MIP (also not common knowledge if you don\u2019t live in the forums). I looped in SF to have them understand what the product is and offer any feedback in line with similar proposals in the forum related to investing in short term treasuries and such. Hopefully this is more clear. ",

So the DAO has to trust 4 known people to withdraw $1.6b from Coinbase back to PSM?

I don\u2019t see the word \u201cpermissionless\u201d in this write-up. It seems that Coinbase still retains the right to refuse to allow the withdrawal. We cannot put the existence of DAI in the hands of Coinbase and we definitely can\u2019t put it in the hands of just 4 \u201cauthorized individuals\u201d.

It was very useful and the format is good (also for future similar events).] For me the the most intriguing question (and personally the one I was looking forward to hear) was at this point: how does Coinbase profit from this program? Coinbase claims to give us 1.5% rewards because of three pillars:  they want to `accumulate assets\u2019 because their ambition is to become huge custodians they want to \u2018grow USDC\u2019. Maker is an important Partner to CoinBase and they want to see us grow.  Most importantly, they claim Coinbase is not going to touch the USDC. So it\u2019s not like they are asking a loan from MakerDAO. To the contrary: Coinbase is basically offering their \u2018custodial services\u2019 to MakerDAO for free, and of top of that giving us 1.5% rewards. This all sound a little too good to be true. Anyway, in the best case scenario, my fear is that this instrument (\u201cCoinbase institutional rewards\u201d) will not be able to remain like this for too long. In this sense, I hope we are not going to expose MakerDAO too much in this direction, which to me doesn\u2019t sound strategic (i.e., long term viable). It might be a great solution in the short term, something we surely could explore (I am abstaining for expressing personal opinions because the subject is complicated and requires some professionalism). But I hope we are not going all in with all in on this at the expense of other more sustainable solutions. ",

                    "content": "    ChrisBlec:  So the DAO has to trust 4 known people to withdraw $1.6b from Coinbase back to PSM? What if Maker is in the midst of a regulatory crackdown and the government tells those 4 people that if they do this that they\u2019ll go to jail?       ChrisBlec:  Maker has to trust that the 4 individuals are acting legally in all aspects of their financial life, and also has to hope that US regulators don\u2019t ever sanction them.   It was discussed on this video that the entity itself and the individuals involved would need to be squeaky clean. But yes, I agree this is a major risk and clarity on the mechanics is needed before this can realistically moved forward.  Questions/Comments  4 people is not many for $1.6B . Does it make sense to expand to existing CUs and/or Delegates? There needs to be clarity on who the Maker representatives are, corporate structure, and how this will be determined (timeline/mechanism). This should be a condition of the MIP IMHO. Given the Maker representatives will likely need to undergo enhanced screening (more than normal KYC/AML) to reduce risk for the broader community, is everyone comfortable with that? It could mean pretty significant doxing. A couple questions that come to mind that would require answering/proof:  Where are you a legal resident? Have your taxes been paid? Do you have a criminal record? Have you been involved in any pending or completed litigation? How are you securing your signing key?   More clarity is needed on the multi-sig structure. I assume it\u2019s 4 of 4 but this is not explicitly defined. If it is 4 of 4 this actually creates more of an issue because 1 person could prevent withdrawal execution. It likely should be an M of N with a min threshold and a large enough set of key holders. More clarity is needed on how Maker representatives will make decisions on how/when to move the USDC between the Coinbase custody address and the PSM, what other actions they could undertake, how they might be replaced if there is an issue, and how to ensure the scope of their actions doesn\u2019t unilaterally increase. Might it make sense to reduce the size of this deal? $1.6B or ~25% of the PSM is significant and brings with it more enhanced diligence. Maybe it makes more sense to start with a smaller amount? A $10M or $100M loss is a far cry from $1B+.    Given the complexity and risk associated with multi-sig controls (we are talking about $1.6B after all!) I can\u2019t help but feel we\u2019re pushing a rock up hill here. The lack of a formal company that MKR holders are actual shareholders in is just adding a lot more friction here in the name of \u201cdecentralization\u201d. A lot of these concerns above would be non-issues if it was a formal company with an elected board, and those board members underwent DD and controlled the multi-sig. Through MIP81, we\u2019re basically trying to replicate that, but in an inadequate way and without the legal support for MKR holders if issues arise.  An On-Chain Alternative What might be better and more aligned with the \u201cDeFi\u201d ethos is exactly what @JohnnyF suggested.     JohnnyF:  The part I do not understand: why does Coinbase have to have custody of the USDC for this at all? It seems to me they just do nothing with them. Why not custody it ourselves? We could designate a Maker-controlled USDC address, and all USDC held in that address receive some revenue share. They can easily and automatically check the balance each day and pay the revenue in a pre-defined interval, maybe weekly. This also solves the problem of \u2018how does MKR get the funds back\u2019 and in that specific case, everyone has to agree that it doesnt increase risk for Maker at all compared to the status quo. Even @ChrisBlec should be OK with that.   Have a vault contract that holds the USDC that is managed fully on-chain by MKR governance votes with the only actions to move from the vault address to the PSM address and vice versa. This way Coinbase can automatically send USDC rewards to it from their own whitelisted deposit address whenever they want, based on the vault address balance. This could potentially even occur on a per block basis, based on the deposit balance, less already paid rewards. If Maker decides it needs the USDC it can pull it upon a proper governance vote. If Coinbase wishes to cease the rewards program/agreement it can at any time. It can also update the rewards rate as it chooses to. So this would actually enable Coinbase to be more flexible and nimble, and reduce the amount of friction with regards to notice around changes to the agreement/program. While this structure isn\u2019t completely under Coinbase\u2019s custody and may not give them the showcase piece in the way they\u2019re hoping for, I think it could present a novel more decentralized way of having funds \u201clocked\u201d in a mutually agreed upon custody arrangement that showcases the programmable and verifiable benefits of a distributed ledger. If @CB_Institutional is looking to support Maker and doesn\u2019t intend to do anything with the USDC in custody (which it has repeated a few times now), and they are simply looking to keep USDC from being redeemed so that the fiat stays sticky in the banks and guarantees revenue for Circle and Coinbase (my reading between the lines), then this solution satisfies those goals. If the vault contract is simple and audited, I would argue that holistically it\u2019s more secure than the currently proposed solution given all the other off-chain risks that have been highlighted in this MIP so far (regulatory, custody, bankruptcy, co-mingling, accounting, multi-sig and Maker representative risk and their potential doxing). Is this something that @CB_Institutional would be open to? To be more custodial for Coinbase, potentially the contract could be slightly more complex and be a 2/2 on-chain multi-sig with a time delay where Coinbase also has a key to authorize vault actions. In this implementation, if funds are deposited or withdrawn it would be a 2 stage process:  Maker governance vote approval triggers an on-chain approval signature in the vault contract to satisfy the first 1 of 2 signatures; The Coinbase key completes their 2 of 2 signature for approval of the deposit or withdrawal;  In the case of a withdrawal, if Coinbase does not sign within a certain number of blocks the withdrawal transaction would go through, ultimately leaving withdrawal control up to Maker governance and MKR holders. In the case of a deposit by Maker, if Coinbase doesn\u2019t sign within a certain number of blocks the deposit would not go through, leaving the deposit amount (and any claim to future rewards by Maker) ultimately in Coinbase\u2019s control. All without a corporate setup, extreme DD and lengthy legal contracts. I think this would still have PR value for both Maker and Coinbase, and wouldn\u2019t increase any additional legal or regulatory risk for either party because Coinbase would be making rewards payments to a smart contract that is only governed by a decentralized group of MKR holders.       iammeeoh:  [Personal Note: I want to thank @prose11, all the organisers and Alesia for this.

In the past, every RWA collateral onboarded has needed a fair amount of technical work. This may not be apparent to most. As I read this MIP, these are the only tasks to be performed by CES:     CB_Institutional:   A member of the CES Core Unit will verify the address destination and the legal entity\u2019s Prime account prior to transfer of funds. A test transaction will take place to ensure the receiving address is correct prior to any release of funds. If CES is not satisfied with the security of fund transfer, the deal would be halted until these concerns were rectified.    If this is not the case, this MIP needs to be updated to ensure CES is responsible for the technical implementation and assessment. We believe there are solutions to the known issues that can be solved from a technology perspective. One example\u2026 As a technology partner exploring a generic technology solution with Coinbase Institutional Technology, we received some clarification as to what digital assets can be custodied with CB besides standard ERC20 tokens. We specifically asked whether CB institutional could custody a smart contract which could contain USDC tokens. Given an affirmative answer by CB Custody - we provided an outline of a smart contract that could be custodied by them. This is currently being reviewed by the Coinbase Custody technical team and we are expecting feedback soon. Depending on feedback from CB Custody technical team, this smart contract implementation approach could provide several benefits to both Maker and CB. Specifically:  Removing any concerns about incremental bankruptcy and regulatory risks Whilst an initial Real World entity will be needed to enter into an agreement with Coinbase Custody - human interaction for the ongoing management of our USDC position could be eliminated Direct integration with Maker - allowing Maker to remove USDC funds from Custody directly through the smart contract instantaneously  When we receive further feedback from Coinbase Technical team - we would plan to develop this proposed implementation if requested by this MIP. If not, CES will plan to perform the tasks as listed in this MIP. We are happy to help in whatever requested capacity, per this MIP, to onboard the collateral. ",

This same BVI entity successfully completed the Formalities, that comprised monitoring the flow of funds from MakerDao\u2019s archives. If KYC was anticipated to be a problem, there is a very minimal likelihood that Coinbase ever would have recommended it. I believe we should learn more about the deal\u2019s structure before committing more than a billion dollars in assets. I\u2019m particularly interested in learning how MKR holders will participate in the governance practices of any future investment companies, particularly after the MIP/Governance structure is adopted.

                    "content": "    CB_Institutional:  We would like to formally submit MIP 81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards for a vote in the October cycle. We appreciate the community\u2019s engagement and comments and look forward to the vote which will occur from October 10 - 24.   This is unfortunate. Despite a lot of good details and potential, I think this moving to a vote is premature. This MIP is still lacking important specification around:  the entity onboarding; who the 4 Maker representatives are and how they are elected; and the governance and multi-sig structure for the representatives to move USDC in/out of the PSM, what else they can do, and how they may be replaced if there are issues;  Especially for $1.6B USDC! To put this in perspective, the details presented in the HVB and RFA MIP specifications are superior and far more detailed, and there is much less risk ($100MM DAI respectively). Additionally, I proposed a more decentralized approach that, in my view, reduces regulatory and legal risk for both parties, which further built on @dbkcan\u2019s initial smart contract idea here. @monkey.irish hinted at this as well.     monkey.irish:  We believe there are solutions to the known issues that can be solved from a technology perspective. One example\u2026 As a technology partner exploring a generic technology solution with Coinbase Institutional Technology, we received some clarification as to what digital assets can be custodied with CB besides standard ERC20 tokens. We specifically asked whether CB institutional could custody a smart contract which could contain USDC tokens. Given an affirmative answer by CB Custody - we provided an outline of a smart contract that could be custodied by them. This is currently being reviewed by the Coinbase Custody technical team and we are expecting feedback soon. Depending on feedback from CB Custody technical team, this smart contract implementation approach could provide several benefits to both Maker and CB. Specifically:  Removing any concerns about incremental bankruptcy and regulatory risks Whilst an initial Real World entity will be needed to enter into an agreement with Coinbase Custody - human interaction for the ongoing management of our USDC position could be eliminated Direct integration with Maker - allowing Maker to remove USDC funds from Custody directly through the smart contract instantaneously  When we receive further feedback from Coinbase Technical team - we would plan to develop this proposed implementation if requested by this MIP. If not, CES will plan to perform the tasks as listed in this MIP.   While Coinbase has updated the MIP to say     CB_Institutional:  In the future, Coinbase and Maker will automate transactions between the PSM and Prime account via smart contract or API.   I believe this option should be explored before putting ~20% of Maker\u2019s USDC PSM in the hands of 4 presently unknown individuals. If this MIP passes, the soonest the rewards will take effect is on October 15th (at the earliest) which would result in ~5,063,013.69 USDC rewards for the remainder of 2022 (at best). While that revenue is great, the ROI still feels out of balance given the lack of details. We\u2019re risking $1.6B with 4 presently unknown people, with an unclear disaster recovery plan, for potentially ~$5M in revenue.  Note: FWIW I don\u2019t think the risk is with Coinbase custody at this point, it\u2019s to do with the lack of transparency around the Maker representatives and the mechanics.  Unfortunately, given this MIP is only paying out rewards until the end of 2022, I feel like the timing on this hasn\u2019t aligned well and would have preferred to see this pushed to the November voting cycle with more of the remaining details ironed out. Sadly, I will be voting \u201cno\u201d for these reasons, and would urge others to do so as well. I hope that the remaining details can be refined and this MIP can be put forward for the November vote, potentially with an extension from Coinbase to pay rewards until the end of February 2023 so that the same 3 month trial period initially proposed is available.

Yes. On the withdrawal time, I would say 2 weeks to be sure. A facilitator will have to issue a governance poll (notice going straight to exec might be possible as well). Exec vote (which take a bit of time to craft), then having the corporate servicers get the message and act.

We hope its implementation can help to drive a path towards decentralization and resiliency for $DAI in the long-run. We do believe for the final proposal, however, that automating the USDC liquidity flows between the PSM smart contract and the Coinbase Prime account could be important from a technical perspective. These potential risks could be addressed if the funds were to be deposited into a Coinbase smart contract that didn\u2019t have custodial access to the funds. The smart contract could automatically deposit funds back into the PSM based on programmatic thresholds. This way, Coinbase\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d of the USDC would not become a hurdle to user redemptions in the event that a significant and unpredictable number of redemptions were to occur. As @monkey.irish has noted, the full technical solution is still in development; we appreciate the MakerDAO and Coinbase teams\u2019 hard work and look forward to hearing more about the final structure at a high level once complete.

                    "content": "    Porter_Smith:  We do believe for the final proposal, however, that automating the USDC liquidity flows between the PSM smart contract and the Coinbase Prime account could be important from a technical perspective. These potential risks could be addressed if the funds were to be deposited into a Coinbase smart contract that didn\u2019t have custodial access to the funds. The smart contract could automatically deposit funds back into the PSM based on programmatic thresholds. This way, Coinbase\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d of the USDC would not become a hurdle to user redemptions in the event that a significant and unpredictable number of redemptions were to occur.   Appreciate this explicit call out @Porter_Smith!  With strict custody by Coinbase, my concern is this could be considered an investment contract and potentially jeopardize the $1.6B supporting the DAI peg. There is reg arb in the right structure. Since this vote has now passed, I would love to see an updated amendment or proposal for resources to be allocated by Coinbase and/or Maker to get this engineering work done right as it potentially alleviates all the previously raised issues around multi-sig key holders and governance. Whether this funding comes from some core funding or a new MetaDAO is TBD. Maybe @rune, @CB_Institutional or someone from @collateral-core-unit or @Protocol-Engineering can comment on the the most viable option given the other changes going on? As a dev that has been deep in the regulatory weeds for the last couple years, happy to provide high level feedback. Just DM.  Excited to see what develops.  ",

As an update I want to inform the community that @collateral-core-unit is exploring the smart contract solution with Coinbase Custody. Last week @collateral-core-unit had a meeting with Coinbase Custody in which we shared a high level outline of a smart contract that could be held in Coinbase custody - with that smart contract containing any USDC that would qualify for rewards.  Amongst the features of this smart contract is that whilst held in Custody there is a function in the smart contract that would allow Maker to call that function on-chain at any time to return the USDC to the PSM and likewise send USDC to this contract - without the need to have any off chain transactions. On Friday Coinbase Custody contacted @collateral-core-unit in our discord channel to indicate that the smart contract solution is one they would consider however they do need to finalize internal approvals and they do have some changes/suggestions for modifications to the smart contract for security and other reasons and we would receive a formal update/response soon. Given that we haven\u2019t yet received a formal response (hopefully we will have one before the end of the week) it would be premature to comment on the proposed technical solution. But once we do receive a formal response - we will have what we need to complete the required technical assessment for this MIP and will update the community accordingly. ",

We obviously need the vault in the short run because low is better than 0 and it has minimal risk due to instant withdrawal and with an existing trusted partner. I don\u2019t see a reason why we cannot set it up the simple way first, and then only later when knowing all the facts about if and how we will use it long term determine whether we want to move to the complex solution. It could be a costly distraction to build a bunch of novel smart contracts for something we don\u2019t know how long we will use.

If the smart contracts can be created without blocking the legal work then I think it\u2019s a lot easier to argue it is not overturning the approved MIP. I still don\u2019t agree with it and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real benefit that makes it worth it to redirect resources from things we actually know will provide value long term. Smart contracts are always hard and always take a lot of time and resources, even if they\u2019re simple. I don\u2019t actually believe that we\u2019re accomplishing anything substantial here. RWA is RWA and the risk is the effectively the same. The smart contract resources could be put to better use elsewhere where actual resilience would be created and we might see reduction of RWA exposure. But ultimately it\u2019s up to the Core Units to make the call on how they wish to implement the MIP and allocate the resources under their control, within the boundaries of the MIPs. ",

In the past year, we\u2019ve learned a lot and where it make sense, we apply that learning forward. The deals we are doing today, and the speed at which we onboard, are a result of the learning and prior work from other RWA onboardings. Some of this is code based. When there are specific concerns by the community, it\u2019s in Maker\u2019s best interest to evaluate possible solutions that do not materially alter the ratified MIP. This is a balancing act of understanding when, and not, to apply friction. These decisions are not taken lightly. While there is risk with RWAs and they might have the appearance of all being the same, we manage that risk after the fact. These deals can be complicated and require a lot of manual intervention once onboarded. This is the part most people don\u2019t see and it would be easy to assume it all works automatically. It gets more complicated when people intimately involved with these deals leave Maker so continuity is critical. I point this out since each onboarding has varying scope (and risk) of work when considering the lifetime of the deal. In order to help protector metadaos be successful, the details need to be managed after the onboarding so there isn\u2019t a hot mess during vault adoption. ",

                    "content": "    rune:  RWA is RWA and the risk is the effectively the same.   Brah, come on. This is just not true. The details of each deal, especially since none of them are the exact same, dramatically impact the risk profile. Stating otherwise is naive or disingenuous. The recent FTX blow up should give everyone here some pause to really reevaluate custody risk and remember what crypto is good for - the ability to not have to trust but to easily verify. I get not wanting to delay and start earning much needed protocol revenue but if if you wanted this done faster it could have taken the same line as the GUSD structure with Gemini that @SebVentures mentioned above. Frankly, in my view, that structure is much less risky all across the board. Less custody risk, legal risk, and chance of being deemed an investment contract (ie. a security). There is no legal precedent for a private entity making arbitrary payments to an immutable smart contract that is not under the control of a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d. What constitutes a common enterprise within a DAO construct is an open question, but true decentralization (which Maker is closer to than Ooki DAO) likely plays a significant role. This includes governance! Putting $1.6B in custody with another party that is paying you a financial incentive (ie. expectation of profit), whether through shell corps or not, is either legally a demand deposit account or an investment contract. Since Coinbase Custody is not a deposit taking financial institution, this is likely to be deemed an investment contract. Now, using a BVI legal entity/trust as a front for legal capture may help address some of the BSA/AML requirements, this does not help protect against Coinbase engaging in an unregulated security offering. Maybe because of the legal structure this gives you a thinly veiled argument that the deal between the entity and Coinbase Custody is between 2 non-US entities (and ideally individuals) so it\u2019s not their jurisdiction but given that all this out in the open, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that the entity doesn\u2019t represent the DAO and MKR holders, some of which are US citizens. Furthermore, as a US publicly listed company, this activity will need to be in Coinbase\u2019s SEC filings otherwise they will be making a material misrepresentation. So the SEC is gonna find out about it and your MiCA decentralization hacks aren\u2019t relevant yet. MiCA won\u2019t even come into effect until 2023/2024. Now, I may be sitting with a tinfoil hat on, and I\u2019m sure Coinbase has very good lawyers, but based on my experience there is a non-zero chance that with the currently proposed custody structure, even with the ambiguity around DAOs, this could cause the USDC to be locked up as part of a legal proceeding. Seems like a big risk considering the implications when there are viable alternatives.     Patrick_J:  Rune is correct that any MIP should be interpreted as it has been ratified by MKR voters. MIPs are the most powerful governance tool that Maker Governance possesses. Because of this, they should be treated with great care. MKR voters voted to approve the MIP and that is now what should be carried out. Core Units and the Community should not reinterpret proposals after they have been ratified, without going through the appropriate process , otherwise the whole concept of MIPs and DAO Governance falls apart.   And while I 100% agree with @Patrick_J about the spirit of governance, let\u2019s be real. A bunch of us brought up concerns about lack of final details on the custody arrangement and instead of extending the review period to taking time to address those issues, this MIP was rammed through to a vote. It was then passed easily by your delegated MKR stake. @rune you have more MKR than has typically been used on any vote in Maker\u2019s governance history (it\u2019s easy to see with chain analysis). So at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really matter which way other people vote unless someone decides to come in and do a hostile takeover of Maker. I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t think most people that are involved in Maker want that. Nor does it make financial sense unless you wanted to be malicious, because MKR is dilutive and doesn\u2019t accrue any value from stability fees or this yield right now. There\u2019s no rational economic incentive to buy or hold MKR because it shouldn\u2019t even have any value or reasonable expectation of profit. Its only purpose is to participate in setting the direction of a public good (idealistically). This is how I\u2019ve viewed it personally. But let\u2019s be intellectually honest here. @rune you want to move fast. So do lots of other people. We can both agree that process for the sake of process is stupid. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. Especially given there are better alternatives and we\u2019re talking about 25-33% of the PSM, which if it gets caught up in any legal dispute or frozen as a result of counter party risk, will kill DAI\u2019s peg. You can\u2019t credibly use process when it suits you and hand wave it away when it doesn\u2019t! This specific MIP13c3-SP12 process has been bastardized greatly. Not only in MIP81 but also MIP86 and MIP87. None of these are in the original spirit of MIP13c3-SP12 which is focused on low risk investments. I\u2019ve added my commentary on each line item below with regards to MIP81.   Screen Shot 2022-11-10 at 11.16.40 PM1472\u00d7725 192 KB  While I support MIP86, and mostly support the direction of MIP81, let\u2019s call a spade a spade here. My comments genuinely are meant to help move this forward and reduce risk for DAI and MKR holders because I want decentralized money to succeed and DAI is the best positioned at present. However, I\u2019m also very concerned about the contagion if this blows up for any reason. DeFi has the potential to be much more resilient than relying on trusted intermediaries. Human\u2019s can always be corrupted. Code can\u2019t. It would behoove us to remember how many times, even in properly regulated structures, humans have messed up.  There is a scenario here where the USDC in Coinbase\u2019s custody becomes an unsecured liability and frozen because this is deemed to be an investment contract or because BSA & AML requirements aren\u2019t being adequately met if the ultimate beneficiaries of the yield are considered to be the DAO members and/or MKR voters. One could argue, as you have, that because Circle is the issuer, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it absolutely does! While I agree there is still risk that Circle could freeze the assets, adding an extra counter-party in the middle and a whole other regulatory hook (securities violation?) increases the risk in a material way. It would be prudent to ensure there is credibility when claiming this isn\u2019t the case. If Coinbase takes custody of the USDC and/or governance votes continue to be highly concentrated, then it will be much more difficult to avoid a regulatory hook. Especially in light of the recent LBRY token case ruling, which looks eerily similar to Ethereum\u2019s early days and almost every other token project so far. It is not too late to address this by redistributing or burning your MKR tokens and letting people vote on an amendment to clarify what the technical appropriateness should be as described in the original MIP spec:     CB_Institutional:  A CES facilitator must, again through a public forum post, provide a verification of the technical appropriateness of the MIP81 designated solution. Should the verification not be forthcoming, this MIP will not move forward.   Specifically, to be that it should use a smart contract instead of a direct custody arrangement and ideally @monkey.irish or @dbkcan can add the spec around what that should/could look like so it is out in the open.  This will be my last post unless there are material changes at Maker. I will watch to see how MetaDAOs evolve because they do present some promise and the work that @Allan_Pedersen and a lot of the @strat-fin-core-unit (and ex RWA team) is doing really is groundbreaking. However, to me right now, MakerDAO is looking more like a really inefficient and risky private equity or mutual/hedge fund rather than the credibly neutral global money that I hoped it could be. If I can help in any way I\u2019m easy to find. Wishing you well.  ",

There has been significant organizational change since the Coinbase USDC rewards proposal was first introduced and approved. MIP81 while approved per Maker Governance - Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 has not yet been funded or final terms agreed. I will attempt a summary including Forum links to help you and others get four corners around where things are relative to this proposal and its dependencies, plus context for further deep diving into the matrix. Corrections and clarity are welcomed by all who may know better the state of play! The latest technical status details on MIP81 are posted here. A smart-contract solution is being explored for holding the USDC in Coinbase Custody on-chain in a manner that gives MakerDAO governance some kind of physical control/participation with respect to transfers.

Also, where can Maker community members easily see what the variable rate is at any given time? Some individuals have reported being offered as high as 4% on their USDC for their individual accounts on Coinbase. The most recent communication from @CB_Institutional is a 2.37% rate. It has been several months and two FOMC meetings since that communication, so we look forward to seeing what a higher rate environment can now provide. Due to some recent interactions around the DAO, we also want to remind all parties of a key term of MIP81:     CB_Institutional:  Maker Governance will be able to freely mint, burn, withdraw, and settle almost instantaneously in USDC (<6 mins), consistent with Coinbase Prime\u2019s standard offering.   Which was then reiterated on September 8th:     CB_Institutional:  Should Governance choose to transfer assets off-platform it may instruct and settle these transfers almost instantaneously in USDC (<6 mins), consistent with Coinbase Prime\u2019s standard offering. Governance may choose to increase/decrease the sum at Coinbase, or regularly transact in and out of this account. This was proposed with liquidity top of mind.   Any final implementation will need to respect this key promise. We are excited to receive an update on what still remains to be done and any estimated timeline and an updated rewards rate. We recognize there have been some personnel changes since this MIP was approved, as well as the holiday season, so if no estimate is possible, that would still be a helpful update. ",

This is a best effort work and shouldn\u2019t be relied on for investment decisions. Feel free to reach in case of errors or substantive omissions so I can correct.  High level overview MakerDAO will, through a MKR legal entity, use Coinbase Custody services to deposit an amount of USDC. This deposit will be held in the name of the MKR legal entity and left untouched. Coinbase will provide a reward on this deposit paid in USDC. The current reward rate proposed is 1.5% until the end of 2022. There is no time commitment from MakerDAO.  Pro:  Ability to generate 20M+ of annualized revenues in a scalable way while keeping a good liquidity Only proposal fitting this revenue generation/liquidity spot USDC in custody is not unwound, unwrapped or otherwise invested so the only additional risk that MakerDAO takes on is counterparty risk on the custody   Cons:  Expose a big chunk of MakerDAO assets to Coinbase Custody International Ltd counterparty risk Increase the regulatory risk as Coinbase could freeze the USDC in their custody on top of Circle freezing the USDC address. Notice CES is working on an idea to wrap USDC to fix those two previous issues. Similar result (more revenues but with more complexities and potentially slightly lower liquidity) might be achieved with MIP65 using money market funds   Next steps:  Figure out the MKR legal entity and who set it up (arranger?). Provide further clarity on the custody risk through a legal assessment of bankruptcy implications for digital asset custody in Ireland. Get more clarity on the liquidity profile (does it need governance interaction or is it a smart contract, do we want a hot or cold wallet, the latter being slower but more secured)   Legal structure The structure contemplated might be close to HVBank/MIP65. An orphaned entity (MKR legal entity) could be spun up to contract with Coinbase Custody International Ltd. Assuming it is a structure similar to the RWA Foundation, it will be managed by third party professional corporate servicers. MKR legal entity will recognize the MakerDAO loan with a Deed poll. MakerDAO will be able to send instructions to the directors through the issuance of DAO Resolutions in Executive Spells.  image922\u00d7397 10.8 KB  The custody of our USDC by Coinbase Custody International Ltd is probably the most significant risk in this construct. One part is technical. Is USDC safer under Coinbase custody than sitting under the PSM smart contract? The answer is probably that it is more risky (e.g. they can lose the keys, we can\u2019t). This is mitigated by the fact that Coinbase is custodying 88 billions dollars of digital assets. They are on the top tier of digital asset custodians.  the theft, loss or destruction of private keys required to access any crypto assets held in custody for our own account or for our customers may be irreversible Coinbase 10Q  Another part is legal. Digital assets are new and therefore there is little history of what happens in a bankruptcy. The counterparty, Coinbase Custody International, is located in Ireland and is a dedicated entity. Legal work should be done to get more clarity, if possible, on this front.  Moreover, because custodially held crypto assets may be considered to be the property of a bankruptcy estate, in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors Coinbase 10Q  The last part is regulatory, as Coinbase will have to comply with regulators. It is unclear if that\u2019s a significant risk change as USDC in the PSM can be frozen as well by Centre Consortium/Circle. Some counterparty risks are detailed in the MIP65 counterparty risk post.  Commercial terms In the MIP, Coinbase proposes a reward rate up to 1.5% of the USDC under custody. Currently, the risk-free rate in $ term (we will use SOFR here) is 2.25% and expected to move to 3% shortly. Coinbase will not use the USDC deposited in custody. Coinbase also doesn\u2019t manage the underlying collateral of USDC as this is done by Circle. Nevertheless, under their Centre Consortium partnership, Circle has a revenue sharing agreement with Coinbase (see excerpt below from Circle S4). The ratio of revenue sharing is not specified but we can suppose it is between 50 and 100%. This agreement is probably limited to USDC that is at Coinbase (custody services or trading services) which explains the need to put the USDC in Coinbase\u2019s custody.  As part of our and Coinbase\u2019s investment in the development of the Centre Consortium, we entered into agreements with Coinbase, pursuant to which we share any revenue generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on (i) the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party and (ii) the amount of USDC held on each respective party\u2019s platform (i.e. held in its customers\u2019 accounts) in relation to the total amount of USDC in circulation (the \u201cRevenue Share Arrangement\u201d). The Revenue Share Arrangement requires the parties to calculate their revenue allocation a daily basis and provides for an annual true-up mechanism by which the revenue share is adjusted and paid per each party\u2019s pro rata allocations. The Revenue Share Arrangement may only be terminated upon the mutual agreement of the parties.  The Coinbase reward is not directly linked to the $-risk free rate. But, as we have seen, it would be unwise from Coinbase to set the reward rate above what they get from Circle in their revenue sharing agreement. USDC is invested in short-term, safe instruments (mainly US gov debt instruments with an average 40-day maturity and cash deposits), so the risk-free rate is a good proxy. Furthermore, this rate expires at the end of 2022 so we can imagine that, should Coinbase want to continue generating a share of yield backing from Circle, it will update the rate for January 2023 to be competitive relative to alternatives that might be spun up in the meanwhile. Three alternatives to this MIP could be considered. First, fiat-backed stablecoin issuers could offer the same reward structure without having the need of putting the stablecoin in custody (keeping them in the PSM). This would be ideal as we would get a yield while keeping ample intra-block liquidity and taking zero additional risks. In a free competitive market, we should be able to earn close to the risk-free yield. One concern could be the very adverse regulation that those issuers have to face. The second solution would be moving those assets (USDC) off-chain and investing them in very short-term instruments (e.g. overnight repo). It is something a structure like MIP65 could achieve quite easily. The custodian \u201cconcern\u201d would be reduced by using a traditional asset custodian like JPMorgan. Nevertheless, such a structure involves more counterparties (crypto-broker, bank, \u2026) which is always a risk. It is also less transparent as being off-chain. Finally, the speed would most likely be slower. Finally, a product like Backed Finance or tokenized MIP65 could provide a good on-chain solution if the underlying is a money market fund. Nevertheless, this would require strong market adoption. Those solutions, while probably the endgame, are not there yet. TradFi risk-free yield should be a floor in DeFi as well due to arbitrage. In that sense, allocating capital in the Coinbase Institutional Rewards MIP81 doesn\u2019t seem ideal. Yet it is the only option available and a game changer for MakerDAO. As depicted in the diagram below, MIP81 fit the algorithmic short-term allocation. Even with a 1.6B allocation, we would retain enough PSM layer intrablock liquidity to ensure the peg.  943\u00d7478 32.2 KB  Maker Community should also consider second order effects of this proposal. A Maker competitor could easily get a similar proposal and pass the reward to its customers (through a DSR-like mechanism). MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have a concrete solution to compete by setting the DSR to 1.5% as well as it would be quite costly. Therefore, implementing this MIP would also be seen as a defensive action in a world where TradFi yield is coming to DeFi. ",

You should do the same. Onwards and upwards!     SebVentures:  One part is technical. Is USDC safer under Coinbase custody than sitting under the PSM smart contract? The answer is probably that it is more risky.   I think this can be argued in both cases. Sanctions can be impose with provided guidelines to those who fail to follow prudent requirements. This is then follow by an investigation and sanction proceedings before sanctions are imposed. Some will argue that having a Trust Structure in place is a lot more difficult to sanction than a smart contract that\u2019s controlled by a centralized entity (Circle as an example). All sanctioning steps take time. And last, this ecosystem has begged for guidelines and yet here we are.

Similar result (more revenues but with more complexities and potentially slightly lower liquidity) might be achieved with MIP65 using money market funds    @SebVentures I would just like to point out that as discussed here MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards - #201 by monkey.irish @CES has been in discussion with the @CB_Institutional  technical team about the possibility of @CB_Institutional holding in custody collateral indirectly through a simple custom smart contract (which we have provided a high level outline to CB and are still waiting for feedback). Should this be possible, under the proposed smart contract structure - all concerns about Counterparty/Bankruptcy risk are eliminated as Maker retains complete control over the collateral (even if Coinbase were to lose their private keys) simply by having a function within the smart contract which allows Maker to return the funds held in the contract to the PSM and which cannot be blocked by any party. Obviously, the USDC regulatory risk still exists regardless of where the USDC is held (in custody or within the PSM). Given the above I think that readers of this post should not reach any conclusions about the \u201cCons\u201d as the actual technical implementation which still needs to be developed by @collateral-core-unit (subject to a positive vote) - may mitigate the cons you have identified, and furthermore move their rewards proposal into the 0-block liquidity in your ALM chart above.

We recently published a blog post regarding our approach to transparency, risk management, and consumer protection. In addition to the blog\u2019s overview about our broader business, I want to reinforce the security of Coinbase Prime/Custody specifically. This means:  There can\u2019t be a run on the bank. Client assets are held 1:1 - unless explicitly directed by the customer Assets are 100% segregated in on-chain wallets (no commingling with other client funds or Coinbase\u2019s business) Funds are held in hot wallets or 100% cold storage per the client\u2019s sole discretion via our state-of-the-art security protocols Comprehensive insurance coverage Our processes, books, and records are fully audited via SOC1/SOC2 reports  While many in the industry have been exposed to fraud and liquidity struggles, Coinbase remains unimpacted:  No exposure to Alameda Immaterial exposure to FTX/FTT ($15 million in deposits) No exposure to Genesis / zero exposure to Genesis Trading No exposure to Gemini We only hold $168mm of our $5.6B USD resources at third party venues. Reference our limited exposure to third parties on pg. 10 of our shareholder letter.   Coinbase has been focused on servicing clients in need and supporting others in the industry through this time - we\u2019ll continue to do everything we can to protect our customers while safely growing the cryptoeconomy. Broadly speaking, in the highly unlikely event of a Coinbase bankruptcy, our client agreements are explicit that Coinbase does not have a property interest in the digital assets we hold for customers. Specifically, we believe that the USDC on Coinbase\u2019s platform on behalf of Maker would not be subject to the claims of our creditors. Finally - regarding the status of MIP81: we are still in the execution phase, and do not yet have custody of Maker\u2019s funds. We are looking forward to finalizing implementation, onboarding, and providing a steady stream of revenue to Maker through our partnership. As stated in the MIP, our rewards program is not contingent on external parties or market conditions; we pay USDC Rewards from our own well-funded inventory of USDC. Current market conditions have in no way diminished our enthusiasm for \u2013 or ability to deliver on \u2013 MIP81.

What does that mean exactly? The ratio in context refers to assets we would deposit vs the potential for Coinbase to rehypothecate or use those assets. How is a custodial account ever not holding 1:1 if the client gives you some kind of \u201cdirection\u201d? Are you referring to a situation where the client withdraws funds from custody? In that case the assets are still held 1:1 vis-a-vis the amounts deposited by customer and amounts held in a segregated wallet. Please explain. Of course top of mind is the situation at Grayscale and noting that the letter you provided (attached in the tweet shared below) reports balances as of September 30, 2022. What is the reason you could not or did not provide confirmation of assets in custody as of today\u2019s date? Wallet addresses and on-chain proof have not been provided for Grayscale\u2019s products citing security concerns.

It\u2019s often said in the context of Web2 that if services are free, the customer is the product. Here, not only are custodial services free for MakerDAO, but we are paid for being a customer. Accordingly, ACREinvest would gain comfort through more specific disclosures to better understand how Coinbase sustainably pays for this program, especially since there is no guarantee of or commitment to offer any particular rate after December 2022. We have seen reports that Circle reduced yields to zero on one of its retail yield offerings seemingly as a result of Genesis Trading halting redemptions and ceasing lending operations this week. By \u201cexposure\u201d mentioned below are you referring strictly to equity investments made to any of the FTX entities in bankruptcy and Genesis?     CB_Institutional:  We have immaterial exposure to FTX (CB Ventures made a small equity investment), and none to Genesis Trading.     Are you impacted as a customer in any way that could reduce the inventory available for funding this rewards program in the future?   Is there a Coinbase entity that is an institutional customer of Circle International Bermuda Limited (\u201cCircle Bermuda\u201d) for the purposes of generating yield for this MakerDAO rewards program?   Does Coinbase lend its own Bitcoin to Circle Bermuda any other party to generate yield?   Does Coinbase pledge bitcoin to Silvergate or other lenders and borrow USD for the purchase of USDC?   You have previously referred to having a revenue sharing agreement with Circle.    MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards   The USDC that Coinbase uses to pay USDC Institutional Rewards comes from Coinbase\u2019s inventory of USDC. Coinbase funds the inventory from its own purchases of USDC from Circle, from purchases of USDC from users of the Coinbase platform, and from payments that Coinbase receives pursuant to its revenue sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of USDC.   Can you provide more details on that agreement or provide a link to any of your public filings that describe this relationship? You state that \u201cpurchases of USDC from users of the Coinbase platform\u201d are in your pool of inventory. How so? Which users are you referring to? In what way and under what circumstances is Coinbase a buyer of USDC from these users? Is Coinbase permitted to rehypothecate or borrow USDC from balances held by some Coinbase customers to pay rewards to MakerDAO? Thank you ",
