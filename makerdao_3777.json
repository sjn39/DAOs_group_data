It has been a busy two weeks since the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit Launch Pod Session. Based upon a lot of feedback and reflection, I decided to revise and re-submit the MIPs for the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit. I appreciate all the valuable feedback from the DAO and community. I am excited to lead this Core Unit!  Changes So, what has changed? A LOT!   Name Change: Renaming the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit to Collateral Engineering Services (CES) Core Unit. The name change better reflects the focus of the Core Unit.  Governance Cycle: The plan is to formally submit for the July 2021 governance cycle.  MIP39: Simplified the MIP to focus on the key aspects of the CES Core Unit.  MIP40: You will want to spend some time reading this MIP. I added a significant amount of details around the budget, the budgeting process, and initial Core Unit implementation action items. Please ask questions since there is a lot of information in this MIP.  MIP41: Minor updates. Please watch the Launch Pod Session since it fills in the gaps on who I am and my experience with Maker.   Next Steps   June 9 - 25: Feedback and conversations with the community.  By June 25: Confirm multi-sig addresses, Auditors, & Advisors.  June 26 - July 6: @monkey.irish on holiday. I am on a river trip and will not have access to the Internet.    July 7: Formal CES Core Unit submission.  July 8: Begin Phase 1 CES Core Unit implementation.  July 14: Begin weekly status updates for CES.  Early August: Formal CES Core Unit kickoff.
