                    "content": "A recent Wall Street Journal Article on Cryptocurrencies and Credit Cards. This is a fascinating innovation and could create opportunities for Maker.  Visa, Mastercard & Paypal are getting involved.  Are there ways to work with some of these folks? JULY 9, 2022 9:43 AM Cryptocurrencies are a volatile investment today, but card companies including Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are betting crypto will one day be used routinely for everyday purchases from food to clothes to plane tickets\u2014and they don\u2019t want to be left behind when that happens. Consumers now can make payments with cryptocurrencies linked to Visa and Mastercard cards provided mainly by fintech companies, but it\u2019s a niche market. And transactions generally depend on third parties converting the crypto to local currencies. Visa and Mastercard\u2014the largest card networks in the U.S.\u2014say they are working on ways to handle the mechanics of crypto payments themselves. These efforts, if they succeed, would mark a major turning point\u2014the first time that the decades-old networks would enable settling payments in assets beyond what most consider mainstream currencies. For now, the card networks largely view their efforts as geared toward banks, fintechs and other businesses they consider clients. But the moves could ultimately have a big impact on the way consumers and merchants make transactions. This could mean a future where it will be common to pay for sandwiches, clothing and other daily purchases by pulling out a card that\u2019s funded by cryptocurrency, similar to the way debit cards are linked to checking accounts. It could also mean more financial institutions begin issuing these cards for consumers and that more merchants begin accepting stablecoin or other crypto as payments. Some companies, including AT&T Inc., Overstock.com Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., already accept crypto payments from consumers. Uncertainties remain. One question is whether merchants will find a way to bypass cards altogether when taking crypto payments, saving themselves the fees that they pay when they accept debit and credit cards. Security challenges must be addressed. Some payments executives say nationwide regulation is needed to require financial institutions to have reserves to back cryptocurrencies they hold. Still, while the recent crypto crash has shaken some investors, payments companies have pressed forward with their plans for crypto-backed payments during similar drops in the past and now say they will continue on the same path. \u201cIndependent of the prices of any given crypto asset on any day, we are seeing continued interest from our existing clients and new developers coming into the space,\u201d said Cuy Sheffield, global head of crypto at Visa. \u201cWe want to\u2026take a long-term perspective on how crypto can impact payments and focus on adding as much value to the ecosystem as we can.\u201d  A Push Toward Crypto Over the past five years or so, crypto has moved from an asset largely isolated to wealthy investors and millennials dabbling in the possible next big thing to one that could become a rival in everyday consumer payments. The biggest U.S. card networks are concerned that not enabling crypto payments could mean getting cut out of a growing\u2013and possibly one day, dominant\u2013form of payment, according to people familiar with the matter. They also think consumers will want to pay this way. \u201cWe don\u2019t really see demand for that today but it may come; and so that\u2019s also a reason why we\u2019re investing,\u201d Jorn Lambert, Mastercard\u2019s chief digital officer, said at the company\u2019s investor day last year. Other large payments companies are expanding their crypto capabilities. PayPal Holdings Inc. began allowing U.S. consumers to pay with crypto last year. Instead of paying merchants with a card that they have loaded on PayPal, consumers can choose crypto that they store in accounts on the platform. The crypto is converted behind the scenes into local currency through a partnership with Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure platform. PayPal then sends the payment to the merchant. In June, PayPal said it would allow its consumer customers who have crypto on its platform to pay other PayPal users with it. \u201cWe are on the side of the debate that believes this is going to happen,\u201d said Jose Fernandez da Ponte, senior vice president of blockchain, crypto and digital currencies at PayPal. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we are three years or five years away from mainstream adoption, but that\u2019s something that I believe that we will see in a relatively short amount of time.\u201d Banks and other card issuers got a wakeup call, according to payments executives, as customers asked if they could use their cards to buy NFTs, the digital tokens associated with digital art and collectibles, songs and videos. Many sellers of NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, only accept cryptocurrency as payment. Though NFT marketplaces have cooled, Visa and Mastercard still see them as an opportunity and have begun working with third parties to get into the market. Among them, Miami-based fintech MoonPay since last year has enabled Visa and Mastercard cards to be used to buy NFTs. The capability launched in testing mode this year on OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces. When consumers who have crypto wallets\u2013or accounts\u2013use their cards to buy certain NFTs there, MoonPay purchases the NFT with crypto and then charges the consumer\u2019s card the equivalent amount in local currency plus a roughly 3% fee on average. MoonPay then transfers the NFT to the cardholder.  Trying Different Models Both Visa and Mastercard see fiat-backed stablecoins, with values pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar or other financial assets, as a testing ground for handling crypto payments\u2013though stablecoins, too, have been shaken in recent market turbulence. After consumers make a payment with a card linked to stablecoin, the networks want to be able to receive stablecoin payments directly from the card\u2019s issuer\u2013a bank or other financial institution\u2013and then send the stablecoin to the merchant\u2019s bank. Visa is also testing converting the stablecoin into local currency itself and sending it to the merchant\u2019s bank. The company is aiming to roll out the latter capability in certain markets globally before the end of the year. Many U.S. banks don\u2019t allow customers to buy crypto with credit cards they have issued because of pricing volatility. The concern is that cardholders might be more likely to default on their bills if crypto plunges soon after a purchase.  SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think cryptocurrencies will become a routine form of payment in coming years? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Visa is in the early stages of trying to share more information with issuers about transactions that involve buying cryptocurrencies so that they can make decisions about whether to approve them, according to people familiar with the matter. There is more willingness from banks to approve these transactions for consumers who have high spending limits, they said. Banks are also weighing possibly placing separate, lower spending limits for these purchases, they said. Some card companies are looking at different models for using cryptocurrency for daily transactions. In April, London-based crypto-services firm Nexo teamed up with Mastercard to launch a credit card backed by cardholders\u2019 cryptocurrencies. The card is available in Europe and allows consumers to put up their crypto as collateral in exchange for a spending limit of up to 90% of the crypto\u2019s value. Mastercard clears and settles the payments in the local currency. If the collateral\u2019s market price falls too low, Nexo could ask cardholders to repay part of their outstanding balance or to increase their collateral\u2013or risk Nexo selling parts of their collateral in order to lower their loan-to-value ratio. Nexo says it is planning to roll out the card in the U.S., though it didn\u2019t disclose timing.  Fighting Security Threats Payments companies say security breaches are a concern when it comes to crypto-card payments. Many people store crypto in wallets that sit on exchanges or other third-party services that are prone to getting hacked, which means that people\u2019s crypto can vanish. Over the past year, hacks have happened on large crypto exchanges and platforms. Somerset, N.J.-based CompoSecure Inc., a company that issuers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and American Express Co. use to develop their cards made of metal (a feature that started out on higher-end rewards cards and has spread to other credit cards), filed a patent last year for a security application for storing and paying with crypto. Last year, CompoSecure launched \u201cArculus,\u201d a smartcard that stores the private keys to people\u2019s crypto. Consumers open the app using their fingerprint or face, type in a PIN and tap the card on their phone in order for the transaction to go through. For now, the security measures apply to selling crypto and paying other people with it. CompoSecure says it\u2019s in discussions with major card issuers and others that are looking at adding the company\u2019s security feature to the chips that are on standard credit and debit cards. It declined to name the companies. People could then be able to tap their cards on their phones and, through a biometric or other secure login process, make crypto payments for NFTs and more.

For example, an NFT-backed cash value line of credit. The insurance company sends quarterly statements that get uploaded as Jpegs that anyone on the blockchain can audit. So anyone can be an \u201coracle\u201d since the insurance company is highly regulated they arent going to be fudging the numbers such that Maker is going to be left empty-handed. If it is risk-free collateral such that banks already issue billions of dollars worth of cash value lines of credit, then I don\u2019t see the high risk that is presumed by the Maker community. Or what about an NFT-backed mortgage with a 50% loan to value? How likely is Maker to take a loss in that scenario? Maker should be in the business of buying CLOs backed by digitally native assets like Untapped\u2019s Revenue Financing Assets. All of the Uber rides they give, purchases using point-of-sale devices, and all other investments are updated in real-time such that you can see whether a business is healthy or if it\u2019s in decline such that you should pull back on the size of the loan. If they can collaborate with Chainlink to have proof of reserves like Fluid FInance, that should mitigate the risk substantially. Just know that others like @humancapitol @BlockTower will be moving in this direction sooner or later. ",

Unless you think the HVB deal was not a good thing, this is the direction MakerDAO should be taking to scale DAI and do so in a risk-minimized fashion. The hardest part is finding solid collateral and domain expertise to scale that collateral. The easy part should be refinancing that collateral for a better yield spread. I already pay M&M bank Prime minus 35 basis points, why can\u2019t MakerDAO be the one to reap that interest rather than the bank? By the way, I already have a general agency with $40 million in permanent life insurance contracts willing to commit to refinancing these loans from their existing banks to a secured business credit card with cash back rewards that can be denominated in DAI or MKR. The only thing we need now is for the community to WANT it. This seems like a losing battle.     Federact:  Outsourcing makes sense, but I would rather use the term \u201cforming partnerships\u201d.   Yeah, the Maker community does not seem thrilled about \u201cforming partnerships\u201d with the likes of Bacon Protocol. People assumed that I had some kind of financial incentive because of how hard I advocated for them seeing as they have originated BILLIONS of dollars worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans through LoanSnap seems like they should know what they are doing.

Today the space for originating digitally native fixed income assets (our vision of the future) is still extremely early. I think this is a transition that will legitimately take a decade or longer, which we hope to accelerate by backing innovative companies that are bridging to that future (but doing so with an eye on serious, professional underwriting, due digilience, and structural protections to ensure we and, if the Maker community wants to partner with us, preserve principal) To your Bacon Protocol point - that was actually one of the projects that first got me so excited on this intersection. But I would say they sell billions of dollars to Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac for a reason; those GSEs have extreme advantages (i.e. basically taxpayer funded + revenue agnostic + efficient capital treatment) that make it an extremely competitive market for Maker to enter. It also doesn\u2019t do much to expand the use of DAI. But on DAI usage, there\u2019s reason to be optimistic! B2B distribution through Centrifuge, pretty much the only RWA platform that leverages DAI, does mean RWA generating entities are using this today. The key is B2B2C, which is a really attractive distribution channel for DAI, but that will require time and trust to be built with new, and even larger, communities. It will also require reasons to stomach switching costs, which @MarianoDP laid out much more eloquently (and with nuance) than I could. But I will say that after leaving TradFi, I\u2019m content having bet my life + career on the open innovation ecosystem and community, of which Maker is a huge contributor. ",

The payments stack is quite intermediated with a lot of potential for margin compression which would benefit small businesses the most, as for them the credit card fees probably represent the largest % turnover relative to other sized firms. This excellent resource has a great diagram about payments  image1322\u00d7600 67.6 KB  They talk about Apple Pay but it\u2019s informative for the other elements of the ecosystem. It has been a while since I looked at payments in detail but a few years back one of the web2 fintech disruptors was Klarna with their pay later instant credit checkout solution for e-commerce. Looking at this diagram you realize Klarna\u2019s actual innovation was finding a way to smoothly cut out a huge portion of the intermediaries in the mix. By replacing the checkout experience and offering instant approval credit, they were able to circumvent card associations, acquirers and issuers, getting between the bank and the customer with no other counterparties in the mix. Their business model may have evolved since then, not sure what it is doing now. It would have been a great match to offer native Dai integration to Klarna in its early days and help them break out of the balance sheet/volume chicken & egg problem. Hopefully one day a new and emergent piece of payments and credit infrastructure can tap into the Maker protocol to grow an independent and uncensorable branch of the financial services industry. ",

Also the business model has retail unknowingly paying these fees. Merchants pay the fees directly & hike up prices accordingly). Plus, a good portion of interchange goes straight back to the consumer as cashback rewards. In any case, the merchant makes more money from debit card transactions / cash than they do from credit card transactions, unless they explicitly charge credit card fees. This happens but more often than not, it doesn\u2019t. So if a merchant started to accept crypto cards, it realistically wouldn\u2019t make a difference to fees that retail pays. It would be just like retail paying with cash or with a debit card today. Further, with incentives set as they are, retail would still be better off using a credit card (for the cashback rewards) in most cases. ",

How does Maker best lead/participate in this growing market??   www2.deloitte.com    us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf 7.57 MB      When an American online retailer became the first major merchant worldwide to accept cryptocurrency as payment in 2014, it was big news.1 Since then, digital currency has entered the mainstream. Globally 220 million people use cryptocurrency now,2 and customers are paying for everything with it, from travel to sports tickets to mobile phone services.3 A radical shift has occurred in less than a decade, with once-wary customers and retailers increasingly viewing digital currency through an optimistic lens. In this study, we examine the role of digital currency in the rapidly evolving world of transactions. The survey focuses on US consumer businesses, with annual revenues ranging from below $10 million to $500 million and above, asking their views on digital currency payments and the investments they\u2019ve made in payment infrastructure, as well as their plans for the years ahead. The digital currency ecosystem is maturing, and the industry growth is continually fueled by the increased utility and accessibility. Overall, we find that merchants are receptive to their customers\u2019 needs and expectations and see business and enterprise-related benefits from embracing digital currency payments. These organizations have invested and plan to continue investing in enabling this capability. However, there are still a number of factors to be considered, such as infrastructure decisions, security, and the development of a regulatory framework that will determine much of the pace at which adoption continues to grow.

Adoption is rising year after year, the volatility argument as a deterrent is going to fall short in the short/medium term. With just looking at the biggest FIAT currencies struggling with inflation is enough to realize that they\u2019re not so free from the volatility effect. I believe consumers will, with time, adopt crypto as a way paying for everyday expenses given the experience will become more accesible and fees should tend to be cheaper than a credit/debit card comission.

Instead of credit checks it scans the apps in your phone to produce a risk profile and starts by lending very low amounts ($50-100) and as those are repaid the amount gradually increases.
