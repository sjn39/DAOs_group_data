Doo, I am a big believer in professionalism, accountability, and integrity. That being said, it probably makes the most sense to avoid shaming others. If we want to have a debate about a particular individual, let\u2019s come with objective data and acknowledge the sensitivity of the issue. If we are going to have a broad discussion on professional expectations (presentation, accountability, transparency) that should happen without specific references to named individuals. That being said, we do need a facilitator code of conduct with expectations around professional/personal interactions and the relationships between IC and Facilitators. Codifying these expectations is important. As we saw with the recent \u201cinformal\u201d meetings, there are currently mismatched expectations that are creating conflict and confusion. At present, we have an opportunity to address these challenges in a meaningful way, without finger pointing. Let\u2019s take it\u2026 ",

But it\u2019s more of social encouragement. There can be something similar for facilitators but I think the difference is if Delegates act in bad faith or violate codes, they are in theory punished by Delegators pulling their votes. For facilitators, it would be either pressure to change the facilitator or budget adjustments. But that\u2019s ultimately up to MKR voters ",

A document like this is sorely overdue. @iammeeoh @ultraschuppi @flipflopflapdelegate @rspa @PaperImperium @twblack88 please tag others where appropriate Anyone want to take a shot at leading a small working group to establish a facilitator code of conduct? Maybe the working group can produce a number of recommendations and we can have a request for comment period before formalized into some form of MIP? This seems like it could be a good task to get DVCs chugging along in parallel, could have some open calls to walk through the request for comment period, etc. These are of course just some informal thoughts but there appears to be an opportunity here.

But I\u2019m also against shaming in public as it is pointless and plain harmful to everyone and everything involved. My course of action if I had negative feelings about somebody else\u2019s behaviours would be:   Reach out and ask to help - it\u2019s amazing what people can discover when they actually reach out and offer help   If that doesn\u2019t work, discuss with someone I trust (perhaps they don\u2019t share my negativity? - as is clearly the case here as well). If we agree,  then reach out to the person together (still trying to be a human being first, but also being honest about our feared potential implications of that person\u2019s behaviour)   At this point, usually things solve themselves.  Shit happens to people, times are rough and this is the world where communities such as ours get a litmus test done. And btw. Scientific Governance does not exist without Humane Humans ",
