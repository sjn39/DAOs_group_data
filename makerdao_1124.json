The analysis below covers: (i) an overview of the Rocket Pool Protocol, (ii) rETH token metrics, and (iii) rETH\u2019s relationship with the RPL token (Rocket Pool\u2019s native governance token). Throughout this assessment, Lido\u2019s stETH is used as a comparable reference point for understanding and interpreting the risks and metrics of rETH. The relevance of comparing stETH to Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH is based on the fact that both are ETH staking derivatives that serve a similar purpose. Furthermore, the usefulness of this comparison is enhanced by the fact that Lido\u2019s stETH is already used as collateral in the Maker Protocol and is a clear leader in the staking pool field.

Rocket Pool was first started by David Rugendyke in 2016. The mainnet launched in November 2021. Rocket Pool, as a staking pool, offers several benefits compared to other forms of staking. These include (i) a low barrier to entry compared to solo staking (32 ETH requirement), (ii) a simple interface for end-users, and (iii) a liquid staking derivative token, rETH, which can be used for other purposes in DeFi.  Tokenomics The Rocket Pool Protocol is designed with two key stakeholders in mind:  rETH holders - Individual Liquid Staking Users The only requirement to stake through Rocket Pool is to own the rETH token. There are generally two ways to acquire rETH: (i) Depositing ETH in Rocket Pool\u2019s official staking front-end (minimum deposit requirement is 0.01 ETH), or (ii) buying rETH on the secondary market. rETH that is minted directly through Rocket Pools deposit pool contract will be locked for 24 hours to prevent timing attacks on the network.  Node Operators (NOs) Node Operators (NOs) can participate in the Rocket Pool Protocol by running \u201cminipools\u201d (Rocket Pool nodes). NOs need the technical knowledge to run the Rocket Pool Smartnode stack. The minimum monetary requirements for NOs to create one minipool is 16 ETH and at least 1.6 ETH worth of RPL tokens as insurance collateral. The process of creating a staking node through Rocket Pool works as follows: first, 16 ETH from the NO is matched with 16 ETH deposited by individual stakers from the Rocket Pool deposit contract. The resulting 32 ETH is then sent to the Beacon Chain deposit contract to create a new validator. Node Operators earn (i) staking rewards from their own staked ETH, (ii) a commission on the amount of ETH matched by individual stakers, and (iii) RPL rewards on the deposited RPL collateral. The Rocket Pool system consists of two tokens - rETH and RPL:  rETH rETH is Rocket Pool\u2019s staked ETH derivative token. Minting rETH is limited exclusively to the Deposit Pool contract. In effect, this acts as an intermediary for each new user depositing ETH in Rocket Pool. A detailed explanatory overview of this process is available in the rETH Technical Assessment. The minimum deposit requirement is 0.01 ETH. The deposit pool is responsible for accepting user-deposited ETH and assigning it to available minipools. The assignment of ETH is dependent on available minipools and Node Operators (NOs) and does not necessarily happen directly. Hence, ETH can lay dormant in the deposit pool for a certain period of time. The amount of dormant ETH that is allowed in the deposit pool is currently capped at 2,000 ETH. Users can redeem dormant ETH in the deposit pool by burning rETH.  RPL RPL is Rocket Pools\u2019 native governance and utility token. It serves four main purposes:  Supplemental insurance against slashing - NOs are required to stake at least 10% of the total bond value in RPL tokens when creating a minipool (i.e. 1.6 ETH worth of RPL per minipool). As an incentive, RPL issuance rewards are provided to NOs in proportion to the total amount of collateral that they provide. There is a reward limit at 150%. NOs are not able to claim RPL rewards if the RPL collateral drops below 10% of the ETH staked value. They then either have to wait for the ETH/RPL price to increase or deposit additional RPL tokens. The Oracle DAO (oDAO) provides regular on-chain snapshots of the ETH/RPL price ratio over time. In terms of RPL\u2019s role as insurance, Rocket Pool employs a Dutch-style auction system to cover the loss of ETH caused by slashed node operators. RPL collateral tokens are offered to users at a discount as an incentive to participate in the auction. The ETH collected from the auction is then deposited back into the protocol to compensate for the missing ETH, covering any rETH dilution. Incentivized rewards - Currently 5% of the total RPL supply is minted annually. The RPL issuance is distributed to key protocol players: (i) 70% to Node Operators staking RPL as insurance collateral, (ii) 15% to oDAO members who are providing oracle data, and (iii) 15% to the pDAO treasury to fund future development. oDAO bonding - A requirement to bond RPL tokens as insurance against bad-faith behaviour is mandatory before becoming a member of the oDAO. Rogue nodes that misbehave are ejected from the oDAO by other oDAO members. As a penalty, the original RPL bond is burned. Governance token - When the Protocol DAO (pDAO) is live, the RPL token will serve as a governance token for voting.   Governance The Rocket Pool Protocol is intended to be run by a \u201cDual DAO Model\u201d - one Oracle DAO (oDAO) and one Protocol DAO (pDAO). Further details and respective DAO responsibilities are set out below.  Oracle DAO (oDAO) There are currently 14 nodes/members in the oDAO. The Ethereum Beacon Chain is currently separate from the execution layer (in previous terminology ETH1). The main purpose of the oDAO is to relay data from the consensus layer (in previous terminology ETH2) to the execution layer (ETH1). The tasks of the oDAO members include: (i) monitoring the performance of all validators within the Rocket Pool network, and (ii) reporting and updating daily the internal balance and exchange rate of rETH. 51% of oDAO node operators must agree on the data that is reported back from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer (ETH1). oDAO members can be ejected by other members if they misbehave or go rogue. Since its inception, the oDAO has been running in \u201cbootstrap mode\u201d. To date, the Rocket Pool team is still able to tweak settings and parameters in the oDAO and the Rocket Pool Protocol. This includes smart contract upgrades. The team has stated that they will disable bootstrap mode in the oDAO by May 23, 2022. Full control of the oDAO will then be in the hands of oDAO members.  Protocol DAO (pDAO) The Protocol DAO (pDAO) is not yet live. According to the Rocket Pool team, the pDAO will be run by RPL holders. The pDAO will be responsible for several parameters and settings within the protocol. These include (i) annual RPL inflation and rewards distribution, (ii) RPL auction parameters, (iii) min/max minipool RPL staking amounts, (iv) minipool node commission fees, and (v) ETH deposit amounts and limits within the deposit pool. Since pDAO is yet to be launched, these parameters are currently controlled by members of the Rocket Pool team. As with oDAO, the intention is to use bootstrap mode during the initial pDAO rollout phase.  Metrics and Analysis  Supply & Market Share At the time of writing, the circulating supply of rETH is approximately 87,389 rETH. The growth of rETH over time is illustrated in the chart below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 26.9 KB  Source: Rocketscan To date, circa 12.6 million ETH has been deposited in the Beacon Chain Deposit contract. Rocket Pool currently makes up 1.31% (approximately 166,500 ETH) of all ETH deposited. This number includes both individual staker\u2019s ETH and node operator\u2019s ETH. In distinct contrast, Lido makes up 32.4% (approximately 4.19 million ETH) of all ETH deposited.  1600\u00d7572 131 KB  Source: Etherscan According to Etherscan data, the number of active addresses holding rETH is 3,525, averaging 25 rETH per address. By way of comparison, the total token supply of stETH is approximately 4.19 million with 73,781 token holders, averaging 57 stETH per address. This relationship suggests that rETH token distribution is currently slightly less centralised compared to Lido\u2019s stETH. However, such a comparison might be misleading as (i) rETH is much smaller in size compared to stETH, and (ii) the largest addresses holding stETH are trading venues and DeFi protocols. The two pie charts below show the top 10 addresses holding rETH and stETH. The chart on the left, rETH, shows that the top 10 addresses hold 46.45% of all circulating rETH. The chart on the right, stETH, shows that the top 10 addresses hold 74.46% of all stETH supply. The largest stETH address is the Aave Interest Bearing STETH (ASTETH) address with 34.1% of all stETH. Second in line is the Curve Liquidity Farming Pool Contract with 16% of all stETH. The largest rETH address is the rETH/wstETH Curve Factory Pool with 18.6% of all rETH.  1600\u00d7474 182 KB  Source: rETH - Etherscan & stETH - Etherscan  Token Value Accrual Mechanism  rETH rETH has a built-in value accrual mechanism to reflect the increase in staking rewards over time. The rETH:ETH ratio is determined using the following formula: (total ETH staked + Beacon Chain rewards) / (total ETH staked). In theory, rETH\u2019s value should over time increase relative to ETH since Beacon Chain rewards will most likely always be positive. The exchange rate is determined by the Oracle DAO (oDAO) monitoring the actual rewards earned on the Beacon Chain. The exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours. This is the exchange rate which is used by the deposit pool.  RPL The charts below illustrate the degree of correlation between ETH and RPL deposits in Rocket Pool. The 10% RPL collateral requirement when spinning up new minipools likely accounts for this correlation. There are currently 4,962,069 RPL staked in Rocket Pool. This equates to circa 30.6% of the circulating supply. The average RPL collateral ratio is 46.86%.  1424\u00d7416 158 KB  Source: DeFiLlama The relationship between rETH/ETH and RPL is also evident in price. As illustrated in the chart below, the price of RPL seems to be highly correlated to the price of rETH and ETH.  Chart1200\u00d7742 60.9 KB  Source: CoinGecko  Future issuance The amount of rETH issued is proportional to the quantity of ETH deposits in Rocket Pool. The rate at which ETH deposits can increase is constrained by (i) the deposit pool limit currently set at 2,000 ETH and (ii) NOs\u2019 ability to match ETH in the deposit pool (as explained above in the Tokenomics section). The chart below shows that the deposit pool was at full capacity almost every day from March 12, 2022, to May 9, 2022. This indicates clear demand to deposit ETH in the deposit pool, either from high organic staking demand or for arbitrage purposes.  855\u00d7427 30.8 KB  Source: Rocketscan The chart below illustrates the minipool growth over time. There are currently 5,528 minipools live in Rocket Pool, controlled by 1,177 node operators. By way of comparison, Lido currently has 22 node operators. Lido requires an approval and onboarding process for new node operators to join. Rocket Pool is permissionless, which has led to more node operators being able to join the network. However, Rocket Pool has fewer validators (i.e. ETH deposits) than Lido. The growth over time of minipools in Rocket Pool is illustrated in the chart below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 29.4 KB  Source: Rocketscan The pie chart and table below give further context on minipools per NO in Rocket Pool. The average amount of minipools per NO is currently 4.7. A majority of NOs maintain 1 minipool. 6 respective NOs maintain 100+ minipools each. The largest NO maintains 840 minipools.  1426\u00d7657 111 KB  Source: Rocketscan The growth of rETH seems to be constrained by two key factors:  The deposit limit in the deposit pool - The rETH value accrual rate (i.e. the staking yield for rETH holders) is a product of: ((staked ETH + ETH rewards) / deposited ETH). If the amount of deposited ETH increases faster than the amount of staked ETH, then, the value of rETH would dilute. This, in turn, would lead to a less competitive position for rETH as an asset. Hence, the deposit pool limit can probably only be increased in proportion to the growth of staked ETH in Rocket Pool. This means that increasing the deposit limit further is not a sustainable solution for increasing the rETH supply. A slow deposit pool to minipool turnover rate - The fact that the deposit pool was at its full 2,000 ETH capacity from March 12, 2022, to May 9, 2022, indicates that demand for NOs exceeded the available supply. This suggests that a slow deposit pool to minipool turnover rate may be a supply-side issue. In other words, either (i) there are not a sufficient number of NOs available, or (ii) the current NOs do not have enough capital/bandwidth to spin up more minipools, or (iii) both cases together. NOs need to have the technical ability to run the Smartnode stack as well as the necessary capital to stake 16 ETH and 1.6 ETH worth of RPL tokens per minipool. This means that for one NO to operate several minipools at scale would require a considerable amount of ETH and RPL capital. Some participants may also be reluctant to stake RPL tokens as the price of RPL may fluctuate, which in turn may require them to purchase additional RPL tokens to meet the necessary 10% collateral threshold to receive RPL rewards.   Token Deposits on Trading Venues rETH is available for trading on a growing number of exchanges. Up until now, Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer have had the highest liquidity. No top-tier CEX listings are available at present. It is also worth reiterating that the deposit pool contract itself can act as a trading venue. When ETH is available rETH holders can redeem the ETH by burning rETH. As a reminder though, it is not guaranteed that the deposit pool will contain a sufficient amount of ETH at all times. The amount fluctuates as a function of the amount of rETH burned by rETH holders or the amount of ETH matched by NOs. Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, and the deposit pool currently hold approximately 21,004 (24% of the total circulating supply). This is illustrated in the chart below.  Chart1200\u00d7742 25.7 KB  Source: Curve, Balancer, Uniswap, & Rocketscan  rETH on Curve The Curve rETH-wstETH Factory Plain Pool has the most deposited rETH when compared to other leading trading venues. At the time of writing, the pool contains 16,211.49 (76.25%) rETH and 5,050.51 (23.75%) wstETH. The pool is currently designed to maintain an approximate ratio of 77/23 rETH-wstETH. The wstETH token works similarly to rETH - it increases in value over time as Lido books validation rewards. The wstETH token was launched earlier than rETH. Hence, it is worth slightly more than rETH, and hence, with the current Curve mechanics the rETH/wstETH pool needs to maintain an unbalanced ratio to minimize slippage. The main difference between the rETH-wstETH Curve Pool and the stETH-ETH Curve Pool (the main trading pool for stETH) is that the rETH-wstETH pool contains two staking derivates that increase in value at approximately the same rate. Lido has to subsidize 50% of the stETH yield in the stETH-ETH pool, otherwise, users would be better off just holding stETH. In contrast, both assets in the rETH-wstETH pool are earning staking returns. Hence, the cost of capital is lower than the stETH-ETH pool. However, as previously mentioned by the Risk Core Unit in Governance and Risk | Ep. 184, from the perspective of the lender, the rETH-wstETH pool may be less reliable and subject to higher risk. If, for example, Lido\u2019s stETH experienced considerable slashing or a hack, and as a result, there was a sudden substantial discount on the wstETH token, then (i) Rocket Pool\u2019s rETH would probably absorb all of that discount, and (ii) in response rETH liquidity would be likely to rapidly diminish. So, in conclusion, pairing with wstETH makes the pool more capital efficient, but also probably entails more risk for the end-user.  Future rETH Liquidity Incentives On May 16, xToken Terminal proposed a partnership with Rocket Pool to boost rETH liquidity on Uniswap V3. They are proposing an rETH/WETH 0.05% fee tier pool with RPL incentivised rewards. Further details of the proposal can be found here. Integrating RPL incentivised rewards on Uniswap V3 would result in further slippage reduction for rETH. It is worth noting that this is still only an early-stage proposal that has not yet been accepted by the Rocket Pool community or the Rocket Pool team. However, it is clear that (i) there is still room for improvement in terms of rETH liquidity and slippage reduction and (ii) Rocket Pool is currently in conversation with relevant parties and is actively trying to improve liquidity.  Downside Risk The observed time period in the chart below is from November 23, 2021 - to May 6, 2022. The data is taken from CoinGecko. rETH tends to have a similar frequency and severity of negative pullback compared to ETH.  Chart1200\u00d7742 15.9 KB  Source: CoinGecko The health of rETH is dependent on the ETH/rETH ratio working as intended. The chart below illustrates how the ETH:rETH ratio changes over time.  1600\u00d7475 117 KB  Source: @NDGcrypto - Dune Other exchanges on the secondary market, subject to market forces, may report different exchange rates. In theory, arbitrage opportunities should balance variations in exchange rates. Nevertheless, it should be noted that if liquidity is low on the secondary market, then this could make rETH more susceptible to trading at a discount.  Defi Presence / Integrations  Alchemix (beta) WETH + rETH:  $796,950 TVL  Curve rETH + wstETH: $43.4 million TVL  Balancer WETH + rETH: $15.3 million TVL  Uniswap: $102,000 TVL   Bancor: $334,000 TVL  Yearn Curve rETH Vault: $1.3 million TVL  Arbitrum - L1 ERC20 Gateway: $3.29 million TVL  Optimism - Gateway: $2.29 million TVL  Polygon (Matic) - ERC20 Bridge: $145,000 TVL  zkSync: $359,000 TVL    Future rETH DeFi Integrations Further DeFi integrations will probably lead to higher rETH demand and liquidity. However, if rETH is onboarded to the Maker Protocol, it will be important to continuously monitor the state of rETH, and any additional integration, in order to modify relevant risk parameters according to new and evolving market dynamics. For example, in April 2021, Rocket Pool posted an rETH token proposal on the Aave governance forum. This was before the mainnet release of Rocket Pool. However, 10 months later, it was brought back into the limelight. If rETH is onboarded to Aave, recursive yield farming may become the optimal strategy for end-users. This would be similar to the way stETH leverage has already accumulated in Aave. Such a scenario can in effect worsen liquidity if the leverage were large enough and a majority of borrowers were to unwind at the same time.  Summary of Notable Risks   Smart contract risk: Previous technical audits include (i) Sigma Prime (ii) Consensys Diligence and (iii) Trail of Bits. Rocket Pool also has an active bug bounty programme with Immuni.Fi. To learn more about technical risks associated with the Rocket Pool system, read the [rETH] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment.  Execution risk of Ethereum\u2019s Upgrade Path (Previously the Ethereum 2.0 Roadmap): All staked ETH derivative tokens are susceptible to price volatility if there is a crucial bug in either the merge or the post-merge hardfork. Two tokens in the Maker Protocol are already directly affected: (i) WSTETH-A and (ii) CRVV1ETHSTETH-A. So while adding more staked ETH derivatives could diversify other types of project-related risks, the execution risk of Ethereum\u2019s upgrade path would increase.  Governance Risk - Bootstrap mode on oDAO: While the bootstrap mode is enabled, a guardian address can upgrade certain contracts and adjust settings unilaterally. The Rocket Pool team stated that they intend to disable bootstrap mode on the oDAO on May 23, 2022.  Governance Risk - Bootstrap mode on pDAO: The pDAO is not live yet. The pDAO will have bootstrap mode enabled during its initial phase. This means that a guardian address will still be able to adjust certain parameters intended for exclusive control by the pDAO. These include (i) annual RPL inflation and rewards distribution, (ii) RPL auction parameters, (iii) min/max minipool RPL staking amounts, (iv) minipool node commission fees, and (v) ETH deposit amounts and limits.  Liquidity Concerns: The Risk Core Unit has previously communicated concerns regarding rETH liquidity and market capitalization. In response, the Rocket Pool team has stated that they are working on improving liquidity. Currently, the Curve rETH-wstETH Factory Plain Pool pool is the clear leader in terms of rETH liquidity. The main risk with that particular pool is the wstETH dependencies. Pairing with wstETH makes the pool more capital efficient, but also probably entails more risk for the end-user. Finally, the recent Uniswap V3 liquidity incentive proposal by xToken Terminal may further improve the liquidity of rETH on Uniswap.  Decentralisation vs growth: It seems that demand for NOs exceeds the currently available supply. In other words, a slow deposit pool to minipool turnover rate may be a supply-side issue. In addition, the RPL collateral requirement imposed on NOs may also impede growth as certain participants can be reluctant to purchase RPL tokens. RPL is a volatile token that requires a rebalancing of collateral to meet the necessary 10% collateral threshold.  Slashing or Rogue Node Operators: Individual stakers are most likely hedged against something happening to node operators. This is because node operators have to provide both 16 ETH for each validator + at least 1.6 ETH worth of RPL tokens. If ETH, for whatever reason, is lost, it will be taken from the node operator\u2019s balance or from the RPL collateral. In addition, this process is socialised, meaning that it is spread over the whole network. This process mitigates the rETH staking derivative from diluting in value.  Added technical complexity by post-merge upgrades: There are several ideas available in the Rocket Pool Research Github that may be developed and implemented after the merge. If the Rocket Pool community decides to develop additional features, this may lead to added complexity and added technical risks. However, such risks can only be accurately quantified once relevant data is available.

For example, Rocket Pool seems to be structured as an opaque legal entity and has been censoring comments that try to find more about the ownership structure of the RocketPool company and the persons associated with RocketPool and their UBOs. This thread sheds more light on this topic : https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/usxf0m/concerns_about_rocket_pool_from_a_minipool/ Rocket Pool\u2019s response to these concerns was to ban those asking the questions. Additional comments and thread on the topic:   https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/usvsir/daily_general_discussion_may_19_2022/i96w3v1/   https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/uvpoj6/rocketpool_banning_comments/   This kind of action of banning and censoring away concerns is extremely unbecoming of a decentralised protocol, much less one that seeks to be included as a collateral in the Maker DAO ecosystem. While it is great to have diversity in staked ethtereum derivatives, Maker DAO must also be aware of the risks a centralised entity like Rocket Pool (that does not hesitate in censoring critical questions) can pose to the larger Maker ecosystem .

TLDR: they were banned due to mistaken identity, not the questions they raised. Their access was reinstated days ago.    reddit   r/ethfinance - Rocketpool banning comments 57 votes and 15 comments so far on Reddit      Additionally, our community answered many of the concerns regarding centralisation in the original post:    reddit   r/rocketpool - Concerns about Rocket Pool from a minipool operator's... 50 votes and 27 comments so far on Reddit      Ultimately, Rocket Pool Pty Ltd and Rocket Pool the protocol are separate. As a core team, protocol sovereignty is very important to us and we go to great lengths to limit our influence. As an example of this, we announced and executed disabling bootstrap mode for ODAO functions (mentioned in the report). If you have any other questions I would love to answer them in the /r/rocketpool sub-Reddit or preferably in the Rocket Pool Discord. ",

It is our responsibility to ensure that the Maker Protocol\u2019s risk profile is mitigated at all times. In general, a lower DC is normally proposed when the @Risk-Core-Unit makes initial parameter recommendations for a new collateral type. The DC can be increased over time if (i) there are no immediate risks preventing increased exposure, and (ii) there is relevant traction/demand for the particular collateral type. If rETH is onboarded, the debt ceiling may change going forward. However, this is not guaranteed. The DC may be decreased if other technical risks that we were previously not aware of are identified by other core units performing other assessments. Finally, we have previously explained our concerns regarding rETH liquidity. We also reiterated these concerns in the risk evaluation above. More information here. We want to be sure that rETH used as Maker collateral can be sold in a timely manner without a large price impact. To do so, the liquidity of rETH has to be sufficiently large relative to the debt ceiling. We believe that (i) if liquidity is low, a low debt ceiling is more appropriate, and (ii) if rETH liquidity increases, then and only then, might there be an opportunity to safely increase the debt ceiling.
