Resources  Uniswap website Uniswap FAQ Documentation Github Twitter  UNI FORUMS PINK BANNER Welcome to the official Uniswap Governance Forums! Below we have provided a template on how to structure your Uniswap proposals in order to offer a more comprehensive & efficient deliberation process.  Proposal Structure  Title: [Enter Proposal Title] Author(s): [enter name(s) of associated authors] Related Discussions: [paste link here] Submission Date: [Enter Date]  Body Paragraphs:  Simple Summary: Give us a TL;DR on your proposal; no more than 2-3 sentences. Abstract: Introduce and expand on the proposal. Highlight key points on how the proposal will improve stakeholder/tokenholder experience, protocol performance, and the overall implementation process. Motivation: What problems will this proposal address/solve? What\u2019s the value-add? Specification & Rationale: Go all-out and explain the rationale & vision for the proposal! How will this affect the protocol both technically, socially, financially (if applicable), and governance-wise? Benefits (Pros): Provide benefits as to how the proposal implementation will advance the protocol. Downside (Cons): Are there any disadvantages with implementing the proposal? Voting: Define what a \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote entails. If there are any Snapshot votes or forum polls associated with this proposal, please attach it.   Governance Process For the sake of transparency, accountability, and consensus we would like to structure a cohesive flow that will assist with the transmission of governance proposals, temperature & consensus checks, and high-traction proposals. Please, provide TLDR update on the top of your proposal so it is more easily accessible Here is a quick outline of how the governance process works:   Submit a forum post (Proposal Discussion section).   Get in touch with Uniswap Discord Admins to discuss your proposal in a community call and on Twitter Space as well.   Create another forum post in the Temperature Check section and publish a snapshot (temperature check) vote with 2-5 days voting time. This action requires at least 1K UNI tokens delegated or self-delegated. For the snapshot to be valid, at least 25k UNI should participate.   Update the temperature check post incorporating community feedback.   Publish a snapshot (consensus check).This action requires at least 1K UNI tokens delegated or self-delegated. The snapshot would be deemed valid if at least 50K UNI participates   Escalate the proposal to an on-chain vote. It is required to have at least 2,5M UNI delegated to do it. Fish.vote gives smaller holders a chance to congregate and gather enough votes to push proposals on-chain.
