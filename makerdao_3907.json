At the unsolicited request of members of the community \u2013 and to be even-handed given the due diligence I performed with the first MarComms proposals \u2013 I went through a moderately intensive process of due diligence on AmaZix. While I could talk about how their historical core competencies appear to be mostly in the realm of moderating Telegram and Discord channels rather than branding or marketing, opine that they never clearly seemed up to speed on exactly what Maker does, or point out some fairly adversarial exchanges with community members, I will mostly focus on the responses I received from their current customers. I reached out to as many current customers as I could. Several graced me with replies by either email, Telegram, LinkedIn, or Zoom call. I will note in advance, I was never able to get a real reply from Bancor, who appears to be AmaZix\u2019s largest client in crypto, and has been with them for a while. Bancor I can only assume would at least provide neutral or positive feedback about AmaZix, given the length of their relationship, but we can only speculate. While I did get one response from a project that was very positive, my main finding was that multiple current clients told me they plan to end their relationship with AmaZix. More current clients said they were already planning to discontinue using AmaZix\u2019s services than provided positive or neutral replies. Generally, there was nothing exciting in the reasons given. No malfeasance or terrible personalities. It was an overall lack of performance. These are quotes from multiple current customers. One of them is even on the provided \u201cList of Notable and Successful Engagements\u201d in the AmaZix presentation: \u201cNot delivering value honestly.\u201d \u201cNot that great.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a real strategy, just good presentations.\u201d \u201cHonestly we didn\u2019t like AmaZix too much. Our community didn\u2019t like them, too\u201d \u201cWe have worked with another team before AmaZix for community management and marketing services and they were definitely 100x better than AmaZix.\u201d \u201c[We] will not move forward after this month.\u201d Perhaps AmaZix can do something for MakerDAO that it has not for its current clients. But given that some of the very same names that are listed as examples in their own list of clients are this unhappy with them, I think there is no reason for MKR holders to vote anything other than NO. You may vote NO here. Thank you to AmaZix, who spent quite a bit of time engaging with us. Please don\u2019t let this dissuade you from coming back with narrower or different proposals \u2013 particularly if you can bring a number of customer references that would be willing to speak with us.

                    "content": "Hi PaperImperium, 1. First of all, I would like to briefly reiterate our success story As mentioned in the proposal document, AmaZix humbly served the crypto space since 2017, developing from a company of 6 founders to be named the largest full-service blockchain marketing agency, ranked #1 in 2021 by Software World. We employ a powerful team of 80+ staff, contractors, and partners worldwide and have successfully worked with 250+ blockchain projects in these four years. Growing from community and social media management services, we have steadily expanded our service offering to include (among the others): global public relations, website design and development, primary and secondary market research, pay per click (PPC) advertising across social and display and remarketing networks, blockchain and mass media influencer outreach, investor relations, webinars and AMAs, viral and growth hacking while expanding an award-winning creative team. 2. The Importance of organic growth vs. hype We know our customers, and since the beginning of our business history, we have strived to promote a professional, measured, organic approach embedded within all our services. We fronted the hyped approach adopted by many of our \u201ccompetitors,\u201d based on fake vanity metrics. The reason is that, while our team has vast experience in blockchain and marketing, our management business background comes from +100 years of previously cumulated experience with traditional corporations. We know how to get to the required results without getting burned through shortcuts. Having to fight unrealistic expectations is also part of our job, and as a company ethos, we prefer to make things clear with our customers from day one because we know this is the route that will bring better results in the long term. It\u2019s a matter of trust, and trust takes time to be built: it\u2019s by far the most valuable asset we have. We are here to be a reference company for many years to come, together with our team of professionals, with our well-thought approach against any hype. We are AmaZix. 3.

My experience working for a global corporation like Bloomberg taught me that reputation matters. It matters to potential clients, users, vendors, employees, job applicants, anyone who interacts with the organization. You treat everyone with respect, and no one is beneath you. In MakerDAO\u2019s case, reputation matters to our partners, users, the community, and anyone who is considering joining our community. Conducting all the discussions openly has been great achievements indeed. In addition, in a regular organization, the management and HR ensure fairness, and they make sure no one is treated differently based on their race, gender, age, etc. In the case of MakerDAO, there\u2019s no one in charge of such a role, and we can only assume everyone in the community strives to hold a high standard and act in good faith. If MakerDAO wants to be successful, every one of us in the community needs to keep that in mind. Not to mention unconscious bias, cognitive bias, and stereotyping that can be easily overlooked. Those subtle forms of discrimination hurts diversity we seek, and potentially detrimental to the MakerDAO community. ",
