                    "content": " Unified Auctions UI Release v1.5.0 - July 5th 2022 Version: v1.5.0 Name: Lewis  v1.5.0 in a nutshell With the start of July the usual holiday season starts, but this doesn\u2019t prevent us from shipping release v.1.5.0 of the Unified Auctions UI. In this sprint, we made a lot of progress on the implementation of the dedicated UI for flap auctions. In addition to the usual fixes and polishing, we are shipping the support of custom RPC URL support for those who want to run the UI or the keeper locally with their own node or provider. With this update, we make sure that auctions aren\u2019t interrupted by network switches or hot refreshes. That\u2019s why this update doesn\u2019t have the name of an auction house as usual. This time it is named after the auctioneer James Lewis. He holds the world record for the longest auction by a single auctioneer. So, no interruptions!  A closer look at changes  RPC URL support Up until now, we relied on the usage of an Infura project id to get the UI and our keeper implementation running. This was a limiting factor in terms of adding redundancy, but also a limiting factor for users. Because users may use different providers or custom / local nodes to set up an own instance of the UI or the keeper implementation. With the new release, we are enabling this possibility and allow usage of custom RPC endpoints. It can be specified via the RPC_URL environment variable. Find the updated readme on required environment variables, especially when it comes to spin up a keeper instance. Feedback is always highly appreciated.  Flap auction Implementation (WIP) We have executed on our plan to introduce a new UI for flap auctions that was presented in our last release notes. Getting closer to a release of the feature. We once again want to emphasize that we are building in a flexible way to adjust if there are changes to the whole logic of flap auctions at any point in the future. For now, a lot of the required components required for the desired user flow have been built. On the logic side of things, we also hit major milestones like fetching of auctions and interacting with auctions. In the next sprint, we are aiming to bring those pieces together and have a first working flow.  Smoother network switches Representative for a bunch of smaller UI and UX improvements, we ensured that the page is no longer refreshed on network switch. Especially for heavy users and those switching between networks for testing purposes, the whole flow is no longer interrupted by a hot refresh any longer. ",

The main focus of the last two weeks was to improve, harden and refactor parts of our code base. After shipping the surplus auctions feature with the previous release, the time was right to focus on minor and major adjustments. These also involve additions to the existing UI that will improve the overall UX. Today\u2019s release is called Simon Baker, the founding father of the well-known auction house Sotheby\u2019s. Baker conducted his first auction in 1744 and today Sotheby\u2019s enjoys an excellent reputation. Such a development is not possible without a rock-solid foundation - such a rock-solid foundation is what we are striving for in our products as well. And it requires constant care as we did in the last sprint.  A closer look at some changes  Withdraw Dai Panel  WithdrawDAIPanel1348\u00d7724 68.6 KB  We have extended the surplus auction flow with another panel that allows a user to withdraw Dai from the VAT immediately after the auction was collected. Before, we only provided the option to withdraw Dai via the wallet popup. With this additional panel the whole engagement with a surplus auction from bidding, collecting to withdrawing Dai is supported. The different panels reflect the current state of the auction as well as the required prerequisites for auction participation. This facilitates a streamlined and guided experience for an auction participant.  Improved auction navigation  Since we claim to be the go-to destination for all auction-related use cases, we want to ensure the best possible and low barrier navigation for the user. With two supported auction types and the landing page to the Unified Auctions UI, we saw the need for an easier navigation element. It allows to easily navigate between sites. We also ensure that relevant data is properly fetched immediately. No cumbersome search for the correct UI to participate in the desired type of auction anymore.  Further adjustments Without further details following is a list of other fixes and adjustments:  Cleaner component folder structure Profit calculation adjustments for collateral auctions Improved SEO Fix overflows and incorrect icons Fix network switch modal Fix wallet disconnect Fix authorization status fetching between different auction types  ",

                    "content": "Unified Auctions UI Release v1.6.0 - July 15th 2022 Version: v1.6.0 Name: Artcurial Before jumping into this sprint\u2019s release updates, we share here a concise update of the state and traction of the products operated by our CU. As a recap, our mandate focuses on the following 2 goals:  Always have a working backstop solution for every kind of auction Increase accessibility and awareness for participation in auctions  For that, SAS builds, operates and maintains three distinct products for the protocol:  Auction Twitter bot  Auction keeper Unified Auctions UI   For the first goal, we particularly look at exotic auctions for which there are no specialized players to take them early (meaning those vault owners would get a bad result). This is where the backstop is most important. Looking at the newer collateral types CRVV1ETHSTETH-A and WSTETH-B, we have seen one auction each so far and both were taken through our products - so 100% If we look at a wider range of collateral types, excluding only the 3 blue-chip collateral types ETH-A, ETH-B and WBTC-A, we saw 79 auctions across 16 different collateral types this year. 37 of those were taken through our products - so 21% If we include all collateral types and offboarding auctions around 10% was taken through our products this year. Overall, there is currently a backstop solution for every collateral type, and we ensure that new collateral types are on boarded fast into the products. For our 2nd goal, let\u2019s have a look at website visitors of the Unified Auctions UI. Since April of this year we saw a total of 3055 unique visitors on our Unified Auctions UI, with increasing numbers of 429 visitors in April, 866 visitors in May and 1600 visitors in June. The increase in visitor numbers is mainly driven by the various heavy market downturns resulting in high liquidation days. This is why we saw visitor peaks especially during these three periods:  19.04 - 20.04 09.05 - 12.05 11.06 - 19.06  On the 13th of June at peak the Unified Auctions UI had ~90 concurrent auctions and everything ran smoothly. With that said, let\u2019s turn to our regular sprint update and have a closer look on what we\u2019ve built and shipped throughout the last two weeks.  v1.6.0 in a nutshell In the last sprint, we put all of our focus on releasing the first functional version of the surplus auction support. And today we are thrilled to announce that we reached our goal and hit another larger milestone. We are proud to hit the next big milestone. For that reason, we named our newest update Artcurial. The French auction house has managed to hammer a number of international record results. That is the spirit. We aim for the best results and are eager to hit the next big milestone!  A closer look at changes  Surplus auction support  Screenshot 2022-07-15 at 15.41.113104\u00d71972 546 KB  First things first and to stress it again: With ongoing discussions about whether to bring back the burn and an open outcome on the actual design and mechanics, we aimed to build the UI and its underlying functionality in the most flexible way. This will allow us to adjust to any changes that might come in the future, like an adjustment to the lid parameter or a potential upgrade of the flap auctions to liquidations 2.0. For us, it was a reasonable decision to have a backstop solution in place already that caters to the current flapper design. With the narration-based approach, enrichment of relevant auction information, proper covering of different auction states and the panel-based approach we make use of proven components that are already used for the collateral auctions. In doing so, we do not only want to achieve a uniform auction experience, but also guide the user throughout the whole flow of auction participation. After this release of the first fully functional version that was tested locally, we now want to harden the feature and also provide a testing scenario in order for users to give feedback on the functionality and UX. Watch out for an update in our next release notes. ",
