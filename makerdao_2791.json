                    "content": "TL;DR With Real-World Assets being on-boarded hopefully soon as collateral, the community needs oversight of the off-chain lenders and be a proxy for confidential information that cannot be shared in a public forum. Ideally not only one Maker Representative per lender, ideally more. MKR\u2019s governance and risk, needs you ! \u2013 Real world assets are coming as collateral to the MakerDAO protocol. With each transaction where DAI is minted for an off-chain transaction, the community can only assess the true risk of the transaction (and price the capital accordingly) if the risks are known. Further, unlike \u201ctraditional\u201d crypto transactions, the real-world has legal complexities and sequencing that make a huge difference to determine compliance. Further, unlike a crypto transaction governed by code, off-chain lenders must follow the agreement between the parties. As Maker is a DAO (literally), it cannot inspect a transaction. It must rely only on information being reported back to the DAO. While off-chain lenders can do this with the confines of what they are allowed to share publicly, the community needs to elect \u201cone of its own\u201d and new folks to interact with off-chain lenders and report back. For virtually all of these transactions, reputation is built with time. The risk to Maker is largely front-loaded, especially for a new off-chain lender. An annual audit of the financial statements is useful, but getting started the community should push for earlier spot inspections. Specific to 6s\u2019 LendCo structure, not only do I request a Maker Representative, I invite it, encourage it, and clamor for more oversight from a cohort of Maker Representatives. Depending on the community turn-out, 6s\u2019 LendCo may only have one. Having many Maker Representatives serves three purposes.  MakerDAO distributes the trust across many Maker Representatives to have better comfort and insight and ensure compliance. Maker Representatives gain more credibility within the community the more each attests in a similar manner in concert. LendCo diversifies its risk as it looks \u201cbetter\u201d the more compliance it demonstrates.  Subject to the community approving the MIPs that I have put forth, the remainder of 2020 will largely be reserved for administrative setup with hopefully time for a deal or two. During the course of 2021, the gloves come off, and 6s turns-on the deal machine. MakerDAO needs Maker Representatives. LendCos need Maker Representatives. I will be volunteering to be one (for other off-chain lenders) if the community grants me this role. Links: Translucent Finance Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender What a Maker Representative needs to do: Required Activities:   Execute a non-disclosure agreement with an off-chain lender   Review lender\u2019s legal setup and construct   Review lender\u2019s transactions on a spot and quarterly basis Confirm:  Independent Financial Statements and confirm they were delivered timely No operations outside of approved scope No loans above portfolio threshold issued Equity requirements for all loans in compliance All loans issued are either performing or under construction Report back to the community the abstracted summary of the above:  Fully Compliant Compliant with minor comments. Material Breach - Not in compliance.      Note: The Community can easily replace Maker Representatives ! Compensation: This role builds your credibility within the community and could evolve into either a community compensated role or a LendCo compensated role. (TBD) Indemnification: 6s (as a LendCo) will be indemnifying any Maker Representative for his / her role. Further, at the Maker Representatives discretion, a legal entity may be used to serve this role as well to provide further legal protection. An initial list of candidates that I would like to be nominated as a Maker Representative:  @Planet_X @MakerMan @SebVentures  @g_dip (1*)  (1*) He may be conflicted as he works at or w/ the Maker Foundation, though he does have significant business background that the community should want.  The above list is not set in stone. If you are interested, please feel free to volunteer below. We need folks from the community to step-up and help !  UPDATE: Based on the below thread, the below is the current list of folks volunteering. Given that this role is an administrative oversight role for the benefit of the community, I recommend the community appoint all of them as Maker Representatives with a known requirement that a Maker Representative must recuse himself / herself should their be a clear conflict (e.g. I should not be a Maker Representative \u201cassigned\u201d to my own project, but that doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t be a Representative one day).  @psychonaut @Planet_X @MakerMan @flipflopflapdelegate @maarten @mario @iammeeoh @ejbarraza @SebVentures spin  (hit the limit of user mentions!)

In many ways, one could view it as a thank-less role. On the other hand, it is an essential role that gets the Rep \u201cin the deal\u201d and can see what is actually being done. So, from a United States perspective, think of it not only being in Congress but being on the Intelligence Oversight committee. That is my thinking.     iammeeoh:  However, at the same time, I think we eventually need forms of security mechanisms that prevents/discourage bad (even illicit) behaviours of Maker Representatives.   On this, I completely agree and why having many of them is important. For example, one could easily imagine LendCo getting extorted by a bad Representative (e.g. pay me 50k or else I will tell the community that you are cooking the books\u2026 etc.)     iammeeoh:  This sounds more like insurance for Maker representatives   That is correct. It is for the Representative.     iammeeoh:  Maker Representative should (somehow) have stake in the game (related to the RWA they are dealing with).   He / she should be somewhat familiar with what they are supposed to watch-over. To start, we have what we have. For now, my role in running LendCo is to answer questions to the reasonable satisfaction of the Maker Representative. And the Maker Representative should \u201chammer\u201d me with questions to understand what is going on. Now, the transactions contemplated are the same over and over. It is more about ensuring that deals are in-scope (10seconds), approved tenants (30s),  equity moves first (1min), and review the docs that show that LendCo has the senior lien (3min). Of course, there is more than that, but the spirit is that LendCo has the obligation to tee everything up for a review. The review itself might take time the first cycle, but afterwards they will be routine.     iammeeoh:  This could be in the form of locking some assets until the job is done (well), or stuff like that. Has this type of considerations already been discussed?   So in the context of \u201cbusiness staking\u201d\u2026 for now, today, I believe the community reputation is sufficient to get started. We can always evolve it with time. ",

From early on in my career, 20 years ago, I have been involved with energy and real estate investments, not only in Europe but also in the US and other countries across the world.

Let me know, and if it doesn\u2019t we can try another time.
