From what I\u2019m aware, gas tokens aren\u2019t an intentional feature of the ethereum protocol, and I think there are active proposals to remove the ability to use them, so investing dev time might not be a priority for the uniswap team. You can look up the EIPs to see exactly what\u2019s being discussed. When you airdrop a token you inflate it\u2019s availability and likely reduce its price, if it goes to people who\u2019re just going to sell it. What would we be trying to incentivise, with another airdrop, that would be beneficial for the uniswap project as a whole? Pursuing another airdrop without a justification sounds like you\u2019re just looking for a handout. ",
