I organised with a group of very nice people the \u201cBlockchain for Society\u201d meetups in Amsterdam, Berlin, Leipzig and Hamburg before moving forward to start my own company inblock.io to support the growth of the blockchain space. Since a long time I\u2019m very interested in governance but recently things fall in place how governance and blockchain play together. This is my main interest regarding the Ethereum community - to connect and to find ways how we can find new governance mechanisms which can help to coordinate for and around  distributed systems. For that reason we also initiated the dgov.earth #dgov18 conference in Athens this year. Next to governance my focus remains in the security aspects of distributed consensus technologies. I believe that we need to achieve a state where we can trust those platforms to be mission critical. Together I hope that we can archive an inclusive, sustainable well being for anybody through distributed consensus technologies. My twitter is https://twitter.com/tim_bansemer ",

I\u2019ve totally drank the koolaid, but I\u2019m also very pragmatic and want to work on general things to extend all blockchains that come out of the space. For the purposes of Ethereum, I am going to be spending a good bit of time on state-channels as these are going to be the only thing that possibly prevent ethereum from being trounced by other chains in the short run. It\u2019s important to not blindly believe that sharding and PoS are going to be finished and work, we didn\u2019t intend to need scaling this soon, but the fact is that we need it now.

I\u2019m Lenny or The JhonnyJason - probably the best describtion is the cog that fits no machine^^\u2026 I\u2019m very philosophically interested since ever and since 18 years of age somewhat on the path to technological mastery. First weirdly arrogantly through the pathway of the Technological University in Graz - then after I finally flunked out and had some good adventure with attempt on gf +  family. I finally found the path to deal with my inner insecurities and the issue about feeling simultaneously superior to everybody else and inferior to everybody else. Which finally allows me to really evolve as a developer and not just expect of myself to know everything in beforehand xD - then judging myself and everybody to not have known better. On this path I also have a strong opinion of what to work for makes sense and what not. One reason why I constantly run on a negative Budget^^ - though minimalism FTW, frees up your time. Now I like the perspective very much that this imperfect world is the best opportunity to live out that sense. There is so much to be done and every little bit helps. Especially all that what we may do with such a plattform like Ethereum the whole Ecosystem evolving right now in the space\u2026  it is the perfect time for an upgrade of our financial systems and democrazy. So now I\u2019m here from an halfway sophisticated fullstack-webdev background and just starting to develop on some Smart Contracts. There you are, I\u2019ve got you, be very much appreciated  Cheers! ",

I learned about Ethereum in 2016 and immediately started experimenting with smart contracts. Once again, I let my skepticism get the best of me. After heavily trying to convince people around me that this was the future, I ended up conceding to the argument \u201cit\u2019s a great tech but there\u2019s no real use-case\u201d. In 2018, it was my greed that got me back to it, prices had just surged so I put all I could of my savings in crypto and started doing web3 hackathons. Got a few prizes at some of them, and since then, I just never stopped. I discovered this forum while googling \u201chow to propose an EIP\u201d. I\u2019ve been working on a Visual Novel game engine for a little while and I\u2019d like to come up with a standard way to store players\u2019 progress and choices on a smart contract that would represent the story.

I have written and helped eth from the start but also projects like bitshares (wrote the whitepapers to make it more decentralized after 2014) and worked with them and the steem creators, its been a wild journey. Today I work with GitLabs and also have my own organization called Cryptocurrencies Sweden https://cryptosweden.eu (still beta) We are developing a decentralized internet called Unigrid today.  But im here to connect back to my old community, my first wallet was the old MEW wallet, before it was MEW for those who remember, it was still a beta back then but are not MEW and Jaxx. If someone who is good with old smart contracts and how to work with them trough proxy can reach out to us/me and get rewarded for helping us to upgrade these contracts either trough proxies or something. I tried it myself, with a proxy to gnosis vault and by mistake transfers 8 million. So will not like that to happen again.

The control token themselves can be any type of token and recursively circulated in the token circulating system. See this paper for more details. ",
