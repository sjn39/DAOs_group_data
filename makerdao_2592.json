Tokens are not sets of eyes/brains. In general it\u2019s agreed that the wisdom of the crowd is \u2018a thing\u2019. The larger the pool of people we have scrutinising every vote and every decision the more likely it is that one of them will spot something that endangers the system. Arguments against this can normally be summarised as: \u2018The best argument against Democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.\u2019 There is some truth behind this too, but we are building this community around the principle of scientific governance. We emphasise the value of evidence when making decisions, this principle should help to mitigate the danger of a large group of people with false beliefs influencing the system.  #2 Those who hold large amounts of tokens will tend to fall into a narrow subset of demographic groups. Most people don\u2019t have the amount of money required to purchase a large amount of MKR tokens. I would also claim that the western world got a \u2018head-start\u2019 on owning MKR tokens (the project originated in the west.) If we want the DCS to be a net benefit to the less fortunate, we need to hear those voices in the governance process. If we want the DCS to become a global bank, we need to attract people around the world to the governance process. People from different backgrounds and cultures will have different ideas about how to govern the system, we need those ideas! We need their participation to avoid the same pitfalls as the legacy financial system. If we send the message that MKR tokens are all that matter, we will drive those people away.  #3 We need to build our community and tokens can\u2019t do anything. Tokens are not humans, they are not capable of productive work. The more people we have taking an interest in MakerDAO and devoting time (paid or unpaid) to contribute to discussions, to development and to community projects the better. Now the DCS is not MakerDAO, and MakerDAO is not the DCS, but the DCS benefits from the expansion of MakerDAO (and vice versa). Ultimately without people driving MakerDAO, the DCS will not reach its full potential. Why am I talking about expanding MakerDAO when we\u2019re talking about voting in the DCS? Because voting and small MKR ownership is one of the key introductions to the project. Every small MKR voter is an expansion to the pool of humans that could potentially become active community members. This pool of active community members can potentially become employees of MakerDAO. The larger our recruitment pool, the better talent we have access to.  TLDR: There is way more at stake than the security of the DCS, our goal should be to get as many people as possible voting. ",

Whales, like the Foundation, A16Z, \u2026 could provide a certain % of their MKR holdings to increase governance adoption by giving it away based upon a set of predefined criteria like motivation, location, education, age, social level, participation \u2026 you name it. Interested people could apply by writing why they want to govern and why they would be an asset to the overall governance system and get the voting rights of a certain amount of MKR, for a certain amount of time. After a while, when they have proven to actually be an asset to the system, they could become owners of the MKR they were managing. Essentially, I\u2019m suggesting a delegation-system, with the option of handing over the MKR to the delegated address when a certain set of criteria are met. Increasing MKR holders, even by giving it away \u201cfor free\u201d, is actually in their (whales) best interest IMO because if decentralised governance doesn\u2019t take off on a much larger scale, the system doesn\u2019t stand a chance anyway IMO.

Except, and I know this is a bold statement, call upon MKR whales to distribute MKR to interested parties,  for free .   Bold indeed. In general I find myself agreeing. The people that are taking part and voting with small amounts of MKR now are people we want to stick around in the future, they\u2019re the people that are doing it because they care, rather than for monetary incentive. Providing those people with monetary incentive cements their future participation and rewards them for the work they\u2019ve already been doing for free. All that said. I\u2019m fairly certain I wouldn\u2019t want to lose a chunk of my MKR to pay for this if I were a whale. The logical source for this would be the Foundation, but I\u2019m sure there are many demands on the dev fund already. Another potential source would be voluntary inflation of the MKR token which could then be distributed to active governors, or put up for delegation as you suggest. In this way we could ensure the cost was spread across all owners of the system. ",
