We have been working EIP-1167 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1167.md) through the process.  To date we have had few comments directly, but we do have several users of this code in production.   While not ground breaking, we believe a standard for this will allow third party tools to provide better user experience for contracts that implement hard-wired proxies.  We are planning on submitting a PR to move the EIP to LAST CALL status today with a two wee\u2026     Perhaps an EIPs/Last Call subcategory would be useful? What do you think @Arachnid @jpitts? I do think the site can help in getting the word out on last calls. ",
