                    "content": " Overview We have been running our PSMs with zero fees for some quarters already (original Signal Request, onchain poll, executive). While that helped to keep the hard peg to USD our stablecoin-ratio has more than doubled from 34% to more than 80% until today. It should be noted that the Maker white paper describes a soft peg rather than a hard peg.   The vast majority of the stablecoins is coming from the USDC-PSM. USDP and especially GUSD have not been equality utilized   We have lowered the Stability Fees to encourage vault holders to mint DAI from crypto collateral, but so far this hasn\u2019t helped much on the stablecoin ratio but instead is just cutting even deeper into our revenues. A softer peg can create arbitrage opportunities for vault holders potentially increasing their utilization. A more detailed explanation on the mechanics of the PSM including some discussion can be found in the pre-SR post I made here.  Proposed Actions  Increase the tin on the USDC-PSM In simple English, this will put a fee on every USDC->DAI swap using our PSM. Arbitraging DAI prices above 1 USD will only happen on the PSM, if the price is above 1 + tin, otherwise the actor will not make a profit. As an example if the tin was 2 bps we would expect the DAI peg to be between $1 and $1,0002  Pros  recreating a freer market on the DAI-price (related post by @michwill from Curve) recreating the arbitrage use case for crypto-vault-users reducing the inflow of new USDC into the protocol Possible decentralization of stablecoin-exposure: might move some stablecoin out of the USDC-PSM into the two other PSMs we are running some (probably not a lot) profits for the protocol Setting the \u2018tin\u2019 too high can potentially reduce the inflow into the PSM to zero   Cons  as there is an upwards push on DAI price, we might drift north of 1 DAI = 1 USD (limited through the tin) and by that breaking the promise of an hard peg may hurt gelato-vault-users Setting the \u2018tin\u2019 too high can potentially reduce the inflow into the PSM to zero Changes to the PSM mechanics in general can reduce confidence in the protocol, potentially losing users that are expecting mechanics to work a certain way.   Poll: To which level shall we set the tin  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     0 - no change 1.0 bps (0.01%) 2.5 bps (0.025%) 5.0 bps (0.05%) 10.0 bps (0.1%) 25.0 bps (0.25%) 50.0 bps (0.5%) Abstain     0 voters      Increase the tout on the USDC-PSM This will put a fee on every DAI->USDC swap using our PSM. Arbitraging DAI prices below 1 USD will only happen on the PSM, if the price is below 1 - tout otherwise the actor will not make a profit. As an example if the tout was 2 bps we would expect the peg to fluctuate between $0,9998 and $1.  Pros  recreating a freer market on the DAI-price (related post by @michwill from Curve) possible decentralization of stablecoin-exposure: might move some stablecoin out of the USDC-PSM into the two other PSMs we are running some (probably not a lot) profits for the protocol   Cons  driving peg of south of 1 DAI = 1 USD (limited through the tout) will not immediately get compensated by USDC outflow from the PSM, as the DAI price needs to be below 1 - tout before this happens will reduce the outflow of USDC from the PSM, slowing down the desired effect of reducing USDC-exposure breaking the promise of an hard peg may hurt gelato-vault-users   Poll: To which level shall we set the tout  Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.     0 - no change 1.0 bps (0.01%) 2.5 bps (0.025%) 5.0 bps (0.05%) 10.0 bps (0.1%) 25.0 bps (0.25%) 50.0 bps (0.5%) Abstain     0 voters      Next steps The polls will run until 2022-09-01T22:00:00Z ; their outcomes will result in two separate onchain polls assuming there is majority for any of the non abstaining options.

Limiting my comments here to the following: Any opening in spread should be equal in both directions, also a rate of opening should be limited to 1bps/week with a maximum of 6-10bps to start (tin/tout 3-5 bps).   An official PR notice not just targeting GUNI holders, but all DAI holders, integrators etc regarding MakerDAO intention to loosen DAI PEG warranted.   I am not even sure 4 weeks notice will be enough for people so expect some unexpected blow back on this. 6-10 bps isn\u2019t going to be enough of a spread btw to create a healthy decentralized PEG management market and such a market isn\u2019t going to be created overnight.

This seems like behavior that should be discouraged as it will push away retail users and users who simply don\u2019t want to play that game. A hard peg is desirable for the vast majority of people who don\u2019t want to get into highly competitive trading. Additionally, this USDC is supposed to be invested into real world assets, generating the protocol revenue. If we start adding friction to the PSM, then in the long run it should result in less USDC being put into the protocol, which also means less available for us to invest and thus less revenue. ",

Soft PEG management is selling short DAI when the price is high (providing liquidity), and covering when the DAI price is lower (absorbing liquidity).

SebVentures:  As stated, the problem is not the peg, our problem is our inability to focus on investing our balance sheet. Sure, creating an inferior product might helps.   We should note that any fee increase has ripple effects to investable assets. Basically adding fees can affect organic dai which results in lowering pool of funds investable for bonds. I am divided, but since the recurring revenue has decreased significantly, liquidation revenue will be less prominent going forward and we need other revenue streams I voted for the minimum 1bps. Ideally I think the 1bps should apply only to trades when the PSM is above 3bn. ",

Having 3.4b in USDC is effectively no different than having 3.5b in USDC exposure - it\u2019s still existential. Apart from setting the fee to 10%+ or something huge we will not have significant difference in USD exposure and at that point we will probably just lose users due to not being a stablecoin anymore. RWA companies that are wanting to get DAI in and out of USD treat having to deal with an unknown spread vs 1:1 redemption very differently and it will be yet another roadblock to finding borrowers. I\u2019m concerned we are just fiddling with existing knobs because people feel stuck, and this adjustment will have a very real, non-linear damaging effect on the protocol. ",

TRUEMAKER:  Dynamic PSM pricing would be a great way to adjust PSM fee based on reliance parameters. Setting PSM fees based on USDC collateral ratios using a bracket structure. E.g. < 25% = 0bps 25% to 50% = 1bps 50% to 75% = 2 bps   I went to PE office hours to ask this very question. We could set up an IAM for this and I think that would be a couple of milestones.  Why not zoidb\u2026now? Slowly working towards a dynamic peg is more important than ever. Especially with everyone awakening our OFACtory senses. But. we should be steady and try for an actual roadmap as an outcome. Otherwise, as @hexonaut notes, we\u2019re just tinkering levers without a plan. The steps I could muster from way too many office hours and research were:  add tin fees to a reasonable amount like 10 bps. @makerman actually did some digging on the full route on transactions for RWA here and it seemed like 10 bps anyway. <\u2014 we are here Simultaneously, adjust GUNI CR so vaults enabling peg markets returns. As backup, we keep the code ready to shift it right back to 0 again. <\u2014 we are missing this part allot for timing on this initiative, maybe 3-6 months, to see if new net GUNI positions open and debt cycles out of 1:1 and into vaults. <\u2014 we could assemble a data set here before doing the first two. Add an IAM for USDC so new demand is encouraged to use external markets or use GUNI. Reducing the amount of DAI minted for free. Would prefer this to be based on solid data. Add the reverse IAM for gigabear 40% down-candle days to turn fees off. (aka \u201cthe full Burban\u201d) Assuming we have exposure limited down, liquidity is cycling, vaults are opening, and IAM\u2019s are in place, consider other market vaults. 3pool comes to mind ( but I\u2019m unsure if thats a great solution against the risks). We could also evaluate D3M-ing into places where liquidity would be useful and earn the protocol fees as a result. see that @Saludiego_201 is on the same wavelength with more GUNI types. Plenty of options here that need further research.  My hypothesis is deep liquid markets with guided incentives would push a higher velocity peg and , counterintuitively, a stronger one. So if there is deviation, it doesn\u2019t get throttled/cornered.  As of right now, we have a stuck peg which is good for PMF, sort of, but doesn\u2019t help us grow sustainably against the risks associated. ",

This means that GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A may fall out of range slightly under certain conditions - not necessarily a deal breaker but something to be aware of. Larger tin/tout (eg 10 bips) could begin to impact GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A vault. I think to an extent we\u2019re kind of working against ourselves here, as these GUNI vaults provide measurable benefits to censorship resistance and limit liquidity risk of unilateral actions with delayed judicial review such as Circle blacklisting/freezing.

The PSM was a hack that ultimately breaks the game by stunting the system\u2019s innate market incentive mechanisms. We\u2019ve artificially boosted Dai total supply but with no revenue and at the expense of existential risk to the system. To answer your question, yes, the system can handle diverse collateral because it can use the surplus buffer to recapitalize itself if any particular type of collateral is frozen or goes to zero. The system should be generating revenue on that collateral to insure that risk. At this point, not only is all of this USDC a real systemic risk for the protocol, but it\u2019s also a giant reputational risk for Maker that can scare away organic Dai holders, as Dai becomes more risky for individual holders of Dai who could see their holdings significantly lose value if the USDC adapter is frozen, vs. those users just holding USDC directly because their individual risk of blacklist is lower. A TVL is smoke and mirrors, it\u2019s all risk and no reward for Maker, it doesn\u2019t benefit Dai holders, it doesn\u2019t benefit vault holders, and it\u2019s not worth keeping on the books. Worrying about LP holders doesn\u2019t make much sense either, with the ranges so tight there\u2019s very little impermanent loss as their position will convert to 100% USDC with minimal slippage before moving outside of the tick range.

I don\u2019t think DAI really falls under this category even with existing 0% PSM fees, because the DAI<>USD peg is maintained through incentives, rather than obligations. If PSM reserves were exhausted due to large withdrawals, DAI would no longer be redeemable and may trade below target price but this wouldn\u2019t lead to a default, because DAI has no obligation to pay holders $1 on demand, only incentives to maintain value close to target price. In this sense I think DAI is still soft pegged as initially described even though our PSM fee strategy has resulted in very close adherence to target price. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re breaking with tradition of maintaining a soft peg as long as we avoid creating strict obligations to counterparties (DAI holders, vault users, RWA borrowers) and remain in the realm of incentives. That being said, there may be good reasons to widen DAI\u2019s PSM fees. ",

As a reminder, Signal Requests are a form of approval voting, and for options in a Signal Request to proceed to an on-chain vote, they require a majority of non-abstain voters to support them. In this instance, 3 options that support a change from the status-quo tin have received more votes than the status-quo option, but none have achieved a majority of support from non-abstain voters. The closest at present is the 10bps option which has attracted 47.8% of non-abstain voters. In contrast, the status quo option has attracted support from 36.3% of non-abstain voters. We encourage all community members to weigh their votes carefully and to consider supporting compromise options where they feel appropriate. As always feel free to reach out to one of the governance facilitators if you have any questions or concerns about this decision. ",

                    "content": "My TL;DR opinion  This vote is inconsequential. Drop USDC collateral. DAI could do it better, more global and more efficient but right now DAI is worse than almost every stablecoin in every way. Adding PSM fees has negligible upside and more downside to DAI. USDC PSM should be dropped. Focus should be on better collateral and boosting authentic demand. I\u2019d vote for no change.   Longer form justification\u2026     brianmcmichael:  The simple fact is that Dai was never designed to have a hard peg (see: The White Paper), despite certain \u201cpromises\u201d by certain community members, and it\u2019s the soft peg mechanism that is responsible for it\u2019s long-term stabilizing features. The PSM manipulates the market, chases away our own paying customers, and adds unacceptable levels of risk to the protocol. Maker will survive and thrive if it is allowed to operate as designed, but as a wrapper for USDC it is not sustainable or interesting.   I agree with @brianmcmichael. My longer form rants in here may have obscured this. IMHO this vote is inconsequential because additional PSM fees brings in negligible revenue and makes DAI even less attractive than it already is compared to just straight USDC. At present, with DAI you absorb the same risk as USDC but then slap on smart contract risk and more hops, which is inefficient to just acquiring it (or other stablecoins) directly through centralized exchanges or the issuers themselves. The main reason (I think) people are acquiring DAI is to arb, to avoid KYC, flashbot attacks, the vault yields or some lethargic user behaviour because they are legacy users/ETH whales. DAI benefits from being the first stablecoin available in DeFi with enough liquidity and there are still some coin markets on DEXs that have better DAI pairs. However, this has been changing rapidly since 2020 with the rapid growth of USDT and USDC as a result of their multi-chain pushes. DAI has lost demand value outside of these use cases and is being propped up by the Oasis UNI vaults, other protocols holding it as a reserve asset, and some of the other lending/yield markets. This is already waining compared to USDC and USDT and, as others have mentioned, adding a PSM fee will likely accelerate this vs. other stables. Like @brianmcmichael mentioned, at 0% the protocol is currently subsidizing arbitragers for very little gain given that demand has still been declining compared to other stables. The problem is not the PSM but that the value of DAI is currently weak and is harder to acquire via the protocol vs. other stables in the competitive landscape. I too think the PSM should be removed and the market should price the intrinsic value of DAI and MKR based on token economics, utility and vault ease of use/revenue. I\u2019ve always felt this way. The issue prior to 2020 was not the lack of PSM. It was that there was not a strong and diverse enough demand for DAI and the collateral backing (ETH) was too concentrated, volatile and correlated to the demand activity. It makes sense that USDC was added at the time but it was the wrong move and RWA and/or other crypto collateral that can be revenue producing would have been better. As I\u2019ve mentioned in other forum posts, what would be a better use of time and a differentiator would be:  to remove the USDC PSM; focus on reducing USDC exposure; and consider focusing on alternative uncorrelated collateral as well as protocol revenue generation to boost DAI stability and DAI and MKR demand.  Right now based on the End Game the focus is on using USDC to ultimately acquire more ETH or stETH. IMHO this is a marginal improvement and only improves on revenue generation potential due to PoS staking but does not help reduce correlation at all and then we\u2019ll be in the same situation that caused Black Thursday. In fact, the End Game proposal might actually make the correlation to crypto market movements worse due to lack of liquidity and the oligopoly forming around stETH concentration\u2026   consider focusing on alternative uncorrelated collateral as well as protocol revenue generation to boost DAI stability and DAI and MKR demand.   If we look at how other groups have tried to tackle this problem:   Celo\u2019s strategy of diversifying collateral has been on the right path for stability but is very capital inefficient. The collateral ratio has been extreme at as high as 5X, the capital is just parked and are not used for productive means.   Terra started to move this way but did it poorly and with too much hubris.   OHM was on the right track with using the treasury for productive means but didn\u2019t diversify their market making strat and ended up being the bag holder for unproven projects and their own OHM DEX pools with an inflation schedule that vastly outpaced protocol owned revenue.   All have some good ideas but have failed to execute well. This is DAIs opportunity to learn from those and get back into the lead. By putting treasury towards productive economic activity to boost its value is the right path and will be what drives demand and maintains stability for DAI more than anything else. IMHO other good RWA collateral (lending, treasuries, bonds, etc.) as opposed to just crypto collateral is a better diversification strategy and could still enable a very tight peg (hell maybe even a premium) due to the quality of the collateral and global distribution. The risk of this approach is introducing more censorship/counterparty risk but by using centralized stables like USDC we\u2019re already inheriting this risk without the yield benefits. IMHO cutting out Circle and doing this directly with more diverse yield source than US treasuries this is a better path if done right but requires sacrificing decentralization in the short term to achieve a better form of it long term. I think there is significant demand for a USD pegged stablecoin that is not domiciled in the US but has a strong and diverse collateral backing, better transparency, and reduced custody and collateral risk. Tether has proven the demand for this but has failed on every other point. This is something DAI could achieve but is currently floundering and adding PSM fees doesn\u2019t help get there either. ",

The fact that these holders have used and benefitted from reliable 1:1 redemptions as a core product feature goes beyond \u201c\u2018promises\u2019 by certain community members\u201d. The introduction of PSM fees would result in a DAI with noisier peg, and make various processes like allocating back and forth between DAI and USDC in a lending market inefficient. Fwiw, I completely agree about efforts to greatly reduce the size of the PSM by deployment into other productive venues. The amount of liquidity needed to reliably smooth the peg is much lower than the current PSM USDC balance. Just don\u2019t think adding a fee is the right approach, would rather see the replacement built first and PSM USDC deployed into RWA or on chain markets like Aave. From a user perspective, reintroducing peg noise is a HUGE change, and should not be viewed as simple or natural just because it was the original design. ",

The DAO should not accept any proposals from these parties until that retrospective is published and they can explain just how they went so wrong. My own hypothesis, unaccompanied by bedazzling graphs, is that raising the tin on the PSM will reduce the percentage of Dai that is backed by USDC. Doing so may reduce the total supply of Dai. That\u2019s OK, it\u2019s not making us any money, it\u2019s not attracting any vaultholders who pay us, and at this point the composition of Dai is an embarrassment for many of the developers working on this project, and it puts us at real risk from regulators. This is the simplest and most effective way for us to stop digging the hole that we\u2019re in. ",

In the absence of the G-UNIV3DAIUSDC vault, I would agree, but there is still be robust liquidity for swapping in and out. If anything, increased swap volume drives more liquidity to stable<>DAI pairs since less volume would be routed to the PSM. As fee switch discussions pop up which potentially make this less viable, perhaps actions should be taken to create a Maker twAMM, or reviving the discussions around increasing Maker liquidity on Curve.

They\u2019re not really comparable in their historical contexts though, and because Rai was a response to MKR holders actions it was always going to be in Maker\u2019s shadow. At this point, Rai does not have the existential problems that Dai has, so time will ultimately tell which was the best path. Anyways, I\u2019m not here to be a yes-man for Rune. The PSM is a problem, and he should know it. ",

Here is a chart showing change in PSM inflows as of when the fees were shut off which was around August 29th, 2021:   Rather than what feels good, let\u2019s start with the facts. The PSM tin Fees were set to zero in the November 5, 2021 Executive Spell, not in August. Prior to that the tin fees were enabled, but no fees were being earned because the PSM was unwinding. (More on that below) With that context, here\u2019s that same chart with that date indicated.  849c978dc8e26bf77a927ebab0ba3251deebd7972226\u00d71020 216 KB  It\u2019s pretty clear that changing the fees to zero resulted in an aggressive uptick in USDC PSM usage almost immediately, which has continued to the present. Because Maker is now taking the Dai/USDC trade market almost entirely by itself, we\u2019ve arrived at this situation where we\u2019re discouraging ecosystem actors from managing the peg via liquidity and standing limit orders. We\u2019re hurting Dai adoption by taking opportunity from the market. Anyone who has tried to sell Dai on Coinbase in the last few months knows that it\u2019s been consistently below \u201cpeg\u201d there and liquidity is light against USDC. This is because we\u2019ve taken the opportunity away from ecosystem market makers to earn anything on a spread. These are the \u201cempty shelves\u201d that the PSM was predicted to cause and that were described in the pre-MIP discussion of June 2020.     hexonaut:  As you can see not only was there no change in inflows in fact shortly after the PSM started outflow. So the prediction that PSM size would not increase by more than 200m was correct, and in fact that number was a vast over estimate.   When we re-evaluate this graph based on facts, we see that there was no change in inflows in August, and no fees earned on the USDC PSM between August and November. This was not because of any change to the USDC PSM, but because a USDP PSM was added in August with lower fees than the USDC PSM. There were relatively few inflows to the USDC PSM during that time because they were filling up the USDP module with other regulated stablecoins instead. Anyways I look forward to seeing the updated analysis in your postmortem. ",

I mean, it\u2019s clear that there cannot be a 100% agreement of who was right/wrong, right?

Also, we have lost the opportunity for over 1 year now of at least making money from these USDC bags. And now Maker is (1) not making money and (2) exposed to significant centralised risk. At the cost of sounding as the typical \u201cbag holder\u201d, let me add that MKR\u2019s value is basically back at the prices of pre-PSM (late 2020), after a pump-and-dump that many shitcoins had. So there are reasons to be unhappy about the status of things NOW and about the performance over the LAST TWO years. I think it\u2019s pointless to point fingers and accuse each other of bad choices. But I think the scientific governance process must indeed go over \u201cpost mortem\u201d\u2019 's as @brianmcmichael calls it, and try to imagine what the ideal choices would have been and what opportunities were missed.     brianmcmichael:  and no repercussions or retrospective analysis when the \u201cexperts\u201d are wrong.   Indeed. What are the incentives for them to criticise their own choices or make post-mortem? The fact that a member of the PE core unit, motivated by his own passion for the protocol (and also a MKR holder probably), had to come out from his \u2018technical\u2019 job to try to awake the community in a certain direction is quite worrying in my opinion.

The history of a DAI at par value What can we learn from it? Strategic Finance   Summary  The price stability of DAI was expected to be managed by rate settings and speculative arbitrage; This didn\u2019t work in the aftermath of Black Thursday when DAI liquidity was needed to close borrowing positions, nor during DeFi Summer. A risk-free arbitrage was introduced with low Collateral Ratio USDC-A and finally the PSM Balance sheet of MakerDAO can now be expanded by DAI demand and no longer only by DAI supply. Fees (tin) on the Price Stability Module (PSM) were removed on November \u2026     I stand by my work. The hypothesis of max 200M was not invalidated as the PSM exposure decreased after fees where set to 0bps (so you might say I was wrong if you like). The impact on DAI <-> USDC trading activity started immediately so any change in the USDC holdings from arbitrage should have seen quickly as well. On the other hand:    [Signal request] Set PSM fees to 0%   As we get closer to the peg the liquidity gets deeper and it requires us to take on increasingly more USDC to reduce that spread. Our 3 billion USDC represents the long tail pricing that gets us to the price that we\u2019re at now, but that\u2019s small change compared to what it\u2019s going to cost to hit true market parity.   We are at 4 billions, so if 3 billions was small change we are still in the small change territory. We haven\u2019t increase the exposure in USDC relative term. Part of the increase is also du to a drop in crypto-backed loan demand, due to a crypto-winter. Now, if we want to attribute the crypto-winter to the 0bps on the PSM, sure, I recognize it started only a few days after which is suspicious.     iammeeoh:  At the same time I tend to agree with @brianmcmichael : our experts (and, myself as a random follower, I should add) did not anticipate that DAI would become (referred to as) a \u201cUSDC wrapper\u201d.   A simple search on the forum shows clearly that the \u201cUSDC wrapper\u201d narrative was way before the PSM at 0bps. We are backed by more than 50% stablecoins for almost 2 years. The real problem is why we are not getting at least the risk-free rate on all our assets. Something I\u2019m working on for more than a year, getting a lot of critics for it and finally starting to take shape. We are finally at a stage where we can put all this capital to work with MIP65, Coinbase Rewards, Backed Finance and others. There is exactly no reason why a 6 billion balance sheet can\u2019t generate at least 120M of annual revenues. If we don\u2019t care about the peg we can even invest it in more illiquid venues and earn more (but then I make the hypothesis that we will get less DAI so it\u2019s a tradeoff). ",

In my haste I was just looking at the fees. You are correct the spell to set tin took effect on November 10, 2021, but the broader point still stands. If we look at that date the point that no more than 200m USDC would flow in on that day is still correct:  Screen Shot 2022-09-09 at 8.27.28 AM546\u00d7818 27.6 KB  Brian is making an argument that this lowering is somehow responsible for all the USDC we onboarded after this date. This is not how causation works. It\u2019s similar to arguing that because you ran your fan on high in your backyard for a week and a month later a hurricane shows up that you somehow caused this hurricane. I can steel-man their side of this if that helps: The belief is that if we allow for a spread on the DAI price then people will show up with ETH and short-sell DAI against USDC to push the peg back down so we get more ETH on our balance sheet. The problem is this is an incredibly wasteful position to take. To get the price to move any significant amount you need hundreds of millions of USD worth of ETH, and even then you pocket ~1% (assuming 100bps tin) IF someone else indirectly takes over your short position as you can\u2019t unwind because it will just push the price back up. Would you lock up your ETH for potentially unlimited amounts of time for a ~1% return risking liquidation, opportunity cost, etc? We have the answer to this because it\u2019s what we were relying on after Black Thursday. The truth is nobody will do this because it\u2019s a bad deal. It\u2019s as simple as that. I get where the other side is coming. They don\u2019t like the USDC and RWA stuff, so they want to make incremental shifts in the other direction any way they can. Problem is small increments on certain properties such as tin can have outsized negative effects. Not everything is linearly related. ",

Totally agreed, I just don\u2019t think this is a good thing. G-UNIV3DAIUSDC is inferior to the PSM, as it imposes greater costs on DAI users and involves rent-seeking by the issuer, who takes a fee which could otherwise be retained by DAI holders or earned by MakerDAO. In my view, a Peg Stability Module is a strictly superior solution for providing reliable liquidity at peg than a Uniswap style AMM. Recently Binance merged the books for USDC, USDP, BUSD, with users paying no cost regardless of which of these units they deposit or withdraw. They did so not out of altruism but because by removing user friction to swap between stablecoins, and then deploying the dollar denominated deposits productively, they benefit their core business. They will keep as much as possible in BUSD under the hood, and keep only the minimum amount of other denominations. MakerDAO should do the same thing, allowing zero fee mint and redeems with tier one stablecoins, then swapping most of what it receives into more productive real world assets so there is not a large USDC balance held on hand. In this way, there is no tension between maintaining the functionality of the PSM and greatly reducing USDC balances. Allowing DAI to be minted 1:1 with USDC does not mean holding that USDC for long is required. Tldr, not only is a PSM fee not guaranteed to reduce PSM balances, it removes the great utility of the PSM while still maintaining the risk of the large USDC balance! There is no good reason here that DAI holders need to have entry and exit taxes imposed. edit: I do think there\u2019s a lot of room for innovation from the basic PSM, as you suggested with Maker twAMM idea. Something more like a \u201csingle direction Univ3\u201d might be optimal, we\u2019re brainstorming ideas for internal market maker module also. ",

We\u2019re now in a position where we are overexposed, to an unacceptable level, to risk in a certain jurisdiction. The point of going to multi-collateral Dai was to mitigate risks posed by any particular collateral type, and those mitigations would necessarily include jurisdictional risk. With >80% USDC and/or RWA making up a significant amount of risk in a single jurisdiction, the protocol has failed at properly mitigating risk. Taking our foot off the gas pedal is the first step to fixing it, but keeping this value at zero will be a clear commitment from MKR holders that meaningless short-term vanity metrics are more important than the long-term safety and stability of the protocol.

The problem is this is an incredibly wasteful position to take. To get the price to move any significant amount you need hundreds of millions of USD worth of ETH, and even then you pocket ~1% (assuming 100bps tin) IF someone else indirectly takes over your short position as you can\u2019t unwind because it will just push the price back up.   I see people on the decentralization side talk as if this isn\u2019t true. The current deviation between the market price of DAI and the DAI peg is much less of an incentive to do anything than the expected future direction of change in the deviation. Individuals will short-sell DAI if and only if there is an expectation of its price declining beyond that of shorting behaviour of other actors. To act without this expectation is incredibly reckless. This one of the reasons that RAI modifies the target rate. With a changing target rate, there is a future expectation of deviation back to par that benefits shorting behaviour. Without a changing target rate, this incentive does not exist and it does not work to stabilize the price of DAI. TL;DR selling borrowed DAI at $1.01 today is no good to you at all if when you want your ETH back you have to pay $1.05 for your DAI. Without a mutable target rate, DAI is not guaranteed to be stable against the par. Without a PSM, DAI is not guaranteed to be capped at the par on the upside. If we feel that it is necessary to clear the RWA/PSM exposure, we will need to either implement a negative target rate, or allow the market price of DAI to deviate significantly above par. ",

The counterexamples of course being Sai, MCD before the PSM, and LUSD as depicted above. In a real multi-year bear market, when dollars are leaving crypto to go to other asset classes, Dai will be persistently below a USDC peg, and the PSM will unwind as people seek redeemability. Further, MKR holders will be scrambling to unwind all of these off-chain solutions to try to push the peg back up. This system, and all decentralized systems like it, are trailing response systems, it takes time for changes to propagate downstream. People seem to want or expect block-to-block responses here, but that\u2019s not the system that was built here, and trying to force it just manipulates the market and perverts incentives. The price of Dai will stabilize as the system matures organically, scale is inherently built in to the design, but when the innate incentives are tinkered with the market manipulation creates adverse effects and stunts healthy growth.

I will list 2 that we have experience with:  In a system without a PSM, a depeg to the upside, where the magnitude of the depeg represents the magnitude of the demand mismatch In a system with a PSM, a positive balance in the PSM, where the size of that balance represents the magnitude of the demand mismatch.  So 2 questions: Would increasing tin change the demand for DAI? Might lower it because DAI would be less \u201cstable\u201d. This would decrease the demand mismatch, but only by pushing a less user friendly product. Would increasing tin change the demand for DAI generation in CDPs? Realistically, a tin of 50 bps (all else equal) would alter the peg from $1 to $1-$1.005. So users could open debt positions at the upper end of the peg with the hope that when it was time to repay, the price would be closer to the $1 side of the peg, for an overall max favor of 0.5%. I very highly doubt this is a strong enough incentive to change anything. Thus, we can conclude that increasing the tin would not meaningfully change the PSM balance, and any reduction in balance is simply due to DAI demand destruction by shipping a worse product. Not great. When I initially voted, I included all fees options. The arguments in here are extremely in favor of one side though so I slowly changed to 1bp only. But if I were to vote now I\u2019d for sure add the no fees option and would lean toward that. The difference between voting for 0 bps and 1 bp to me would be the revenue that the PSM would be expected to drive at 1 bp. ",

For a decentralized technology to be resilient we need an ecosystem, and we can do that by leaving a little on the table for external developers to take advantage of.

And why do you mention the SF team? I am speaking on behalf of myself. I\u2019ve been through the whole experience minus liquidation (chose to get liquidated on other platforms instead ). RWA borrowers aren\u2019t mythical and we are focusing on them because that is where the money is, straight up. And that is also the best way to reduce USDC exposure while maintaining a peg (granted, some interim quick-to-market solutions might not reduce USDC exposure but will generate plenty of revenue until we find solutions that will). My opinion: we are operating under the assumption that we are switching to eagle stance in ~3 years. Our \u201cexisting customers\u201d will largely leave when that happens (& be replaced by a new batch who are not intimidated by the more complex system, hopefully). Under this guise, why would we focus on vault-holders for the next 3 years when we can maybe generate a million or 2 of revenue per year off of them.
