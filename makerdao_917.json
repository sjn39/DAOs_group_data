                    "content": "This post includes two instances of parameter changes for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A. 1) The Immediate which will go into this week\u2019s executive vote and 2) Short-term which will go in the next week\u2019s on-chain poll.  The Immediate DC-IAM line (DC) change from 3M to 5M DAI  In the initial Risk Assessment in October 2021, we proposed 5M DC, which was later lowered to 3M in March 2022 due to technical concerns from other CUs. The 5M DC was already approved by the Maker Governance in this on-chain poll. The concerns are now lifted which allows us to immediately increase the DC for the remaining 2M, to 5M, in the next executive vote this Friday, 8th of April.  The Short-term Parameter Changes Proposal  The CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, or Curve Lido stETH-ETH LP token, has been onboarded mid March and has recently almost fully utilized the available DC of 3M dai, which was set as part of the updated collateral parameter recommendation. The initial DC is always set lower than required in order to allow its performance observation in practice by different CUs. As previously mentioned, there are now fewer technical concerns regarding CRVV1ETHSTETH-A. In addition, after assessing the vault performance, there is no clear financial risk that inhibits the increase of the debt ceiling further. Therefore, the Risk Core Unit is proposing an additional increase in the debt ceiling and the DC-IAM gap. The vault type currently consists of 17 individual active vaults with a 276.5% debt weighted collateral ratio and the largest user represents ~36% of total debt. The Curve Lido stETH-ETH pool is one of the largest markets on Ethereum, currently sitting at $5.53B or 1588K stETH + ETH (equally weighted). From the perspective of liquidity, the DC could be potentially relatively high compared to other collateral assets, but we still want to maintain controlled exposure towards Lido specific risks, which are shared with other exposed products such as wstETH vaults and Aave D3M to some smaller extent. Assuming that the latest MOMC parameter proposal passes, the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A stability fee will be lowered by 1.25%, from 3.5% to 2.25% which will increase the potential profitability of the vault positions and increase demand. Proposed parameter changes for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A;  Increase the DC-IAM line (DC) to 50M Increase the DC-IAM gap to 10M  Assuming there are no objections, we would like to proceed with proposed parameters from point 2) to the on-chain poll next Monday, 11th of April.

The other proposal will further increase the DC to 50M, which is a lot for a vault type that does not even exist for one full month. Main concern (correct me if I am wrong) is that a lot of new code is used for this vault type and different CUs would prefer gradual increase over a large one. ",

I am pretty sure this will be used rapidly and we will be back to deciding the next move and I would rather get that out of the way here so we already know what the next move(s) should be.   3, 6, 12, 24, 48 or like 3,5,8,11,15,22,30,etc\u2026   The time in between is important as well. I would like more CUs to chime in here with concerns or comments on the approach to DC raises here or just start another thread.  So I will leave this one for posterity and look forward to the next poll on this. ",
