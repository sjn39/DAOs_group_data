                    "content": "I\u2019m not even sure the average user even agrees on what the difference between wallet and interface is.  I mean, MyEtherWallet kind of screwed that up IMO.  I\u2019ve always used the following to help people understand the security and usability of different products: \u2022 Blockchain Interface - software that allows a user to input external sensitive information and output useful processed/formatted data.  This is what MyCrypto and MEW are. \u2022 Wallet - a software interface (as defined above) that stores sensitive information.  MetaMask, Jaxx, and any other software that uses some kind of authentication method to access.  This also encompasses exchanges, but I differentiate those by calling them \u201ccurated wallets\u201d since the user doesn\u2019t have direct control over the software or access to it. \u2022 Hardware Wallet - a wallet (as defined above) that emphasizes security by physically air-gapping the sensitive information and using strong encryption.  I consider the USB drive running Tails and a KeePass DB with my PK inside to be a hardware wallet.  It\u2019s air-gapped, and uses MyCrypto for the interface.  Potentially conflicting/confusing terms we use now that might not follow this classification schema: \u2022 \u201cPaper wallets\u201d - they aren\u2019t wallets. They are equivalent to writing your password on a stickynote.  To fit the wallet analogy, the thing has to both 1) hold something of value, and 2) have purposeful design that supports use of the value stored within.  You don\u2019t call a change jar a \u201cwallet\u201d, even though it meets much of the same purpose as a wallet.  The difference is in design/function in addition to storage of value.  To be clear, value is generally synonymous with sensitive information like PKs. \u2022 \u201cVaults\u201d - this is a term I\u2019ve seen Coinbase use.  It\u2019s essentially a curated wallet with extra authentication / anti theft measures. \u2022 \"Software wallets\" - it\u2019s redundant.  \u201cWallet\u201d should inherently imply that it\u2019s at least partially software.  It would only be a useful term to use when contrasting it against a hardware wallet solution. \u2022 Hot/Cold Storage - I\u2019ve seen hot/cold be used to describe both security and use.  \u201cCold\u201d wallets should be a subset of hardware wallets, but \u201chot\u201d wallets can really be anything as long as it\u2019s geared towards frequent use. Frequent use =/= insecure.  I don\u2019t use Parity Signer, but from my understanding it is what it\u2019s called - a signer.  If it doesn\u2019t store information, it\u2019s not a wallet at all. Just a secure interface. ",

The air-gapped + strong encryption bumps that up to hardware wallet by my definition. However, if you don\u2019t dedicate the phone to this purpose and are simply running the app on a normal smartphone, I wouldn\u2019t consider it more than just a mobile wallet. The overhead to actually set this up properly seems very high, including both steep hardware requirements and usage requirements.  Too many ways to mess up, so IMO it\u2019s not a great solution in terms of high security for the average user.  Certainly no worse than any other online wallet though.  I can loose a hardware wallet like my TEZOR - but when loosing a \u201coffline signer\u201d like the parity signer - this is a problem \u2026  Why is losing the offline signer more of a problem than losing a TREZOR/Ledger?

Maybe the distinction can be is \u201cdedicated hardware\u201d. Ledger, Trezor, and your USB are all dedicated devices. Their sole purpose is crypto key storage/transaction facilitation. With a mobile phone, if it\u2019s sole purpose is to store cryptographic keys and allow for the signing of transactions then it can be called a hardware wallet. Otherwise, a phone that is used as a phone + with the auxillary function of storing keys and signing transactions/messages, would just be a mobile signer. I can see this as being a point of contention though, as the two devices (mobile phones with an app on it) are the same.

The problem is that you can e.g. brute force the password for a parity signer. You cannot do this for a TREZOR as it has an exponential back-off for decryption attempts and you cannot get the encrypted key without attacking the hardware. So I think a TREZOR (which for me falls into the class of hardware wallets) is much more secure as it is protected against attacks with physical access than a parity signer (which for me falls under the class of offline signers). Again - I think both have their use-cases - we should just be careful with wording as when we put both into the same class - then users might get confused and assume both have the same security guarantees.

You cannot do this for a TREZOR as it has an exponential back-off for decryption attempts and you cannot get the encrypted key without attacking the hardware.  btw, where does this opinion come from? For the sake of my understanding: is there any real snag (in principle) which blocks us to implement such a protection in the signer-like class tools (apps)? In principle, it\u2019s possible to such a layer not in the app itself, but on the device level (or some virtual environment). So, that would make a device into a what we call \u201chardware wallet\u201d today (with the same promises) (maybe (but I don\u2019t really like the word \u201cwallet\u201d in the context - I\u2019d better propose \u2018\u201cvirtual\u201d vault\u2019)) - at least according to the proposed definition principle:  So I think a TREZOR (which for me falls into the class of hardware wallets) is much more secure as it is protected against attacks with physical access than a parity signer (which for me falls under the class of offline signers)  I\u2019m pretty sure there is a such a hardware protection in the phones already (in iOS devices AFAIK, but I\u2019m sure there should be something for Android devices too!). My point is that maybe it is not a best idea to rely on that property in the final definition\u2026 Just because it could be not a common denominator for all products for that class\u2026 Fair point made here is that people could name (for themselves) that kind of \u201cproduct\u201d depending on how they are using it (use case). In the same time, point of the current discussion (as I see it) is not to play with public opinions about things, but rely (as strict as possible) on the properties of the product itself. The point (as I see it) is to extract the common denominator and come up with the definition which must be as consistent as possible. IMHO: we\u2019d better to rely on the best practices (security) on how to use such tools and the final definition must include this idea just not to confuse users (to be as honest as possible with the definition). The current (official) usage best practices are:  Parity Signer was built to be used offline. The mobile device used to run the app will hold valuable information that needs to be kept securely stored. It is therefore advised to: Get a separate mobile device. Make a factory reset. Enable full-disk encryption on the device, with a reasonable password (might not be on by default, for example for older Android devices). Do not use any kind of biometrics such as fingerprint or face recognition for device decryption/unlocking, as those may be less secure than regular passwords. Once the app has been installed, enable airplane mode and make sure to switch off Wifi, Bluetooth or any connection ability of the device. Only charge the phone on a power outlet that is never connected to the internet. Only charge the phone with the manufacturer\u2019s charging adapter. Do not charge the phone on public USB chargers.

In America anyways, most cellphone providers will take back the phone after your contract expires and you are able to get a new phone without paying full price upfront. Few people actually drop $1000 on a new phone every couple years to truly own it.  Even if you do have a phone that\u2019s 2 or 3 years old and still works fine, why not just sell it for a TREZOR or something and pocket the rest?  It\u2019s not a cost effective solution even for the niche it appeals to. On top of that, the user experience doesn\u2019t exactly sound easy. We\u2019re looking at a niche of a niche of a niche that will actually do this properly.  If the app doesn\u2019t force users to be secure, then they won\u2019t be.  Since the vast majority won\u2019t be that secure, it\u2019s extremely misleading to call the product secure. If I put on my tinfoil hat for a second - even if you have the phone \u201coffline once and for all\u201d, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s actually the case for many phones. So, it\u2019s really not a reasonable secure solution compared to what people do today, because those people will rarely use it as intended.

By giving them the same name common users think they have the same security guarantees. Which they do not. For me using \u201copenhardware wallet\u201d could solve the problem as we draw an important line there. What do you think? A TREZOR is a openhardware wallet. A parity signer, WallETH, Ledger, \u2026 is not - simple as that. Would work for me\u2026 ",
