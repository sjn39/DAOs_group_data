At 15th Jan, NYAG decided Tether is fraud and/or Tether is unbacked throwing the full power of the US government against it. Tether obviously loses it\u2019s peg and starts racing to $0, that wouldn\u2019t be huge deal but it\u2019s in every DEX AMM pool with other stables So let\u2019s make this simple example in AMM DAI/USDT pool, USDT goes to 0 and DAI goes to $2 Suddenly people that have borrowed $300 worth of DAI against $1000 worth of ETH (at relatively safe margin level of 300%+) Owe $600 instead of $300. At the same time other with riskier margin levels get liquadated and ETH price dumps as well, causing even the safe guy above being under collaterized with $600 worth of DAI against $100 worth of ETH (if ETH drops 90%) Wouldn\u2019t that crash the whole system? And not just makerdao of course but pretty much everything? I realize this is unconfirmed black swan FUD at this point, but black swans do happen from time to time and I just woud like to know if the above scenario is ralistic if that does happen, your thoughts?

Well, in case of such systemic disaster, and hopefully before DAI reaches 2usd, somebody (anybody with more than 5k MKR, I believe) can trigger a \u201cEmergency ShutDown\u201d. The effect of this is to immediately halt the MKR system. All DAI in circulation will be swappable with the underlying assets, etc (more details on ES are available in the MakerDAO docs). So MakerDAO would \u2018halt\u2019 but of course, everything else in DeFi would go trough a very significant turmoil, with almost unpredictable consequences. Remark: (Un)Fortunately the ES system, is the only component of MakerDAO that has never been tested live (I believe, or perhaps only partially with the move from SAI to DAI). ",

Actually another user in another thread reminded me that your debt is denominated in DAI, and hence DAI price against the USD doesn\u2019t matter.

I have considered ES a possible protocol and DAI attack scenario for some time now especially since hitting $1B.  A full halt on Maker would basically lock up a chunk of assets and make DAI minting impossible with implications for the PEG and all DAI/asset trading pretty quickly.   As far as I know there is no way to reverse out an ES.  The contracts would have to be redeployed (ala SCD-MCD like a MCD1-MCD2 transition) and collateral withdrawn, redeposited etc.   I think this is like a nuclear bomb for borrowers btw.  Given network congestion currently one could expect gas to easily hit 1000gwei and some significant market turmoil. ",
