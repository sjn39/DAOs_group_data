If I had been eligible, in all likeliness I would\u2019ve sold most of the airdrop to keep in my pockets. I don\u2019t think an airdrop from another exchange would really persuade me to leave unless they had a specific feature that made fees much cheaper, and/or made the experience of exchanging simpler/easier. The way for the devs to deal with that by engineering uniswap better. ",
