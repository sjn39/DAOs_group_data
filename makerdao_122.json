                    "content": "Hello, this is my first post on this forum. I\u2019m active on Reddit\u2019s r/ethfinance and I just learned about this place today. I\u2019m pretty sure I just lost everything on oasis.app. I heard they launched DAI on arbitrum today, so I tried depositing my ETH on arbitrum into my vault and generating DAI. I did this by opening my vault and switching over to Arbitrum in Metamask. Under collateral, where you deposit ETH, it told me my balance, so I deposited my ETH, just like normal. It\u2019s not showing up in my vault. There\u2019s no DAI generated either. On my transaction list, it just shows up as a send to this address.    Arbitrum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer   Arbitrum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Arbiscan Arbitrum (ETH) detailed transaction info for txhash 0x48bc9dce07a4fc0278a309342478c64c595ac20100be69563fee086631eeb65c. The transaction status, block confirmation, gas fee, ETH, and token transfer are shown.      On r/ethfinance, the posters there helped me figure out that this address is the arbitrum version of my vault on the ethereum mainnet. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything that can be done, but I\u2019m posting here on the off chance that it\u2019s possible. EDIT: Here\u2019s an update that will hopefully more clearly explain what happened. It includes \u200ba video showing the steps I went through when I made the original deposit. Depositing ETH into a Maker vault on Arbitrum - YouTube Just to go through the steps, since I probably didn\u2019t communicate clearly earlier:   I connected my metamask to oasis.app with metamask set to Ethereum Mainnet, same as I\u2019ve done probably dozens of times.   In Metamask, I switched from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum, same way I\u2019ve done on Impermax, Sushiswap, etc.   Just like on Impermax, Sushiswap, and other projects, when I switched Metamask to Arbitrum, oasis.app showed my ETH balance on Arbitrum. At the time, that balance was a little over 63.56 ETH.   Seeing my Arbitrum balance, and hearing that DAI was now available on Arbitrum, I thought vaults were now available on Arbitrum as well   I deposited 63 ETH and clicked confirm. I should have sent a test transaction, however after using my vault without problems for years, I didn\u2019t think to do so.   Now that ETH is gone.   Note, in the video, that when I switch between networks in Metamask, the amount of ETH available to deposit in oasis.app changes. On Mainnet, I now have a little over .54 ETH. On Arbitrum, after losing my 63 ETH, I now have a little over .56. I\u2019m point it out because there\u2019s only a .02 difference between the numbers, so I want to make sure you guys don\u2019t miss it. If you\u2019re reading this and you have a Maker vault, DO NOT SWITCH TO ARBITRUM AND TRY TO DEPOSIT. It will allow you to do so, but you will lose your ETH. This was literally everything I had in the world besides my car. I\u2019m not posting for sympathy, I just want everyone to know so it doesn\u2019t happen to them, and because I said I\u2019d keep everyone updated. I know I\u2019m the one who made the transaction. I take responsibility for that. But I do think, if Maker doesn\u2019t support vaults on Arbitrum, they should disable deposits if your wallet is set to Arbitrum. That\u2019s what projects like Impermax, Sushiswap, and even ArbiNYAN do ",

I\u2019ve posted this in G&R channel and on the reddit threads too, so apologies if your seeing this everywhere, but I just wanted to give a quick update to say we have closed the loophole that lead to the issue of funds being transferred to Arbitrum while trying to open a Vault on Oasis.app so that it can\u2019t happen again, including on other networks - not just Arbitrum. Apologies for the issues this caused. We are in communications with the Maker PE team who I believe is looking into trying to find a way to recover the funds sent. Will provide more updates on this as we learn them. ",
