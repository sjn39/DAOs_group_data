Paragraph Summary MIP103 establishes the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework. This includes Asset Liability management and Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate adjustments. All rules for Stability and Liquidity for the DAO are contained in this framework, including the procedures of the The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council.  Component Summary MIP103c1: Preamble Contains the Preamble to the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework. MIP103c2: Scope Framework Articles Contains the Scope Framework Articles for the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework. MIP103c3: Responsible Facilitators Contains details on the Responsible Facilitators for the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework. MIP103c4: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process Contains details of how the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework can be amended.  Motivation The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework is necessary to define the Scope as per the Maker Constitution.  Specification  MIP103c1: Preamble The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework provides the core principles, rules and regulation regarding Dai stability, peg and the liquidity and minimum returns of collateral. This includes Asset Liability management and Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate adjustments.  MIP103c2: Scope Framework Articles  1: The Stability and Liquidity Advisory Council  1.1: The Stability and Liquidity Advisory Council definition The Stability and Liquidity Advisory Council is a group of Ecosystem Actors that have been approved by Maker Governance to carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework.  1.2: Stability and Liquidity Advisory Council membership management Members of the Advisory Council are directly approved by Maker Governance through a governance poll, and must fulfil specific criteria.   1.2.1: The Responsible Facilitators must ensure that potential Advisory Council Members can apply to be approved by Maker Governance, using an open process with clear instructions.     1.2.2: Advisory Council Members must be ecosystem actors that are not involved in any business activity that could result in a conflict of interest, either directly or indirectly. They must also have relevant skills for providing professional expert input on the content that the Stability and Liquidity Scope is covering.     1.2.3: The Responsible Facilitators must periodically, when it is relevant, review the Advisory Council Applications, and if they find applications that are suitable, bring them to a vote through an MKR governance poll. Approved Advisory Council Members are added to 10.2.3.1:.     1.2.4: The Responsible Facilitators may, if they deem it necessary, hold a vote to remove an Advisory Council Member. If an Advisory Council Member has not done any paid work for the Scope for at least 1 year, then the Responsible Facilitators can choose to remove them at will, if they deem it necessary.     1.2.5: The current approved Avisory Council Members are recorded in the Active element 1.2.5.1A.   1.2.5.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 Current list of Advisory Council Members:  N/A  \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      1.3: Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework Advisory Council projects and funding The Advisory Council is paid on a project basis to do specific work that improves all or specific parts of the Scope Framework.   1.3.1: Each Quarter, if they deem it necessary, the Responsible Facilitators must solicit proposals and find one or more suitable Advisory Council Members to perform a project that will result in output that can be used to improve the Scope Framework. This work output will be presented to the CVC Subcommittee Meetings as the starting point for the CVC Scope Framework Position Documents. As many CVCs as possible should be supported this way, prioritized by the Responsible Facilitators.     1.3.2: In case an ambiguous, uncertain or challenging situation arises related to the Scope Framework, the Responsible Facilitator may approach one or more Advisory Council Members to perform a reactive project that aims to specify the language of the Scope Framework to take into account the specific situation. The Responsible Facilitator can then directly propose the change to the Scope Framework in a weekly governance poll, quickly resolving the challenge.     1.3.3: The Advisory Council may not produce work output that is directly compatible with the formatting of the Scope Framework. In this case the Responsible Facilitator must either transcribe it themselves, or hire an Ecosystem Actor to perform the transcribtion. This role does not require preapproval by Maker Governance.     1.3.4: The Responsible Facilitators may also produce advisory input on the content of the Scope Framework themselves, as long as it is focused on improving process and governance content. They are prohibited from providing unilateral input on expert subject matter content.     1.3.5: The Responsible Facilitators have a budget available to pay for Advisory Council Projects per quarter. All spending must be limited to only what is deemed necessary and with a high probability of producing clearly measurable value, and this must be transparently be accounted for in a forum post at least a week before any transaction occurs. The budget implementation is specified in 1.3.5.1A. The budget implementation Active Element can be modified using the standard CVC Scope Framework modification process, or through the Responsible Facilitators proposing a modification through a weekly cycle governance poll.   1.3.5.1A: \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4 The Advisory Council project budget is as follows:     Quarterly Budget (DAI) Method of Distribution Maximum Limit (DAI)     500,000 Keg - streamed at a linear rate over 3 months 500,000     \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4      2: The Implementation of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework through Software The Responsible Facilitators must in collaboration with the CVC Subcommittees, periodically review possibilities of integrating DAO toolkit innovation into the processes and content of the Scope Framework.  3: The general Asset-Liability Management model  3.1: The general Asset-Liability Management model definition The ALM model governs the overall duration risk of the Dai collateral portfolio, and its contents are implemented practically in the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework and the Real World Asset Scope Framework. The high level requirements specified in the sections act as the boundaries for how the Dai collateral portfolio must behave. Broadly, there are two categories of collateral in the Asset-Liability Management model: Stability Collateral, and Yield Collateral. Stability collateral are stablecoins and highly scalable and liquid assets that are used directly by the Maker Protocol to support the Dai peg and the Dai Savings Rate in the market place, while Yield Collateral are low risk, but less liquid assets used to generate yield above the Dai Savings Rate as surplus for the Maker Protocol.  3.2: ALM Rules for Stability Collateral Stability Collateral covers a few types of stablecoins and RWA exposure that the Maker Protocol interacts directly with, based on the exact specifications provided in this section. The purpose of Stability Collateral is to directly enforce the Dai peg in the market place, and to provide very low risk, scalable collateral deployment opportunities that enable the Maker Protocol to maintain the Dai Savings Rate regardless of the level of incoming Dai demand.   3.2.1: Cash Stablecoins are stablecoins that have very high liquidity and are used as a direct target for the Dai peg. As a result the Maker Protocol must maintain a large amount of Cash Stablecoins available for direct on-chain exchange with Dai for minimal fees or spread.   3.2.1.1: The ALM model targets an exposure to Cash Stablecoins equivalent to 10% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio.       3.2.2: Liquid Reserve Collateral is scalable collateral that can be converted to Cash Stablecoins within a short amount of time, and at very large throughput, while generating a yield.   3.2.2.1: When exposure to Cash Stablecoins is in excess of the exposure target defined in  3.2.1.1, the excess Cash Stablecoins must be converted to Liquid Reserve Collateral through an automated smart contract.  3.2.2.2: When exposure to Cash Stablecoins is below the exposure target defined in 3.2.1.1  any available Liquid Reserve Collateral must be converted to Cash Stablecoins at a high throughput based on an automated smart contract.       3.2.3: The Stability Collateral Benchmark Yield is equivalent to the average yield, weighted proportionally to target relative exposure, of the Liquid Reserve Collateral.     3.2.4: Incubating Stablecoins are stablecoins that do not have enough liquidity to serve as Cash Stablecoins, but are strategically selected for incubation and subsidy through direct exposure as Stability Collateral in order to promote their adoption and maintain them as potential fallback solutions in case of risk to the Cash Stablecoins.   3.2.4.1: Incubating Stablecoins cannot exceed 10% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio, and their exposure must be restricted unless they provide a yield competitive with the Stability Collateral Yield Benchmark.     3.3: ALM rules for Yield Collateral Yield Collateral is the portion of the Dai Collateral Portfolio that is not directly used to enforce the Dai peg, and can instead be deployed to generate higher yield that results in a surplus to the Maker Protocol. Yield Collateral have multiple tiers broken down based on their duration. The ALM rules are designed so that it is always possible to substitute a longer duration asset with a shorter duration asset.   3.3.1: The ALM model targets an exposure of at most 80% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio to collateral of ALM Tier 1 or higher.   3.3.1.0: If all higher tiers are at their targeted exposure, the allocation that is exclusively available for tier 1 collateral is 15%.   3.3.1.1: ALM Tier 1 collateral is collateral that can be repaid as Dai within at most 2 weeks when required by the ALM model.       3.3.2: The ALM model targets an exposure of at most 65% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio to collateral of ALM Tier 2 or higher.   3.3.2.0: If all higher tiers are at their targeted exposure, the allocation that is exclusively available for tier 2 collateral is 15%.   3.3.2.1: ALM Tier 2 collateral is collateral that can be repaid as Dai within at most 1 month when required by the ALM model.       3.3.3: The ALM model targets an exposure of at most 50% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio to collateral of ALM Tier 3 or higher.   3.3.3.0: If all higher tiers are at their targeted exposure, the allocation that is exclusively available for tier 2 collateral is 37.5% of the Effective Dai Collateral Portfolio.   3.3.3.1: ALM Tier 3 collateral is collateral that can be repaid as Dai within at most 6 - 12 months, with an average of 9 months, when needed by the ALM model.       3.3.4: The ALM model targets an exposure of at most 12.5% of the Dai Collateral Portfolio to collateral of ALM Tier 4 or higher.   3.3.4.0: As there are no higher tiers, the allocation that is exclusively available for ALM Tier 4 collateral is 12.5% of the Effective Dai Collateral Portfolio.   3.3.4.1: ALM Tier 4 collateral is collateral that can be repaid as Dai within at most 1 - 3 years, with an average of 2 years, when needed by the ALM model.       3.3.5: Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield. Yield Collateral is highly diverse and is deployed in many different ways. The Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield is a tool for Maker Governance to control the overall risk of Yield Collateral through a single, simple parameter that influences various incentives and rules throughout the Scope Frameworks.   3.3.5.1: Initially, the Yield Collateral Benchmark Yield is equivalent to the 3-month US Government Treasury Bill.   3.3.5.1.0: This element is meant to be improved to become a long term self sustainable, automated algorithm based on both endogenous values and external oracle input over time.        4: The Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate  4.1: The Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate Definition The Dai Savings Rate is a yield available to Dai holders that deposit their Dai into the Dai Savings Rate smart contract.  The Stability Fee Base Rate is a global variable that is applied on top of the stability fee of all Variable Rate Core Vaults, and used to fund the Dai Savings Rate.  4.2: The Dai Savings Rate parameter During normal conditions the Dai Savings Rate is set as 90% of the Stability Collateral Benchmark Yield specified in 3.2.3.  4.3: Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate changes in demand shocks In situations where Dai demand rapidly falls and the Maker Protocol runs low on Stability Collateral, the Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate starts increasing.   4.3.1: For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been below 5% of the total Effective Dai Collateral Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to increase the Stability Fee Base Rate by up to 0.5% per consecutive 24 hour period, up to a maximum of 4%. This also increases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Variable Rate Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai.   4.3.1.0: This is to ensure that the Dai Savings Rate doesn\u2019t go above what the Maker Protocol is earning on its collateral on average. Examples:   4.3.1.0.1: If the total Dai supply is 4 billion, and the total Variable Rate Core Vault debt is 1 billion, and an executive vote increases the Stability Fee Base rate by 4%, then the executive vote must also increase the Dai Savings Rate by 1%.       4.3.2: For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been above 5% of the total Effective Dai Collateral Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to decrease the Stability Fee Base Rate by up to 1% per consecutive 24 hour period. This also decreases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai. If the Stability Fee Base Rate returns to 0%, then the Dai Savings Rate must also return to its value during normal conditions as defined in 4.2.    5: The long duration asset haircut model and process  5.1: The long duration asset haircut model and process If the effective Stability Fee of at least one Core Vault user has doubled as a result of a demand shock response as defined in 4.3, then the Responsible Facilitators may submit a fire sale proposal to Maker Governance, enabling them to consider selling long duration assets at a potential haircut. The expected haircut, and other context including the current risk to the Dai peg, must be clearly explained as a part of the decision making process.  6: Preferential terms for strategic collateral  6.1: Preferential terms for strategic collateral The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework and the Real World Asset Scope Framework can designate specific collateral types as strategic collateral. This makes it possible to lower their return to at least equivalent to the Stability Collateral Benchmark Yield defined in 3.2.3. Any time this is used, it must done to a limited extent, and with clear justification and strategic goals that must be periodically revisited.  MIP103c3: Responsible Facilitators The Responsible Facilitators of the Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework are defined in MIP113c2.6.1.2.1A.  MIP103c4: Scope Framework Articles Modification Subproposal Process During the pregame the Scope Framework articles can be modified through the Monthly Governance Cycle using a MIP102c2 subproposal.

                    "content": "As being most likely in a conflict of interest by the very same MIP definition, I will try to refrain to propose actual changes and stay high level. As a preamble, ALM is managing both assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are intertwined, liability composition commands assets composition and the reverse. One key development this year is the introduction of a DSR, which we expect to increase significantly DAI demand. But this DAI demand behavior might be quite different from our legacy users. The wholesale lending (a.k.a shadow banking) of 2008 or the brokered deposits of Silvergate more recently come to mind. I understand the scope will be updated significantly by the advisory council and the proposed start provides a good and safe base so I\u2019m fine with the form, it is just something we need to keep in mind. Those advisors will nonetheless need some context and a section on top called \u201cStability and liquidity strategy\u201d would be helpful to provide meta information to those advisors, community and users. For instance, it seems to me that the current scope wants to keep the peg of DAI very strong at almost all time (which a depeg, not matter how small, would be seen as catastrophic). The whitepaper speaking about a soft peg and another valid approach would be to say the peg will be aimed to be corrected within 5 days (which is the regulatory ask for stablecoins) or even allow more deviation. On the stability front (solvency), a key decision would be to say that we are following a pure mark-to-market valuation or a hold-to-maturity view. Should the scope enforce that we remains solvent all the time. Is solvent considering the proceed of a MKR minting? More broadly what is the risk appetite of the protocol? Probably doesn\u2019t have to be super specific but at least give the color. For instance, should the protocol take the lowest risk to just cover it\u2019s cost or go beyond (riskier) and generate capital to operate some MKR burn?     rune:    3.2.1: Variable Rate Decentralized Core Vaults are not counted as a part of the ALM-applied portfolio.    Maker as a potential exposure to 20B+ of decentralized core vault, if realized (i.e. a very strong bull market) the stability and liquidity scope would become irrelevant as there would be ALM-applied portfolio to manage anymore (assuming no change in DAI demand). What about adding at minimum of $500M Stablecoins?     rune:        3.2.2.3.1: A smart contract must be used to automatically move excess Cash Stablecoins into Yield Stablecoins, and automatically move Yield Stablecoins into Cash Stablecoins if it is below the target.        What about saying adjust the tin, tout, line parameters, as it is not possible for a smart contract to convert USDP to USDC (except we are yoloing to a Dex). And are we accepting negative  tout which will lead to a protocol loss but might be required to move fast? In my view protocol losses actions should be managed by humans to avoid being exploited.     rune:  3.2.3.1: As a subset, the ALM-Applied Portfolio must target at most 12.5% exposure to collateral with a duration of 1-3 years, with a 2 year average duration. This can also be substituted for collateral with a shorter duration. Legacy Real World Asset Vaults count towards this limit.   I would suggest to asses both maturity and duration (same values). I think we are already way above this limit (the duration one) from the possible exposure with 150M IBTA from MIP65 (2 yr duration), BT (5yr duration) and HVB (various durations/maturities but average above 2yr I would say at scale).

And are we accepting negative tout which will lead to a protocol loss but might be required to move fast? In my view protocol losses actions should be managed by humans to avoid being exploited.   There\u2019s some issues with the naming and definitions - the thing that i here call a primary yield stablecoin is something that can be transformed 1:1 onchain to a cash stablecoin - specifically it refers to coinbase custody. It might be a good idea to find a new term that replaces stablecoin entirely and is more technology neutral and simply refers to things that help us keep the peg directly in the market (e.g. GUNI is not technically a stablecoin, but it falls under the definition of a cash stablecoin for the purposes of the framework). More specific details on stablecoins etc will be in the RWA scope framework since that\u2019s where the practical implementation of the RWA side of this is defined. In practice if we end up in a long term situation where there are multiple dominant stablecoins and they all pay us rewards directly for holding them in the PSMs, then the whole section direct exposure to stablecoins would change and it would probably be more about adjusting tin and tout, i guess. Additionally, there is the possibility that we can use arrangers to do offchain rebalancing based for a service fee. All of these things can be developed further during the pregame when we get a sense of what the low hanging fruits are. ",

                    "content": "Very clear and concise framework. That\u2019s my first post on Maker forum and might not have all the previous information related to this MIP, so i apologies in advance for what might sound like stupid questions/remarks. Automation vs Human Decision First, I wonder why the need of the Responsible Facilitators for tasks that could be automated based on data and metrics with thresholds. Especially when such Facilitator (currently \u201cCollateral Engineering Services core unit\u201d) are already being paid to do other tasks i suppose . Automation could limit the increase in cost and allow Responsible facilitators to focus on the creative part rather than \u201chouse keeping tasks\u201d. Here i\u2019m mainly referencing the increase to the DSR     rune:  4.3: Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate changes in demand shocks In situations where Dai demand rapidly falls and the ALM-Applied Portfolio runs low of short duration assets, the Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate starts increasing.   4.3.1: For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been below 5% of the total ALM-Applied Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to increase the Stability Fee Base Rate on all Core Vaults by up to 0.5% per consecutive 24 hour period, up to a maximum of 4%. This also increases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai.   4.3.1.0: This is to ensure that the Dai Savings Rate doesn\u2019t go above what the Maker Protocol is earning on its collateral on average. Examples:   4.3.1.0.1: If the total Dai supply is 4 billion, and the total Core Vault debt is 1 billion, and an executive vote increases the Stability Fee Base rate by 4%, then the executive vote must also increase the Dai Savings Rate by 1%.       4.3.2: For each consecutive period where the direct exposure to Cash Stablecoins has continuously been above 5% of the total ALM-Applied Portfolio, the Responsible Facilitator can trigger an urgent executive vote to decrease the Stability Fee Base Rate on all Core Vaults by up to 1% per consecutive 24 hour period. This also decreases the Dai Savings Rate proportionally, based on the proportion of Core Vault debt compared to the total supply of Dai. If the Stability Fee Base Rate returns to 0%, then the Dai Savings Rate must also return to its value during normal conditions as defined in 4.2     In case of DAI demand shortfall, modification of such parameters require urgent executive vote, although constrained by thresholds it is giving exceptional power in human decision when smart contract could do the tricks while still providing implementation delay to make sure no adverse effect are included when smart contract changes the parameters. (a pause function could be useful on top of timelock) I\u2019m also referring to the sales of RWA long duration in case of DAI demand shortfall:     rune:  The long duration asset haircut model and process If the effective Stability Fee of at least one Core Vault user has doubled as a result of a demand shock response as defined in 4.3, then the Responsible Facilitators may submit a fire sale proposal to Maker Governance, enabling them to consider selling long duration assets at a potential haircut.   We can argue automation of such sales could be difficult as those RWA will likely be held by regulated custodian which requires human interaction anyway for approvals. But there might be custodians able to do so via API or direct smart contract calls: thinking of Coinbase prime and USDC PSM that can be redeem via smart contract as an example. I understand that at least automation is the goal for the max 20% exposure to Stablecoins and that is a great start. Benchmark rates selection Please forgive me if the question has been asked/answered somewhere else but, what are the criteria on selecting the benchmark rate for the DSR? I understand for article 3.3.1 but i don\u2019t understand for article 3.3.2 especially when both collateral carry the same \u201cworthiness\u201d = liquidity and availability*. (*Inlcuding the availability for the 3-month T Bill since it is irrelevant as T Bill can be sold before maturation BUT within trading hours). I\u2019ve personally been using the 10 Year T Bill non-adjusted for inflation as my benchmark, as it is the one used in TradFi to quantify investment opportunities, DCFA, etc. ",

Here the question is: how fast do we need those trade to happen? If time is not paramount: CoW Swap have recently enabled ENS DAO to swap 10k ETH at 0.6% slippage and ended up saving up to $84k from MEV losses if the trade was carried on a normal DEX. Their smart contract called milkman allow trade to be posted and executed whenever a transaction path follow slippage requirements regardless of time duration (passive trade). If time is paramount, I suppose CoW Swap is not the best protocol. Although they do have the ability to execute trade within the same general timeframe as a normal DEX aggregator. In this case i\u2019m afraid slippage will apply. ",

                    "content": "    rune:  4: The Dai Savings Rate and Stability Fee Base Rate   Recommend adding a section about Maker only charging for DAI outstanding that is in circulation and affecting the peg to the downside. Just because DAI is minted into a target protocol does not mean it is in circulation. For example, this exists already with D3Ms to Aave and Compound as well as the G-UNI tokens. In both of these instances, the amount of DAI that is immediately accessible to the protocol should be discounted from the rate charged to the Ecosystem Actors (and probably the DAI market cap as it is \u201cfake supply\u201d). Here are examples of how to calculate this:  G-UNI LP Real Debt = LP Size - Amount in DAI For example, if the G-UNI DAI/USDC LP is a 50/50 split worth 200m total then the actual debt generated from the position is really 100m. The 100m of DAI sitting in the LP position should be discounted.  Aave/Compound Real Debt = Debt Issued * Utilization Rate of DAI Pool For example, if an Aave D3M issues 100m DAI into a lending market DAI pool and the utilization is at 80% then the rate charged by Maker should be on 80m real debt. The remaining 20m is not in circulation and requires someone to post collateral to borrow. You can see why this is the case if you take an extreme example. Let\u2019s say we decide to mint 1 trillion DAI into the Aave market. What would this do? Intuitively you may think this would break DeFi, but really all this would do is make the interest rate on the DAI market go to ~0% to borrow with ~0% utilization ratio on the pool. If we take the calculation above then we can see that the \u201cReal Debt\u201d should be about the same as it was before Real Debt = GIANT NUMBER * VERY SMALL NUMBER cancels out. This is no different than sticking a 1 trillion debt ceiling on ETH-A and setting the rate to 0%. Maybe it\u2019s a bit extreme, but it definitely won\u2019t break the peg. ^ This extreme example above highlights why we should only count circulating DAI instead of all DAI minted out of D3Ms into EA products with the definition of circulating DAI being DAI that affects the peg.  Fixed rate tokens: D3M is connected to a Principal Token (PT) market on a liquidity market. Maker mints 100m PT-DAI by having a D3M first mint DAI, then exchange those DAI for PT-DAI (1:1 mint operation) then fill the liquidity engine with those PT-DAI in exchange for aPT-DAI (claim on PT-DAI). Until those PT-DAI hit maturity the DAI is not actually in circulation, should have no effect on the peg and therefore should not be charged by Maker. Once the PT-DAI hits maturity then the DAI is unlocked, enters the market and the given interest rate should kick in at that point. There are debt ceiling considerations, but that is separate from charging the cost of capital to the EAs. Real Debt = Debt Issued * isPastMaturity(0, 1) where isPastMaturity returns 0 if the token is not past maturity and 1 if so cc: @monet-supply @Primoz @rema and risk team if this makes sense to you ",

I see dai supply as following; Total supply = supply which assumes all DCs across core vaults, RWAs, D3Ms, PSMs, potential others are issued and fully utilized. This can be further divided based on the DC-IAM parameters. For example, we know what would be the maximum possible mint in 24h, this can additionally account for net dai from interest. Circulating supply = all currently issued dai which is in circulation, this includes idle dai in lending markets and also LP AMMs which is used as collateral and other financial instruments or services. The dai in AMMs directly impacts the peg, and could be all bought out, at which point it would be in circulation without argument. The idle dai in lending markets, DSR and other DeFi contracts such as BAMM, is also part of the circulating supply. It directly impacts various interest rates which indirectly impact supply and demand and thus the peg. Also if some dai does not directly impact the peg, but is issued, this is imo circulating supply. I see the argument, that idle dai in lending markets, etc, is to some extent similar to unutilized DC from a vault, etc, but do not think it should be directly equated. Dai from unutilized DC, can be minted if collateral is provided, while idle dai in lending markets, which was sourced from respective D3M can for example be stolen by a technical exploit, oracle rouge attack, governance attack or economic exploit such as price oracle manipulation. Same goes for dai in AMMs, once it is issued and supplied to the contract, it is exposed to various things and as such is considered in circulation. For the purpose of L&S scope, and ALM, perhaps a similar methodology to monetary aggregates in traditional currency could be developed, but obviously adopted to how dai is being used in the crypto economy.

Obviously not with a DC at the beginning but starting to take a close look at them to be ready when needed. If regulated stablecoin are shutdown, we could migrate most of the PSMs to MIP65 or MIP90 in MMF, but we still need a liquidity buffer which LUSD and USDT would offer. The DC could be limited to a section of the Surplus Buffer. It would provide a worst experience for DAI users (some temporary small depegs from time to time, tin/tout to manage exposure), but at least it would be a plan B that isn\u2019t too bad.    You should propose this in the S&L scope framework. ",
