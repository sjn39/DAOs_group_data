The purpose of these threads is to get a clear idea of what everyone\u2019s goals are and where on the roadmap each project is. With any luck, this will help us find opportunities for better collaboration and interoperation. Quick recap: We\u2019re talking about Ethereum clients that can run under constrained resource conditions, such as on phones or browsers or even embedded devices.  What I plan to do with these updates: As the contact person for this ring, I will:  Catalog and mention (or reach out) to founding participants for their own projects\u2019 update. Once all updates have been posted, I\u2019ll collate action items across teams and follow up. Repeat every few months (~quarterly?) Anything else you\u2019d like me to do?   What I\u2019d like from the participants with each update:  Short summary: What is your project and its goal? (This can change over time) Roadmap now: What is the currently working and available to try? Roadmap next: What is being worked on over the next few months? Current challenges and concerns: Do you need help with anything? Are there unknowns you\u2019re accounting for that could be nailed down by another participant?   Participants To all projects mentioned: Please post an update as described above.

It works by providing a coordinator (a vipnode pool) which connects paying clients with participating hosts. Roadmap: Now Beta just released this week. The demo pool is running for MainNet nodes with payments on Rinkeby.  Instructions to try it here: https://github.com/vipnode/vipnode#quickstart  Recent blog post: https://medium.com/vipnode/vipnode-progress-update-3-16b07037d3b3   Roadmap: Next Roughly in order of priority:  Onboard some users and polish towards a stable release. Getting close!  Integrate with a wallet: The current demo is wallet-agnostic (working with geth/parity) which makes the whole user experience somewhat clumsy. A native wallet integration with vipnode could make the entire onboarding ~transparent.  Reduce trust in vipnode pools: Right now, the trust model of vipnode pools is the same as mining pools: The pool operator can run away with the deposit balance. Need to find a fee-efficient way to do many-to-many microtransactions. Traditional state/payment channels don\u2019t work well here because there could be many pairs with very low balances but a non-trivial total balance.  Challenges and Concerns  Need help finding LES wallets to try integrating vipnode with. (Talking with WallETH and Status, but the more the merrier!) Need to investigate if the LES/ULC protocol will \u201cJust Work\u201d with Vipnode out of the box. (Any here hints appreciated!)

Its most complete implementation is part of the Go Ethereum client (Geth) and this is also where the latest features are first introduced. Roadmap now A huge PR has just become ready for review which improves LES server mode significantly:   github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum       les, les/flowcontrol: improved request serving and flow control     by zsfelfoldi   on 03:34PM - 02 Dec 18 UTC   8 commits   changed 30 files   with 3315 additions   and 851 deletions.       These improvements and rewrites prepare the servers for incentivized operation by improving performance, making bandwidth control more precise and introducing a private API to control individual client priorities. Though there are in-house plans for introducing an in-protocol payment mechanism, the API is intended to be usable by any project implementing any kind of incentivization or prioritization scheme for LES. A proposal will also be released shortly that describes a simple and efficient many-to-many payment channel protocol that is based on a probabilistic approach, does not require a complex infrastructure and is easy to integrate into LES. Roadmap next The next step is to improve the \u201cserver pool\u201d of the Geth light client with more sophisticated server performance estimates in order to be able to compare the value-for-money that different servers offer. These metrics will be used by the integrated automatic server selection algorithm and also exposed through the API to be usable by externally implemented strategies. Also, the planned payment protocol should be reviewed and discussed. If we find it suitable then we can start experimenting with its implementation soon (the implementation itself is not extremely complicated). Current challenges and concerns We should definitely improve communication with other teams and find ways to converge efforts (hopefully this forum will help). Finding efficient ways to follow each other\u2019s progress and catalyze collaboration is an important meta-problem itself because human attention capacity is limited and the number of great projects is growing quickly.

Another issue that hasn\u2019t really been solved is how to validate full node state.  A way to validate the node could be to ask for some info only a full node has, but there isn\u2019t a way to determine whether they got this info from another node or not.
