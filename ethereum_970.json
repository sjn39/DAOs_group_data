We would like to invite Core Devs, Researchers, @vbuterin to have similar session as at Devcon5 in Osaka  [call for action]  What kind of sessions would you like to see? Your recommendation for a special host that you would like to see at EthCC?  Feel free to post ideas below  We have confirmed room for approximately 150 people for almost whole day of first day of the EthCC conference  ",

ETH1.x session (with the Eth1.x Researchers and other stakeholders) Marketing DAO session? This is an important new initiative A session to talk about how to improve the community (drama reduction session)  Also, it would be a good idea to meet up about client diversity, and specifically have an open discussion about the fate of the Parity Ethereum client.
