            "body": "A proposal for funding Uniswap ecosystem development with up grants from the UNI treasury.\n\nThe mission of the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) is to provide valuable resources to help grow the Uniswap ecosystem. \n\nA grants program is a by definition a subjective process that cannot be easily automated. \n\nSo the proposal calls for a small committee of 6 members\u20141 lead and 5 reviewers\u2014to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants.\n\nThe budget proposed is:\n\n- $750K (of UNI) per quarter\n- Over 2 quarters\n\nThe assumption is that $1.5M worth of UNI seems appropriate for an MVP, especially relative to the size of the treasury that UNI token holders are entrusted with allocating. \n\nMore details and an explanation of the methodology that got us here are live on Discourse, and we are polling consensus before putting this to a governance vote \u2014 as soon as next week!\n\nShould UNI gov create a committee for grant funding?\n\nPlease show your opinions!",
