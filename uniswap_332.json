Main reason I did this Post, to give a place for Newcomers to get advice about any wallet from others who have experience with other wallets. Thank you for your understanding in advance Lo$Montana420 UNI_LIFE   At first I was Intimidated to hit the approve button on my Metamask wallet to unlock voting for Uniswap Governance voting. I first want to thank all in the community who have supported some posts of mine, this whole UNI token ( Receiving/Not Receiving) thing has taken away from possibly discussing other creative ways to allow UNI token to mature and thrive in a competitive DEFI space. But that is not how I would like this thread to go, rather a place Newcomers can come to get some color on the whole Unlocking Voting on the VOTE tab on Uniswap Interface. (THIS EXPERIENCE WAS DONE ON METAMASK AND TRUST WALLET, any other wallets I can not speak for. It is really as easy as 1,2,3!! To explain basically what the contract that your signing says in short, I\u2019ve put together my experience so those who may feel the same way when it asks you to approve your UNI for voting. Thats it, yea I know, like really. All your doing is giving a certain permission to the Governance contract that you will be voting with said UNI. Metamask pops up ( or whatever wallet your using, in my case I used Metamask and Trust Wallet) ",
