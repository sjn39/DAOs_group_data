The Maker Foundation, in particular its Smart Contracts team (including those team members who are also mandated actors for the DAO), has not had any involvement with nor made any contribution to the PSM. Moreover, the Maker Foundation and its Smart Contracts team has not and will not provide support (technical, ministerial, or otherwise) for the PSM. The Maker Foundation cannot make any guarantee or provide any opinion regarding the safety or correctness of the PSM implementation. We therefore strongly encourage the community to seek multiple independent validations for the module from reputable smart contract auditing firms. ",
