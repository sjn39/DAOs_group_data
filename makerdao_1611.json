Sentence Summary This subproposal offboards the current Facilitator of the Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001).  Specification This subproposal relieves the current RWF-001 Facilitator, @williamr, from his responsibilities as a mandated actor and leader of the RWF-001 Core Unit. The outgoing Facilitator will not be considered a member of the RWF-001 Core Unit unless retained by the Interim or a future Facilitator. All unspent funds and assets should immediately be handed over to an appointed Interim Facilitator. If this proposal passes and MIP39c3-SP5 passes at the same time, the other one should take precedence over and supersede this one.  Motivation @williamr is actively divesting the RWF-001 of its duties, and appears to have abandoned his mandate to other Core Units. As the mandate is currently not being fulfilled, an alternative path is required to ensure the protocol meets obligations to external stakeholders. This subproposal is meant to be held as an option to MKR holders, if RWF-001 is not rehabilitated and actively pursuing its mandate by the time this subproposal is eligible for submission. It is preferable to see a tangible plan articulated and executed by @williamr.  Core Unit ID RWF-001 ",
