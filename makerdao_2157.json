                    "content": " Protocol Engineering Q4 Highlights This post touches upon Protocol Engineering\u2019s high level achievements from Q4 2022 and gives some indications as to how the team is mapping out its work for 2023 as Endgame kicks into gear.  Governance Executives Throughout Q4 PECU maintained a steady delivery of governance executives. For the engineering team, this typically requires at least one spell writer, and two reviewers on a rotation basis - possibly more if the spell needs additional oversight or brings in new smart contract complexities or additions from other teams. Spell deployment runs from Monday to the following Wednesday to ensure correct input from other teams and means that there is an overlap with earlier and later executives thereby requiring ongoing coordination amongst stakeholders. In 2023 the team, working with GovAlpha, will be sticking to a two week cadence to minimise engineering interrupts on parallel projects. In the background, the team ensured that spell creation remained decentralised and visible for anyone to craft despite the high barrier to entry due to protocol fragility. PECU continues to maintain comprehensive spell checklists for anyone crafting inputs into Maker Governance. This is aligning nicely with the Endgame\u2019s Governance Security initiative. Due to the aforementioned smart contract complexity and protocol fragility, PECU will request to retain last-line-of-defense oversight into what goes into the protocol as the DAO considers Endgame operational changes.  Multichain - Layer 2 The multichain journey started with a simple L2 to L1 message passing bridge, then fast withdrawals, and soon, the ability to transaction from one L2 to another L2 - between Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkNet. In Q4 PE also developed a Teleport Demo UI to enable 3rd parties to interact with Teleport and a Growth CU Initiative for the community to build upon it. The team has been pursuing research into Messaging Bridges and Rollups for a comprehensive awareness of security concerns as the protocol considers opportunities for scaling. Similar discussions have also taken place for determining if/how MakerDAO should be setting mint and bridge limits to prevent risks to the broader protocol. This research will form the basis of future design decisions put to the community. In parallel with future looking research initiatives, and the writing of the actual xDomain code, PE has been engaged in successful formal verification tasks - which involves writing specifications on the newly written contracts to prove they function as expected in an L2 environment. This has been coupled with an extensive rewriting of our testing infrastructure - DssTest, which now simplifies and improves the testing experience of L2 deployments. Cross-team collaboration with the StarkNet team has increased with PE now hosting a weekly joint planning session to ensure better alignment with Teleport contracts as well as the spell deployment process. External collaboration has also increased as we have created and audited a new ZkSync simple bridge capability. The team has also been eagerly contacted by various protocols to explore further cross-chain DAI expansion. Our goal is to firstly solidify the architecture of Teleport before extending to other rollups or sidechains, which will require Governance awareness. In preparation for this, PE along with the SNE team have begun work on an Integration Pack to guide future onboardings and risk assessments.  Core Modules: D3M Testing & Deployment The tail end of last year saw a complete modularized rewrite of the Direct Deposit Module, which is now live in Compound and ready for redeployment in Aave as well as future adoption for SubDAOs. This involved extensive testing, optimization, red/blue team review and audit.  DAO-wide Research, Development & Integrations The team has been involved in a variety of reviews for protocol led initiatives, including: MIP65, MIP21 in/output conduit reviews alongside CES, dss-proxy-actions and dss-vest updates, along with ongoing SafeBox implementations for CoinBase. There has also been ongoing work with the SAS team to complete exchange callees supporting liquidations, and reviews of their contract which integrates with 1inch liquidity. PE has also maintained participation in CSI meetings alongside CES to ensure new collateral can be managed through the spell process. With enough public awarness, PE was also able to finally release its Curve-lp-oracle mitigation, and post mortem. PE also worked alongside Immunefi in the review of a number of smart contract bug bounty submissions, however none were found to be valid other than presenting opportunities for better documentation - something that will need attention in 2023 to improve the developer experience. Side research projects during Q4 saw us explore ERC721 considerations as vaults, ultimately however the pricing of such assets is not something the broader ecosystem is ready to pursue. Q4 also saw PoW research concerns, luckily none of which came to fruition. The team also led a brief investigation into automating rate calculations, which with more research could open up opportunitites for reducing governance rate-change overhead. Similarly, emergency shutdown simulation testing led to improvements in the end contract which recently led to an upgraded flash module deployment.  Endgame & Looking Forward The last few months has seen a lot of structural Endgame discussion, some of which has been distracting to the DAO, while some of the discussion has provided insight into innovative products such as the Protocol Owned Vault for which we have extended the DssKiln implementation. Pending governance\u2019s direction, PE will be able to modify the base contracts to engage with different pools and token pairings. This brings with it research for preventing front running, impermanent loss and sandwich attacks when automating token transactions over time periods. Initial scopes are also being considered for voter incentives and will require additional investigation in 2023. In Q4, PE started working with Endgame proponents to document the \u201cscopes\u201d for Governance Engineering (spell creation), Core Protocol Engineeering (core modules and L2 expansion), and Innovation Engineering (Endgame and SubDAO products) - all of which will help give steer to the DAOs engineering endeavours as part of the upcoming constitution. As such, PE is excited to document the critical core engineering functions that contribute to the Endgame scopes and their value as part of Maker\u2019s future strategy. ",
