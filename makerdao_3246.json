But it also sort of feels like \u201cYou had one job!\u201d The product market fit for Makerdao is not hard to find. Its not like Makerdao has to sit in a room and brainstorm. It is slapping Makerdao in the face. You know of what i speak, I speak of eth. Makerdao should never allow the ether ceiling to be hit. Do whatever it takes: create different types of vaults for ether with different SF or whatever. Makerdao has 1 billion dai created from ether for a reason: product market fit. All this other stuff is theoretical (and interesting and should be worked on) but the priority should be eth. For the spice must flow! ",

The author believes that Makerdao's product market fit is Ether and that all other theoretical ideas should be worked on after Ether. A 3rd party is giving constructive criticism by suggesting that the author should provide more details on how Makerdao can prioritize Ether Vault Uptime and how it can create different types of vaults for Ether with different SF. The post also asks a question about whether Makerdao is missing the forest for the trees.",
