                    "content": "Dear Maker Community, As you know, 6s Capital and RWA Co. have worked closely together since the inception of the RWA001-A facility. Historically, RWA Co. has generated a monthly report when the facility is in use to showcase the transaction history and status of various assets and loans. In compiling this report, virtually all of the information is received directly from 6s Capital with the exception of the Trust bank account balance, which is collected via a direct viewer account possessed by RWA Co. In light of this, it represents a waste of resources for 6s Capital to continue to contract RWA Co. to generate reports that it can generate itself and are already a requirement in the Credit Agreement (see Reporting section). We would like to remind the community that the Credit Agreement also requires an annual audit from an Auditor to be delivered to the Trustee (which is underway right now for 2022) to ensure compliance. Moving forward, RWA Co. will continue to confirm its reading of the Trust balance from the viewer account while 6s Capital will provide reporting directly. Please do not hesitate to reach out to either myself or Matt with any questions.  DISCLAIMER The content of this communication is for informational purposes only.
