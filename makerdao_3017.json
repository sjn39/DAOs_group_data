Given the nature of how Real World Assets are being collateralized by 6s Capital, this vote is NOT to approve the actual debt ceiling; rather, this is the adminsitrative process approval to allow things to move forward. Unlike all other previous collateral onboarded, the 6s Real World Asset implementation has legal infrastructure that needs to be deployed first. For complete clarity and as an MKR token holder myself, I am not asking for, nor would I expect or desire to have a debt ceiling until such time as I have demonstrated that I have caused the implementation of the legal structures outlined in the Declaration of Intent. As @cmooney has put on the schedule, this is scheduled for a technical implementation December 18 2020. Unless I can provide the community time to review the book of legal documents related to the legal implementation, the the debt ceiling that would be implemented for that executive vote SHOULD be for a value of ZERO. Only AFTER the community has seen the structure is in place should the debt ceiling be raised. I do not want a debt ceiling until it is safe for MKR holders. Period. My understanding of the sequence.  Administratively onboarding Techncial onboarding Debt ceiling increase (only after 1 & 2)  It is possible that all of the documentation is ready before the 18th and if I can compress 3 into 2, then so be it. However, we should bifurcate the onboarding from the actual raising of the debt ceiling to a non-zero amount. ",

Will there be any losses on the Maker side if after approving going forward with this proposal we hit a future impasse that stops the project?   Good question. A few angles to comment on this. First, 6s is in this for the long-haul. The debt ceiling will come when LendCo can perform and the community is more comfortable with the associated risks. The reason why this proposal has so much legal infrastructure is explicitly to plan ahead to answer risk concerns way before they are here. \u201cWhat happens if we cannot find something works?\u201d Well, I prefer to focus on how we can build together (as the alternative painfully would be to only work at a reduced level). \u201cWill there be losses on the Maker side?\u201d If after some period of time, MakerDAO decides it no longer wants exposure to the credit quality and the loans that LendCo is providing, it need only to reduce the debt ceiling to zero. In doing so, this act will inhibit any future loans from being funded. Further it causes all future outstanding loans that are repaid to be returned to MakerDAO. In summary, this action would close LendCo\u2019s loan book by attrition.  Alternatively with the nuclear option of liquidation, should the community trigger a liquidation instead of an orderly wind down, the Trustee step-in and sells the assets of LendCo. LendCo\u2019s equity investors get \u201chit\u201d first, but it is possible there are losses to MakerDAO as assets would be sold to willing buyers and would be net of any administrative fees the Trustee would charge.     prose11:  Thanks again for all the time and effort helping us newer members understand what we are being polled on!

That\u2019s exactly, the main pain point we have currently as the smart contract is unable to keep the contract. My feeling is that we will do more off-chain deals (using a trust structure) before it moves on-chain. To be on-chain, we need a structured and liquid market. And let\u2019s suppose a corporate bonds ETF is tokenized tomorrow with a liquid marquet (and no KYC). For instance NEAR to stay short duration (18 months average maturity). The yield is 0.77%. And there will be the market valuation to deal with (drawdown of 5% in March). ",

The heart of why a Trustee is needed in this construct is painfully simple. The technology is moving lightyears ahead of the law. At present (and for the foreseeable future), a smart contract does not have standing in a Court of Law. That is to say, a smart contract (or its output) cannot be used (presently) to enforce a contract (e.g. it cannot cause or defend litigation). Guaranteed that jurisdictions will test implementations on smart contract legal standing enforcement within a set alpha protocol (e.g. like an enforceability standard to which a smart contract would have to interface to have standing). Those discussions are already starting within legal circles but still far away from laws being implemented or standards finalized (as this is new territory for them). Summary: The use of the Trustee today is paramount to ensuring enforceability from a regulated third-party. ",
