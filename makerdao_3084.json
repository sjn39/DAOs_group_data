Would like to ask about the transaction fees that will be incurred if 10 DAI is transferred from one address to another DAI address. I actually want to know the gas used amount - will it be a fixed 21000 for normal transfers or something different? ",

If you use Metamask you can configure all that, but don\u2019t recommend change gaslimit, just the Gas, hope it worked for you! ",
