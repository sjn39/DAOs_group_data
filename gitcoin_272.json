I wanted to let everyone know that SuperModular, which still maintains https://store.gitcoin.co/, dropped a new item on the store today - the Quadratic Lands Treasure Map Infographic. Here it is.  FknEIFbUoAAkAYj1920\u00d72961 539 KB  This treasure map is meant to be a celebration of the journey that Gitcoin has been on from 2017-2022. You can get a physical print or high res copy of the infographic here.  Or browse all items on the store at https://store.gitcoin.co/. ",
