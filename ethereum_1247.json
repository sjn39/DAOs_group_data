I\u2019m thinking on extracting this pattern as an ERC, as a way of providing a set of best practices and a building block to make other ERCs leaner. This is a common pattern (ds-auth, Delegable) which can be easily drafted and then used as a building block in many other ERCs (ERC20, ERC721, ERC777, ERC1155). In particular, ERC777 is a beast of an ERC, and it doesn\u2019t need to be. Segregating the operator pattern into its own ERC would allow ERC777 to be easier to understand. Later ERCs could pick apart other features of ERC777 like granularity and hooks. Is there any interest in opening this can of worms? ",
