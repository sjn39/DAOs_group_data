Originally passed in October of 2020, MIP14 outlines a generic procedure for DAI to be sent from the protocol to an Ethereum address. It does not appear to have ever been utilized, and the transfer of DAI for a number of purposes has typically been authorized through whatever governance action authorizes the activity financed by that transfer. Additionally, any subproposal under MIP14 would require a 4-week feedback period for sums between 10,000 and 100,000 DAI, and a 12-week feedback period for sums above 100,000 DAI. These thresholds make MIP14 impractical to use, but with no clear need for this MIP, repeal is favored over amendment.  Removed MIPs MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer, in its entirety.

I will recommend against removing MIP14 in favour of amending the MIP to improve it instead. While it is true that MIP14 has never been used - this in itself is not a complete argument for the removal of a MIP or any other part of the Maker Protocol. With the removal of Signal Requests following the recent MIP16 amendment, there are now three ways to request funding from MakerDAO:  A MIP40 Budget subproposal. A Special Purpose Fund (MIP55). MIP14.  MIP14 fills a niche where a funding request does not fit into either of the first 2 categories and if it is removed, we may run into a situation where we would like to provide funding for something but have no defined governance process to do so. GovAlpha has recommended using MIP14 when approached for advice within the last few weeks. Of course, this is just an opinion; feel free to disregard it.     fumoffuXx:  Can a collation of all MIPs which are obsolete be identified, explained with clear and concise narration with explanations for its/their obsolescence or deprecation be jointly included to this MIP?   You may collate MIPs which are linked for removal; see the recent removal of the collateral onboarding MIPs as part of a set. But otherwise, the MIPs should be assessed individually. e.g. the Core Unit MIPs could be removed as a whole, but we wouldn\u2019t allow the removal of, for example, Emergency Response Procedures and Delegate Compensation as a set.

This is an important point to address. There is overlap, but Special Purpose Funds have a specific definition as well as requirements. Taking from MIP55:  The creation of the Core Unit Framework launched the initial building blocks for organizing work for the DAO. Facilitators define mandates that cover long-term work areas and a broad set of focus and responsibilities for the protocol to be secure and successful.(1) Since then, community members have uncovered a need for a framework that is particular to purposes:  Of high priority, yet narrow in scope. Receivers of Funds are accountable to their deliverables, but do not hold long term responsibilities like a Core Unit. The request is one-off or irregular.  This MIP can be used for situations like:  Protocol Audit Funding. Legal Reserves for the DAO. Gas Reserves for Oracles / Protocol Deployments. Funding a team that works independently of Governance. Funding DAO objectives with no existing Core Unit or Facilitator.  Special Purpose Funds should be used infrequently. This MIP should NOT be used for:  Grants. Teams with long term objectives that should be Core Units. Vesting or DAO Mandated Actor / Contributor compensation.   There has, at times, been a perception that SPFs are a \u201cgeneric money request\u201d tool - which is untrue. In fact, they are a specific tool. The generic tool is MIP14. There may be a valid situation where someone wishes to request funding that the DAO wishes to provide, but it does not meet the requirements of an SPF, and MIP55 is therefore inappropriate. That is where MIP14 is useful and why I don\u2019t think it should be removed. It is a useful generic fallback option to have. That isn\u2019t to say it couldn\u2019t do with a freshen up. Many of the MIPs could do with some love. ",

This MIP removal subproposal repeals MIP14 in its entirety. With the removal of Signal Requests following the recent MIP16 amendment, there are three institutional options to request funding from MakerDAO Governance: (1) MIP14, (2) MIP40c3: Adding/Modifying Core Unit Budget Process, and (3) MIP55: Special Purpose Fund. MIP14 provides a specific pathway for Governance authorization prior to distribution through an Executive Vote that differs from the other two procedures, namely by being a generic, unrestricted mechanism. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth. You remain responsible for any actions you take on the grounds of this information. Please note the date when the summary was last updated to judge accuracy. Updated 2022-11-29 ",
