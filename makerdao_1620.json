Over 250 cryptocurrency wallet addresses were blocked on the Uniswap exchange, one of the most widely used in Ethereum, for allegedly being linked to illegal      It is the second time that Uniswap does something like this, this is good and bad, it is good because it cleans a little injustice (although we know that ironically the injustice that moves through the banks is much greater), and bad because we see that they are easily manipulated by the U.S., decentralization is over for Uniswap and other protocols that are taking similar measures. It seems that now it is time to make a fork of Uniswap that complies with the decentralization, since this in the future lends itself to sanction any address that does not comply with the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d at the convenience of the U.S. . Is there a possibility that in the future Maker can make its own DEX ?, the more self-sustainable we are the better, collaborative systems are good to some extent. ",
