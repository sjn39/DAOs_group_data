To avoid this we would need to draw up some rules that to determine which posts/replies benefit the community and which ones harm it. This is basically impossible to do in a decentralised way. We would need moderators to trawl through content determining if something is good or not. Then we\u2019d need moderators to moderate the moderators to ensure they aren\u2019t colluding to only reward their own posts. Then we\u2019d need moderators to moderate those moderators etc. etc. It isn\u2019t realistic. A better alternative would be to just reward token holders who vote on proposals. ",
