While we still make ~ 38MM just by the stability fees right now, our expenses are at ~32 MM so we are not going to fill the Surplus Buffer anytime soon as the System Surplus is at ~50MM now. However, if we are going to see a huge market drop with corresponding liquidations, we might end up in a huge pile of liquidation fees piling up, overflowing the Surplus Buffer eventually resulting in some flap auctions. I have to admit i would rather see those liquidation fees ending up in the piggy bag than some MKR burn, so I would like to discuss the idea of increasing the Surplus Buffer again making sure all accrued income is going into the Buffer instead of (potentially) causing some MKR burn.  Shall we increase the Surplus Buffer?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps I would be very happy hearing your opinions on this topic, maybe @Risk-Core-Unit or @Real-World-Finance have additional points. IMHO there is no real hurry on this topic, but I would like to find out what the community thinks about it and make a Signal Request (assuming there is some positive feedback on the idea) in ~2 weeks.

Imo the focus on burning MKR is completely misplaced during this phase of the project. I didn\u2019t realize this myself for a while, but\u2026 the fact that this isn\u2019t generally recognized is maybe my biggest concern I have for Maker right now. Supply side challenges we\u2019ll deal with. Regulatory pressure we can weather better than the competition. We\u2019ll build a DAO that can scale. But an extraction mentality too early in the project is a creeping drain on our vitality that may bring us down if we\u2019re unaware of it. If you think Maker is no longer a startup and we can sit back and relax\u2026 reaping the fruits now even if we\u2019re no longer in a bull market\u2026 I think you lack imagination about where this space will go and just how long the road still is. Maker needs to fire on all cylinders and reinvest as much as possible in its own growth and security. Everything else is complacent and burning MKR at this stage is shortsighted. If burning MKR now is what we need to convince MKR holders to hold\u2026 let\u2019s hope then we get better MKR holders or they will kill our competitiveness. But honestly, I think this may be a situation where everyone is assuming everyone else wants it (burning), but it may not actually be the case. So I hope the yes option of this poll will win with a landslide. We should not be burning MKR until the next bull market at least. ",

The standard business strategy for a new market is to reinvest as much as possible and grow like hell and to take as much market share as possible, then as growth slows start to extract more value and shift to a focus on profitability. If this wasn\u2019t clear to everyone already, it should be even more so after reviewing Circle\u2019s investor deck. They\u2019re growing and taking market share faster than any other stablecoin in the space and forecasting $-76M in EBITDA on $115M in Revenue this year (excluding D&A and stock based comp), but targeting 35% EBITDA margins long term. They\u2019re also forecasting nearly $900M in revenue in 2023 and I don\u2019t see their growth slowing anytime soon especially with a TAM approaching $200T. With that said, I think our first step should be to align as a community on appropriate CET1 and leverage ratios per @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s guidance. ",

                    "content": "The method we use to calculate appropriate Surplus is to check each collateral type\u2019s risk premium (can be found here https://simulation.blockanalitica.com/) and calculate the \u201cportfolio weighted risk premium\u201d which represents expected portfolio loss in percentage terms. The recent calculation we made, estimated the weighted risk premium of 2.5% and applying this to 2bn DAI outstanding debt from volatile collateral equals 50m DAI. This is in line with the current Surplus Buffer and we actually rarely (if ever) achieved that good risk coverage in the past. However, this ratio won\u2019t stay fixed going forward. If bull market kicks in or we increase DAI supply from volatile/risky collateral by organic growth (D3M, RWAs, stETH, G-UNI,\u2026) we should be prepared to grow risk coverage in nominal terms as percentage wise if portfolio weighted risk premium increases. It also becomes easier to onboard risky assets, scale DAO and so on. From that perspective it is better to accumulate reserves in advance, because otherwise we\u2019ll be lagging as we did many times in the past. At the same time I also think we should start giving more focus on treasury management if consensus will be to grow the surplus buffer from 60m. At certain point only hoarding passive DAI in reserves becomes ineffective. And to be honest, probably the number one reason why MKR holders would prefer buy&burn is because they prefer their share of passive surplus money to be reinvested somewhere rather than held passively (in buy&burn scenario reinvestment is made in protocol from those who don\u2019t sell MKR). If Maker is able make yield on at least part of Surplus, support for increasing surplus buffer could possibly be higher. Also side note, I don\u2019t expect 60m Buffer to be hit soon - unless rates increase or DAI supply from volatile collateral increases significantly to May levels, revenue will more or less equal costs and Maker would need to liquidate 77m DAI to accumulate another 10m in penalty fees to fill the remaining surplus buffer.

I would like to see a real assessment @Primoz  from a what amount of cash do licensed banks need to have as I expect regulators would like to see Maker with that number or higher. I want to echo a second sentiment regarding isolating operating cash from SB.     PaperImperium:  So we also need to get our arms around separating the actual SB from our operating cash. Because a year of expenses is (roughly) estimated at $32 million right now.   Agree with various comments @wouter @Aes and others startups really don\u2019t buy back stock - they plow returns into growth. I am also for buffer diversification and less concerned regarding PEG as per:     brianmcmichael:  As this has been a persistent issue, I wonder if it would be worthwhile to explore saving rainy day funds in a basket of alternative assets so that we can free Dai up for the market. That said, even tens of millions of may not affect the peg much at this point anyways.   PEG is being driven by artificially high DAI demand due to LP farming.  I see some moderate change of backing on DAI off of USDC to ETH predominantly.  Not sure if this is due to SF or just a 2K-3K ETH price change as I have not looked at the numbers in DAI vs. percent. I think it is important to realize that operational manpower costs now are over $30M/yr and SB basically has 1 year cash run ATM.   Some analysis of what we can do with DAI surplus to roll into growing operational budget fund probably would be prudent.   Realize it should be an easy matter to roll some of this back into the Surplus buffer in case of emergency if required so can still work as capital asset backing of the system in a pinch. I think a real discussion as to a real targets and structures for:  Surplus buffer (what is too much - why? ) Operational expense fund (which can back up surplus buffer in a pinch.  What is too little?  What things can Maker invest in to get return and still retain good liquidity. What is too much.). What levels of 1, 2 before Maker would consider looking for buyers to flop MKR to pay operational expenses or deal with losses in the SB if we have operational funds we can fill the SB deficit with.  Or what is too much and conditions to burn more MKR because MKR has a lot of cash on hand.  I think my main concern here is while we can talk about SB Maker would do well to also give some thought to when and how to line up MKR buyers (or whether to actually put up a DSR-B facility to borrow DAI with bond like terms to cover operational revenue deficiencies).    Companies don\u2019t usually just throw stock on the market if they need cash, they take time to find the best sale terms/prices, look at bond rates to borrow etc.   This should all be factored into a cash reserve management strategy.

                    "content": "  As discussed in the past, there is no way to invest the Surplus Buffer. The Surplus Buffer is on the equity section of MakerDAO not on the asset side. For most other protocols, the equity equals the treasury section which is on the asset side. Therefore, this one can be invested and managed.   Separating the surplus buffer from operational cash seems to be a good idea but it\u2019s not really. That\u2019s what I learned from my research for the Strategic Reserves. Some Core Units have contingency buffers that are out of reach of Maker Governance. It\u2019s better for Governance attacks and it didn\u2019t cost any PE time. Moreover, the risk of not being profitable (and not being able to generate cash flows to pay the teams) is somewhat uncorrelated to credit risk or market risk. So there is a diversification benefit of polling them.   I would refer to the [MakerDAO balance sheet] that RWF CU is maintaining (@Aes doing a great job at  it). As you can see the Surplus Buffer is in blue, it\u2019s not an asset. But the Operating Wallets are both as equity and as an asset. In that sense, you can say that there are some inefficiencies by having this cash unused. But it\u2019s really a minor problem (4M DAI). (MakerDAO Financials - Google Sheets).    The equity requirement for banks is 3% of the balance sheet (let\u2019s forget about more elaborated stuff like CET1 ratio, and it\u2019s not saying anything that we are or should be in any way under this regulation). We are currently around 1% and we might have an issue catching up if there is hyper-growth life earlier this year. MICA regulation for stablecoin issuers will be 2% (not saying at all we are in the scope). Even for simple brokers (and we are kind of a broker providing margin loans on crypto), it is above 1%. So even before knowing how much exactly we need (which would depend on our risk appetite and our place in the competitive landscape), it is fair to say that it should be more than what we have currently to give us options in the future and avoid dead-ends.

Not having a fair valuation would leave the system vulnerable to take over attacks ( Hostile takeover ) as MKR is not fairly valued and is at suppressed rates.

If you browse even just this forum, you can see myriads of work being done by the CUs on payroll, contractors, and active holders, all of whom receive compensation for their work. I don\u2019t see how you could say with confidence that dai spent isn\u2019t producing growth, even if you have an issue with specific expenses. The protocol has been scaling pretty rapidly with more CUs coming on board, new integrations and connections being made by growth, new structures. If you check other posts there is still new hiring happening, and new CUs such as legal that some expect to be coming next. All of these require costs, and I\u2019m sure there are a million other operational costs I\u2019m not aware of.  And it\u2019s not like the protocol is exactly raking in the cash right now from what I can see. ",

The surplus buffer plays an important role in the stability of the protocol. It\u2019s not just idle cash doing nothing. I\u2019m not sure if you think this is about the foundation MKR instead of the SB, but I don\u2019t see how printing and diluting maker to cover operational costs instead of raising the SB and delaying a burn makes any sense.
