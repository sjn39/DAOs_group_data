As the Ethereum ecosystem grows and stakeholders become more emotionally and financially invested, it\u2019s vital that we inform ourselves on the true views of disparate members of the community, to inform future decision making processes. The intentions of the survey are to:  Gain diverse community perspectives (eg. devs, miners, investors, community etc!) Derive accurate sentiment analysis (better signal to noise) Provide a channel for anonymous communication  The survey takes inspiration from last year\u2019s EIP0 Shared Values Survey by Status and the ability for data-driven efforts to impact how we collaborate on both technical and political challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem. The results of the Ethereum Governance Survey will be open sourced and published into a report. Note: this is NOT an official survey. Please take ~10 min to fill it out and share with your peers! The more responses, the more representative the data. Discussion welcome! https://forms.gle/YMy3uNvBG6QG8yTP8 ",

Thank you for committing to this and stating it up front.     evabeylin:  Note: this is NOT an official survey.   I\u2019m not sure who has the authority to decide whether something is an \u201cofficial\u201d survey. Can you expand on what you mean by this and why you felt the need to say it? Can you talk a bit how you came up with the labeling / names and sets of questions? My gut reaction is that the roles are going to result in not helpful answers. I consider myself a Community Member but not really a fan or hodler. Product Manager / UX Designer are two vastly different roles - why are they included in one category? Same with Business Person / Economist (entrepreneur / marketer). I do business, know little about economics, but am an entrepreneur. Maybe split them out? On 16, I don\u2019t know what \u201ceth 1.x discussions\u201d is? Do you mean the Prague / Stanford meetings? And I guess Core Devs tomorrow  Also on 16, Any reason EthMagicians forum isn\u2019t listed as a platform to learn more about Ethereum? And then the followup questions seem to be the same question but pick one platform \u2014 but with not all listed? Having me define the Ethereum vision myself and then ask if I agree with it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. This is a lot to get through. I answered it all. This might be effective as a much shorter survey with then asking users if they want to do a longer follow up. I hope you get some interesting answers but I think it will be hard to get many answers and the current format has some issues that may prevent useful analysis. I am trying to give feedback because I would love to see better info. But maybe we can give feedback on these questions before we promote it widely? Hope this early feedback helps! ",

While @boris has some strong points here, I want to emphasize as a surveys-nerd who immediately enthusiastically filled it out: You\u2019ve got something really strong here, @evabeylin. I\u2019m thinking this is the most successful broad-coverage assessment of many stakeholder groups, some of which haven\u2019t been explicitly examined together before. Boris being able to list some stuff you left out is the exception, rather than the rule, in my eyes. This is a great building block to add to the Kyokan-MolochDAO state of ETH2 report, and I look forward to the data outcomes. Final design note- different folks may have different internalized reference points for Likert scales; I unconsciously assume 1= negative sentiment towards framing question and 5= positive sentiment, so I filled out the first couple Likert scale Qs the opposite of how I intended to answer, before proofreading and catching my error. I\u2019m always available to proofread surveys etc for parallel construction of this type, you can ping me on Twitter or innovative.disruption@gmail.com. I feel like just as there are peer writing review groups, we need to post up peer methodology/research review groups, to help support one another\u2019s work! Anyways, it was really fun to take this thorough survey, it was well organized and kicked ass. You might get a higher abandon rate since all the Likert questions are \u201cmust answer\u201d in order to submit - if you want a bit wider of a net I think you can still alter that quality when a poll is live. If so you could either count \u201cnot answered\u201d alongside 3/neutral on the scale, or make it its own separate class. ",

I hope you get some interesting answers but I think it will be hard to get many answers and the current format has some issues that may prevent useful analysis.   I felt like a shorter survey wouldn\u2019t do justice to all of the topics being covered. I explicitly did not say how many questions were to be answered so the number wouldn\u2019t be a deterrent and those who were committed to submitting valuable data would get through all of it. This is also an anti-spam mechanism, you must answer all questions to submit and that can take time. Thank you for the feedback, much appreciated!!  ",

This might be effective as a much shorter survey with then asking users if they want to do a longer follow up.   Agreed. I was excited to start it, but man there\u2019s a lot there. It would be great to have a short and long form. Questions 21, 22, 23, and 24 would be a great simple, short, and easy quiz for anyone to do in 1min or less. After that, then ask people if they want to donate 5  more minutes of their time filling out more detailed questions. A few other things:  The first few (20) questions felt a bit too personal. I\u2019m struggling to see why you\u2019d need to segment people into such specific buckets with so many specific questions. Does that really inform a person\u2019s interests in governance? The part asking me to define the Ethereum vision then asking if I was aligned with it is confusing. I don\u2019t see how that provides meaningful feedback and signalling. For the EIP section, it would be great if \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable answering\u201d was rephrased as \u201cskip\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about this topic.\u201d  Hope that helps  ",
