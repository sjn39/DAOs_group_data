Here\u2019s a brief explanation of why this is needed:  The proposed Strategic Marcomms unit identifies and anticipates a problem of ad campaigns that require confidentiality and swift decisions, which the DAO can\u2019t easily provide. The heart of the problem is that the unit wouldn\u2019t be able to share details or data of an upcoming campaigns as signing NDAs is a standard business practice. The unit comes up with the Moonshot Fund as a solution, putting aside 5 million DAI which enables the unit to act on offers that provide great opportunities with high ROI. To ensure the Moonshot Fund is safely guarded, I ask five facilitators who can share the multisig of the fund in a separate wallet. *This way, it eases concerns by some of the community members, and it also enables the Strategic Marcomms to perform its mandate.
