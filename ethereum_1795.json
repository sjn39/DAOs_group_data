Example:   Company releases collection A and user mint token B at a price chosen by A.   User wants to resell token B through a NFT marketplace.   The marketplace, however, must (as works for royalties with ERC-2981) check whether the NFT has a minimum selling price imposed by the creator of the contract. If it does, the user will not be able to list it for less.   This ERC can be used to sell real objects whose value can never drop in price but only increase over time. Feedback, discussions, and comments are welcome. ",
