                    "content": " Background Information  Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Goldfinch is a decentralized, globally accessible credit protocol, with a mission to bring the world\u2019s credit activity on-chain while expanding access to capital and fostering financial inclusion. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Goldfinch is revolutionizing the $1T+ global private debt market by first allowing credit funds and FinTechs to access cost-efficient crypto loans. Goldfinch provides crypto lenders with access to debt deals collateralized with real-world assets that have been historically inaccessible outside exclusive networks. FIDU is a \u201cdigital receipt \u201d that represents an LP\u2019s supply to the Senior Pool. The Senior Pool supplies senior capital that must be fully paid back before Backers (first-loss capital) receive their principal/interest repayments. FIDU increases in USDC exchange value as interest payments are made to the Senior Pool and only decreases in the case of capital losses in defaults net of asset liquidations. MakerDAO has the opportunity to onboard a diversified selection of senior secured debt positions collateralized by real-world assets across 20+ different geographies. Goldfinch to date has maintained a 0% default rate across a currently ~$100m in loans deployed.  stats1582\u00d7686 77.8 KB  How long has the project been live in production? The FIDU token and the Goldfinch protocol both launched on January 2021. Provide a brief history of the project. Goldfinch was launched in early 2021 and currently has over ~72m in circulating FIDU. The FIDU token, which is an LP token, has a market cap of ~$77m. Goldfinch\u2019s protocol token, GFI, is used to govern the protocol. From the beginning, Goldfinch wanted to build for the borrowers who can benefit most and where crypto can have the greatest impact. That meant starting with lending businesses in emerging markets. Demand for crypto\u2019s liquid, multinational nature is high in those regions, as businesses stand to gain many benefits from using crypto due to the inefficiencies and barriers of traditional finance limiting the capital that can flow into these regions. Goldfinch is currently expanding financial access for thousands of individuals around the world via its Borrowers, spanning over 28 countries. Some of Goldfinch\u2019s Borrowers include PayJoy in Mexico, QuickCheck in Nigeria, Divibank and Addem Capital in LatAm, Greenway through Almavest in India, and Cauris in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. You can view more Borrower Pools here. It has ~$100M of active loans, and over $1M of protocol revenue. Warbler Lab\u2019s Founders are two ex-Coinbase employees with a team of ex-Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, World Bank, Binance.US, Airbnb, Meta, BlockFi, and more. Goldfinch has raised a $25M Series A, backed by a16z, Kindred Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Variant Fund, IDEO, Bill Ackman via TABLE, Kingsway Capital, Stratos, and more. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Whitepaper GitHub Repo Dev docs Protocol docs Dune dashboard  All the aforementioned pieces of information can be found through the links above.  Asset Information  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.) An ERC20 LP Token that is similar to cUSDC. How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights) FIDU is a USDC-based yield-bearing token that represents your position in the Goldfinch Senior Pool. Staked FIDU receives GFI rewards. In a soon-to-come product update, FIDU and GFI can be placed inside Membership Vaults to access enhanced yield. What is the market cap for the asset? As of 9/12/2022, FIDU has a market cap of ~$70m. Where does exchange for the asset occur? 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth. FIDU can be minted upon deposit of USDC into the Goldfinch Senior Pool and can be redeemed/burned in exchange for USDC if there is sufficient liquidity in the Senior Pool. This is the primary market. FIDU can also be traded on the Curve FIDU/USDC Pool. Currently, (as of 9/12/2022) there is $5.4m of depth in the curve pool. The pool can support (as of 9/12/2022):  A buy of $290k at 2% slippage A sell of $160k at 2% slippage  The DAO is considering migrating the pool to UniV3 and thereby increasing order book depth. FIDU secondary markets have a 7-day daily average volume of $338,733.55 (as of 9/12/2022). Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)? Trustless, on-chain. If off-chain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time. None. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type. Curve FIDU/USDC Pool. The DAO can develop more oracle solutions. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type. Liquidations may occur through a few different mechanisms:  Selling FIDU on the secondary market. Redeeming FIDU for USDC through the Senior Pool directly.  This would require the redeeming entity to be KYC/KYB.   Smart contract enforced seniority on interest payments that come to the senior pool, currently at around $500k monthly.  Similar to Centrifuge\u2019s method. This will require dev work on our end and is not currently possible.   Liquidation support guarantees through Warbler labs and other investors.   Business Questions  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault? LPs will use Dai to get liquidity on their FIDU positions without having to withdraw directly from the Senior Pool. LPs will use Dai to take leveraged positions into the Senior Pool. The DAO is open to exploring enabling the Senior Pool to accept Dai as an investable currency. What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated? If this were to launch \u201ctoday\u201d, we would expect $10M immediately. We expect this to de-risk investing in the senior pool for other LPs, give our bullish LPs a chance to take a levered position into our senior pool, and thus increase the amount of capital in the senior pool considerably, along with the market cap of FIDU. These effects will be significant as it is something we hear often from our current LPs. We expect the vault to grow proportionally over the next 6 months to $30-$50M. What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral? The key benefits for Maker are:  Charging a higher variable annual fee as FIDU is yield generating. Diversify the collateral within Maker\u2019s system.  FIDU in the senior pool [as of 9/19/2022] earns 7.81% APY, 14.66% with GFI rewards. As the FIDU inherently generates yield, Maker can charge a higher variable annual fee than the other vaults currently on its platform. Most of the assets listed are entirely on-chain, highly volatile assets that are quite prone to cyclical bull and bear markets, as well as tail risk events like the UST collapse, de-pegging of stETH, and Black Thursday. The Goldfinch Senior Pool, through FIDU, provides the safest and most diversified way by which Maker can onboard real-world assets. FIDU is much less volatile, sourced from across 20+ different countries, and thus much less exposed to one single regulatory and economic regime. FIDU increases in price as repayments come into the pool. As FIDU represents second loss capital, FIDU only decreases in price after a 20% default rate. Even in such tumultuous macroeconomic times, the default rate on private credit remains at 1.18%. Do note that these are generic private debt default rates, and Goldfinch has historically had 0% default rates as our protocol sources and underwrites incredibly high-quality, low risk borrowers with proven track records.  defaults1338\u00d7852 57.8 KB  Source: Proskauer 2022 Q2 Private Credit Default Index FIDU represents an incredibly differentiated, diverse, low volatility, collateral time for Maker. Furthermore, our LPs have expressed demand to borrow against their FIDU.  Legal Questions  What are the legal risks associated with the tokens? Goldfinch uses a product called the Unique Identity (\u201dUID\u201d), developed by Warbler Labs, for know your customer (\u201dKYC\u201d)/identity verification and accredited investor verification for US persons. UID is a non-transferrable NFT for on-chain identity verification. Warbler Labs partners with Persona and Parallel Markets to perform KYC and accredited investor verification. After a user completes this process, the user is may mint a UID which signifies that they have completed the KYC process  Each backer, borrower, and LP must hold a UID to transact on the Goldfinch protocol. We view the legal risks associated with FIDU as low. (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Goldfinch has obtained legal advice regarding the protocol; however, that information is not subject to disclosure to preserve the attorney-client privilege. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Not applicable. Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)? 21.a. If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity and jurisdiction? Issuance of FIDU is decentralized and automated by smart contracts. Access to the protocol is permissioned, but decentralized. Any party with the UID NFT can mint/redeem FIDU whenever they would like. Any changes to the protocol are done through the governance processes established by the Goldfinch DAO. This includes token voting for protocol changes using the GFI token and ratified through the Goldfinch Council which is a 6 of 10 multisig. Furthermore, Goldfinch has an industry leading DeFi Safety Score of 93% which you can read about here. This is equivalent to other bluechip DeFi protocols like Compound and Yearn.  Technical Questions  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Security is of absolute, paramount importance in the development of the Goldfinch Protocol. To that end, Goldfinch engages external auditors to review all smart contract code. Warbler Labs also maintains its own internal audit process for all smart contract code. Since its inception, Goldfinch has published the report from every external audit in an open-source repo. Goldfinch also has a $500k bug bounty live. Referencing again, Goldfinch has an industry leading DeFi Safety Score of 93% which you can read about here. Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified? No. Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400) ERC20. Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)? The Goldfinch Council is a 6-of-10 multisig with 10 members who represent all stakeholders of the protocol, and is designed to execute the will of the community. Snapshot: https://snapshot.org/#/goldfinch.eth The Goldfinch Council was formed when the GFI token was released and you can find more info about the council members here: https://docs.goldfinch.finance/goldfinch/governance#governance-council. Holders of GFI have voted on all changes to the protocol and the the Goldfinch DAO enforces a governance process for all protocol changes. Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved? No, there is no blacklist or whitelist. Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved? FIDU is an upgradeable proxy contract. Governance process, snapshot vote, and approval by the Goldfinch Council (referenced above) must happen in order for the contract to be updated. Does the token contain rebasing logic? No.  RWA The following questions apply to RWA collateral onboarding applications only: Provide (a) proposed legal structure for transaction, including: type of legal entities, (offshore/onshore, form (trust, corporate, other)) and jurisdiction(s) of legal entities, and (b) likely funds flow (DAI => Fiat => DAI). To onboard FIDU, no additional legal entities need to be created. FIDU is an LP token received by depositing USDC into the Senior Pool of the Goldfinch protocol which automatically allocated that capital to senior secured debt positions in borrower pools approved by the protocol. Once minted, FIDU is freely tradeable and secondary markets for it currently exist. The Junior Backers that take the junior debt position in the deal have legal rights to claim the assets that serve as collateral in the case of a default. The legal documents that give the Junior Backers these rights are structured such that any assets seized as collateral are due to be repaid back into the protocol - where the smart contracts enforce the proper waterfall, with Senior Pool participants being paid first. Any liquidations of FIDU can occur totally abstracted away from the legal structure. FIDU represents a diversified position in geography, business, and terms. It is resilient to defaults. Provide details on the organizational structure of the interested party, beneficial ownership, governance/control, key personnel, capital/funding resources and past financial performance. FIDU is a diversified position over many different deals, across 20+ countries. Each of the protocol\u2019s Borrowers have deep experience lending in the respective geographies where they operate, including following the proper legal structures and getting the necessary licenses as defined by the jurisdiction\u2019s regulators. Not one single entity composes the Senior Pool. The details for each deal can be found here: https://beta.app.goldfinch.finance/earn. Profiles for the borrowers can be found here: https://gov.goldfinch.finance/c/borrowers/16 Provide detailed summary of the proposed economic terms of the transaction, including, without limitation: commitment term, principal amount, interest rate, frequency of principal and interest payments, disbursement schedule, equity amount, funding ratios (equity/debt pro rata, equity first, etc.), collateral security, coverage ratios, currency (if not DAI) and other material terms. The quality of the proposed economic terms will be a consideration for the prioritization process. As mentioned above, FIDU is a diversified position over many different deals, across 20+ countries. The details for each deal can be found here: https://beta.app.goldfinch.finance/earn. Aggregate portfolio level details  (e.g. countries, number of people Goldfinch has funded) can also be found here: https://dune.com/goldfinch/goldfinch-borrower-impact-estimates. At a high level, there are some similarities in the economic terms of the Borrower Pools. Borrowers tend to pay around 10-15% in interest over a term length of about 2 to 3 years. Borrowers have payments due every 30 days. The loans are done in USDC. As the Senior Pool is comprised of multiple Borrow Pools, it functions as a weighted average of the individual terms defined above. At a high level, the Senior Pool:  Has a variable interest rate. Is an evergreen fund. Receives repayments from the Borrower Pools as they are paid back individually. Underlying USDC can be redeemed anytime there is excess liquidity in the Senior Pool, or traded in the secondary.  The Senior pool is protected on-chain by 20% of junior capital. Which is generally further protected off-chain by an addition ~20% by the borrower. Thus the actual economic buffer is ~40%. Identify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address, without limitation and to the extent relevant: market risks, commercial risks (e.g., diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc. FIDU is a diversified position and so risks described here will be general and not covering idiosyncratic risks relevant to each investment specifically. This is an advantage to listing the FIDU token as collateral versus other RWA assets. Some risks and mitigants across each of our deals include:  Commercial risks: borrowers may default on payments owed to lenders.  Mitigant: Borrowers have long track records with expertise in underwriting in the respective regions they operate in. See here for summarized views of each of the key Borrowers on Goldfinch. As described above, the Senior Pool has an aggregate economic buffer of 30-40%.   Currency risks: borrowers borrow USDC and are thus exposed to significant increases in the US dollar relative to their local currency.  Mitigant: Borrowers are mandated to hedge FX risk through various measures via a lower Loan to Value (LTV) to give a cushion for currency volatility, and FX hedging products such as futures or forward.   Jurisprudence risks: some collateral assets in certain nations may be difficult to liquidate given the rigor of the legal regime present in each nation.  Mitigant: Goldfinch operates with Borrowers who have expertise in their local context and have experience liquidating/recovering value from defaults.   Regulatory risks: certain nations may impose capital controls that prevent the protocol from gaining back USDC in extreme events.  Mitigant: Goldfinch operates with Borrowers who have the required local regulatory licenses needed to operate in their regions. To get a sense of the diversity of countries we operate in, please check out: https://dune.com/goldfinch/goldfinch-borrower-impact-estimates.    Outline the applicant\u2019s underwriting guidelines/policies, origination strategy (marketing, sales, channels), servicing strategy (charge-offs, collections), and historical asset performance. There are two levels of underwriting relevant here:  How funds we lend to underwrite their deals. How the protocol chooses to deploy Senior Pool capital across the different Junior Pools.  The Borrower Pools are proposed by funds that are experts in underwriting credit, have deep experience working in the geographies within which they serve, and utilize the best available technology to support their efforts. These are the entities taking out the loan from the Goldfinch protocol. Some of Goldfinch\u2019s Borrowers include PayJoy in Mexico, QuickCheck in Nigeria, Divibank and Addem Capital in LatAm, Greenway through Almavest in India, and Cauris in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. More information about each of these funds can be found here: https://gov.goldfinch.finance/c/borrowers/16. Backer review the data rooms created by the aforementioned funds and provide the first loss capital for each of the deals. By incorporating the principle of \u201ctrust through consensus,\u201d the Goldfinch protocol creates a way for Borrowers to show creditworthiness based on the collective assessment of other participants rather than based on their crypto assets. This means that while the protocol doesn\u2019t trust any individual Backer or Auditor, it does trust the collective actions of many of them. Borrower provides ongoing performance updates to the community - link. Outline the applicant\u2019s risk monitoring and operations guidelines/policies (e.g., charge-offs, collection, recovery provisions, data collection and technology, etc). Borrowers provide regular performance updates (e.g. covenant reporting, and portfolio level on-lending summaries) time to token-gated communication channels. Loans on Goldfinch are currently over-collateralized with off-chain assets and income. Off-chain loan agreements provide path to legal recourse for default remediation. All of the current Borrowers develop and leverage technology to gain a further edge in underwriting. Describe the regulatory regime applicable to the underlying asset (if any) and the applicant\u2019s legal and compliance program relating thereto. As Goldfinch lends across 20+ countries, there is not a single regulatory regime the protocol falls under. Goldfinch is permissioned through the UID product. Goldfinch rides on Borrower local licenses and regulatory approvals. Identify any 3rd party persons likely to be relied upon by applicant to implement the transaction (legal, accounting, servicers, trustees, etc.). None.  Cc: @recognizeddelegates ",

As an investor in both senior pool and backer pools (almost 4 of them) since August 2021, I can vouch for the Goldfinch protocol, it\u2019s team and the quality of borrowers on the protocol. I invested in Goldfinch just as a hedge against bear market in Crypto. I was looking for something that was completely uncorrelated to Crypto and as all the borrowers on Goldfinch are from real world and their performance has nothing to do with Crypto market\u2019s performance, I took a chance. Till now, I am glad I invested in Goldfinch because my crypto portfolio fell by 80-90% since 2021, but my investment in Goldfinch is stable and providing me most of my monthly income from Borrower pool\u2019s interest payments (which are paid on time every month. Not even a single month delayed or missed payment till now ). The interest I get from Senior pool (Close to 16% if GFI rewards are also included) is also relatively more than many other standard lending protocols on Ethereum. I support this proposal as I believe it is beneficial to both Maker (Higher Yield, GFI Rewards, Uncorrelated to Crypto Market) and Goldfinch (More liquidity in to Senior pool). A win-win situation!

Sincerely appreciate the kind words and feedback! I will dive into some of your points below.     rspa:  Later you posit that KYC is not necessary for Maker. But without KYC Maker could not redeem FIDU, right?   To be clear, KYC is unnecessary for interacting with FIDU on the secondary market. It is, as you noted, required for interacting with the primary market. This does mean redeeming FIDU for USDC. There are a few ways to go about it:  Maker has real-world relationships implemented through off-chain, legal entities. We can apply a similar framework through a conduit partner who lets the DAO redeem FIDU for USDC through the primary market for liquidations. While the volume on the Curve pool is low, it is fairly liquid allowing you to do $200-$300k buys and sells as liquidity is incentivized to be there. As the Senior Pool receives significant cashflows monthly, we can pursue a Centrifuge-like solution that enables the DAO to liquidate via cashflows.  We certainly view Maker as an important long-term partner and are hoping that, with this thread, we can understand what is important for the DAO and see if there is anything we can do on the product side to help. Please do let me know if there are any further questions or concerns! ",

This seems like the best route to go, given the liquidity concerns. But I\u2019ll leave it to the respective core units to formulate the ideal implementation path. As has already been noted elsewhere, it seems like FIDU will have a hard time ever making the oracle costs involved back to the DAO. Given that a transition to metaDAOs, who could use cheaper or free oracle networks, is on the horizon, we\u2019re even more convinced that a partnership between Maker and Goldfinch is feasible soon.

Thanks for the feedback here! Is there a minimum amount of Dai generated that you look for in terms of covering the costs? Is the main metric you look for that ability the market cap of the token?

Is there some sense of the minimum \u201cDai Generated\u201d metric in the case of MetaDAOs and how that calculation is done? Understand the work on MetaDAOs is not yet finished. If you don\u2019t know what the MetaDAOs are going to look like here, is there any way we can figure out what the key minimum benchmarks for liquidity and Dai generation are for Maker today as a base case? We are excited to work with Maker too! We want to do whatever we can to set up the collaboration for success so understanding the benchmarks for some of these key metrics would be incredibly useful!
