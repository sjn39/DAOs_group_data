Pertaining to DeFi:  If you compare Curve\u2019s exposure to GUSD in November 2021 to February 2022\u2013not much has changed. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the Risk CU Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation:    image1408\u00d7164 78.5 KB  Today Curve has 8.2% of GUSD Supply and Gemini is still at 54%  image1710\u00d7620 83.2 KB    We believe this product lacks Network Effects\u2013Stablecoin sector has become super competitive.   If crypto(dot)com who spends millions in advertising/marketing has lost exposure to GUSD from holding 3% of the supply in November 2021 to 1.84% in February 2022\u2013how can we be confident that the GUSD PSM will attract users?

We Fully Support the @MakerMan Compensation We are 100% behind our fellow Delegate receiving the compensation that has been requested within the current Executive.  Request for Comments We ask the community to provide comments as to why it is important to increase the GUSD PSM DC.  Protecting the Hat is Priority One In the case we believe there\u2019s more supply available in the open Market versus the HAT, 3F Delegate will prioritize the HAT over its believe that the GUSD PSM increase is not necessary.

                    "content": "GUSD seems as safe as USDC or USDP/BUSD. There are also little concerns that there will be market makers to arbitrage the price should it deviate from the peg. Therefore, the point is mainly on the fact that it is not used today (it was maxed earlier this month). Diversification on centralized stablecoins should be a goal for 2 reasons:  Having a standup alternative when needed. You can buy 99% of your good from one supplier because it\u2019s cheaper, but it\u2019s good to keep an alternative warm just in case. Avoiding reinforcing the USDC monopoly. We are not shareholders of Circle, don\u2019t get any deal from them so we should help to level the playing field of CeFi stablecoins suppliers.  Let me show you to hint that the GUSD-PSM is helping. First, on the Dexes, since the PSM introduction end of November, the price deviation from the peg is lower and volatility of this deviation is lower as well.  image1285\u00d7516 40.9 KB  Secondly, from CoinGecko, you can see visually the stabilization mechanism from the PSM from the end of January which was when the PSM was really used.  image845\u00d7475 22.9 KB  You can follow from Etherscan that one Gemini is filling the PSM and a flash bot is using it to arbitrage the pools. You might say, well this is just helping Gemini, they should pay for it. I would argue that it is in our strategic interest. First helping them is giving us an alternative to USDC. I don\u2019t care about nickels and dimes here. But there is way more at stake. Looking at the trades, I have the feeling that Gemini uses the PSM when they are doing an OTC GUSD-DAI trade for a client (the numbers are quite random) or to arb the price on their exchange. If that is correct (which is what @tylerwinklevoss  said in Gemini PSM application), this is a great way to provide DAI liquidity and competitiveness to a major CeFi hub at no cost. I would advise MakerDAO to increase the DC and Gemini to target a utilization rate of 50% (so it can work in both ways). ",
