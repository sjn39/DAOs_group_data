                    "content": "Hello all. I\u2019d like to suggest that we consider changing the way we vote on large-cap ceilings that aren\u2019t ETH-A. I\u2019m primarily thinking about WBTC-A, but also to some extent USDC-A. We\u2019ve seen the appetite for WBTC continue to increase. Managing the debt ceiling on an ad-hoc basis with signal requests was fantastic for the initial stages, but now that it has become a core part of the collateral portfolio, we may want to think about how to govern the ceiling in a more consistent manner. USDC-A shares similar problems, though it is somewhat mitigated by the fact that it is only heavily used when the peg is distressed. As we add additional collateral types that see heavy use, we\u2019ll find that managing them individually is not especially scalable. I\u2019d like us to try to land on a more automatic approach. Here are some suggestions:  We decide that we want WBTC-A / USDC-A debt ceilings to be x% of the ETH-A ceiling, and adjust automatically whenever we change the ETH-A ceiling. We decide that we want to vote regularly on the debt ceiling (or ceilings) and include polls to increase ceilings each week similar to how we vote on base-rate. We decide to maintain a buffer of x million Dai between the ceiling and current debt, then poll when needed to maintain that buffer.  Many of these are similar concepts to what is proposed in MIP17, but MIP17 was specifically targeted around usage and was intended to provide short-term flex rather than long-term changes. It\u2019s also likely that something like this can form the basis of the logic for an instant access module in the future. In terms of implementation of this idea. I\u2019m coming around to the thought that signal requests can be used to initiate / trial changes in governance process which can then be formalized through MIPs once any issues have been resolved and we know the process is solid. Suggested Steps (assuming positive outcomes)  Discuss the issue and consider the pros and cons of various options Someone start a signal request (following the practical guide) to try to form consensus. On-chain vote as per the signal request process. We trial the system for a month or so. The signal creator formalizes the system as a MIP.  ",

We\u2019ve been capped out on WBTC for awhile now, and BAT is close too (we haven\u2019t even started the signalling request for that one yet). The hard part is, if we are keeping the \u201cspirit\u201d of the debt ceiling intact, the math should include current asset price, collateralization ratio, and the moving target of \u201cprice at where a large chunk of vaults get liquidated.\u201d I like the buffer idea the best, because we could just set a relatively low buffer, eg 10-20 Million, which (I don\u2019t think) increases risk a whole lot for ETH-A and WBTC-A, and then whenever we cross that threshold the increases get included in the weekly executive cycle.  I\u2019d prefer to avoid more on-chain polling at this point : / ",

ETH will soon have yEarn vaults, and IMO the community should commit to always keep at least 100 million in free debt ceiling available so that the protocol can service a surge in new users through the yEarn ecosystem. Its true there is risk to having a free debt ceiling, but that risk isnt comparable to the risk of turning away users during the critical moment of the project where it needs to scale to keep the peg functional.
