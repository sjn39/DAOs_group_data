Because Sai was used as a restricted collateral in MCD, there are certain contracts that remain that are now useless, but it\u2019s still good practice to de-authorize, and a couple other things like erase the SAI ilk as much as possible. Just tagging the community in general to figure out whether a polling vote is needed for this or not. Our idea is to incorporate this in the executive vote for Friday June 5, 2020. The SC team will of course provide access to the code beforehand, as well as an explanation as to what the code will do. @LongForWisdom I require your wisdom  ",
