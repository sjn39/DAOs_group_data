We will refine this proposal during the RFC period. Our preferred way forward would be to get a counter proposal from the CoreUnit Facilitator, so we can ditch this one and not submit it formally. The authors reserve the right not to submit this proposal formally if an adequate response is forthcoming. The proposal should include how the core unit plans to:  Transfer intangible MakerDAO assets (access to DAO-claimable platforms, e-mail accounts, websites, etc.) back into the DAO.

To the extent that this is reasonable and possible, provide enough detail so that other Core Units can pick up these activities.

As our core unit has been minimized to just the bug bounty program at this point, I\u2019ve been in coordination with the steward core units with regards to making sure the transition to Ecosystem Actor is done with minimal negative impact to the bug bounty program management. One of the things we\u2019re working with them on is with regards to proper staffing for triaging bug reports within or among their respective core units. I can confirm as well that during this time the core unit itself beyond Joshua\u2019s activity can continue to operate without the allocated budget as it is in the interest of Immunefi itself to make sure that the bug bounty program of MakerDAO is properly maintained and we will continue to work with the steward core units to keep the bug bounty program operational with no, or at the very least, minimal downtime.
