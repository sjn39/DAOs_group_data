I do my best to exercise discretion and sound judgment in my conduct as both a risk professional, investor and advocate in the MakerDAO and crypto ecosystems. Disclosure Policy I may hold positions in some of the companies, projects, cryptocurrencies, or tokens I discuss in public forums, web chats, including social media. Where reasonably possible, I will disclose these relationships. Compensation I have not been paid in cash, gifts, or expense reimbursements by any company, project, or fund to serve as an ambassador or marketer. Should this change, I will add those compensated roles here. Any sponsored content will always be disclaimed as such. Investments I hold investments in publicly traded firms, indexes and mutual funds across NZX, ASX, European, US and Emerging share markets. Where any of those investments have direct conflicts with any project assessed in my capacity as risk professional for MakerDAO, and where reasonably possible, I will disclose these relationships. Material Cryptocurrency and Token Holdings I own cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and tokens, and also may speak publicly about these projects, assets, and concepts. My current holdings include the following assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, XRP, Cardano, Aave, Synthetix, Maker, Matic, Uniswap,1inch, Brave, Binance, Nexo, Solana. Real World Asset Projects I hold no position in tokens or projects invested by MakerDAO in any Real World Assets evaluated. General I am committed to keeping these disclosures as up to date as reasonably possible in my capacity as a risk professional working for the MakerDAO. Note: I truly hope this sets a precedent for other members of risk teams in their capacity working for the DAO. If not, I\u2019ve done my part. ",
