                    "content": "I struggle to understand how the peg is maintained and what exactly is the purpose of the MRK token in all of it. Say Dai is going for $1.09 on the open market: To remedy this MKR holders \u201cshould\u201d decrease interest rates so that more people mint Dai and the price of Dai goes down. However, lower interest rates means less MKR gets burned off when Dai loans are paid back. MKR holders want higher interest rates because burning off more MKR reduces supply resulting in the price of their holdings going up. So MKR holders are incentivized to keep interest rates high when they should be low. Add on top of this that if interest rates are lowerd, then more Dai holders are going to want to pay back their loans thus reducing the supply of Dai and driving the price up more. Exactly the opposite of what is needed when the price of Dai is above the peg. Add on top of this arbitrage as people mint new Dai in order to make a quick profit selling it for the marked up price. Add on top of this collateral dipping below the 150% threshold immediately being liquidated with a 13% penalty. Add on top of this minting new MKR and selling in on the market if the price of collateral dips so fast that auctioning it off does not cover the losses. Add on top of this an increased demand for MKR as the demand for Dai grows. Like, what a mess of supply and demand incentives. It is just as bad if Dai is less than $1 which also results in a salad of conflicting incentives to raise the price. I can see many of the individual parts of this system, but the whole picture of how it all works together eludes me. ",

Minting new DAI have been already stopped for more than one week, in fact, DAI seems being returned at the moment, and MKR holders don\u2019t want to put the interest down. Or at least, a big portion of the holders don\u2019t want to. Maybe this is just displaying one of those conflicts @nanook mentioned above. This said, I\u2019m not bringing any solution to this conflict, aside from suggesting to the MKR holders to easy a little the fees. But I guess they want to go back to Burning MKR from Surplus DAI as fast as possible, even at the cost of DAI on $1.01 fixed and nobody wanting to risk to mint DAI with leverage on the stable coins at the cost of never getting anything back (not even the GAS fees). image689\u00d7511 17 KB ",

LongForWisdom:  Essentially when we set the stablecoin vaults to 101% LR, we exchanged peg instability above $1.01 for stablecoin supply instability.   I wonder if this implies that we\u2019ll give up to try to take the PEG back to $1.00? I do understand that below $1.01 it is within acceptable parameters, but it worries me that without actions, we\u2019ll never get \u201cswings\u201d between $1.00 which are (IMHO) good for the stability and credibility of the DAI.

Part of me is onboard with you, and I share your interest with making a stable coin that is truly a global currency. It makes me want to contribute to this cause because I believe in it and believe in the better future it promises. But then I look at the governance and it seems just as rotten to the core as any other scam shitcoin out there. The MakerDao system will probably succeed in making a universal stable coin, but at the cost of the governance around it being indistinguishable from modern governments around the world. Complete with all the greed, corruption, extortion, and general rottenness all to sway and garner more votes. Congratulations on becoming your own fed. As much as shit changes it also stays the same I guess. ",
