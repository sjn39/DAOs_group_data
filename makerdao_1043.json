                    "content": "My name is Adam Young and I wanted to introduce our firm to the community in advance of submitting a more formal application in the coming weeks. This post and the accompanying document serves as a place for the community to get to know us better and through dialogue on the Forum, begin to understand how we can add value as a long-term partner. We\u2019ve spent time getting to know members of the Real World Finance Core Unit. In the coming weeks, Precession will be submitting a formal application for review and hosting a community call and presentation. We look forward to meeting more members of the community, core units, and delegates. For those who want an immediate look into some more detailed information on Precession, and a work-in-progress of our eventual Arranger Application, please dive in deeper here. With that, I\u2019ll shed more light on who we are and why we think working together is a win-win for Maker and Precession. Precession Capital Management LLC, or here just Precession, is an SEC-regulated, New York-based Investment Adviser specializing in asset-backed and structured credit portfolio management. Our management team has decades of experience in structuring, managing, and investing in asset-backed securities and private credit transactions backed by real estate, consumer, and corporate assets. We deliver value through:  collateral & modeling expertise flexible and forward thinking transaction structures holistic risk-based underwriting  We focus on:  risk-adjusted return optimization capital preservation relative value  Each transaction we undertake is unique in composition, requiring an adaptive yet disciplined form of investment management. Our extensive experience in analytics, risk-based management, and structural mechanics has been honed by decades of credit market volatility and opportunity. Regardless of deal size or asset type, Precession also contributes junior capital to all transactions we manage through our private funds, providing credit support to senior counterparties. I am a credit and fixed income manager with three decades of experience and focused exclusively on asset-backed investments at financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank, and Macquarie, and more before establishing Clear Haven Capital Management in 2012 and Precession Capital Management in 2021. My responsibilities are leading all investment activities including research & analysis, execution & allocation, and risk management. I hold dual undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Finance and a Master\u2019s Degree in Financial Engineering from University of California, Berkeley. Our team has navigated asset-backed financial markets through both macro and localized economic cycles. By focusing on our core competencies and avoiding style-drift, we look to continue our track record of delivering value to our clients and our partners.  Why MakerDAO? Currently Maker vaults use over-collateralized Crypto assets to protect MakerDAO from losses. However, events such as black Thursday have shown this is not a perfect solution. Real-World Assets (RWAs) are also exposed to macroeconomic cycles, but this risk is mitigated when the assets are properly structured. Ultimately a combination of both Crypto and RWAs can create a more resilient DAI peg. We believe Maker was aware of this when the RWA journey first began. In traditional finance, Asset Backed Lending (ABL) structures minimize senior risk above all else. ABL structures can be used to effectively control RWA risk - whether it comes from macroeconomic cycles or the underlying asset. ABL structures have existed for many years and are constantly evolving. At Precession, we have built our careers around asset-backed lending, and invest almost exclusively in these transactions. ABL structures have weathered all types of economic cycles and persisted - a testament to their efficacy. We believe in the decentralized future of credit markets and the role that MakerDAO\u2019s decentralized stablecoin Dai will play in delivering stable and resilient liquidity. DeFi alone has the ability to create shared incentives and penalties without creating economies of scale for single actors to become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. As DeFi infrastructure becomes an integral part of global markets, established forms of traditional finance can play an important role in this evolution. We regard this as a once in a lifetime opportunity for early adopters like us and would like to submit an application for an \u201cArranger\u201d style vault meeting MIP67 criteria.  More About Precession  Precession Capital Management, LLC is a SEC-registered Investment Adviser based in New York, NY USA and founded in 2021. Precession is a fund manager first and foremost. We seek out investments that generate above average returns for our investors. The primary mechanism is by investing in levered or subordinate tranches in pools of assets. We put our own capital into every deal, as \u201chaircut\u201d or first-loss capital, and utilize senior financing. We use a top-down and bottom-up approach to analysis to form a comprehensive assessment of both idiosyncratic and macroeconomic risk. We are highly selective yet opportunistic. We screen asset classes, markets, and structures for specific features that we believe offer suitable risk vs return. We typically invest in less than 5% of the potential transactions we analyze. We perform our own due diligence and cashflow modeling, and often form joint-ventures to reduce transaction-specific risk. Over 80% of our transactions are domiciled in the U.S. We have legal counsel relationships across the globe, and are comfortable working in other jurisdictions, particularly with US, EU, or British legal systems. Deal Structuring typically involves a DE Statutory Trust model, and/or a Bankruptcy-Remote SPV to hold assets. All-Asset Liens, Guarantees, Representations, and Warranties are standard transaction features. We understand that Centrifuge is working with MakerDAO on an indenture trust, and will strive to meet all requirements there. Risk Management starts with asset-selection, diligence, and deal structuring. Ongoing management involves a toolbox of underwriting controls, exit clauses, and guarantees. We monitor our transactions as granularly as possible, and update our portfolio analytics in real time. Our team is made of industry veterans with experience in structuring, trading, and investment management. We actively seek out new talent and ideas, and favor battle-tested experience. Each member of our management team has achieved success through bear and bull markets. Economic cycles are unpredictable in size and frequency, but always occur. Certain types of assets and borrower behavior is recognizable across cycles. We screen asset classes and assess risk in a holistic manner. Below, I share our general economic commentary and thoughts.   Our Investment Thesis and Strategy Precession\u2019s Strategy: In a recession, Precession reduces or halts asset purchases, allowing cash to build up and then re-deployed when appropriate. Our transactions often feature triggers and covenants that can rapidly amortize the senior tranche in the event of adverse performance. We continuously search for relative value across different markets and sectors, which can also be useful in identifying credit cycles and patterns. We do not have a crystal ball. We position ourselves defensively so that we can proactively adjust to change. Economic Cycles: Economies move through growth and contractionary phases in a cyclical manner. Precession believes in a prudent approach to underwriting risk. For example, low-risk assets such as insured or guaranteed loans are modeled based on worst-case prepayment and interest rate scenarios. Direct consumer loans are evaluated based on their ability to withstand recession-like default rates. Secured loans are underwritten based on conservative default rates and prudent collateral recovery projections. Loans to businesses are evaluated assuming recession-like revenue scenarios and feature security pledges from the borrower. Recession Probabilities: In Q3 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve believed the probability of a near term recession was high, based on historical experience. Federal Reserve - Nov 2020  1155\u00d7772 183 KB  Though a recession failed to materialize in 2021, the future is unknown. There is no way to accurately forecast economic cycles, but we know with 100% certainty that they occur. Federal Reserve - April 2022  1133\u00d7723 284 KB  Our goal is to understand the risks we are taking while recognizing that not all risks can be avoided, but many can be mitigated through disciplined analysis, structural protections, and embedded optionality.

With regards to unsecured consumer loans, we recently seen an uptick in non-bank lending outfits like Upstart, Affirm, and others\u2014(automated underwriting)\u2014do you believe their pricing models are going to be under some stress with the current credit risk and rising rate environment? This will be nuanced depending on the type of lender, borrower sourcing channels, underwriting (\u201cU/W\u201d) methodologies, and so on.  Most automated loan originators use black box U/W techniques that, while not very transparent, tend to rely on a combination of (i) traditional credit U/W (FICO, credit reports) and (ii) tech-based U/W.  The latter may involve Plaid and other service providers that underwrite based on behavior.  Whether a new form of U/W will be successful (relatively) is often unknowable until tested.  We would normally expect an increase in defaults during an economic downturn.  But the magnitude of the increase will vary across credit tiers and will be related to the issues mentioned above.  Early in an economic downturn, loan pricing comes under pressure until originators can adjust U/W and/or the effects of the downturn become known.  When the market is uncertain, extreme scenarios will be priced in.  This happened in the '08 crisis and during the first few months of the Covid pandemic. Originators survive based on how their product performs, how much of it they hold or are exposed to, and whether they have sufficient capital to withstand a contraction.  In March and April, we\u2019ve seen pricing pressure across non-QM and consumer sectors.  To compensate, originators will increase interest rates and modify U/W, which usually impacts volumes.  We have seen valuations decline for many of these firms recently. And the paper that\u2019s being packaged and resold to investors\u2014do you think more than likely it\u2019s going to hit a rough patch, a.k.a defaults? Holders of this paper may experience losses when defaults rise, or they may simply experience a lower yield.  The end result depends on the relationship between the increase in default rates vs the net interest spread, as well as the structural features of the investment vehicle.  Senior tranches of securitizations and ABL facilities are typically structured to withstand an increase in default rates.  Junior tranches are more levered and more sensitive to adverse performance.  Unstructured vehicles will experience losses directly.  The answer to your question depends on the asset itself and the investment vehicle holding the asset.  But generally speaking, if defaults rise, you would expect investors to become cautious, leading to pricing pressure and changes in structural requirements.  We analyze and structure transactions conservatively as we typically participate in a first loss or subordinate position.  If a senior tranche experiences a loss, it means we have taken a 100% loss or full writedown.  This is a catastrophic outcome and something we would avoid at all costs, including avoiding the transaction entirely. How does Precession deal with non-bank lenders that don\u2019t have an account with the Federal Reserve? Non-bank lenders typically either originate via (i) state-level licenses or (ii) through a depository institution (bank) with Federal Reserve access.   If we are facing the former, we conduct diligence on the entity\u2019s financial condition.  Our concerns will depend on the nature of the relationship and transaction.  For example, if we are purchasing assets outright and holding them in a SPV with third-party servicing and no recourse to the originator, Precession (as buyer) may feel insulated from originator risk, regulatory concerns aside.  If, however, the originator was servicing loans internally, then the financial condition of the servicing entity would be an important consideration.  We would require financial covenants, and may retain a backup servicer as a precaution.  In another example, if we are extending financing to a lender or origination counterparty, its financial condition will always be important.  We would normally take security interest in collateral that is pledged to a BK-remote SPV in the event of a workout (default) scenario. ",
