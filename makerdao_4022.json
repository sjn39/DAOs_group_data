So I\u2019ll explain more (thought this was self-explanatory): In a couple of hours time, bETH will be launched on the Terra blockchain which will allow stakers to borrow UST and earn a net APR of 30% (currently). Locked ETH in Oasis vaults cannot and do not generate any yield, and incur a 2% stability fee on borrowed DAI. In a world of rational decision-makers, borrowers will shift their ETH collateral to Lido Finance to be paid to borrow UST on Anchor Protocol. In time, Maker will gradually lose its market dominance to Terra if all things stay equal. Thoughts? ",

I think potentially it could be, but it\u2019s too early to tell, especially since they are still going through their liquidity mining program (without the incentives, borrowers have to pay ~20% interest).  Although their traction so far has been impressive, having already locked up 28k eth in ~24 hours. I think one of their strongest points though is that Terra is very strong and focused on scaling across multiple chains, whereas Dai is mainly just on Eth at the moment. ",
