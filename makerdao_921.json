                    "content": "tl;dr FATF, the global AML watchdog and standard-setter, has reached out to me to present at their meeting next Tuesday. What should be my message to them? More context Due to my past public policy and advocacy involvement at Maker and expert work, representatives of various governments and international organizations occasionally message me with requests or questions. Usually, I keep these conversations confidential to maintain trust and for other obvious reasons. These contacts have recently intensified, yet another sign of increasing interest and ongoing scrutiny. For example, two weeks ago, I participated in a global regulators\u2019 roundtable by the Japanese Financial Services Agency. Tomorrow I will present at a seminar for the Swiss central bank. FATF\u2019s invitation is especially significant, hence my outreach to you all. About the meeting FATF\u2019s Virtual Assets Contact Group organizes the meeting as part of periodic consultations with the private sector. A bunch of government representatives, as well as multiple industry players, will participate. Other than me, presenters will be from academia and industry associations. After a few presentations, there will be a discussion among participants. The general topic will be AML and crypto. They want me to provide thoughts on the revised FATF guidance and DeFi. The guidance spurred heated discussion a few months ago (including here in the forum). It has already led to the EU\u2019s crackdown on unhosted wallets, which I am sure you have heard about, and that\u2019s just the beginning. The request I received is to reflect on the guidance and provide insights about what can be improved and what further work the FATF should consider. Let me know your thoughts (here or via a DM). ",

                    "content": "I want to echo @PaperImperium here.   Key points of Maker are that it is not a bank.   Maker does not print DAI, users do by depositing collateral.   DAI is not money, it is a promise to pay by a borrower so they can get their collateral back.   DAI as a \u2018stablecoin\u2019 distinctly does not have the same mechanics as currency backed stablecoins like USDC, USDT, GUSD, and while software is responsible for allowing users to deposit collateral and mint DAI, it is the users with collateral that does this using the software. I don\u2019t think this second point will go over well so probably just keep it under your hat but it is something I think about every time I hear this KYC/AML stuff in conjunction with FATF. It is well known that something like 99% of all Money Laundering goes UNprosecuted(thank you psychonaut).  More money is spent on AML and KYC than is captured by prosecuting money launderers.   UNODC reports have stated this for decades now.   a16z lawyer pointed this out in legislative testimony.   The simple fact is that AML/KYC hasn\u2019t done dink to stop the vast majority of money laundering and won\u2019t.   What AML/KYC does is force private companies to collect data on individuals that then ends up being exposed via security exploits leading to other forms of losses for law abiding people.  Put short AML/KYC exposes private information of law abiding citizens to law breakers, while law breakers go about the business of laundering their money unhindered. Can you imagine if 99% of all people sentenced to prison for a crime escaped. How about condoms that were 1% efficient? And medical procedures that had a 1% of success while 99% chance of killing you? ",

                    "content": "Speaking purely personally. What is useful for people will also be useful for criminals. The nature of this technology makes it also very difficult to police effectively with coercive regulation, that intends to direct rather than follow. Which means the tradeoff regulators have to balance is stifling innovation in their jurisdictions with the mirage of exercising greater perceived control. As a thought experiment, imagine if all the users of a technology leave a jurisdiction because they can\u2019t be bothered with the regulation, particularly users who are susceptible to need to launder money as they are more likely to be geographically mobile. Has AML been prevented if all the wealth in a country, dirty or otherwise, leaves to other friendlier places? If a regulator writes a rule so onerous there is nobody left to follow it, does it make a sound? This sector has a chance to make a meaningful change in the world and it should push back as much regulation as it can until the jurisdictions start to compete with each other in a race to the bottom (as it seems to be happening recently). Regulation has its place but it also has a tendency to go only in one direction, as well as a facility to destroy all the innovation it touches. As a final thought, I am glad to hear all the other money laundering has been prevented. Now, the FATF can finally focus its attention on crypto after cleaning up all the money laundering in hawala networks or undeclared art hiding in freeports. ",
