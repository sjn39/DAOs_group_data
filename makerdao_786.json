Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip55c3-sp3-ethamsterdam-event-spf/13781 Ratification Poll URL: https://v2.vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qmb9brx3#poll-detail   Sentence Summary The purpose of this sub proposal is to allocate 50,000 DAI for the MakerDAO event in Amsterdam scheduled between April 20-24, 2022.  Motivation  Putting MakerDAO back in the European Scene Recently, MakerDAO hosted an event at the ETHDenver conference called DAIvinity. Due to its overwhelming success and response from the Maker Community we believe that it would be good to host another event during ETHAmsterdam.  Making it a Habit In parallel to this SPF a Core Unit proposal has been put forth on the forum for feedback (see MIP39c2-SP32). EVENTS-001 has been proposed based on discussion with the Maker community to provide a permanent budget and ongoing hosting of MakerDAO events.  Time Constraints Due to the time constraint imposed by MakerDAO\u2019s current governance cycle to be able to get the funding in time for ETHAmsterdam, this SPF has been created to partially fund the event. The remainder of funds will be coming directly from participating Core Units.  Special Purpose Fund Name ETHAmsterdam Event SPF  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials  Fund Scope This SPF will partially cover costs for the ETHAmsterdam MakerDAO event, which has been allocated a budget of 80,000 DAI. This is based on the \u201cminor\u201d event sub-budget in the Core Unit proposal with the addition of FTE compensation.  Due to time constraints, 50,000 DAI is being requested through this SPF with the balance coming directly from participating Core Units. The funding breakdown gives the scope of how the funds will be used. Funds from this SPF will be spent between March 1, 2022 and May 8, 2022. Any unused funds will be returned to the surplus buffer.  Work Credentials The team who organized the ETHDenver event (John Legg & Jon Perry) would return to their roles to plan and execute the ETHAmsterdam event.  Funding Breakdown The following is a summary of the event budget outlining how the funds will be used:      Dai     Travel (2 FTE & 2 Contractors) $5,200   Accommodations/Food (2 FTE & 2 Contractors) $6,200   Set Dress (Venue Branding, DJ Equitment Rental, Lighting Rental, Visual Renderfarm, Plugins/Software) $2,000   Labor (2 FTE & 2 Contractors) $42,400   Venue/Hospitality $17,000   Music & Photography $2,800   Misc (Shipping, COVID Tests, Onsite Tools/Equipment, Overhead, Contingency) $4,400       Event Total $80,000    Due to time constraints, 50,000 DAI is being requested through this SPF with the balance coming directly from participating Core Units.  Multisig Wallet The multisig for the funds will be 2:3 with @juan/@hexonaut/@Nadia and will be set up after the successful on-chain vote, prior to the executive vote.  Special Purpose Fund Details Official Contact or Group Name: Jon Perry Contact Email/Handle: [email\u00a0protected] Date Added: (2022-03-09) Total Amount: 50,000 DAI Wallet Address: Multisig address will be added after successful on-chain vote prior to the executive vote.

Comptrollers execute payouts to final recipients based on the completion of milestones stated in the SPF Scope. Please let me know if you are having difficulty sourcing these Comptrollers and I\u2019m happy to recommend some people to reach out to.

                    "content": "Here is a comparison of DAIvinity and ETH Amsterdam.  This is based on DAIvinity being replicated by the existing team.  I have modified the actuals of DAIvinity to a \u201creal\u201d labour cost based on the FTE compensation in the Events CU DAI budget.  I did this because as highlighted in a events CU proposal post, the team labour cost for DAIvinity did not reflect the true work involved.  You can refer to a more clear explanation here. .  The ETH Amsterdam event has corrected this issue by compensating FTEs and contractors based on the rates proposed in the Events CU DAI budget. Another area that has been pro-rated is set dress.  The team has the advantage to use resources available to them at their current employers which had the advantage of being offered free of charge to Maker.  This would not be the case moving forward with other events.  In the interests of a good 1 to 1 comparison, I have added cost to these two areas from the actual paid out by MakerDAO. The strategy of the ETH Amsterdam event is to scale it down and reuse visual animations and physical material from the DAIvinity event.  This gives us the advantage of saving on a set dress.  The DJ for the event will be a more local DJ rather than the international DJs which were brought in for ETH Denver One thing I will note in regards to the portion of your comment \u201ccost to replicate\u201d,  this comparison is both events done by the current team who is not running a for-profit events company.  We get compensation but do not charge markup and also have the advantage of accomplishing this branding/visuals without using external contractors.  In both of these areas, you would see an increase in the \u201ccost to replicate\u201d DAIvinity if an events company was used.

A follow up phone call, subscribing to an email list, or even paying something at the door? Will there be some way for VIPs (job candidates, prospective business partners, politically important individuals) to be given the appropriate level of direct engagement?  I guess my question is whether this serves an actual business purpose or is it just a way for some people to get drunk and party? And please do NOT say \u201cbrand awareness\u201d because it\u2019s a crypto conference. Everyone there has already heard of Maker and doesn\u2019t need us to buy them a drink.

Coca cola pays for advertising not because people don\u2019t know who they are, but because it gives people this hard to describe positive association with the brand. Throwing these events is precisely this type of association we are creating. If you are looking for direct results I think you are missing the big picture. Having zero spend on branding is insane, and no other business does this. Are we unique? Or perhaps let\u2019s go with what works. Regarding kickbacks, it is a huge amount of work to throw these events and there are a bunch of other places to go if this was some cynical operation. Appreciate the feedback, but I vehemently disagree with the implication. ",

I am personally fine with Maker community hosting some events but \u201cbrand awareness\u201d shouldn\u2019t be an excuse to throw parities at every event.

Seeing as we haven\u2019t used the Q1 travel funds, and this is the type of thing we expected to fund on occasion in our current budget request, we felt quite comfortable committing the funds. We do no currently have a marketing or events CU despite the demonstrated need to market both the protocol and the DAO itself. GovAlpha does not claim to know what the best marketing strategy is for the DAO. When Growth and Sam asked for CUs to support this effort  (after putting on a successful event in ETHDenver) we were happy to pitch into the event, noting that we will benefit from it, both from being able to attend and network, as well as from the PR it creates. The decision to fund this SPF is the DAO\u2019s, and we will not support or oppose the proposal. However given the need to make deposits so this event could happen if the DAO funds it, we were happy to commit our funds that had already been earmarked for like spending. If this SPF fails, I have no doubt the people who found this a good use of funds will make the best of the situation, though I would expect some losses from non-refundable deposits to occur. ",

Why is Maker, when holding parties (which should be considered as PR events) not seeking out partners to share expenses in exchange for a PR presence at our own events?  I mean heck everyone likes a good party, and many players want to have the \u2018best\u2019 party.  Wouldn\u2019t it make sense both from a growth, awareness, and expense point of view to not just have a Maker party but Maker/Nexo/Celcius/whatever/whomever else party to save on costs, and be a generally bigger PR event for the players? Why would Maker not talk to folks like Celcius, Nexo, and whomever to give them space at our events in exchange for helping us cover expenses and/or make a bigger party for less cost to Maker? This is my biggest beef with these Event expenditures and the same goes for Maker swag.   Wouldn\u2019t it make sense to put up space at our own events and swag space as advertising space to anyone who will buy it?    Make Maker Events not just for MakerDAO but for as many partners and advertisers as we can bring in (within reason, and within MakerDAO mandate). My point, and I have been saying this for a long time is that CUs really need to think out of the box and start deriving some revenues from outside sources in creative ways that both leverages MakerDAO brand with other growing parties so we help create a network and brand as well as save on CU expense budgets. I have this vision in my head of the biggest race cars with all these stickers of companies that are supporting the team with financing all over the car as advertising, why not think of Maker the same way?

At ETH Denver, there was an intention for an offsite meeting with CUs, Delegates and other stakeholders. I had planned to travel and participate in that and other associated events. I was also hiring three positions on my team so this was also recruiting event for me. In the past, I would rely on other groups within my organization to provide the air coverage to build buzz and hopefully attract some folks to ask about Maker, what we do, and open positions. Based upon ETH Denver, the party appeared to provide a lot of visibility for Maker. Given the same organizers were putting on this event, I was hopeful the same would be created at ETH Am. Without the support of a Marketing or People/Talent/HR group, it is damn tough to attract talent into this ecosystem. I am also a believer if that I \u201cuse\u201d something, I should pay for it. Being a \u201cuser\u201d of ETH Am, this seemed like a good investment especially since recruitment fees alone would make the 10k Dai a very good use of funds. On a side note, I\u2019ve done a fair amount of event planning and getting money upfront is needed to reserve the venue, etc. and the rest can be paid later hence the structure of this MIP. Yes, things have changed since I made that decision and I do not plan to attend ETH Am. I still support the event since I will get indirect benefits without being physically present. While I am happy to answer to the community on my decision, it\u2019s super important we focus and place our energy on the core issue\u2026we have very little Marketing and we need to fix that. ",

Would like to re-iterate a few points as they seem to be getting lost:  Costs are already sunk to the tune of 30k. It was either we did this or we had no event in Amsterdam which is turning out to be a large conference. If you object to the idea overall that\u2019s fine, but I would suggest making your opposition on the Events CU rather than this budget which would effectively waste 30k with nothing to show for it. The Events CU will be seeking partnerships to reduce costs. We have already had offers from a few other projects, but it was too short notice to include for Amsterdam. The Events CU is confident they will likely be able to half the costs per event via co-sponsorships moving forward. After the Denver event these guys were approached by many other crypto projects trying to snipe them away from us as it was nearly universal consensus this was the best event in Denver. There is a reason every major protocol is throwing events. Talking to @aburban90 in Boston this past weekend, he informed me people were still talking about the event in ETH Rio wondering when the next one was. As much as this can seem superficial, this is how this industry works, and it will lead to real opportunities in the future.  ",

But instead we are going to spend 3-4x on party because this kind of party creates more positive association with the brand than supporting the ecosystem directly? I am personally fine with Maker community hosting some events but \u201cbrand awareness\u201d shouldn\u2019t be an excuse to throw parities at every event. If there are better alternatives, the community should reconsider better options.    Here\u2019s my argument against these \u201clow\u201d numbers you cite @Doo_StableLab  Maker can \u201cinvest\u201d: $10k, $16k, $20k into hosting an event like any other protocol. Objectively\u2026 yes, their spend is half an order below ours (probably only eclipsed by AAVE)\u2026 Have you ever been to one of these events you cited? or any generic crypto event for the matter? Do you remember who hosted it? I never do. At best, it was always just another bar or cliche thing. Yes, everyone got together and mingled\u2026 but for the life of me, I can\u2019t recall attending a single one of those events where I remember who threw it. \u201cOh\u2026 it was a Solana party? a Flux party?.. \u201d Best case scenario\u2026 they didn\u2019t gatekeep or make attendees pay for drinks. The recent Avalanche event I attended in Harvard\u2026 the one takeaway I had\u2026 \u201cthese guys are so cheap\u2026 they\u2019ll only cover one drink for the attendees of their mixer.\u201d Pay cash for more. BAD IMAGE! A good case? No memory of whose event I attended. The money they spent there, cutting corners that shouldn\u2019t be cut, is legitimately wasted. $15k for an unmemorable event is $15k down the toilet. So ya, we can follow in their footsteps. On paper, we can spend less on these things. Yes, our events are much more expensive\u2026 no doubt about that, but\u2026 the difference between what our Events CU will do, and has already done\u2026 is that MAKER events are memorable. There is not a single person that attended DAIVinity in ETH Denver, that isn\u2019t t still going on about it TO THIS DAY. We\u2019re gotten media attention. Bankless coincidentally invites us for an interview after two years of no contact. We\u2019ve gained a reputation amongst the community for caring about the work we put into crafting a memorable experience. You can\u2019t put a number on what that\u2019s worth. ",

The people being paid to run this party are friends of the dev who asked for the 30 000 before approval.   Think it\u2019s important to provide a bit of push back here. Regardless of your feelings on this event (which should be debated freely here), it\u2019s important to recognize how Core Units currently function within the DAO. The MKR holders vote on a budget which is then executed by the teams, hopefully with transparency into transactions and budget returns when there is a surplus. The actual things the teams are doing are rarely \u201capproved\u201d explicitly by Governance, instead the Core Units provide a mandate and budget objectives to allow the community to decide if they are comfortable trusting the group with the funding. So while it is important that these events get discussed in public, we must note that what has happened so far is fairly optimal from a Governance standpoint:   A group of CU members brought up a funding need that wasn\u2019t being fulfilled by any CU directly, but fits the ethos of several mandates, and a recognized business objective.   CUs with funds earmarked either directly for this type of event or a \u201ccontingency\u201d of unexpected expenses volunteered some of their funding to ensure the opportunity was possible.   A proposal was made to the community to fill the remaining funding gap to achieve the event.   If Core Units have to ask governance anytime they use any of their own funding there is little use having Core Units, as we would just process all requests through Governance.  It\u2019s worth noting that how we operate is always in flux. If anyone observing this thinks they have a better process to improve how we can meet objectives as a DAO, they are encouraged to work on it and bring it forward. As GovAlpha we will uphold anything in our power that the community votes through. So far everything that has occurred with this funding is in line with what has been passed by Governance. If this SPF event is voted down then there will need to be some transparent reporting about where funds went if they are non-refundable and it will be a learning lesson for all involved. However, I want to push back against tones of anything unethical occurring here when CUs are following the restrictions that have been passed and the budgets they put forward. ",

For this specific event (Amsterdam), given that it\u2019s strongly supported by 100% trusted people (@hexonaut , @juan @Nadia ) I\u2019d personally just accept it and try to make the best of out of it. I feel the discussion, as it is devoloping right now, has just the potential to turn down the enthusiasm of @hexonaut and others, and we need that for a party. For the future, I agree that the process should be improved and this means:  Having a broader discussion on if/how we want to do \u2018brand creation\u2019 and how much USD/year we are willing to invest on it. \u2192 long forum talk + vote + etc.  At the same time, give organisers (like @hexonaut in this case) quick access to the cash because sometimes things need to move fast (or fast_er_ than the bureaucracy).  In the line of discussion (1) above, we should decide who we want to target: teenagers, young people 20-30yo, 30-50, millionaires? young users? coders? content creators? hippies ??? This type of parties seem to me as oriented towards 20-30yo. And I strongly doubt it is much effective (but I might be wrong, as I am not 20-30yo anymore). I\u2019d rather invest money on systematically making hackatons, University-campus level events, press interviews, youtube influencers, etc. I personally think (but again, I am not 20 anymore) these drink parties with alchool+music+fancy lights are quite ineffective but, more importantly, they do not build the type of image we (or, I should rather say, I\u2019d like to) want to build. To me a 50kusd party organised by a startups screams: YOLO! Lambo! Bitconneeeeeect!, etc ",

It could organise such a party from its budget if the price/value meets the branding objectives. It is likely to be important and valuable for us to have such an event, but I think it is difficult to measure, so it would need to be validated by professionals who have experience in this. Unfortunately we are not there yet, but the current confusion in marketing strategy will certainly be sorted out soon. If we had the MCU to do this, it would be enough to discuss its budget and keep track of its achievements through various marketing events.
