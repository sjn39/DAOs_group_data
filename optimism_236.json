Yes Project description nice2win is a decentralized web3 casino deployed on Optimism. In detail, nice2win attempts to improve upon the state-of-the-art in on-chain gambling by combining intuitive games like coin toss and dice roll together with well-thought-out user experience. Technically, consider us as a modern successor of dapp gambling casinos with our live public chat and our optional profiles. The smart contract our platform is built upon has been battle-tested, audited and literally processed hundreds of thousands of transactions Project links:  Website: https://nice2win.com  Twitter: https://twitter.com/nice2winDapp  Discord/Discourse/Community: https://discord.gg/GwuDax5RRW  Medium: https://medium.com/@nice2win  Dappradar: https://dappradar.com/optimism/high-risk/nice2win  Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuAq0jn6wkSPgJbmnheoXA   Relevant usage metrics : 40.29 ETH total as bankroll (https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb0450ff766c81222d29f7e61ff47b5d0e43d78f2). Dune Analytics: https://dune.com/nice2win/nice2win-web3-casino Competitors, peers, or similar projects Heavily inspired by now discontinued dice2.win: https://medium.com/@dice2win.helpdesk Is/will this project be open sourced? No Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: July 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: We like to think the ordinary person enjoys to gamble once in a while. This is why the OP ecosystem should have a platform where responsible users can gamble on fun simple games. Gambling is literally everywhere these days (arguably already on OP with sports wagers and others), but the casino version of gambling needs to be on Optimism and nice2win have set its course on Optimism. In fact, nice2win\u2019s native chain was OP before even knowing grants were actually an option. nice2win already offers 4 types of games: coin flip, roll a dice, two dice and etheroll. Using our own funds to bankroll winners and losers from all bets placed on our smart contract, we are providing a solid stable experience for all OP users inclined to gamble on our platform. We have more games coming up in the future and certainly more ideas to make the overall experience more fun and interactive, which could be incredibly sped up with a grant. The Optimism ecosystem could benefit from users moving funds from other chains that are more typically associated with GameFi in order to experience a quality gambling experience on nice2win. It\u2019s a new reason to onboard users that are lacking on Optimism. Moreover, existing users on OP can test their luck right now on our provably fair casino games, providing them with a fun way to blow off some steam. Number of OP tokens requested: 100 000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? Our smart contract already has 40 ETH serving as bankroll. We want to add another 10 ETH in the short term. On top of that, as per our roadmap (https://medium.com/@nice2win/september-2022-nice-roadmap-8a10aa60ef76), we are planning to open a bankroll staking contract later this year rewarding stakers a cut of the house edge fees.  Proposal for token distribution: Bankroll( 75% - 75 000 OP Tokens ): Having a considerable bankroll will enable bets of greater value to be processed from the smart contract. Industry standard for online casinos typically sets a 1% maximum profit per bet. Our current max profit is set at 2% to mitigate our relatively small current bankroll value of 40 ETH, done at our own risk. Beyond this technical measure, allowing bigger bets to take place on the platform broadens our reach to all types of gamblers, from smaller pockets to larger pockets. To increase security and trust, the tokens will be locked in a smart contract for an extended period of time, withdrawable only by bets settlement obligation ( winning players ). The 75 000 Tokens would be distributed at once on the approved smart contract. Besides, having set our short term goal to fund the bankroll up to 50 ETH strictly from our own funds, we feel that 75 000 OP tokens matches this bankroll investment at a reasonable ratio from a risk perspective. In short, this will give us a greater exposure to attract more wallets interested in a premiere web3 casino experience on Optimism. Users( 25% - 25 000 OP Tokens ): Users will be incentivized to use nice2win on Optimism and betting Ethereum. The first 1000 users achieving a set minimum ETH volume of wagers will be rewarded with OP. This will act as a marketing campaign as well as a way to get users to transfer ETH on Optimism and get familiar with the ecosystem and the platform. We are thinking this promotion will last about a month given our current userbase. After the promotion ends, we will have acquired new users, which we believe many will be recurring users on the OP network.

What would be a fair grant amount on your opinion?   Increasing the bankroll helps to enable larger bets as you said and generally speaking a gambling platform is as good as it\u2019s settling pool. Higher userbase for nice2win means greater adoption for Optimism if we manage to achieve the goals set on our roadmap. We want ETH (for now) from all chains to be deposited on OP.   We are a team of 3 developers. Our main dev is comfortable with being the public face of the project. We have no section yet on the platform pertaining to the team because we did only focus on product building so far.   The main dev mentioned previously is based in Taiwan and we plan on making that country our headquarter for all administrative purposes if needed. This platform is legal in Taiwan.   ",

All that is related to the \u201cgambling\u201d aspect of the platform is on our smart contract thus opensource and verifiable. However, the website (javascript, css, html\u2026) itself is not opensource meaning the code to run it is not public. After all, the website acts as a UI  to the smart contract. You don\u2019t need to use the webapp to play our games, you could interact with the smart contract itself! The main reason you would want to play on our casino is that it\u2019s provably fair which means that any bet outcome can be independently verified and that the operator or other players have no means of tampering with the result. We may be one of the only fair, transparent, non-custodian, and immutable gambling platform out there, thanks to web3 technology  As for the audits, we are already using smart contract code that has been audited in the past, I invite you to check our Medium page for more info (the link is in the original post) Thanks for the questions!!!

                    "content": "@Butterbum Hi again, Very nice reading you again. Let me try to reassure you about the legal issues. First of all, please refer to this article 2019 Taiwanese article Blockcast article 2019 which has the English title of: Gaming games occupy the Dapp market but are still in a \u201clegal gray area\u201d Here\u2019s a quote from the article:  Question 3: Is writing a Dapp game program likely to constitute the crime of \u201cproviding a gambling venue/gathering a crowd to gamble\u201d in Article 268 of the Criminal Law? Li Canyu: At present, Taiwan\u2019s judicial practice has not yet made a definite judgment on this issue  Secondly, the following article describes a judgement in Taiwan stating that gambling is legal if it\u2019s not in public space. Internet is considered personal therefore not making it illegal to gamble on Internet. Ltn News article 2020 Now, just to put some context on the matter, gambling is very popular in Asian countries more so than Western countries which is the reason for such specific articles(rulings) on the matter. Gambling is also more accepted in day-to-day life. About the first article, it is clearly stated that it is not illegal to write a Dapp casino as of today in Taiwan. The second article confirms that online gambling is legal at the moment. None of us are lawyers in the team so take everything with a grain of salt, but just know that Taiwan is friendly to web2 casinos overall and logically would translate to web3 casinos. It is also common knowledge for online casinos in Taiwan to host the casinos in foreign countries which we will do anyways. Replying to this now:  Are you planning to keep the OP as OP in your bankroll or exchange it for ETH?  We could do either really, depending on the preference of the council. It\u2019s already on our roadmap to support more currencies to gamble with, like OP . Would swapping for ETH even be possible from the council\u2019s point of view? Thanks for reading! ",

There might be some very interesting possibilities here.  The house edge already being 1%, the current plan is to grow the bankroll aggressively, taking no profits, until the bankroll is solid enough to fulfill more type of bets. For example, in the current ETH pool, 100 ETH sounds achievable within the next year if we manage to take off. We don\u2019t have any type of models yet but we are working on some Dune queries to give us some more insight on growth and analytics.  Using OP for a bankroll is kind of tough because the idea is that it\u2019s evergreen and grow  Not only that, but you can\u2019t pay gas with OP. For a simple user experience, ETH makes more sense as our primary crypto of choice to bet with because if you\u2019re going to play 100 games per day, you\u2019ll be charged on the same currency AND you\u2019ll be managing your gas spending implicitly. On top of that, OP is likely to be more volatile than ETH in the next years which adds more risk to \u201csimple\u201d users swapping for a set crypto amount to play within let\u2019s say a month, then recharge if needed.  The best thing to do would ofc be to facilitate OP use for the app itself but idk what sort of dev lift that would entail.  I\u2019m not sure I understand the statement fully, however, if you\u2019re talking about betting with OP strictly or any other crypto, it is definitely on the roadmap and is definitely achievable.
