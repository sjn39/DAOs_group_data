                    "content": "Project Name: Clipper Author Name: Austin Defillama TVL (at snapshot): $2.5M Transactions/day (at snapshot): 253 Tier: 3 Optimism native: No Number of OP tokens to claim: 300,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0x1Dd174bF2e090d0F1b1360Ac8905780429B2642B Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): Background on Clipper Clipper is a decentralized exchange for retail traders built by Shipyard Software and customized for Optimism. Since launching on Optimism at the beginning of February, Clipper has had more than $30 million in volume. Shipyard Software is an exchange group that develops specialized DEXes. Soon, Shipyard Software will be releasing a second DEX on Optimism for derivatives. Goals Clipper has the following goals in mind:  Bring more developers and builders into the Optimism ecosystem Increase TVL (for Clipper Coves which allows for permissionless trading between any two assets) Increase number of daily transactions Increase number of Optimism project collaborations through community initiatives (e.g., Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series)  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 1. Trader Mining 35% Given Clipper\u2019s architecture (capped liquidity pools), Clipper believes the optimal use of OP tokens would be to incentivize trading. Clipper would be able to attract new users to trade on the DEX and increase volumes, which in turn would give Optimism CLPs extremely competitive yields. To prevent sybiling/wash trading, Clipper plans on using a whitelisting process to validate user authenticity. Additional measures include:  3 Months Vesting (based on Gro Model) Discord Verification flow currently built on Clipper\u2019s Website  2. Limited Liquidity Mining 20% Clipper does not require significant amounts of liquidity to offer competitive prices to its target users. Instead, it caps contributions per person to ensure retail traders aren\u2019t diluted by whales. That being said, Clipper\u2019s current liquidity pool only supports short tail assets (ETH, WBTC, USDT, USDC, DAI). In a few weeks, Clipper will be launching Coves, which will allow the trading of any asset. OP tokens will be used to incentivize the creation of new pools with these assets. 3. Builder Acquisition 15% Clipper is composable and looks to incentivize builders to integrate and support Clipper\u2019s pioneering formula market maker architecture. 4. Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series 20% Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series is a community initiative launched whenever Clipper launches a new product or on a new chain. Users participate in various steps to confirm identity (to minimize bots/ fake accounts) and complete educational and collaborative steps to encourage usage of projects on the Optimism ecosystem. Participants that complete all stages of the adventures get rewarded with OP tokens. Clipper\u2019s current adventure has 22,000 participants. 5. Retroactive Airdrop/Gas Reimbursement 10% Airdrop OP tokens to users that have previously made transactions or deposited liquidity into Clipper\u2019s CLP on Optimism. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?   Additional Users Trader mining will naturally encourage users to bridge to Optimism and make more trades on both Optimism and Clipper.   High Yields Trader mining will increase volume, which will drive yields higher and attract more LPs. Reminder: liquidity pools and deposit amounts are capped, so new LP entrants won\u2019t dilute pool share.   Liquidity Migration Clipper will soon offer trading for long-tail tokens and provide comparable prices to mainnet without massive liquidity migration. Optimism will further become a more viable alternative to trade more easily.   Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Clipper has the best prices for small trades even without incentives, so once we bring traders to Clipper for the first time, they will stay to benefit from the great prices. Clipper already has some of the best yields in DeFi, but only on capped pools where deposits are limited per user. Users who come to deposit will stay because the organic yields are so high and they won\u2019t want to give up their spot. There is a track record of this - When Clipper did the last Community Liquidity program, 1,700 NEW users bridged to Optimism, deposited and kept their liquidity locked for over a month. This made Clipper the #3 protocol by addresses (18% of all first-time OP users in the period). As of May 6, the Clipper Optimism LP pool is yielding at a 20+% annualized rate over the past month, including all loss/impermanent loss and without any external incentives, spiffs, or mining. In comparison, yields on Compound on similar assets are under 2%.  733\u00d7290 48.2 KB  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Clipper will target distribution over 9 months. The exact rate at which tokens are distributed will be left to AdmiralDAO council with input from the Optimism community. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Clipper doesn\u2019t currently have a token and as a US company can\u2019t make forward-looking statements about what Clipper would do with any hypothetical tokens. Note This proposal is subject to approval by AdmiralDAO. Specific allocations within each category are yet to be finalized, and may be adjusted once OP price is determined. ",

                    "content": "    austin:  Clipper is a decentralized exchange for retail traders built by Shipyard Software and customized for Optimism. Since launching on Optimism at the beginning of February, Clipper has had more than $30 million in volume . Shipyard Software is an exchange group that develops specialized DEXes. Soon, Shipyard Software will be releasing a second DEX on Optimism for derivatives. Goals Clipper has the following goals in mind:  Bring more developers and builders into the Optimism ecosystem Increase TVL (for Clipper Coves which allows for permissionless trading between any two assets) Increase number of daily transactions Increase number of Optimism project collaborations through community initiatives (e.g., Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series )  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 1. Trader Mining 35% Given Clipper\u2019s architecture (capped liquidity pools), Clipper believes the optimal use of OP tokens would be to incentivize trading. Clipper would be able to attract new users to trade on the DEX and increase volumes, which in turn would give Optimism CLPs extremely competitive yields. To prevent sybiling/wash trading, Clipper plans on using a whitelisting process to validate user authenticity. Additional measures include:  3 Months Vesting (based on Gro Model) Discord Verification flow currently built on Clipper\u2019s Website  2. Limited Liquidity Mining 20% Clipper does not require significant amounts of liquidity to offer competitive prices to its target users. Instead, it caps contributions per person to ensure retail traders aren\u2019t diluted by whales. That being said, Clipper\u2019s current liquidity pool only supports short tail assets (ETH, WBTC, USDT, USDC, DAI). In a few weeks, Clipper will be launching Coves, which will allow the trading of any asset. OP tokens will be used to incentivize the creation of new pools with these assets. 3. Builder Acquisition 15% Clipper is composable and looks to incentivize builders to integrate and support Clipper\u2019s pioneering formula market maker architecture. 4. Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series 20% Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series is a community initiative launched whenever Clipper launches a new product or on a new chain. Users participate in various steps to confirm identity (to minimize bots/ fake accounts) and complete educational and collaborative steps to encourage usage of projects on the Optimism ecosystem. Participants that complete all stages of the adventures get rewarded with OP tokens. Clipper\u2019s current adventure has 22,000 participants. 5. Retroactive Airdrop/Gas Reimbursement 10% Airdrop OP tokens to users that have previously made transactions or deposited liquidity into Clipper\u2019s CLP on Optimism. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  Additional Users Trader mining will naturally encourage users to bridge to Optimism and make more trades on both Optimism and Clipper. High Yields Trader mining will increase volume, which will drive yields higher and attract more LPs. Reminder: liquidity pools and deposit amounts are capped, so new LP entrants won\u2019t dilute pool share. Liquidity Migration Clipper will soon offer trading for long-tail tokens and provide comparable prices to mainnet without massive liquidity migration. Optimism will further become a more viable alternative to trade more easily.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Clipper has the best prices for small trades even without incentives, so once we bring traders to Clipper for the first time, they will stay to benefit from the great prices. Clipper already has some of the best yields in DeFi, but only on capped pools where deposits are limited per user. Users who come to deposit will stay because the organic yields are so high and they won\u2019t want to give up their spot. There is a track record of this - When Clipper did the last Community Liquidity program, 1,700 NEW users bridged to Optimism, deposited and kept their liquidity locked for over a month. This made Clipper the #3 protocol by addresses (18% of all first-time OP users in the period). As of May 6, the Clipper Optimism LP pool is yielding at a 20+% annualized rate over the past month, including all loss/impermanent loss and without any external incentives, spiffs, or mining. In comparison, yields on Compound on similar assets are under 2%.   agree to clipper.its a smooth exchange and have an excellent community ",

Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series 20% Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series is a community initiative launched whenever Clipper launches a new product or on a new chain. Users participate in various steps to confirm identity (to minimize bots/ fake accounts) and complete educational and collaborative steps to encourage usage of projects on the Optimism ecosystem. Participants that complete all stages of the adventures get rewarded with OP tokens. Clipper\u2019s current adventure has 22,000 participants. 5. Retroactive Airdrop/Gas Reimbursement 10% Airdrop OP tokens to users that have previously made transactions or deposited liquidity into Clipper\u2019s CLP on Optimism. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?   Additional Users Trader mining will naturally encourage users to bridge to Optimism and make more trades on both Optimism and Clipper.   High Yields Trader mining will increase volume, which will drive yields higher and attract more LPs. Reminder: liquidity pools and deposit amounts are capped, so new LP entrants won\u2019t dilute pool share.   Liquidity Migration Clipper will soon offer trading for long-tail tokens and provide comparable prices to mainnet without massive liquidity migration. Optimism will further become a more viable alternative to trade more easily.   Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Clipper has the best prices for small trades even without incentives, so once we bring traders to Clipper for the first time, they will stay to benefit from the great prices. Clipper already has some of the best yields in DeFi, but only on capped pools where deposits are limited per user. Users who come to deposit will stay because the organic yields are so high and they won\u2019t want to give up their spot. There is a track record of this - When Clipper did the last Community Liquidity program, 1,700 NEW users bridged to Optimism, deposited and kept their liquidity locked for over a month. This made Clipper the #3 protocol by addresses (18% of all first-time OP users in the period). As of May 6, the Clipper Optimism LP pool is yielding at a 20+% annualized rate over the past month, including all loss/impermanent loss and without any external incentives, spiffs, or mining. In comparison, yields on Compound on similar assets are under 2%.  733\u00d7290 48.2 KB  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Clipper will target distribution over 9 months. The exact rate at which tokens are distributed will be left to AdmiralDAO council with input from the Optimism community. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Clipper doesn\u2019t currently have a token and as a US company can\u2019t make forward-looking statements about what Clipper would do with any hypothetical tokens. Note This proposal is subject to approval by AdmiralDAO. Specific allocations within each category are yet to be finalized, and may be adjusted once OP price is determined.

Since launching on Optimism at the beginning of February, Clipper has had more than $30 million in volume. Shipyard Software is an exchange group that develops specialized DEXes. Soon, Shipyard Software will be releasing a second DEX on Optimism for derivatives. Goals Clipper has the following goals in mind:  Bring more developers and builders into the Optimism ecosystem Increase TVL (for Clipper Coves which allows for permissionless trading between any two assets) Increase number of daily transactions Increase number of Optimism project collaborations through community initiatives (e.g., Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series)  How will the OP tokens be distributed? 1. Trader Mining 35% Given Clipper\u2019s architecture (capped liquidity pools), Clipper believes the optimal use of OP tokens would be to incentivize trading. Clipper would be able to attract new users to trade on the DEX and increase volumes, which in turn would give Optimism CLPs extremely competitive yields. To prevent sybiling/wash trading, Clipper plans on using a whitelisting process to validate user authenticity. Additional measures include:  3 Months Vesting (based on Gro Model) Discord Verification flow currently built on Clipper\u2019s Website  2. Limited Liquidity Mining 20% Clipper does not require significant amounts of liquidity to offer competitive prices to its target users. Instead, it caps contributions per person to ensure retail traders aren\u2019t diluted by whales. That being said, Clipper\u2019s current liquidity pool only supports short tail assets (ETH, WBTC, USDT, USDC, DAI). In a few weeks, Clipper will be launching Coves, which will allow the trading of any asset. OP tokens will be used to incentivize the creation of new pools with these assets. 3. Builder Acquisition 15% Clipper is composable and looks to incentivize builders to integrate and support Clipper\u2019s pioneering formula market maker architecture. 4. Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series 20% Clipper\u2019s Adventure Series is a community initiative launched whenever Clipper launches a new product or on a new chain. Users participate in various steps to confirm identity (to minimize bots/ fake accounts) and complete educational and collaborative steps to encourage usage of projects on the Optimism ecosystem. Participants that complete all stages of the adventures get rewarded with OP tokens. Clipper\u2019s current adventure has 22,000 participants. 5.

                    "content": "Thanks @Justin! Great question. Clipper produces great prices for retail trades because its liquidity pools are capped. Contrary to common wisdom, too much TVL actually hurts retail traders who end up subsidizing excess liquidity that only really matters for Whale traders. Of course, because the design requires a cap, it has a limit and closes. However, to maximize participation the amount any one wallet (with captcha) can contribute is also capped at a few thousand dollars worth. Thus, clipper has thousands of LPs. As new products and pairs are launched new pools will open. But even the existing one on Optimism serves thousands of real retail users. Regarding the other comments, with due respect our community is not Spam. We invited our community to Optimism and to the governance forum to support Optimism and expand the Optimism community. We can\u2019t control what specifically people post. But would you rather they not be invited? This is the heart of project community collaboration. They are all real people now with Optimism governance forum accounts. That sounds like a great service to the Optimism community and a great collaboration as well! The best way to encourage meaningful discussion is to make meaningful comments, not to prevent upvotes. So i especially appreciate you for asking a very good question and prompting this reply! ",

The liquidity constraints make sense - and your past LPs are probably nearly identical to any hypothetical incentives for future LPs.

We invited our community to Optimism and to the governance forum to support Optimism and expand the Optimism community. We can\u2019t control what specifically people post. But would you rather they not be invited? This is the heart of project community collaboration. They are all real people now with Optimism governance forum accounts. That sounds like a great service to the Optimism community and a great collaboration as well!   Almost every one of the commenters in this thread that has included their discord handle has only made a single comment on this forum, has not referred to any previous comment as you would expect in a discussion thread, and many don\u2019t even seem to have read your proposal but are just commenting on their opinion of your platform in general. I don\u2019t think you should be congratulating yourself on bringing a \u2018great service to the Optimism Community\u2019 when what you\u2019ve really done is called brigading. I\u2019m sure your dApp is great, but these threads are supposed to be used to discuss proposals and you don\u2019t seem to have made that clear when calling your community to come and shill here.

The incentives are proposed above, and all require actual use of Optimism. We of course asked our discord community to engage with the proposal, which was in good faith. It\u2019s a tough balance, because we all want to attract users to Optimism but those very efforts may also result in extra comments. Personally, I don\u2019t see how extra comments are so bad - it doesn\u2019t stop substantive discussion, so it seems like an acceptable tradeoff for also attractive constructive usage. To the amazing Clipper Pirate community, I think a good point had been made about \u2018brigading\u2019. Let\u2019s please all engage constructively with the substance of the proposal! To @OPuser and @minimalgravitas, I would also ask you to add a substantive and constructive comment on the proposal itself! That\u2019s the best way to prompt good discussion and we will try to engage with 100% of substantive comments. ",

My concern is not comments but the content, talking vs making noise, contribution vs distraction. My address is public so you can see that I have used the project and I loved it was planning to provide my inputs and YES it does hinders substantive discussion. I want to come here and see feedback, criticism is even better not hundreds of discord server name.  I am also in your discord, I saw this brigading and was waiting for team to take some action, either here or on discord but nothing happened. We communicate too when we are not talking, just because you did not encourage does not mean you did something to stop it. Finally I muted this conversation until I saw @MinimalGravitas post. As I respect his opinion, I decided to jump in. All being said, I wish you and clipper very best. ",

You don\u2019t need to sybil attack to make your project look good. The tech should speak for it\u2019s self! I apologize if I am wrong\u2026 Best of luck with the proposal.  Edited-- Before I posted my comment, I did a little bit of research to make sure if my comments were just\u2026 This is what I found which doesn\u2019t make sense. While some of these accounts exist and are active in your discord server, many of them don\u2019t or haven\u2019t ever commented on any topic in your Discord\u2026Yes this can be coincidence and I\u2019m sorry if I am wrong but fortunately its just my opinion Personally I am struggling to trust Clipper.

I do apologies if my earlier comments were out of line.  ",
