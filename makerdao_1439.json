                    "content": " Deco Q2, 2022 Forum Update 22.07.15 Deco has had a successful Q2 and met its benchmarks. First, the core Deco product has been completed, including addressing and fixing all issues raised in the audit, and acceptance of the final review. See, here. Our team has completed advanced fuzz/invariant testing for both the dss-gate and claim-fee-maker contracts using Echidna. Echidna is a property-based fuzzer, which discovers vulnerabilities by generating a massive number of random scenarios and inputs to assert the properties (invariants). A test run with 1 million execution and a sequence depth of 20 per execution has been successfully completed on AWS compute infrastructure and has not found any new issues. A detailed report may be found here. We would like to thank the PE team for its help and guidance in this area. We have also completed initial UI design and are proceeding with development for the core UI to enable Deco functionality. This is independent of contemplated UI partnerships (e.g. Oasis).  deco-ui-11440\u00d71024 114 KB  We have started developing a post-launch feature extension roadmap which will allow us to rapidly meet the needs of both large and small vault customers without having to change the core Deco contracts, including the following: Self-issuance. This feature will allow vault owners to create their term vaults in real time. An owner will be able to select and issue the claim-fee balance type desired. Governance steps away from direct claim-fee issuance and sets high-level parameters like offered term lengths, their fixed rates, and maximum issuance size. Liquidation Penalty. This feature will provide an additional source of revenue from vault owners who want to exit their fixed rate vault before the term is over. This feature will make term vaults more attractive. Collateral Type Switch. This will allow vault owners to switch the collateral type on the claim-fee balance by collecting an additional fee. Ex: ETH-A to ETH-B. Term Roll Over. This will target fixed-rate vault owners with roll-over deals to encourage extension of a current term. We would like to solicit feedback from the community on these contemplated feature extensions as well as new extension ideas that can help term vault owners improve their user experience. On the full stack operations side, Deco has engaged with legal counsel to evaluate the various issues relevant to a Deco launch and will provide a legal analysis in advance of going live. Engagement touches upon Patent, Copyright, Securities, and other pertinent legal issues. On the Sales side, the Deco Core unit is in the process of developing a business development strategy in concert with the Growth Core unit, and to be completed in Q3, including customizing product features and Deco terms to meet partner requirements. Deco and Growth hope to achieve a launch with an institutional customer no later than the end of Q4. This timetable will set the stage for including several institutional term vaults of various size. Deco and the nature of term vaults can be used to help lock in, normalize, and smooth out revenue cycles, which have recently been the focus of concern.  Q3 Tentative Plan We will make additional progress on the Patent, Copyright, Securities, and other pertinent legal issues. By the end of Q3 we are targeting a test deployment and issuance from dss-gate and claim-fee-maker. We will make additional progress on UI development. We have started formal verification of dss-gate and claim-fee-maker codebases and will make additional progress. We will also be engaging with partners like Oasis to offer vault owners a comprehensive user experience. We are available to chat in #deco-fixed-rates-public or can be reached at [email\u00a0protected] ",

This feature will provide an additional source of revenue from vault owners who want to exit their fixed rate vault before the term is over. This feature will make term vaults more attractive.   Yup this makes sense, my experience with Term Deposits has been a 30 days simple interest penalty for early termination. This flexibility provided me with comfort to use the term product but the penalty was also large enough to desuade me from pulling funds from the TD without first considering more liquid accounts. A few last questions to consider.  Is there a grace period (i.e. 7 days) in which clients can add funds after opening the term vault? Or once its opened is it locked? How often is interest accrued and paid out? Is the interest paid out reinvested or does it post to a separate wallet?  ",

In case something has to be changed   The legal analysis has already been initiated and informs the development process. The objective is to have the product validated prior to launch having had any potential issues addressed well in advance of launch.  At a certain point, the design of the product will be frozen, and thus permit the final report to be rendered. Perhaps our note on this point was not sufficiently clear.  We do not anticipate any issues and will provide the community a report well in advance of the proposed launch.     TRUEMAKER:  I would suggest defaulting this option to auto roll-over with the same term but also providing clients easy access to change the setting to terminate at maturity. Subtle nudges like defaulting to auto roll-over may lead to funds lasting longer in the platform.   Thank you for your suggestion. With regards to roll over and user retention, we can nudge vault owners to extend their term by providing a modest discount to the then current market rate, for example when they reach the 75% mark of their term.  Of course, owners would have to act affirmatively in selecting such an option because they are in full control of and manage their own vaults. We are also in development of an off-chain analytics component which will track a vault owners\u2019 history of preferences so as to affirmatively engage with them. We are also exploring the targeting of empty vaults which have migrated to other protocols with the intent of enticing them back to our platform with special offerings.     TRUEMAKER:  Is there a grace period (i.e. 7 days) in which clients can add funds after opening the term vault? Or once its opened is it locked?   Encoding a grace period feature into the product roadmap is a good idea. We can explore the tradeoffs as we consider the various features. A grace period would be helpful to term vault owners who change their mind and decide to add additional funds, or switch between variable rates and fixed rates without extra fees. Flexibility generally improves user experience. We can probably set up a \u201cgoldilocks\u201d period that is long enough to be useful to vault owners but short enough that it prevents gaming of the system.     TRUEMAKER:  How often is interest accrued and paid out? Is the interest paid out reinvested or does it post to a separate wallet?   Before addressing the substance of your question, it is important to clarify the terminology. To be clear, there is no \u201cinterest\u201d or any other yield bearing component. Deco simply performs an internal Maker accounting function on vaults, while remaining external to the core vault architecture. The architected user experience is what makes Deco so powerful and safe. The Maker protocol charges a stability fee on a vault\u2019s debt on a per-second rate, and the compounding interval is also at a second. We mimic this same formula to calculate the offset which a CLAIM-FEE balance provides. This means that the offset for every second automatically evens out against the variable rate, and in effect provides a zero rate. The CLAIM-FEE offset is part of the same wallet that contains the vault, and in effect this is the Deco Term Vault product.     pipko:  In order to understand the business impact of Deco on Maker, do you have a sense of expected revenue and contributed profits (after gas, attached costs, etc.) that Deco will generate for Maker in CY22 and CY23?   As you can see from the Response immediately above, Deco provides Maker with a new economic opportunity and an effective tool, but Deco does not control or manage the economics, which remain under the direction and control of Maker. The protocol is designed to deliver a product that will be flexible enough to include institutional vault partners across a variety of requirements and sizes. The revenue stream to Maker is dependent upon its specific economic policies and the success of the business development efforts of the Growth Core Unit in identifying opportunities and closing them with the support and assistance of Deco. Moving on from this point, If we assume a modest $1.5bn of assets generating an average SF of 2.5% average, with a 1% Deco premium annually (3.5% Total Rate), that will yield $52.5mm annually.  Under this scenario, this would produce $15.0mm of profit for Maker, in addition to the floating rate (Deco Vault Premium). Additionally, there is the halo effect which Deco will provide for rates more broadly. If we can lock in a significant portion of Dai supply into term vaults, we may be more aggressive with floating rates, which in turn boost the fixed rates as a haven, and optimize revenues from the floating rate.     pipko:  Can you provide a breakdown of the total development, audit, headcount, etc. costs that Maker has invested into Deco as of launch? It would be helpful as we think about the costs of a MetaDAO-like structure.   SFCU produces regular DAO expense reports and always has the most current data based on the on-chain payments. For convenience, the monthly operating information is also hosted on github as part of the MIP Auditor structure. Our fixed monthly budget which has no contingencies, or increases for any reason, is 155K Dai per month which was outlined in the original MIP. ",
