I think it\u2019s essential for true decentralization and participation. Historically, IMHO, over-complexity and poor naming conventions have plagued Maker. It has been corrected over time. Reading this feels like going back to the days of tub, tap and CDPs. Also, why these numbers? What\u2019s the reasoning for the seemingly arbitrary determined amounts? ",
