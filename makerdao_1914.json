                    "content": " [Post Mortem] MIPs Portal XSS Vulnerability On October 27th, a whitehat found and reported an XSS vulnerability on the MIPs Portal, which allowed malicious users to modify the look and behavior of the website and share their modified version under the official domain name e.g. https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/list?search=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3D%22alert(%27xss%20vulnerability%20here%27)%22%3E or a masked version of it [Malicious Mips Portal](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/list?search=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3D%22alert(%27xss%20vulnerability%20here%27)%22%3E) would display an alert when the page loaded (URLs used for reference only, even though they are safe now, feel free not to open them ). For those who are not familiar with the term, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow users to inject scripts into the client side of the website, making it possible to bypass access control, redirect to other websites or malicious clones of the same website, create MetaMask transactions or contract interactions, etc. Shortly after the report, GovAlpha set out to fixing the vulnerability by sanitizing all of the website inputs. This involved adding logic to the code of such inputs to analyze and remove anything a user enters that could be parsed as HTML or JavaScript when introducing data or performing searches. During the last couple of days we, as well as the whitehat, have been testing the fix on both staging and production environments and the vulnerability seems to have been successfully removed. This report was dealt with by GovAlpha directly as the MIPs Portal is currently not in scope for Immunefi\u2019s Bug Bounty Program. Following liaison with Immunefi, we decided to pay the whitehat 2,500 DAI which would have been the qualifying amount for such a report under the Bug Bounty Program. This has been paid out of GovAlpha\u2019s contingency budget. We will be taking steps to get the MIPs Portal included in the Immunefi Bug Bounty Program. These are screenshots with some of the ways the vulnerability could be exploited:  2976\u00d71570 151 KB   3062\u00d71820 534 KB  As a friendly reminder, always try to open links from official sources, and when that\u2019s not possible, pay extra attention to links others share with you.

While we can\u2019t guarantee similar payouts for all reported issues, we hope rewarding someone who took the time to document an exploit and hand it over (rather than take advantage of it) shows our commitment to keeping the Maker community safe. If you see something amiss in the Maker ecosystem please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch! The advantage of open-source development and transparent processes demonstrated above is that we all get to learn from mistakes, while benefiting from the collective knowledge of our community. ",
