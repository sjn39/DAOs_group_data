With the increasing popularity of NFTs and use of ERC-721 tokens as well as the adoption of the Ethereum Blockchain for a variety of use cases, we are presented with a unique opportunity to learn an incredible amount of the token movements and use cases through its metadata. This is not the only benefit we have, we can start thinking about composability as well since development can be sped up and optimized if Smart Contracts and Tokens use previously defined compatible standards. With this idea in mind we can set up the building blocks for a myriad of complex scenarios moving forward. However, metadata is optional and as such, millions of tokens could be addressing similar use cases (with similar metadata) but not become immediately apparent. In order to easily and cost-efficiently draw meaningful conclusions from this metadata, I would argue that it is in the best interest of the community to standardize how certain pieces of metadata are structured in the tokens. For example: I want to include location metadata to a token in the following format:  Screen Shot 2021-04-12 at 2.47.13 PM1152\u00d71722 198 KB  Note: this is what the ERC-721 token Metadata JSON would look like after adding the location metadata in the particular proposed format. The idea is to turn this into an EIP and set a precedent for future Metadata Standards, this way anyone adding metadata to their ERC-721 tokens has access to robust guidelines which they can follow in order to make their use cases tidier and benefit the community as a whole. As part of the Blockchain division at EY (Ernst & Young), we\u2019re working on products and services promoting transparency across business partners, traceability for tokenized assets, and trust in technology by showing token information in a way that is responsive to the metadata associated with that token. We\u2019re looking for input from the community to determine what information is most important to help make this EIP happen so we can collaborate and build together solutions that would positively impact developers and help towards the widespread adoption of Ethereum and Blockchain as a technology.

But as NFT represents a wide range of things from gaming to art (or attendance proof) and as this is a fast growing and changing market, the task seems really complicated ! So I ended up finding the ERC721 metadata minimal requirements a good approach at this time allowing you to add your metadata scheme on top (and the ERC1155 going too far even in i18n). As @dievardump said, we found the schema dot org a good place for mature data scheme (even if the naming is weird sometimes ) and the DID approach really good for combining schemes (still in DRAFT) https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#production-0 \u201c@context\u201d: [ \u201chttps ://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\u201d, \u201chttps ://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1\u201d,] So if we want to do an EIP about extending metadata, I think we should keep it simple and just standardize the schema definitions used, so computers can get the schema definition, parse and validate it correctly something like the DID\u2019s @context: [].

Some of the schema.org ones I have been looking at are:  VisualArtwork - Schema.org Type CreativeWork - Schema.org Type ArtGallery - Schema.org Type  This is mainly as I have been looking at NFTs for art and creativity use cases but I am sure there are others which can be repurposed. I generally favour using these more well established ones from Schema.org if possible and not to re-invent something just for NFTs. Maybe any new EIPs can simple reference schema.org version as a baseline? I am also not sure how wide any schema.org schemas are used but they do a great job of listing out lots of options. ",

It make sense for projects like foam but I\u2019m sure they are using other solution (I haven\u2019t looked into technical details).     RicardoChacon:  I want to include location metadata to a token in the following format:   I do agree that we need to collaborate on better standard and not use ERC721 anymore as it has more flaws than strength honestly. We should look into better definition of metadata and how to display and access token metadata. The EIP-1047 was supposed to define metadata but it fell off to the darkness. I hosted NFT Metadata twitter spaces a few weeks ago where we discussed this problem into more details, notes. The main takeaway from this session: NFT platforms should collaborate together on unification of metadata, metadata formats so users will see their NFTs across different platforms. ",
