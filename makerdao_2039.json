                    "content": "Hi everyone  We are implementing a maximum value for the limit parameter. Until now users could set limit to any value. In the future, users will choose a value between 1 and 100. These changes will come into effect on 16th January. In case this affects you, we recommend using skip to be able to batch multiple requests. If you have any concerns, please reach out to us. Applying the hard limit will alleviate peak server loads, and thereby give a better experience to all api users.   Default sorting & deprecation of experimental endpoints Additionally, we are adding default sorting to all response objects (until now the response was unsorted unless the user specified it). In most cases it\u2019s based on timestamp, for non-timeseries it will be the unique key or the closest approximation to it, e.g. in v1/vaults/current_state it is vault (vault ID). Last but not least, we are deprecating experimental endpoints. Most will be migrated to new namespaces while a few will cease to exist. You can see the deprecation notice in the API documentation. - experimental/vaults_at_risk --> *deprecated* - experimental/vaults_at_risk_alt --> *deprecated*  - experimental/blocks (GET) --> *deprecated* - experimental/blocks (POST) --> utils/blocks (POST)  - experimental/flaps --> auctions/flaps - experimental/vault_history_daily --> vaults/vault_history_daily - experimental/vault_ownership --> vaults/vault_ownership - experimental/parameter_event --> protocol_parameters/parameter_event - experimental/vault_history --> vaults/vault_history - experimental/current_state --> vaults/current_state - experimental/spells_summary --> governance/spells_summary  ",
