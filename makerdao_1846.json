                    "content": " Overview MakerDAO has DAI 1.3m of Vaults\u2019 bad debt (Vaults with higher debt than collateral) on its Balance Sheet which stems from disabled liquidations in the USDC-A and USDP-A vaults. These borrowers are undercollateralized but were never liquidated even though the collateral value is below the liquidation threshold. While the debt is negligable w.r.t the total DAI supply, it is significantly higher than the one of Aave and Compound, and unlike them does not stem from dust accounts, and thus relatively easy to wipe out.  964\u00d7338 77.6 KB  Source: Comparison of bad debt across MakerDAO, Aave & Compound via RiskDAO Bad Debt dashboard  Proposal We think that MakerDAO should set best practices in DeFi for reliability, integrity and transparency. The DAI 1.3m in bad debt is a legacy issue and should be cleared, especially as the DAO moves towards the Endgame. We looked into various options to cancel this bad debt and encourage the DAO\u2019s contributors, tokenholders, delegates and community members to provide feedback and participate in the Signal Request (scroll down for the poll options). Canceling the protocol\u2019s bad debt will have the following benefits:  Distinguishes MakerDAO as the leading lending protocol with best-in-class risk management and liquidation discipline Cleans up legacy issues before MakerDAO transition towards the Endgame Positions MakerDAO as the best-managed Tier 1 lending protocol vs Aave and Compound Comes at a relatively small cost: DAI 1.3m in bad debt corresponds to 1.68% of the Surplus Buffer and merely 0.02% of all outstanding DAI.  In terms of technical implementation, we consider the following three options the most viable:  Liquidate the insolvent accounts Burn unbacked DAI Repay the underwater accounts  Pro:  Clean up the balance sheet. Send the right signals to the DeFi ecosystem that risk management takes center stage at MakerDAO.  Con:  We do not see any arguments against this proposal. The implementation does not require technical changes to the protocol or significant development work. Nor does it require any marketing effort and the sum is immaterial in comparison to the overall DAI balance.   The Backstory USDC-A & USDP-A vaults hold DAI 1.3m of unbacked DAI, where the collateral value is less than the outstanding debt. This bad debt stems from the fact that liquidations for these vaults were disabled. A full list of insolvent accounts for MakerDAO can be found here. Ultimately, stability fee was set to 0 which stopped any additional bad debt to accrue.  Financial implications & technical feasibility To cancel the bad debt, MakerDAO has to do a Balance Sheet adjustment and reduce the number of outstanding DAI. This adjustment should happen in the DAO\u2019s Surplus Buffer which amounts to DAI 77.4m (as of 13 Oct \u201922). DAI 1.3m accounts for 1.68% of the entire Surplus and is thus a non-critical adjustment. We consider the below options the easiest to execute:   Liquidate the insolvent accounts: Liquidate the remaining collateral in the accounts, and let the surplus buffer automatically absorb the remaining bad debt.  Burn DAI from the surplus buffer.  Repay the debt of underwater accounts using the surplus buffer.   Polls    Poll #1: Shall MakerDAO clear the vaults\u2019 bad debt?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Poll #2: What is the preferred option to clear these bad debts?  Liquidate insolvent accounts Burn DAI from surplus buffer Repay the debt None of the Above/Other (see comments) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This signal will run from 2022-10-14T17:00:00Z\u21922022-10-30T23:59:59Z. If Poll #1 receives > 50% of non-abstain votes in favor, progression to an on-chain poll will depend on the outcome of Poll #2. If Poll #1 ends in favour and one option in Poll #2 receives >50% of non-abstain votes it will proceed to a binary on-chain vote with \u201cNo\u201d as the alternative option. If Poll #1 ends in favour and two or more options in Poll #2 receive >50% of non-abstain votes, these options will move on-chain to an approval vote. \u201cNo\u201d will also be an option in the approval vote. Due to this poll leading to a state change in the Maker Protocol, the approval winner will require support of a majority of non-abstain on-chain votes. The on-chain vote would commence on Monday, 31 October 2022. ",

This signal request gauges community sentiment towards clearing 1.3M Dai worth of bad debt from USDC-A and USDP-A vaults that are undercollateralized. Three solutions to clear the bad debt are proposed:  Liquidate the vaults and let the surplus buffer automatically absorb the remaining bad debt. Burn Dai from the Surplus Buffer. Repay the debt of underwater accounts using the surplus buffer.   This Signal Request will run until Sunday, October 30. If the over 50% of non-abstaining votes in Poll #1 are in favour of clearing bad debt, there are three possibilites for an on-chain poll on Monday, October 31:   No on-chain vote: If no option in Poll #2 has over 50% of non-abstaining votes, there will be no on-chain vote.  Binary vote: If only one option in Poll #2 has over 50% of non-abstaining votes, then there will be a binary on-chain vote between that choice and not clearing bad debt.  Approval vote: If multiple options in Poll #2 have over 50% of non-abstaining votes, then there will be an approval vote on-chain with those options and the option of not clearing bad debt. This will only pass to an executive if one of the debt-clearing options receives over 50% of non-abstaining votes on chain.

In the follow-up poll, the only option to receive support from > 50% of non-abstain voters was \u201cLiquidate insolvent accounts\u201d with 9/15 supporting it (60%). The next highest option received 7/15 votes (47%). Therefore, an on-chain poll will be posted today asking if we should turn on liquidations for the stablecoin vaults, which will have the effect of liquidating the insolvent accounts and accounts that become insolvent in future. If this poll is approved, GovAlpha will ask the Risk Core Unit to recommend liquidation parameters for the remaining stablecoin vaults. ",
