One man once told me, \u201cIt is incredibly hard to replace the foundation of a building that has already been built.\u201d . I think this applies wonderfully right now to Uniswap. The pioneers(us) will bear the brunt of the most crucial decisions; therefore, we should also bear the fruit of our actions. That is why I think it would be only appropriate to burn the tokens arising from the additional inflation in order to reward the current governors of Uniswap for their participation. The inflation was added in order to onboard more people into the project after 4 years, but I think this can be done wonderfully even without the inflation. Think about it: the foundation we built, we cherish. The new users could see the rewards the original Uniswap governors received and be incentivized to foster further proposals which would benefit the ecosystem. What I do not think is appropriate is to say that the current UNI governors who put in incredible work now should be punished for their contribution. ",

Given the fact that the burn would happen daily gives off the impression that it is indeed short sighted, but I would argue the exact opposite. The new buildings you mentioned can be built by old members who are aware of the dillution and not necessarily by new members. I\u00b4d argue, in fact, the inflation will be bought up vastly by old members who already are aware of the value Uniswap represents. Please, go into further detail why you think the burn mechanism would be detrimental as I\u00b4d like to see your point of view. ",

I am unsure how the current UNI model incentivizes those who are active in governance to maintain voting position? Inflation as it is designed now will dilute UNI governance voters (i.e. active participants in governance) as this inflation is put to the market and not into UNI governance participants hands. Maybe you could provide some insight on how participating and contributing UNI members do not actively become diluted from the 2% perpetual inflation? ",
