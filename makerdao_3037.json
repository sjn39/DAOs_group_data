I think efficient and effective communication is going to be an absolute requirement of any decentralized governance effort. It\u2019s possible for any user to run polls in Discourse. Polls can be a useful tool for signalling around certain ideas or proposals. With these two things in mind, I propose the following: Anybody that wants to collect signals for some opinion or course of action should create a topic in the governance category titled Signal Request: <polling question>. The top level post should always contain a summary of advantages and disadvantages for that issue, collated by the original poster as the discussion takes place in the topic. The \u2018signaling\u2019 tag should be applied to such topics so they can be easily filtered. The Advantages:  It makes it very easy to see when someone is attempting to gather signals without having to read every topic. It makes signal requests easier to find using the search function. Having the top level post summarize the arguments of both sides makes it easier for Governance to form a balanced view of the issue before voting.  The Disadvantages:  It adds to the institutional knowledgebase (the list of things governance needs to know to properly participate.) There is some ongoing responsibility of the original poster to keep the summary up-to-date. There is a requirement that the original poster be \u2018honest\u2019 and not misrepresent arguments they disagree with. There is no way of telling the MKR holdings of the participants, anyone with a forum account can participate. This polling method is vulnerable to Sybil attacks.        Yes, I agree with the proposal. No, I disagree with the proposal.     0 voters     ",

Anyone that is taking part in the governance of the system should be referred to as governance. Debate and discussion of governance issues is just as much a part of governance as voting on said issues with MKR. To call participants the community implies that they are not governing, which they are, even if they own no MKR. There is danger here of course: anyone without a stake in the system does not have right incentive alignment. This is why we need an easy way of communicating with signed messages similar to https://reporters.chat/. In the meantime, we can make do and judge everyone\u2019s statements as \u2018possibly malicious.\u2019 The problem is that discussion and debate is an integral part of governance and some participants without stake but with malicious intentions could influence those with MKR. In terms of a signalling pipeline, I think that this is too hierarchical.     rich.brown:  general chatting and debate -> forum poll -> governance call discussion -> governance poll -> executive vote   This setup privileges one location for discussion (the governance call) over another (the forum). We shouldn\u2019t do this generally, but especially because the call is not an effective location in which to gather consensus (you have to be available at the correct time, participants speak off-the-cuff, it is time limited). In addition, forum polls should be part of the discussion from the beginning. They are a cheap and efficient method for measuring consensus. It is possible to change your vote at any time, so if a new point comes up in the discussion that sways you to change your mind, you can update your vote in seconds. Ideally a forum signal poll should show the current distribution of opinions on the topic discussed and should naturally vary throughout the discussion. I feel that the process would be more effective as something like this:   Debate in all venues with the aim of generating consensus. Acceptance that all relevant points have been considered. Evidenced by no new points raised / discussion stalled / general consensus among participants that this is ready to go to a Governance Poll).

It is my hope that most of what we call \u2018Governance\u2019 will happen here. But, because we cannot determine if anyone in the forum is a MKR Token Voter with any absolute certainty, it is convenient to assume that the discussions, polls, manifestos that we see here are generated by the Community. This is the venue where everyone who has an interest can influence the debate and help shape the decisions that are raised up to Polls and put before the \u2018Voters\u2019. These Polls and Votes will, once we have the freedom to worry about more than just the stability fee every week, become one of the primary segments of the governance calls where we will surface them and debate relative merits. This puts them into a public record (social media, video, audio, transcripts, translations) and is generally just a nice way for people to stay engaged. But, as I never get tired of repeating, the the governance calls are fundamentally not a place for making decisions. It\u2019s a tiny window of time, set up in a North American TZ, held in English. The only way decisions happen are through Polls and Votes. ",

My last post wasn\u2019t intended as an attack on them, only to clarify the point that discussion in a governance call shouldn\u2019t be a requirement to trigger an on-chain poll. My hope is that we will (eventually) have a system where anyone can create on-chain polls at any time, and that they will always be overwhelmingly leaning in one direction because consensus has been formed beforehand.

This is the best option in my mind because:  It allows participants to invest in their own decision before seeing the majority opinion. It allows participants to follow others (Foundation employees or whomever) if they want to, but encourages them to have their own opinion first. It allows us to see who is voting against consensus and ask them to explain their point of view. This is essential to scientific governance and consensus seeking. If you are signalling for a thing, you should be able to explain your reasons for signalling for that thing and either convince others, or be convinced yourself.  ",

Ideas/requests/input should be always formalized on this forum, since it takes significant time and (cognitive) effort to express ideas and arguments in a formal (written) language.   Governance and Community distinction is important. I would expect Governors (is this even a word?) are, or will be, quite a small subset of Community. Community is broader category: users, translators, advocates, investors etc. I agree with LFW that Governance and Risk category should not be classified under \u2018Community\u2019.   signalling pipeline should be: forum and forum polls -> governance poll -> executive vote Centralized discussion location is a must.   purpose of chat rooms is to ask questions, throw ideas, quick debates etc. That is, informal communication between (segment of) members of the community. It is not about speaking to the general community.   purpose of government calls is to talk about current topics, weekly commentary, current issues/problems, future plans etc. And not about reaching consensus. Live calls with more than a handful of people are also not a good format for debating hard topics. Good example is 39th meeting when mrabino opened a potential problem with  DSR and SF calculation,  and the debate got quickly quite hectic. Only after LFW created post on mkrgov reddit \" Is anything wrong with the DSR and Stability Rate calculations as planned for MCD?\", my understanding got better.   I also agree with LFW about votes being public only after vote has been cast.   ",

Ironically, we clarified matters somewhat between us in the chat sometime afterwards, which is a good example of why chat-rooms are less than ideal for this sort of thing, as it never made it to the forum or r/mkrgov. Not sure if @mrabino1 wants to make a separate topic on this forum about his points and some explanation around this, but the most succinct explanation of the problem we were able to agree on was: Accurately managing the Risk Premium of collateral packages to be risk free with time presents systemic challenges at scale given the requirement of decentralisation: requiring MKR Holders to watch over the risk parameters of each collateral-package to ensure that excess DAI minted from out-of-date parameters is not removed using the DSR. And if I had to generate an ELI5 version: Risk Premiums can go out of date as the risk of the collateral changes, which can introduce risky Dai to the system that can be hidden by the use of the DSR to mop up excess supply.

I like signalling/consensus seeking in the following form:  Proposing a solution to a single problem. Including an honest list of advantages and disadvantages to this solution. Poll options of Agree/Disagree/(Undecided?) The proposal can change in response to input and discussion on the thread, onus is on those participating to keep their signals up to date with the current proposal, and to explain their perspective if they disagree. Polls don\u2019t close ever (or closed manually once the on-chain poll/executive happens) Results are hidden until you\u2019ve voted. Votes open to change at any time (not sure that it\u2019s possible to turn this off anyway) \u2018Show who voted\u2019 turned on so that you can see who is disagreeing and get them to put forward their point of view.  Any poll can be expressed this way, I think. The focus is more on consensus-building than on majority-rules under these guidelines. The idea is to listen to everyone, and hopefully get everyone on board with an acceptable solution, even if it isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s first choice. There are occasions where multiple poll options may be more efficient though, such as in the debt-ceiling case. In that situation I think \u2018Multiple Choice\u2019 is actually more effective, letting everyone vote yes or no to every proposed option. For example, in the debt ceiling poll I prefer an 20mil raise, but I would also vote (on-chain) for a 50mil raise. In a \u2018Single Choice\u2019 poll, this information is lost unless I comment. ",

Consensus >50% with reasonable participation and discussion has stagnated (no new points of view) for two weeks.  The elephant in the room with these is how to define \u2018reasonable participation\u2019. In my opinion this should depend on how many people are actively using the forum, and how many people have signalled in comparison to other signalling topics. A signalling topic that has more votes and discussion than any of the others would have reasonable participation, even if the total votes is say ~30. As the actively participating community grows, this threshold should grow. At a minimum signals should be on the forum for a week and brought up in the governance call to raise awareness before moving on-chain. ",
