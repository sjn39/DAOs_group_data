One problem that I tend to have with other blockchain-based platforms is that you get a lot of scammers that will go in the group just to grab other users and send them private messages selling whatever scam they might be offering. So I think maybe having one telegram group open for everyone and one telegram group for community members (people who actively participate in here, meaning the only way of getting access would probably be through participation in this forum) might be a better solution.
