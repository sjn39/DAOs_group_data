Grants in this category will be automatically considered for the $50k matching pool allocated to this category. If you are building something in the Gitcoin ecosystem, its worth hitting https://gitcoin.co/grants/new and creating a grant so people can support you! What is in scope per the proposal:  anything involved in the DAO workstreams governance for the public good prototypes for the public good decentralization of Gitcoin itself anti-fraud communication - creating content or memes for the public good in general - anyone who is advancing GitcoinDAO\u2019s goals/mission through their actions.
