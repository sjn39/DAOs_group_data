(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): We are building on-chain lending markets for small and medium businesses.Businesses mint equity tokens which have real legal recourse over the business and its assets via legal wrappers and contracts. Auditors get access to necessary financial data feeds and issue live feeds of verifiable credentials for the business\u2019s financial statements. A DAO votes on underwriting parameters for valuing the equity tokens (P/E ratio, liquidity discount, approved/required financial data points). This then determines what the DAO believes they could liquidate the business for in a short-term sale.These equity tokens now have a live, verifiable, risk-adjusted, on-chain value. Business owners can then lock these tokens as collateral in a lending pool and begin to accept lenders via an overcollateralized lending mechanism.For example: I buy a business at $1M, the DAO determines I correctly valued the business at $1M based on the financials, but applies a 30% liquidity discount to ensure in the case of default they can sell the asset and keep lenders whole. From there my risk-adjusted collateral value is $700K. If the collateralization ratio is 2X, I can get $350K of debt for my business.

High, sustainable yields are the backbone for a strong DeFi ecosystem. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Sustainable DeFi yields are currently 1-4% across all ecosystems. We are able to deliver 6-15% yields backed by tangible, profitable businesses. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: DeFi has been one of the largest drivers of on-chain activity over the last few years and is one of the clearest sources of PMF for crypto. Optimism\u2019s DeFi ecosystem is currently lagging behind that of its competitors. We can help drive bringing TVL onto Optimism and build a DeFi ecosystem around our lending markets. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: no Number of OP tokens requested: 50000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): We will use 100% of the tokens to boost the yields for lenders. We anticipate having an MVP launched in 6-9 months. Tokens will be offered to lenders who locked their capital in specific lending pools for 1+ years. Tokens will begin to be vested once they unlock after 1 year. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Our goal will be to allocate the full grant in our first month of launch. The tokens will slowly vest to lenders over the course of the loan. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: We will launch an MVP of our product in 6-9 months. Once launched we will onboard 1-3 businesses for an initial demonstration of the lending product. Once these businesses launch their credit pools, we will look to receive the token grant. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Even our base case yield is higher and more sustainable than traditional DeFi (and even much of tradfi). The token incentives will allow us to grow a bit quicker and helps solve the cold start problem, but the fundamental value of the product does not rely on incentive schemes. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): N/A Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

It also would suffer under the one-year lockup rule, as you would not have access to the grant until well into your planned launch. My suggestion is to resubmit this for the next cycle and to substantiate the proposal somewhat with more materials underlying the go-to-market plan here - there are a lot of questions that need answering when you\u2019re dealing with RWAs in particular, given, at minimum, the legal realities such protocols face.
