See, e.g., Real World Finance. This is great! In this thread, I propose we could list the Core Units that we wish existed.  Hopefully this can give signals to people with the proper background/competences on what is needed at MakerDAO. I will personally only list Core Units that have not been discussed much yet, and do not list very expected CU such as \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d, \u201cOracles\u201d, etc. ",

The contributors of the CoreUnits include: a panel to select the best projects, a \u201cmarketing\u201d figure to advertise the available funds and announce the best results, etc. Additional Notes: I believe the Maker Foundation had this type of structure, internally, as it consistently funded projects and integrations over the course of the years.

This would include an official stream of properly processed news.  Ideally, the Core Units members are the typical figures working in financial information media, social-media experts, etc. Additional Notes: This type of activity is being pushed forward by other projects in the crypto space, and it will be more and more required to \u201clook serious and professional\u201d. As an example, see https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-pm/blob/master/financials/reports/2020Q3-yearn-quarterly-report.pdf.

Maker Relay; Service, Product, Platform Has been consistently released and iterated on since July 2020.  Governance Call Summaries; Service, Product Have been consistently released since May 2019  Governance Call Snippets; Service, Product Recently started, and have been a great success for getting a shorter call summary that can be posted almost immediately after the call.  The MakerDAO Tuesday Community Call; Service, Platform Has been running since early 2018, and has evolved to be more focused on guests and discussion rather than updates  Maintaining the public MakerDAO events calendar; Service This calendar has public calls and MakerDAO votes.   There is still a lot of growth to be had. I especially like the idea of a quarterly report besides the weekly relay, which already targets Maker Protocol Stakeholders.

A lot of the work we currently do for the project is answering questions and providing statements to reporters and researchers as needed.

We need to be able to restore funds for simple mistakes (sending to 0x0 or to a known immutable smart contract). Our existence depends on DAI users, it is our role to provide the best service to them.     Minting New DAI to Offset Lost DAI       With the PSM and balance sheet manipulations, this is no longer an issue for the peg.  Each DAI lost is a perpetual loan with 0% interest rate for Maker.  We really need a Customer Services Core Unit. The ability to recover DAI from mistakes would be a great thing for DAI usability (and DAI demand). We can use the surplus buffer and/or the mandated actor multisig to start with.  In your specific case, I\u2019m not sure it will help as it\u2019s difficult to be sure that those DAI are really lost.     ",

Ideally, contributors of this Core Unit have serious research experience in the field (PhDs, tenured academics, etc). It is very hard to image that this type of figure could come and work for MakerDAO full time (at least now). What is more likely is that the Facilitator of this Core Unit comes/belongs from this word and has a web of contacts in the banking/finance/academic world to outsource research as \u201cfinancial consulting\u201d tasks. It is of vital (i.e., to survive) importance for MakerDAO to understand  - at a deep level - the key winning aspects of MakerDAO, separate them from the \u201cnoise\u201d, and understand how to leverage them in several financial contexts (e.g., negative interests rates, new financial crisis, periods of sustained growth, bull markets, etc) in the best possible way. My point of view: MakerDAO has emerged from the talent, imagination, creativity of a group of enthusiastic and super-clever people, often coming from technology/engineering mora than finance. But now it is reaching big numbers, and we need the help of professionals in money-theory. This does not mean that MakerDAO should be eaten by the \u201clegacy system\u201d. But just that the \u201clegacy system\u201d has a lot of knowledge that we need to use, rather than re-inventing the wheel (and making mistakes). Additional Notes: In his recent talk (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLdCPwvYuFk&t=2072s), which everybody reading this should watch, @SebVentures made several excellent points. One of the most important is that we need to make a deep \u201cCompetitor Analysis\u201d (Aave, Chainlink, Compound, UniSwap, etc), where competitor means \u201cother big DeFi project\u201d.  \u201cYou can\u2019t beat them if you don\u2019t know them\u201d.  I think this would be (one of the) a perfect task for this Core Unit. ",

My practice consists of advising startups in entity formation, day to day outside general counsel work, financings on both investor and company side, capital markets (ipos, spacs, follow ons) and m&a. I also advise a number of crypto clients on crypto specific issues and have helped with various token offerings, both registered and private. I first got involved with makerdao in 2016/17 but got busy in 2018 and stopped attending calls. Trying to work my way back into it, but a lot has changed. Let me know if I can be helpful. ",

For example: R&D core unit communication with Financial Research & Competitor Analysis is crucial to explore the creation of new projects that may help the protocol move forward.
