I believe higher education is key to equality, world prosperity, and importantly, world peace. One of our initiatives in 2021 has been a Fintech Scholarship fund, which was established in order to help college students pay for their tuition, and educate them about the endless possibilities of Fintech. It was a successful undertaking, with had >100 applicants, were listed as a scholarship by a number of high-profile organizations, and had 3 winners, who were extremely happy  In 2022, we would love to expand on this success and offer a scholarship to students around the world, and focus more specifically on DeFi/Web3 and how this could help women (and men) build a better life after they graduate. I am not sure if Maker is interested in anything like this, but if so, I would love your feedback. Together, we could look to expanding the amount we give away, expanding the marketing to potentially reach a more diverse, global audience. We can also rebrand the offering to reflect our partnership and the mission, etc. New Silver could undertake the marketing and administration of this fund. Happy to hear thoughts. Thank you for reading. ",

                    "content": "Ok, just some thoughts:  I\u2019m sure you have your reasons, but the scholarship rate seems to me to be unbalanced:  1st Prize: $2,000 2nd Prize: $500 3rd Prize: $500 Why do the 2nd and 3rd prize winners get the same amount, while the first prize winner gets 4 times as much?   In developing countries, small amounts (a few hundred USD) can be a big help and therefore attractive, while in countries with a high standard of living, it is almost nothing. By weighting the amount of the scholarship you can award by region, you can distribute the amount available more efficiently.  So that you can give financial aid to more beneficiaries. (Although - as far as I know - Maker does not have a region weighting for salaries, I think that weighting by region\u2019s standard of living is a legitimate and not a flawed idea.)   Those who complete their studies with excellent results may get some kind of job opportunity at Maker, if that is possible.   Fiscal, regulatory, technological environments in some countries may make this type of support impossible.   I\u2019m sure there are many issues to be considered for such a project, but this is not my area of expertise. ",
