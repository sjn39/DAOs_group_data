Welcome to the Collateral Onboarding Call. We are here with Stasis and Crypto.com. The first presentation will be Stasis with EURStasis. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   EURStasis  [EURS] - Stasis Euro stablecoin - Forum Thread  Greg Presentation 01:30 Track record1690\u00d7908 168 KB Stasis wallet1690\u00d7908 307 KB BDO1690\u00d7908 116 KB Stasis.net1690\u00d7908 303 KB 1690\u00d7908 96.9 KB 1690\u00d7908 297 KB 1690\u00d7908 213 KB Discussion  08:45 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Lorik in the chat asks) will you add RuPay cards for local Indian people for buying Stasis Euro without any difficulty? Because not everyone uses Visa cards or Mastercard 10:14 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: A couple of months ago, Rafael Cosman from Trust Tokens mentioned that it\u2019s not possible to do euro from a regulatory point of view. Do you have any comments about that? 11:54 - Primoz: I have a question specifically related to negative rates in Europe. You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re storing with custodians and guardians, but the yields in Europe are also negative. So how are you able to have a positive yield on those euros that you\u2019re storing? 13:27 - Primoz: Don\u2019t you think that lending EURS to these collateralized margins, services or products, is risky as well? 14:17 - Primoz: Are you transparent with those assets that you hold? Is this public? 14:46 - Frank Cruz: Regarding BDO Malta, I was looking for an order report for their operations and I can\u2019t find it. Last report was 2018. Do you have a BDO Malta report for us for 2020? 15:45 - Tadeo: If you have a lot of people who want to sell Stasis Euros at the same time and redeem them for the fiat currency, how do you manage the liquidity in that case? 17:33 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I think the question was, if people want to redeem a lot of EURS and sell or burn the EURS, do you guys have the liquidity to do that? 18:53 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Lorik in the chat asks) what would happen when Eth 2.0 would come along? Would Stasis Euro be the same as today or would something change? 19:50 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Will you guys use the vaults yourselves or you\u2019re just interested in getting Eurs into Maker for users and to increase adoption? 20:33 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Alex in the chat asks) why do European investors prefer dollar currency and US backed stablecoins? 22:12 - Frank Cruz: Do you have a web browser built into your wallet? I heard some app creators had issues with Apple. Coinbase had issues; Trust Wallet recently removed their browser. What has been your relationship with Apple as far as the wallet is concerned? 22:53 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Lorik in the chat asks) what\u2019s your plan for 2021? Can we see Stasis Euro on PayPal? What\u2019s your opinion on regulation and PayPal? 27:48 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Sandu in the chat asks) any bets on when a Eurs CBDC can go live? And how would this impact on the Eurs development?  Crypto.com  [CRO] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - Crypto.com - Forum Thread  Eric Anziani Presentation 30:07 Intro1690\u00d7908 112 KB Agenda1690\u00d7908 101 KB Belief1690\u00d7908 192 KB Solutions1690\u00d7908 201 KB Chain1690\u00d7908 201 KB Products1690\u00d7908 223 KB Swap1690\u00d7908 203 KB Education1690\u00d7908 185 KB Global1690\u00d7908 129 KB CRO token1690\u00d7908 190 KB What can CRO bring to MakerDAO?1690\u00d7908 239 KB Discussion  42:02 - David Utrobin: Is there any reason that CRO is not on any of the DEXes? I\u2019m looking for it in Uniswap, for example. I\u2019m not seeing it anywhere. Is it in ERC20? 42:43 - Frank Cruz: You said in your presentation that it\u2019s going to give exposure to more than five million users and more people will get an idea of Dai. Can you go little more into depth with that? If I\u2019m a Crypto user and I live in Honduras and want to get exposure to a stablecoin, will I be able to have access to Dai? Will I be able to open a vault? 44:19 - Frank Cruz: But you won\u2019t be able to get access to Oasis and open up a vault, right? You won\u2019t be able to use your wrapped Bitcoin as collateral through your app, right? 45:06 - David Utrobin: I am curious about how many accounts/wallets hold CRO. I\u2019m curious about the token distribution, specifically. Do you have any data or anything offhand that you can mention? 46:33 - Tadeo: Tom\u00e1s has asked in the chat if you can guide us around the process of staking for CRO 47:47 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: What about the other assets? What else can you stake and what\u2019s the process? 49:17 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: You mentioned that the CRO is a utility token, so what can you get with it, what can you pay with the CRO apart from probably staking and getting rewards in CRO. I\u2019m not sure if you provide rewards in Dai or in CRO 51:45 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: (Tom\u00e1s in the chat asks) can I link my payments with the staking rewards of CRO? 52:57 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do you have a list of the merchants that accept CRO? 54:23 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: David and Alex on the chats were worried about the price. What\u2019s the actual free float on CRO tokens? Since there\u2019s a hundred billion supply, how much could be dumped tomorrow?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 55:46  Tomorrow at 17:30 UTC we\u2019re going to have Federico from Kleros. Kleros has just announced a fellowship with the Maker Foundation regarding collateral onboarding. Next week, October 28th at 17:00 UTC, we\u2019re going to have ConsolFreight, one of the RWA companies that are working with Centrifuge to bring RWA to the blockchain. At 18:00 UTC we\u2019re going to have Curve Finance.  Credits   @Gala and @blimpa   produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
