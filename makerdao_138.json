The onboarding process641\u00d7672 23.1 KB  The use of MKR in a staking role will enable more collateral types to be onboarded faster. Additionally there will be less reliance on Maker real world office hubs. Within the world of crypto in general it can be argued that Maker will be more permissionless with a staking system in place. Purely from a business perspective the staking process will drastically cut the cost of onboarding new collateral types. This in itself will enable more tokens to be onboarded, spreading the beneficial effects of Maker deeper into the ecosystem. The next article in this series will deal with the impact on Maker governance. ",

                    "content": "Staking part 4 - system consequences - Maker governance Maker governance in relation to collateral management is possibly were the staking model has the most drastic advantage. Consider a scenario 6-10 months from now where Maker has onboarded 10 collateral types. Under the voting model this has taken roughly 30 rounds of community discussions and 40 voting events. With the ever-changing landscape of crypto there will be an additional of 10 community discussions and another possible 40 votes (based on a review every six months)  just to keep the present collateral types up to date (debt ceiling, specific stability fees etc). Needless to say this will create wear and tear on the voting community, but most importantly - this will simply not scale. With staking however the voting overhead will be drastically lower, the community just votes to decline the collateral types it does not want. There is absolutely zero collateral type maintenance, when the staking contracts expire the collateral type is removed from the pool of valid collateral types and will have to be reintroduced all over again. This makes for a continuous expansion and contraction of the collateral types available, most of it without any governance necessary unless some scamcoin is introduced and the community must mobilize to dispose of it. Community members are encouraged to think about a scenario a couple of years in the future when Maker has grown substantially and there are 1000 collateral types in the Maker ecosystem. Some might say Maker will never reach this level but the fact is that 1000 collateral types is just scratching the surface of what is theoretically possible. The maintenance overhead of such collateral pool, taking a 6 month period between updates, will amount to (10002/52) a minimum of 38 community discussions and (10002/52*4) 154 community votes per week. Needless to say this is not even remotely workable. Most likely even 100 types of collateral will be too much for an onboarding system relying on MKR holders in a gatekeeping role as the sunk cost of invested time for active voters will increase towards a full time job without compensation.  Maker governance616\u00d7596 16.5 KB  The voting system has an upper scaling limit based on the number of voting processes necessary for onboarding and maintaining new collateral, just based on the present throughput a rough estimate of 100 collateral types as an absolute maximum for this system. The staking system has a vastly higher upper scaling limit due to the much lower requirement for voting. If the staking system requires no votes for collateral maintenance and only one round of community discussion and one community vote for removal of a collateral type, the upper limit of such a system is only determined by how often someone tries to scam the system by trying to get worthless collateral onboarded. Countermeasures include a safety factor in the formula calculating the required staking capital, a safety factor in the required waiting period or an additional safety factor in the minimum staking amount. In other words - under the staking system there is no upper hard cap in terms of collateral types, only a speed limit in terms of growth. This end the series of articles arguing for using staking to onboard collateral. ",

                    "content": "Staking part 2 - collateral waiting period and community responses After an investor has onboarded a potential collateral type, a waiting period follows where MKR holders might challenge the onboarding as the staker might have tried to onboard unsafe or unwanted collateral. During the waiting period no DAI can be drawn from Vaults containing the candidate collateral type. The community is informed through the contract that a new candidate collateral type has been added and during the waiting period the community can challenge the onboarding . In this period entities called Hunters will check the collateral type. An informed reader might have noticed that the role of the Hunter is the same as that of a Maker risk team, but in reverse. Under the voting system a Maker risk team finds and evaluates collateral before bringing it as a proposal to the community. A Hunter finds already staked collateral, evaluates it and if after the evaluation the collateral type is found wanting seeks the community for approval to have it removed. If no action has been taken on the part of the community the collateral type is automatically approved at the end of the waiting period and DAI may be drawn from Vaults containing this type of collateral. This process is in other words the opposite of the voting process where the collateral type will have to wait for approval. Under the staking system the collateral will be automatically approved unless the community takes action to remove it. A Hunter is any entity checking the range of onboarded or potential collateral in order to find dubious collateral types. These collateral types could be scams or in breach of Maker legal or ethical guidelines or have incompatible hardforking or distribution mechanics. Once a Hunter has found one, arguments are prepared and the case is brought to a community vote. If the Maker community votes in favour of the Hunter, the collateral type is invalidated and the Hunter is awarded the staked MKR, but not any accumulated DAI. This in order to incentivize early countermeasures and not let more time pass so more fees are accumulated. Any DAI goes straight to some system fund. In order to keep the Hunters honest a small \u2018Hunters stake\u2019 (1% of staked MKR?) should be applied, the Hunter loses this stake if the voting goes against him or her. This to prevent \u2018nothing to lose\u2019 spamming of the governance system. Due note that there is nothing that prevents the community from removing a collateral type at any time, the advantage of doing it during the waiting period is of course that no DAI has been issued yet. Alternatively, one could argue that the role of the Hunter should be limited to finding bad collateral after the waiting period is over, during the waiting period the community as a group should act as concerned token holders. In that case if the collateral is deemed unsafe the staked MKR would be distributed to the community members participating in the voting process. With the staking process differing substantially from the voting process, the system consequences will be explained in the next part of this series. ",

Maker probably has like 1-2% of all ETH on deposit.  Even if Maker got the same numbers this would be 50-80M in deposits leading to what 30-50M in more DAI.

MakerMan:  I DO NOT believe this system should be allowed to grow much beyond 1/2 the market cap of MKR itself and even then I have some issues.   The market cap of mkr should go up the more debt activity increases in value and volume. More debt activity generally means more revenue for the protocol it controls, so theoretically mkr total value should increase as a result (not only price increase from the supply burn).     MakerMan:  RIGHT NOW if you look at the vault/CDP holders the VAST majoirty of DAI is being utilized by perhaps 100-200 ETH whales.   Well some of that is other crypto projects leveraging ICO eth or at least similar situations with someone trying to fund star ups without selling capital. Sure, definitely not serving the undeserved yet. Keep in mind DAI hasen\u2019t even transitioned out of its baby (beta) stage yet . So it makes sense that the main group of people using it are investors familiar with blockchain (in eth in general or mkr or both) looking to increase yields with leverage and/or stimulate a project that affects other investments. If you hold a lot of mkr then paying interest also goes towards increasing the value of mkr. Many eth whales likely also hold mkr somewhere,     MakerMan:  Unless someone shows me where this vast amount of collateral is coming from the way I see it there is perhaps another ~5-8B IN TOTAL (if that) available in other ERC compatible, decentralized coins.   Another run up in the market even in its current state could greatly increase the value of collateral. A proposed collateral onbording process is in progress and should be released soon, many diverse projects are waiting in line. If any eventually succeed at scale then we are gold. Basically, betting that maker can onboard enough collateral to achieve wide scale, is the same as betting that etherum will house mainstream large scale applications/functions (that use tokens in some form, equity, utility, ect) ",

                    "content": "Staking part 1 - staking to onboard Vault collateral With the launch of multi collateral Dai, the focus is turning towards onboarding collateral types that can be used for Vaults. In order for the Maker ecosystem to grow there will be an increasing need to onboard more and more collateral types in order to increase the supply of DAI. Let me be painfully clear about the goal here: DAI is not meant to be a small niche plaything for defi enthusiasts, DAI is to be the leading stablecoin project with global reach, eventually enabling every person on the whole planet access to financial stability equal to that of the US dollar. In order to achieve this enormous amounts of Dai will need to be issued - and since the system is always over-collateralized - an even larger amount of collateral types in all shapes and forms will need to be approved as collateral material. The process design outlined so far is using MKR holders as voters in a gatekeeping role that will discuss and then use their MKR to vote in order to approve or reject collateral types. While crypto in general aims to be permissionless, Vault collateral onboarded using such a process will be permissioned, although only by the MKR voters. No matter how the process is shaped, as long as MKR holders can only use their MKR in this gatekeeping role, the onboarding process will act as a bottleneck to the growth of the Maker ecosystem. This is however not the only way to onboard collateral, and in this article arguments will be put forward for using MKR in a staking role. Onboarding collateral using voting Let us start with a macro level overview of how the process is outlined to work with MKR holders voting in a gatekeeping role, which is more or less the current function of the token. A collateral type (typically an ERC20 token) will start as a proposed candidate. It is then subjected to initial screening, placed on a prioritised list, subject to further analysis, given collateral parameters, and finally approved or not by MKR holders. The above steps are just the briefest of overviews, the process could easily take three rounds of community discussion and four rounds of community voting for every single collateral type. With the system set up using MKR to vote, this is the state of things. Maker internal or external risk teams will analyze and give parameters to each asset. These teams will be compensated per hour or per job but with regards to incentives their focus will be on being as restrictive as possible. If things go well, the Maker ecosystem thrives but the risk team does not directly benefit. If things go wrong, the risk team in question will get blamed. Perhaps most importanly, the sheer number of community decisions and votes necessary for collateral onboarding will serve to limit the number of collateral types that can be onboarded as well as the speed of onboarding itself. Onboarding collateral using staking When explaining Dai the ultimate argument is \u201cDai is always over-collateralized\u201d - that is the base on which everything is built - the rest is system mechanics. When explaining staking the final argument is \u201cThe staker stands to lose more than he or she can gain\u201d. That is the principle behind staking - again the rest is system mechanics. When explaining the staking model it is necessary to go all the way back to the beginning and mentally scrap the idea of MKR holders as gatekeeping voters with regards to the collateral onboarding process. There are in most cases simply no vote. Instead MKR or DAI is staked in smart contracts to enable collateral types to be Vault material. With regards to staking material MKR is mostly used throughout this article but due to the volatility of crypto tokens, it would in many cases be better to stake using DAI, especially for tokens linked to real world assets. Some might argue that this opens the door to using any coin for staking, but the Maker community can ultimately only guarantee the integrity of two coins - DAI and MKR. Below is a walk-through of using staking to onboard a collateral type:  An investor finds a collateral type worth staking. The investor starts up the appropriate smart contract and sets collateral parameters. All parameters set by the staker. Smart contract requests collateral in response to parameters. Collateral is staked. The collateral type is now ready for use in Maker Vaults after a mandatory waiting period.  Worked out example: An MKR holder wants to onboard the generic ERC20 token XYZ and set the initial debt ceiling to a million DAI. Fire up the collateral onboarding smart contract. Collateral token address: 0xaaa\u2026 Staking address: 0xbbb\u2026 Payout address: 0xccc\u2026 Amount: 1 000 000 DAI Collateral onboarding fee: 1% (1% on top of the general DAI Stability Fee). Years valid: 5 Staking using MKR example: The smart contract responds to the equation nMKRstaked > debt_ceiling(MKR) * collateral_onboarding_fee * years_valid. Staking using DAI example: The smart contract responds to the equation (staking DAI example) nDAIstaked > debt_ceiling(DAI) * collateral_onboarding_fee * years_valid. Solving for the above example gives an approximate answer of 50000 DAI or about 120 MKR (December 2019 values) in order to onboard token XYZ with a debt ceiling of 1 million DAI. Other more advanced formulas are of course possible, including safety factors. Note that in both cases the collateral staked is higher compared to what can possibly be gained from the staking. Other MKR holders might of course issue identical or slightly different versions of the same contract, allowing both a much higher total debt ceiling for this collateral type as well as multiple levels of collateral specific stability fees. System total collateral debt ceilings are off course subject to community votes as normal. Possibilities include setting the debt level for new collateral low if many new types of collateral have been onboarded over the last month or so, making it hard for MKR holders to keep track. Also - if the collateral type is well known (typically just another million DAI worth of ETH collateral) the waiting period could be cut shorter by some system formula. Providing everything goes right: at the end of the five year period the staked 120 MKR and the accumulated fee of possibly up to (1 000 000 DAI *1% * 5 years) 50 000 DAI are returned to the investor. In other words the staker gets his MKR back as well as the accumulated fees which are the rightful reward for onboarding valuable collateral. The contract is then closed, the XYZ debt ceiling is lowered by 1 million DAI and if the above staking contract was the only one for token XYZ, the token is removed from the collateral type pool. In case something goes wrong: in case the collateral declines in value slowly this is simply handled though existing Vault processes with no repercussions to the staker. In case the collateral declines so fast in value that the Maker system is not able to sell the collateral fast enough to cover outstanding debt, the staked MKR and accumulated DAI is sold first to reduce debt before any other system response. A staker therefore could lose his or her MKR in two ways - by trying to onboard collateral the community immediately rejects or by onboarding collateral the community approves of but which later becomes worthless. To compensate for this considerable risk the profit margin is potentially 99% of the staked amount - highly profitable even by crypto standards. To sum it up - requiring more collateral in the staking contract compared to what can be gained from the staking contract itself eliminates the possibility of a rational actor willfully onboarding worthless collateral. Next the staking system needs to protect against scamming - actors purposely onboarding worthless collateral. This is the function of the waiting period where MKR holders might challenge the onboarding. This will be explained in the next part of this series. ",

Planet_X:  When explaining the staking model it is necessary to go all the way back to the beginning and mentally scrap the idea of MKR holders as gatekeeping voters with regards to the collateral onboarding process.   If there is a waiting period during which mkr voters can shut down an instance of a stake-based vault, they still function as gatekeepers, just potentially less voting necessary. In general this idea seems most effective for low cap and more exotic collateral types that risk teams may not want  to spend time on. It reduces mkr risk in having to bail a collateral out since the stake covers some of the potential shortfall. Otherwise I dont think this approach makes as much sense for larger more popular instruments since it bakes in another cost in the stability fee for compensating the staker. In another comment you described the fee imposed by the investor as the risk premium. How would reconciliation with potentially reduced mkr holder profits be manged? Like how would the staker decide the premium to charge and navigate how much revenue goes to the burner? Could those actions annoy governance enough to spite the investor and essential seize the staked mkr/dai? Thanks for the work excited to read part three ",
