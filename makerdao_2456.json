                    "content": "  Who is the interested party for this collateral application? ParaFi Capital   Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol enabling users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. COMP is Compound\u2019s governance token. COMP is an ERC-20 token used to propose and vote on changes to the Compound protocol. Token holders can also delegate COMP to any address. Anybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action.   Provide a brief history of the project. Compound was first announced in January 2018. v1 launched in September 2018, and v2 launched in May 2019. Since launching v2, Compound has become the largest DeFi platform in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), standing at ~$600MM. The protocol currently supports nine assets: BAT, ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, ZRX, WBTC, REP, and SAI. In February 2020, the Compound team announced the release of the COMP token and the path to handing over the governance of Compound to COMP holders. COMP holders officially took control of Compound in April 2020, replacing the team as the administrator of the protocol.   Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.     Whitepaper   Developer Documentation   GitHub   COMP Token Contract   Compound Medium    Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.   Security Audits Formal Verification Summary Gauntlet Market Risk Assessment   Link to any active communities relating to your project.   Discord Comradery    How is the applying collateral type currently used? COMP is a governance token. COMP token holders propose and vote on changes to the Compound protocol. Holders can also delegate their COMP to any address. The Compound governance dashboard displays ongoing governance proposals and a leaderboard of voting weight. COMP Distribution Schedule     2,396,307 COMP have been distributed to shareholders of Compound Labs, Inc., which created the protocol   2,226,037 COMP are allocated to founders & team and subject to 4-year vesting   372,707 COMP are allocated to future team members   4,229,949 COMP are reserved for users of the protocol   775,000 COMP are reserved for the community to advance governance through other means \u2014 which will be announced at a future date   0 COMP will be sold or retained by Compound Labs, Inc. 4,229,949 COMP will be distributed to borrowers and lenders on Compound over approximately 4 years. Initially, the distribution was allocated to each market (ETH, USDC, DAI\u2026) proportional to the interest being accrued in the market. However, with the passing of proposal 011, each market is allocated COMP relative to borrowing demand.     Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? N/A   Where does exchange for the asset occur? COMP trades on multiple centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, and FTX. COMP also trades on decentralized exchanges including Uniswap and Balancer.   (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A   (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. N/A   (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. N/A   ",
