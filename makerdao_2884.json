                    "content": "Hi MakerDAO community, David here  I want to start a discussion to gauge the community\u2019s feelings and thoughts towards a program we started way back to produce high fidelity summaries of the Thursday Governance and Risk Calls. The program serves a few purposes:  Produces a high-quality high-accuracy resource week-to-week for stakeholders wanting to dig into current events. Creates a historic and referenceable record of these calls for the general public. Great way to onboard new community members, letting them earn Dai while also learning about the Governance of the protocol.  Considerations: The introduction of Snippets has captured the benefit of providing a quick snapshot of what happens on public calls. The more detailed summaries are now more of an archival resource than one that is used week-to-week. The introduction of Maker Relay is consistently producing a comprehensive weekly overview of MakerDAO. So the summary is not the only place to get updated. Rather, it\u2019s a place to dig deeper for information and insights. A Publications Section is being planned on the community development portal to have a better location for meeting summaries, snippets, community-generated content, and more. This would increase the visibility of the high-fidelity summaries. The Thursday call isn\u2019t the only public call happening at MakerDAO. There are Collateral Onboarding Calls,  Special Stakeholder Discussion calls, unscheduled governance calls, and more. We average around 6-10 public calls per month that could use some form of public notes like snippets or summaries. The cost of a single high-fidelity summary is approximately ~400 Dai and requires three people, approximately ~22k+ per year assuming one summary per week. The cost of a single snippet is approximately <100 Dai and requires two people. My Thoughts Keeping MKR voters and ecosystem stakeholders informed is very important, and is one of the responsibilities of governance. Deciding as a community how that information is captured and shared is important, which is why this issue is being raised here. Especially considering that the protocol will be paying for such services directly in the near future. I, personally, believe meetings should have snippets at a minimum since they are more cost-effective, a lot easier to produce, require fewer people, and the turn around time is same-day. High-fidelity summaries are useful, especially for active voters, mandated actors, and domain teams. I think we should continue to produce them for the Thursday GnR call, Emergency Governance Calls, and potentially even Stakeholder Discussion calls since a lot of interesting insights are shared there with no way of reliably being captured except through the notes of individuals who attend the calls or duplicate those insights by writing on the relevant forum threads. My thoughts on this are not set in stone, the community should weigh in to signal whether they would support such an activity in the future through direct funding. I will update this top-level post with anything I see that might be missing, or important as brought up in the comments. Questions for you Polls    Do you use or read the High-Fidelity summaries?  yes no abstain     0 voters        Would you vote to fund High Fidelity Summaries? (approx 25k per year)  yes no abstain     0 voters        Should we stop producing High-Fidelity Summaries?  yes, and my answer for why is in the comments no, and my answer for why is in the comments abstain     0 voters     ",

Tomorrow when we\u2019re scaled up, there will be no one left with enough time to attend all meetings because there won\u2019t be enough hours in a day to do that. Researchers will use this as a source for citations, analyses, even forensics. Inclusiveness is an important additional reason. Every governance process that takes itself seriously has notes like this, although not always of such high quality. There should be little discussion that this practice needs to be preserved imo. ",
