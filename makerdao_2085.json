The Ambassador Program is also requesting an official MakerDAO email to use for communication.   Asset name Subdomain Name: latam.makerdao.com  Asset Type: SubDomain Asset Owner: DAI Foundation Platform Manager: Ambassador Program ([email\u00a0protected]) Content Manager: Ambassador Program ([email\u00a0protected]) Purpose: To host Ambassador\u2019s new website and introductory portal to MakerDAO. Last Modification: N/A (new subdomain)  Email Name: [email\u00a0protected]  Asset Type: Email Asset Owner: DAI Foundation Platform Manager: Ambassador Program ([email\u00a0protected]) Content Manager: Ambassador Program ([email\u00a0protected]) Purpose: To get an official email for contact purposes. Last Modification: N/A (new email)   Supporters  @Tadeo @0xdeniz @Derek   Reason for Modification The program members noticed a lack of introductory material about MakerDAO and a need for it from the spanish-speaking community. It was also noticeable that all information was spread across a large number of forum posts and portals outside the Maker Forums, making it difficult to access. After a lot of hard work, an official MakerDAO LATAM website has been made by the Ambassador Program following Growth\u2019s Brand Guidelines facilitated by @Nadia and @Tobal from the Growth Core Unit. The purpose of this website is to gather all original and translated educative content for the hispanic interested parties and community members, thus making it easier to navigate across the material and find information to start learning and participating. The Ambassador Program has created a new Spanish Introductory Portal, which is all 100% original content made by and for LATAM users. It addresses the following points:  Introduction to the DAO  What is a DAO Maker History and Maker Foundation DAOs Core Principles   Maker Governance  What is Governance On & Off-Chain Governance Voting & Proposals Cycles How to Participate   DAI  What is DAI DAI uses How to get DAI   Oracles  Case Uses & Basic Concepts   Vaults  Use Cases & Basic Concepts Stability Fees Risks & Liquidations     Website Preview  722\u00d7412 83.5 KB  The website is currently in the works and will debut in March, 2023. Once online, the website will be constantly updated as new Spaces, Newsletters and Introductory Portal\u2019s articles will continue to be worked on by the Ambassador Program.  A mockup version of the official website can be found  here. Also, a pre-alpha browsable version of the website made on Wix can be seen  here.  ",
