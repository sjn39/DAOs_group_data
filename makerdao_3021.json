The project has scammed approximately 13m$ and we are investigating further into the team behind it, aiming at bringing more confidence to the DeFi market, and forcing the thief to return the funds to those who suffered from this \u2018project\u2019. Here is a post we wrote in public about it https://twitter.com/defiyield_info/status/1333731633393004545 . If you require more information about the scam, please let us know. The stolen funds are currently in the following addresses: https://etherscan.io/address/0x944f214a343025593d8d9fd2b2a6d43886fb2474 https://etherscan.io/address/0x079667f4f7a0b440ad35ebd780efd216751f0758 As you can see, more than half of the stolen funds are in DAI (over 6.8 million DAI), therefore we look forward to your assistance in:  blacklisting the mentioned addresses, monitoring where they are moving their DAI funds and ultimately blocking them.  Needless to say \u2013 all those who suffered from the scam are looking out for any help they can get in the DeFi space and beyond. We look forward to hearing from you within shortest possible delays. King regards ",

We are unable to do either of these things. The DAI token does not have a blacklist, nor is it upgradable. Monitoring the funds is relatively straightforward given that they\u2019re on the blockchain, but there\u2019s nothing we can do to prevent them from being transferred. If you want to pursue this yourselves, you can monitor the funds and if they move to a known exchange address you could ask the exchange to seize the tokens. ",
