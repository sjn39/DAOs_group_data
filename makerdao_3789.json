I have to say it is a bit surprising considering prices are more or less flat lately. It seems there is an increased stablecoin demand in general and any upcoming price shock will only increase it further. It feels the 600m buffer won\u2019t be enough until the next possible executive vote becomes effective in about 10 days. At the same time the latest PSM debt ceiling poll shows support for a larger increase of PSM-USDC-A debt ceiling. I\u2019d propose to increase PSM-USDC-A DC for another 1bn today and hopefully that should be enough until we have a poll ended and make a final larger increase. ",

While you need at least 2 digits to be noticed by crypto-twitter, those guys are fine with 2% as the risk-free rate (3-month t-bills) is 0.02%. So this is a trend that will continue for months I guess and it is great that DAI is perceived as strong enough for those activities. Failure to keep the peg would probably backlist us from institutions for months/years. While, last year, a lot of farmers were delta-hedged (using ETH to generate DAI to lend on Compound, so the price of DAI is not super important), I don\u2019t think this is the case here. Institutions are expecting DAI to be $1.  image826\u00d7541 48.7 KB  But obviously, this is not something we should be complacent with and it is good that all stakeholders look for solutions to this issue.
