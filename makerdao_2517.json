Current users are paying the highest transaction fees on the Ethereum network. So, what do we do? Do we wait it out and hope that Eth 2.0 will resolve the issue at hand and hope that it does resolve itself and allows the average user to regain confidence? Or do we seriously think about what Tarun Chitra said recently that some chains like Solana are trying to pull the Carriage with 1 Horse, but others like Eth are trying to pull the Carriage with 10, 24 Chickens? For sure, It\u2019s a complex software problem. And if we do wait, what are the odds that another Mempool Manipulation consisting of Hammerbots, Mempool Compression, and Spontaneous Stuck Transactions occurs? I would think very high, at odds of 1/5. Do we sit around and wait, or do we research as a community for other options? And as a community\u2013do we believe DAI will only live on Ethereum? And will Ethereum be the only chain to rule them All? I recently saw a twitter post by @monet-supply that he made a transaction on Cosmos for $0.01, or perhaps it was less.  Now I have never used any other chain besides Ethereum, nor am I technically qualified to ask if we should look at running the MakerDAO protocol on another chain\u2013key word: Simultaneously \u2013 but I do know a thing or two about user experience, customer retention, and product-market fit. And right now, we just aren\u2019t cutting it. Simple and plain. And when we do figure out what Chain has the most product-market fit, it will be too late. DeFi has product-market fit, but it still not approachable. My question to the community\u2013when do we start looking at running MakerDAO simultaneously on other chains? And if it\u2019s possible, would it help regulate the promise of a Stable Peg? I\u2019m not picking chains, because I don\u2019t use anything else, but Ethereum\u2013I do know that the playing field right now is tilted towards one side. And it does not favour the average Jane & Joe. In fact, it starting to feel like a Casino for the wealthy\u2026 Place your bets on Black, or Red\u2014and here we go\u2026 ",

                    "content": "I think L2 solutions that can handle the complexity of a Maker vault are still quite far out on the horizon so it\u2019s unlikely that L2 will make borrowing and interacting with MakerDAO cheaper. I do see however that token transfers should become much more practical to do off chain quite soon. I don\u2019t think just waiting for Eth2 to come around or these L2 solutions to become advanced enough to allow for large parts of MCD to run off chain is a viable alternative though. Which in my opinion only leaves us with two options:  accept that borrowing from MakerDAO will for the foreseeable future cost $10-20. deploy MCD to another more scalable chain  It\u2019s likely that a large enough user-base of MakerDAO will still accept borrowing at >100gwei gas prices but it will price out the people that want to borrow DAI 1000 at a time. There are collateral-backed stablecoin projects out there that are building on other chains. None of them are as mature as MakerDAO of course but this could become an interesting space. Acala.network is a project that\u2019s been building a system very similar to Maker\u2019s. Many chains have EVM support (that\u2019s how Aragon for example is planning on offering DAOs on their own cosmos based chain) so merely deploying the contracts would be quite easy. The infrastructure around it is where it gets harder:  Trying to make Eth-based DAI and other DAI fungible is unlikely Governance effort would almost double as these systems are largely decoupled Eth-DAI has a huge amount of support by exchanges and other integrators. That work would have to start from scratch with other chains  With current gas prices though, my gut\u2019s telling me that by now it\u2019s more of a question of when we will start having these serious discussion not if. Is it $275/ETH & 100Gwei or is it $1000/ETH & 200Gwei? Because of that, I think its only prudent to start researching how a multi-chain makerdao could look like. What RenVM will allow others to do is to at least move both collateral and DAI across different chains more freely. That doesn\u2019t lower the cost of interacting with a vault and therefore will make MakerDAO less accessible for smaller borrowers but at least it will allow interacting with assets that exist on other chains because Ethereum might be too expensive and it will allow DAI to be used in other chains.

Feeless smart contracts and free transactions are big step towards mainstream and especially industry adoption. Don\u2019t understand me wrong, I definetly see the DeFi core on Ethereum where Maker delivers the heartbeat, but why not providing the DAI as the base protocol for Open Industrial Finance (OIF)? I think it\u2019s better to bring the DAI as a L2 solution into the game than to wait and leave the OIF market to another player (EUR,\u2026). ",

The robustness of the iota protocol is still questionable, and what we really want is a layer 2 solution on ethereum, not a layer 2 solution on a different blockchain. A solution like xdai would be much more appropriate for us, and there are likely other solutions out there as well. I don\u2019t think we should add support for an entirely new blockchain until it\u2019s proven enough that there\u2019s demand on chains other than ethereum. It really does seem like cryptocurrency use cases are starting to converge on ethereum ",

I think it could make sense to have a closer look at the Optimism Virtual Machine and how it could provide some transaction cost reduction to the maker protocol. I think we all agree that the costs of $~150 to open a vault are neither helping the unbanked nor helps it to realize the original vision of building up a huge DeFi ecosystem. I really see Tether as a global competitor in the space (even with it\u2019s centralized manner) and with OMG they are moving a huge step forward. @befitsandpiper @flipflopflapdelegate ",

I think eventually DAI will run on other Chains\u2013you have NEAR protocol building the ETH-NEAR Rainbow bridge https://bit.ly/31hpIXG You also have other chains wanting to come over to Ethereum\u2013as an example, the Algorand community has proposed a Wrapped ALGO (wALGO) that allows folks over there to bring their ALGO tokens over and use in the ETH DeFi world. There\u2019s also Serum (FTX people) being built on Solana. It\u2019s an order book DEX, that will swap in less than 1 second\u2013we shall see if that is the case. They claim you\u2019ll be able to use your MetaMask on Serum for Ethereum Tokens, and you\u2019ll have the choice to swap DAI from an Ethereum to a Solana address. But of course, these are All experiments and we\u2019ll have to wait and see if it does work out. Let\u2019s not forget PolkaDot. All in all\u2013a lot of exciting innovations are happening  ",
