People have talked about how the PSM could be detrimental in the long run by \u201ctaking the meat off the bones\u201d for peg arbers. It seems to me that putting the DAI price on narrow rails would also reduce the incentive for liquidity providers to put liquidity in stablecoin pools like the Curve Y and 3Pool. If someone can swap from a stablecoin to DAI with no slippage except for the PSM spread wouldn\u2019t that drastically reduce the volume through the Curve stable pools? Are we intending the PSM to eat Curve\u2019s lunch? Or is the goal to set the PSM spread so that stablecoin liquidity pools still play an important role market making within that spread? I think that the stablecoin pools are an important sink for DAI and will help absorb DAI supply in the long run. I guess I\u2019m just questioning the wisdom of competing directly with Curve with the PSM. Maybe we get the best of both worlds by keeping the PSM spread fairly wide? I\u2019m still thinking of all the implications here so wanted to get a conversation started before we start voting on the PSM parameters. ",

It is true though that slippage will be smaller for larger trades through PSM. But gas costs on the other hand probably higher as @alexis mentioned. I think Curve liquidity will still stay there because LP yield consists of CRV yield farming rewards, which PSM doesn\u2019t offer. Also it isn\u2019t quite clear which stablecoins do we intend to include in the PSM and in what proportions. ",
