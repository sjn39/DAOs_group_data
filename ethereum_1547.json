                    "content": "Thanks for getting this discussion started, have thought about this too. One concern I have with the ERC 1077 proposal to implement these kinds of payments is the increasing number of parameters. Solidity has a hard cap on the number of stack variables, and eventually that will limit will be reached by the function\u2019s arity alone. Additionally, many of the parameters end up being 0 which seems like a code smell. A similar issue exists if you have to represent the union of all possible payment args in a struct. A simple implementation of meta payments could be a bytes format that includes a payment type and a variable number of key/value bytes32 pairs. This could exist alongside a standardized set of keys that represent common payment fields/flags. Although the format is a workaround due to solidity\u2019s lack of protobuf-style dense packing, it seems like a good future-proof way to implement meta payments. ",

So given our protocol (Ethereum Alarm Clock), we are currently using simple ETH payments and in order to enable token payments or NFT payments, we need to upgrade code and re-deploy. Looking into the future, I\u2019m pretty sure that we are yet to witness more asset types to be implemented on Ethereum, essentially forcing protocol updates on our side.
