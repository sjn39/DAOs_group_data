Therefor it should be completely obvious to everyone reading this that stability fees are required to net MakerDao a profit to balance out risk. This is a fact and arguing against it is ignorant.  So, with that in mind, MakerDao needs to now raise stability fees to their proper levels and find a different way to correct the peg.  *Note that even if stability fees were required to be negative to achieve demand balance for Dai, a portion of that negative stability fee revenue would again be required to go to MKR holders to offset the risk. The current way MakerDao is being run is flawed.  Let us now correct this. ",

Given that the PSM is posponed at the very least and that a significant amount of dai is expected to be released in the weekend I would wait to see how the peg evolves over the weekend to vote. Having said that, a 0,25% fee on ETH would significantly increase our total fees and I don\u2019t think the supply will have any significant downturn. ",

When someone is opening a Vault and mints Dai, that person is using a service that should be paid for - even if the stability fee is set to just 0.01%. The 0% stability fee also rests upon the assumption of rational actors in rational market,s and the defi craze in crypto is not even resembling rational. We might just earn some for ourselves from this hype. That is why I am constantly voting for a 0.25% stability fee, but up until now the majority of MKR holders have preferred 0%. ",

It is not an option to simply reduce the fees to 0%. Fixing a problem (the peg) in a manner that causes another problem is not a fix at all especially if the fix does not even work in the first place.  The peg is off and that is a totally separate discussion and should be addressed, but in a way that still allows for stability fees to offset risk.

Taking the example of raising ETH stability fee to 0.25%: 0.25% APR * ~200,000,000 DAI borrowed = ~500,000 DAI per year earned Not an insignificant amount, but it would take over 10 years to accumulate enough DAI earnings to cover the losses of Black Thursday at this rate.

Ideally the supply/demand curves of the market should be constantly working and not hitting the parameter limits. I think this is most clear with wBTC where we have the stability fee set to low for our debt ceiling.
