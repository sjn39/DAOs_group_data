MIP65c2 is the amended component. This amendment aims to modify the certification requirements from a RWF-001 Facilitator in MIP65. With this amendment, any community member with legal credentials can produce a \u201cLegal Structure and Governance Appropriateness Verification\u201d. The public forum post will then need to be validated by a Facilitator. The amended certification requirements would make @christiancdpetersen formally eligible to execute the verification process.
