I was reviewing a few of the disputes and I have a few comments:  There are way too many for anyone to be able to spend time making informed decisions, Making an informed decision is almost totally impossible, There are no clear guidelines for decision making, I fear that by making a public comment in support of identifying a grant as malicious or illegitimate, I am opening myself to harassment from the grantee \u2013 especially given that I would have no confidence in my opinion \u2013 so I simply choose not to remark unless it\u2019s a clear case of mistaken dispute \u2013 in other words, I can vouch. It\u2019s not at all clear who makes the actual final decision or how,  Sorry if this has been covered or discussed elsewhere.

By funding certain projects and not others the system naturally weeds out shit (because those projects die on the vine).   This is a common misconception about quadratic funding. It reflects how the contributors collectively value the recipients, not the eligibility of recipients. For quadratic funding to work as intended, it is critical that the system prevents malicious recipients from being added to the round. Otherwise this is an attack vector similar to a Sybil attack from a malicious contributor. i.e. if an attacker can add multiple malicious projects to the round, they can spread their vote weight (contributions) among each of their malicious projects and earn a disproportionate portion of the matching pool. For clr.fund, we initially used Kleros Curate for this, but have switched to a custom built registry for the last few rounds as Curate was not yet available on xDai and gas prices were cost prohibitive on mainnet. The key to any registry option is well defined acceptance and removal criteria, you can check out clr.fund\u2019s acceptance criteria here. I\u2019d recommend that the Gitcoin community come up with a similar set of documents for Gitcoin Grants. ",

                    "content": "@tjayrush I agree with you about the rules not being clear. It is definitely a complicated discussion. The issues @auryn brought up are totally valid and part of our consideration. Another issue is the separation of the Gitcoin platform (all grants) vs an ecosystem (ethereum). As we look to decentralize grants, there will be many ecosystems. Potentially any new funding pool. Issue 3 would be that if sybil was solved* the mechanism would still be susceptible to outside indirect bribery. You might think of this as the allocation of funds because of the potential for receiving airdrops rather than support for public goods. (I think of the different ecosystems somewhat like forks of the mechanism which can independently decide what is in and out in terms of grants) Issue 4 is a practical \u201cthis is how it has been done\u201d with the gitcoin team having the control. Centralization debt that needs to be paid down. The public oversight is a first big step. Building a mechanism, or using one that is out there as Auryn suggests, could be a way to bypass the gitcoin team having their hand on the controls. However, depending how the decentralized grants gets built, it might make sense to wait to do this. (This spec is being worked on with 2 proposals in the decentralize grants workstream) The reason I bring this up is there are two broad was to look at this Curation via governance -  Lets come up with policy and enforcement Governance via curation - Let the participants in each collective group curate users & grants that match their requirements. Many experiments make this a self organizing & adapting model Without knowing which it is, it is hard for Gitcoin to come up with even a starter set of guidelines for ecosystem involvement. As far as your not wanting to comment due to retaliation, some of our commenters on the public notion page are using alias accounts. I wouldn\u2019t optimize for this in the future, but it is a known issue which we are looking for better solutions which also fit into the larger picture. ",
