                    "content": " Rate Limited Flapper Hi everyone, Recent discussion to bring back the MKR burn has sparked discussion on how the existing flapper contract could be modified to rate limit the number of parallel running flap-auctions (i.e. buying MKR using surplus buffer DAI and burning the MKR). In the event of an extreme liquidation event, this would have the effect of spreading liquidations over a longer period of time instead of having them occur simultaneously, which would greatly reduce the chance of opportunistic 0-bids as seen recently.  Contract functionality: This is a simple amendment that allows Governance to limit the amount of DAI that is allowed to be auctioned off at once, accomplished by adding the following two new parameters to the flapper contract;  lid and fill, in more detail;   lid is the total value of dai allowed to be sent out to auction at once  fill is the current amount of dai that is currently in auction calling kick() increases fill  calling deal() decreases fill   Note; keepers will need to update their logic to deal() previously finished auctions in order to clear out space for new kicks().  Next Step: Setting lid  With input from @Risk, and the community, a signal request should be forthcoming to determine the correct DAI limit to be auctioned off at once.  Timeline The above functionality as per the Rate Limited Flap solution has already been coded by @hexonaut. Assuming the above signal and executive vote pass, the code would require an audit before being implemented and could be live within a matter of weeks. ",
