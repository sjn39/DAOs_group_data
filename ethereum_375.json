The work is an EEA Community Project, which is managed by OASIS. The L2 Standards WG has just released a first draft of a L2 Aliasing of EVM based Addresses specification. The WG is intending to release this specification also as an EIP. As part of the EIP process, this post is to start a discussion on this topic.  1.1 Overview The ability to deterministically derive addresses of a digital asset or an externally owned account (EOA) in EVM-based execution frameworks for L1s, L2s, and Sidechains based on an origin chain of an asset or EOA, known as address aliasing, simplifies interoperability between EVM based L1s, L2s, and Sidechains because:   It allows messages from chain A (source chain) to unambiguously address asset A (smart contract) or EOA on chain Y (target chain), if asset A or EOA exists on Chain X and on Chain Y.   It allows a user to deterministically verify the source chain of a message, and, if required, directly verify the origin chain of asset A or EOA and its state on its origin chain utilizing a canonical token list of the (message) source chain.   Note, that address-aliasing between non-EVM and EVM-based L1s, L2s, and Sidechains, and between non-EVM-based L1s, L2s, and Sidechains is out of the scope of this document. ",
