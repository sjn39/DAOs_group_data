                    "content": "This has been discussed previously in this thread however the matter became largely unimportant after the Dai supply dropped previously. Several people have expressed that it might be time to renew the discussion considering the recent Dai supply increase and bullishness of Eth. I\u2019ve created a new thread for clarity, both because the previous thread is out of date, and because many of the responses were meta-discussion around polling.   Should we increase the SCD debt ceiling? Positives  Reaching the debt ceiling introduces a confounding factor into the Dai price as demand increases cannot be matched by supply. Reaching the debt ceiling means that would-be CDP users are forced to go elsewhere to borrow Dai against Eth. This reduces income that could be used to burn MKR. Reaching the debt ceiling hinders the natural growth of Dai, and to a limited extent, the DeFi ecosystem.  Negatives  Increasing the debt ceiling increases the maximum severity of the peg breaking downwards in the event of a massive printing of Dai. If the system were to be proved to have a smart contract issue, more funds would be at risk.   Please try to think of additional points to add to these lists. I\u2019ll add any I see expressed in the replies to this post. I have described the process for the progression of this (and future) proposals here. Please feel free to provide feedback, the process is still being developed, and it is open to change. We\u2019ll start with an initial sentiment poll to determine whether there is a general agreement to increase the SCD debt ceiling from its current value of 100 million. Please use this week to signal and to propose and discuss specific options. If we have a majority (>50%) for change after 1 week has passed, I will add a poll to gather consensus on any specific options proposed. This initial sentiment poll will remain open throughout the process.     Yes, we should increase the SCD debt ceiling. No, we should not increase the SCD debt ceiling.

Tl;dr, debt ceiling is a function of how much risk we can tolerate, given our ability to absorb bad losses. Eth\u2019s propensity to crash is quite low. It\u2019s likelihood to crash straight to 0 is even lower. So for a given amount of Dai outstanding, we\u2019re unlikely to absorb significant losses. I.e., if the debt ceiling is $200, something very unlikely would have to happen for us to absorb a $100 million loss. And even then, MKR could probably absorb it. In short, moving the debt ceiling up in 10 million increments leaving a buffer of 10-20 million is the safe approach IMO. ",

Between this thread and the previous one, there were several suggestions for paths forward. This next poll will last for two weeks, and please remember that:  You are able to vote for more than one option in the poll below. Please vote for anything you would vote for in an on-chain poll.  First lets go into detail on the suggested options.  Option 1 - An immediate one-time increase of the SCD debt ceiling by 20 million Dai, to a total of 120 million Dai.  Mostly self explanatory. This was suggested in both this and the previous thread and had good support previously.   Option 2 -  An immediate one-time increase of the SCD debt ceiling by 50 million Dai, to a total of 150 million Dai.  This was suggested in the previous thread and gathered some level of support. This does increase risk more than Option 1.   Option 3 - A commitment to increase the SCD debt ceiling by 10 million whenever the total supply of Dai comes within 10 million of the current debt ceiling. This commitment will last until the launch of MCD or until explicitly revoked by governance.  This will solve the problem/risk of hitting the debt ceiling until the launch of MCD. This option requires action(s) by the Interim Governance Facilitator (or the Interim Risk Team?) at unspecified future times. There is some complexity as to the interpretation of \u2018when the dai supply is within 10 million of the ceiling.\u2019 Do spikes count? Any ambiguity can be discussed, but would ultimately be left to the IGF or the IRT to decide.       Option 1 - An immediate one-time increase of the SCD debt ceiling by 20 million Dai, to a total of 120 million Dai. Option 2 - An immediate one-time increase of the SCD debt ceiling by 50 million Dai, to a total of 150 million Dai. Option 3 - A commitment to increase the SCD debt ceiling by 10 million each time the total supply of Dai comes within 10 million of the current debt ceiling, as detailed above. Abstain - I just want to see the results. Abstain - I disagree with the poll option. Abstain - I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgeable on the subject. Abstain - I have a different objection. Abstain - I have no opinion.     0 voters      Once again, you can vote for multiple options! Vote for all that you would vote for in an on-chain poll.  ",

If you are not voting for Option 1 or Option 3, but you would like to see a debt ceiling increase in some form, consider voting for it to increase consensus. The golden rule is: Vote for any option that you would vote for in an on-chain poll against no change at all.  Not wanting to be that guy, but there is also the possibility of active sibyl accounts in the initial poll. Several people have voted who have no previous forum activity. While I\u2019m not suggesting that this invalidates the poll (or even that these actually are alt-accounts) it is important to remember that this is not a secure voting system. ",

This number could be then reported weekly at the risk call.

Once we have a set of historical data recorded, we can meaningfully measure how we relatively compare. I will give you a theoretical interpretation of it. At $100 million, we are at ~5% of market liquidity, and with total eth market cap north of $20 Billion, and avg daily volume of 5 to 10 Billion.  we are 0.05% of the ethereum market cap, I would call it \u201ca drop in the bucket\u201d. If we were to liquidate all the locked eth today, you may notice a temporary spike in gas prices, and slight down tick in the price.  I would conclude the debt ceiling at current levels is more of risk, because if we hit it, then SCD will rapidly go above peg and that is the real risk we should be concerned about. In a real world scenario though, things are more complicated, and it will depends on the reason for liquidation. For example if we are liquidating due to \u201ccontagion\u201d where everyone else has to liquidate too, and it\u2019s headline news, and cause of a bug that affects EVERY ethereum smart contract, then the theoretical analysis above would not apply. Thus, it is very easy to model under \u201cnormal\u201d market conditions. ",

                    "content": "The latest poll has now closed. I would have liked to talk about this in the latest governance meeting, but the announcement of MCD (quite rightly) took priority. So with that said, here\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at: There is a 56% consensus to Option 3. This is the only option to receive majority support (even if only barely.)  In addition, the initial general poll is sitting at 77% consensus that we should increase the debt-ceiling in some form. With these results I think it is reasonable to move on-chain with Option 3 versus Status Quo. Here are some thoughts:  I would have liked to gather greater consensus that 56%, but given this is the second time the issue has come up, and given that MCD is launching in just over a month anyway, I don\u2019t think that is a reason not to proceed. The Interim Risk Team (@cyrus) has also voted for Option 3. 43 and 30 voters for each of these respective polls is more than we have seen previously. This is encouraging. Some voters do not have much previous activity on this forum. If you are new, I\u2019d encourage you to take time to read in more detail, and comment or ask questions. You are welcome to vote, but if you are new there is a danger you will be mistaken for a sybil account if voting is your only form of participation.   Moving Forward Option 3 comes with two questions to be answered, specifically:  Who is responsible for setting up on-chain polls to adjust the debt-ceiling when appropriate? How long does the supply need to be within the 10 million of the debt-ceiling before action is taken?  For the sake of efficiency I would suggest that the answers to these are:  The Interim Governance Facilitator (@rich.brown) Whenever the supply spikes to within 10 million of the current debt-ceiling, even if only for a single block.  I suggest continuing under these assumptions unless people object to them, so my suggestion is that this poll moves on-chain in the form below:  Title: Should we keep at least a 10million Dai buffer in the debt ceiling until the launch of MCD? Description: An on-chain executive vote will be created by the Interim Governance Facilitator at any time the difference between the Dai Supply and the Debt Ceiling is less than 10 million, (even if only for one block.) The Interim Governance Facilitator should aim to create this executive vote within a week of the difference falling below 10 million. Like any executive vote, the passing of each individual debt-ceiling increase will require the ratification of MKR Token Holders. This mandate will expire upon the \u2018official\u2019 launch of MCD (as determined by the Maker Foundation), regardless of which date this falls upon. Options: Yes/No  Note that @rich.brown is still at devcon and that there is a lot going on at the moment, he also may have concerns that I haven\u2019t considered. Hopefully we\u2019ll see action on this over the next couple of weeks. ",

This represents one of the largest SF moves in recent memory and could result in a significant shift in secondary lending platform usage as people move to refinance at more attractive rates. The impact on Maker ecosystem and potential for minting of additional Dai is uncertain (I\u2019ll let @cyrus chime in here with some thoughts) but it seems prudent to move this proposal through the system prior to the launch of MCD. Next Steps The plan is to enter this proposal into a governance portal poll on Monday, October 28, 2019 at 4 PM UTC. It will live for 3 days and will move to an executive on Friday, November 1, 2019 at 4 PM UTC if the community votes \u2018Yes\u2019. The Stability Fee executive is scheduled for that Friday, so the new vote introduced on that day will include a new Stability Fee with new Debt Ceiling Thresholding Plan bundled in. Alternatively, we could decide to initiate this poll before Monday. I\u2019m hesitant to alter the general cadence of governance unless the community feels there is an emergency to be dealt with. If we initiate a poll outside of the regular schedule we may not get enough eyes on it, people have lives and not everyone can monitor the ecosystem outside of business hours\u2026 Parting thoughts  The -4% SF change was initiated by a single voter with 1,993.49 MKR. Another reminder that \u201cif people think their vote doesn\u2019t matter, the system will be controlled by people who think theirs does\u201d  The poll as written above states this plan will \u201c\u2026expire upon the \u2018official\u2019 launch of MCD\u201d. I\u2019m not comfortable with \u201cinterpreting\u201d the spirit of the forum polls, so we will have to re-enact this process again after the launch of MCD if we want to continue this method of thresholding.
