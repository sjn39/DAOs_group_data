                    "content": " Unified Auctions UI Release v0.6.0 - January 28th 2022 Version: v0.6.0 Name: Bonhams During the market crash, we came to the realization that the current state of cluttered UIs for different use cases is a mess for the auction user and causes confusion. We are working hard to unify all functionality with one UI. However, following some short-term measures with the core aim to provide users with the best possible guidance: The landing page of the Unified Auctions UI provides an entry point for the auction user and lists different services relevant for each auction type.  Unified_Auctions_Page3104\u00d71974 507 KB  The Unified Auctions UI currently supports flashloan based auction participation but does not enable users to bid on an auction with their own DAI yet. Hence, we implemented a note for these users pointing to the old Liquidation Portal.  Liq_Portal_Tooltip1364\u00d7502 58.1 KB  We have coordinated with @dux-core-unit, and they will add a banner to the old Liquidations Portal, to inform users of the Unified Auctions UI and its functionality to engage in auctions via flashloan. Besides these actions, we also pushed progress on the development of the Unified Auctions UI. We made a large step to fully streamline the onboarding process of new collateral types to the UI which is currently our focus topic. And as always, improved the overall UX with several adjustments. Since we are working on building a UI that bundles all functionality, this update will be named Bonhams. This auction house was formed by the merger of Bonhams & Brooks and Phillips Son & Neale.  A closer look at changes and new features  Streamlining the collateral onboarding process As stated in our Cu\u2019s MIP39, one key strategy is to have automations and streamlined processes in place to shorten the time-to-market for new requirements like the onboarding of a new collateral type. Based on discussions that we had in the onchain collateral management stakeholder alignment calls, this topic gained even more urgency due to upcoming onboarding of further collateral types. Hence, our current focus topic is to streamline the onboarding of new collateral types. On this quest in the past, we faced some issues with dai.js. It prevented us from dynamically adding (or removing) supported collateral types, and the fact that collaterals are hard-coded across several dai.js plugins made it hard to establish an efficient and dynamic process. Given that and due to some other limitations we decided to move away from dai.js in this sprint and no longer rely on the library for wallet connection, fee estimation, auth, auction execution and auction fetching. Quick outlook: We want to push this streamlining even further and plan to add dynamic support of relevant exchange-callee contracts in the next sprint.  UX improvements We\u2019ve heard the feedback on our last release notes and changed the default network to mainnet. Good point to emphasize: Feedback on the UI is welcome. Other than that, we introduced an animation for number changes. The value we see in this little change is not that it looks more fancy, but rather to give the user an easier understanding which KPIs are changing on certain events, like a price drop.  Devops As part of the open-sourcing, we secured out repository so that a malicious attacker/ cannot:  leak credentials, force resource usage (hence increasing money spent and blocking development)  To do so, we\u2019ve disallowed forks from executing CI pipelines and made sure that our CI system can only be used by organization members - see a bad actor trying to destroy our code base in this pull request (PR). Forks can still run tests for their PRs if they\u2019re accepted by an organization member. In addition, we\u2019ve investigated RPC caching to reduce infura key spend and make a keeper implementation feasible. Infura RPC responses should be cached (for a tiny amount of time) to not have 400 clients request thing X 400 times in 1 second, but rather 1 client requesting thing X and then 399 clients re-using this result (within the same second). We came up with a working nginx based caching solution, see this PR for the proof-of-concept implementation. In the next sprint we will move towards a full implementation of this.  Open Source We have heard the question whether our work is open source or not a couple of times. Yes, it is: Feel free to check our repo: GitHub - sidestream-tech/unified-auctions-ui: Unified MakerDAO auctions And if you want to you can even check out our continuously deployed staging environment to follow our weekly progress + weekly failures that lead to staging downtime  Auctions UI Just to emphasize this once again: It\u2019s a staging environment!

Since this is the first update this year, it is named after the world\u2019s first auction house. So let us introduce the Stockholms Auktionsverk update. Biggest accomplishment: We added support for the Goerli network to our UI. Therefore, we had to deploy relevant exchange callee contracts to Goerli to facilitate this process. Additionally, there were some necessary clean-ups to our code base, mainly to make the code more accessible. We have also laid the foundation for additional services: A new dashboard page displays auction related figures and parameters, which we will extend in the future. Finally, we automated our CI/CD pipeline further.  A closer look at changes and new features  Support Goerli  Goerli810\u00d7422 17.5 KB  As support for Kovan testnet is slowly deprecated, we decided to keep up with the times and added support for Goerli testnet to our UI. Doing so, we want to ensure proper testing scenarios for our UIs in the future. Additionally, it gives us a solid foundation to have an auction-keeper implementation for Goerli in the future. In the process, for the first time we deployed the relevant exchange callee contracts (another internal milestone ) to the testnet and were able to execute some auctions on Goerli (see here)  Auction dashboard  Dashboard2878\u00d7925 177 KB  No sprint with at least some value-add to the existing UI: We introduced a dedicated dashboard page that, from now on, will become the go-to place for auction related data, insights, and parameters. In the first iteration, we added a table that provides the current price on Uniswap as well as step & cut parameters for each collateral type currently supported by the UI. The idea is to extend this page step by step in the future with for example data on past auctions etc. You are welcome to have a glance: Auctions UI  Devops For infrastructure work in this iteration, we set up a continuously deployed staging environment. It increases our testing capabilities and quality. We also improved the way we handle secrets within our images. Using chamber (by segment) directly within the Dockerfiles allows for safe secret injection at runtime.  Open Source We want to be as transparent as possible in what we do. So if these bi-weekly release updates are not enough, or you want to have a closer look at our code base, you are more than invited to come by and check our repo: GitHub - sidestream-tech/unified-auctions-ui: Unified MakerDAO auctions ",
