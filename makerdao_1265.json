                    "content": " Signal Request: LP our AAVE and ENS with ETH on Uniswap v3 This post gauges community sentiment regarding LPing our AAVE and ENS in the treasury with ETH. $ENS MakerDAO qualified for an airdrop of ~46.3k ENS tokens late last year. Since then, various discussions have happened regarding what to do with these tokens. Some discussions:  Using airdrop to subsidize MKR holder onboarding to ENS  Using airdrop to cover costs  Ultimately, community sentiment was that it would look unfavorably on Maker if we were to sell airdrops and might disqualify us from further partnerships and other airdrops. So for the last 6+ months, the ENS (worth about $400k as of 6/15/2022) has just been sitting idle in our treasury. This post is to collect sentiment regarding LPing this ENS with an equivalent amount of ETH, which will be purchased using the Surplus Buffer. Proposal: The liquidity provided would be a Uniswap v3, full range LP for the 0.3% fee level. The rationale is:  Protocol: Uniswap due to it being the defi leader and where most of ENS liquidity is. LP Pairs: ENS/ETH due to the being the most liquid paid for ENS 0.3% Fee: Most TVL pair for ENS/ETH Full Range LP: This would be a passive yield aggregation position that wouldn\u2019t require much monitoring. Extensive research has been done to show for these situations, V3 is better than V2 and full range yields better than concentrated ranges.  Looking at historical returns, we would have received 27.36% APR on the LP token due to fee accrual with the example (super wide) range.  $AAVE Maker\u2019s treasury currently holds ~1.47k atkAAVE tokens as well. These tokens were received due to liquidity incentives provided by Aave (which have recently been turned off), from our  Aave D3M. This equates to almost $90k (on 6/15/2022). This post is to also collect sentiment regarding LPing this AAVE with an equivalent amount of ETH, which will be purchased using the Surplus Buffer. Proposal: The liquidity provided would be a Uniswap v3, full range LP for the 0.3% fee level. The rationale is:  Protocol: Uniswap due to it being the defi leader and where most of AAVE liquidity is. LP Pairs: AAVE/ETH due to the being the most liquid paid for AAVE 0.3% Fee: Most TVL pair for AAVE/ETH Full Range LP: This would be a passive yield aggregation position that wouldn\u2019t require much monitoring. Extensive research has been done to show for these situations, V3 is better than V2 and full range yields better than concentrated ranges.  Looking at historical returns, we would have received 86.46% APR on the LP token due to fee accrual with the example (super wide) range.  Overall: Utilizing these idle tokens in our treasury would help generate significant amounts of yield in the future. Additionally, and maybe more importantly, this would be a great PR headline for Maker with respect to ENS and AAVE as instead of dumping, we\u2019d be adding utilization and deeper liquidity for their users. This opens the door favorably to future airdrops as well as further partnerships. Pros:  Utilize and earn yields on currently dormant treasury assets Create a strong PR and image for providing value to different protocols, could incentivize future collaborations and partnerships Subject to possible positive price movements of ~$500k worth of ETH (<0.6% of current 82m surplus buffer)  Cons:  Subject to possible negative price movements of ~$500k worth of ETH (<0.6% of current 82m surplus buffer) Subject to potential IL from ENS & AAVE price deviations from ETH  Polls:    ENS: Should the protocol buy an equivalent amount of ETH and provide liquidity to the Uniswap ENS/ETH pool utillizing treasury tokens?  Option 1: Yes, LP into ENS/ETH Option 2: No, Keep as original Option 3: Abstain     0 voters        AAVE: Should the protocol buy an equivalent amount of ETH and provide liquidity to the Uniswap AAVE/ETH pool utillizing treasury tokens?  Option 1: Yes, LP into AAVE/ETH Option 2: No, continue holding AAVE in treasury Option 3: Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps: This signal closes on June 30, 2022; if any LP pairs are supported, the measure will go to an onchain poll, followed by an executive if the poll is successful.

If you can hold the LP token long enough such that LP fees plus incentives are greater than the IL, then you\u2019re better off LPing than holding the two assets outright. In this case, yes, we would be taking on ~500k of extra ETH exposure, leaving us subject to both the positive and negative price impacts of that amount of ETH. Whereas the other half (ENS or AAVE), we are already be subject to the price fluctuations due to just holding in our treasury. As for your point on a decent amount of work and expertise, the actual act of LPing is pretty simple. However, technical implementation requested from PECU. It is true that if this goes through, Makerburn treasury might have some extra front end work to track the assets, apologies in advance. ",

Let\u2019s look at the ENS/ETH pair, and assume the 27.36% trading fee APR. In order for there to be 27.36% IL across the pairs, there needs to be an over 530% change in the RATIO between the two assets (~538% change) for this 27% IL to happen.  Let\u2019s look at ETH and ENS, assuming ETH = $1100, and ENS = $8. ETH needs to increase to almost $6000 (~$5915) while ENS stays at $8 for there to be 27% IL. Similar, ETH could stay at $1100, and ENS would have to skyrocket to $43 for this level of IL  Do I think in one years time, ETH could change 530% and skyrocket to $6000 (or plummet to $200\u2026 plz no lol)? Yeah, I think there\u2019s a decent chance. However, in the case of either extreme, I\u2019d be willing to bet a lott of money that ENS would also appreciate or depreciate significantly respectively. The case is even more extreme for Aave. To surpass the estimated 86.46% trading fee APR, the ratio between the two pairs would have to change by over 10,000% (100x+). Granted, these calculations are at a discrete point in time right now and don\u2019t account for dilation with respect to time as we progress through the year, but I think my point is rather clear about there having to be significant deviation between the two pairs to have such a large IL hit. Ultimately, I realize this solution isn\u2019t perfect, but I do think strongly it is better than what we have right now. I know you mentioned exploring other options and would love to hear any and all that you may have! BTW, IL calculations were made using this calc: Impermanent Loss Calculator ",

Imho neither ENS nor AAVE qualify for such an endeavor for ENS specifically I think it is - like MKR - heavily undervalued and - if I am right - we would be better of with just holding it until markets stop beeing irrational    There are three other options:  sell it: I would be fine with doing this with AAVE though it is just a bet that we get a decent price right now. I would totally not be fine with doing this with ENS, since I still think this is a special DAO-to-DAO thing we should not abandon for greed borrow against it: locking ENS/AAVE as collateral to borrow DAI from it to\u2026 do something with it\u2026 sounds more reasonable although we might end up in getting liquidated and we lose the collateral if the price tanks even more do nothing: speaking of focus - this is not something we are going to get massive income from.

Can you please share your data source, I am curious if the APY stated accounts for IL, it sounds way too high to me ETH will likely outperform tokens, which means this LP positions would effectively be buying more ENS and AAVE  Amounts of these tokens - ENS $389k and AAVE $86k. Even if we actually get a positive outcome, this is too small to waste time on it We hold stkAAVE, not AAVE, which means we first need to make a withdrawal request and then withdraw after some amount of time, requiring at least two transactions, just to get stkAAVE into AAVE. Currently we are getting 9.7% APY on the stkAAVE, so this asset is already making a good return I think this whole SR is a waste of time considering potential additional returns and the fact that there are basically the same or very similar proposals going on right now. This is the same as Makershire and similar proposals by Strategic Finance to invest. Why do we need a special SR for these two tokens?  ",

Addressing your other options:  Sell it: As discussed, this was shot down before Borrow against it: This is a pretty interesting. Some initial concerns are 1: where borrow against Aave?; 2: 50% max ltv for ENS borrow, seems capital inefficient and somethings that we actually would need to actively manage for a rather small amount\u2026 real questions of \u201cis it worth it\u201d arise.

No one here is a professional asset manager. No offense to SF, but I don\u2019t think any of these yield initiatives is a good idea. They shouldn\u2019t be trying to learn how to be portfolio analysts or managers on the DAO\u2019s money and with no prior experience. That\u2019s just not their job. There\u2019s too much chance for us to get out over our skiis. Beyond just plopping some tokens into a safe lending protocol for yield, I think we need to stop pushing this kind of asset management stuff. ",

The actual link for the V3 analysis/trading APRs done above is link in the forum post, called: \u201cHistoric returns for Uniswap V3.\u201d Yes, we\u2019d have to unstake from stkAAVE, however the LP aprs are significantly higher. I would argue 9.7% with stkAAVE is not that great to justify the risk/volatility of Aave. Not sure I agree with your arguement about waste of time as the actual process of putting it on is rather minimal. And we need a SR for these two is because it was not added or covered in Makershire/others.  ",

I am strongly in favor of holding other assets, engaging in associated metagovernance for both risk management of those assets and achieving MakerDAO strategic objectives with other protocols, while also deploying the assets for income via a Treasury Management function. However, at this time the community is not aligned on some threshold questions, and does not have human resources organized to implement the above. It is a dilution of focus and cart-before-horse to move forward in any narrow direction to execute management of particular assets without first (or at the same time) addressing the big picture inline with the overall objectives. This strategic work is well underway via a number of threads and polls up for vote. I\u2019d love to see the analysis here happening in an integrated way rather than as a standalone signal. Co-sign these other comments.     rema:  This is the same as Makershire and similar proposals by Strategic Finance to invest. Why do we need a special SR for these two tokens?       ultraschuppi:  do nothing: speaking of focus - this is not something we are going to get massive income from. So why even bother fiddling with it.       CodeKnight:  The majority of LPs lose money. LPing takes a decent amount of work and expertise to do well, so I would rather keep as is or sell.   ",

Looks like Makershire and anything to do with investing by the DAO will be turned down unless the DAO passes something to create a treasury these discussions are moot.   IF the DAO does changes its mind and finally decides to create a treasury to manage and build DAO assets (I have been advocating for this for YEARS now) then and only then can and should the DAO revisit the questions of what to \u2018invest\u2019 in.   As someone who already is in the v3 ENS/ETH pair and have worked v2 and v3 solutions.  A good article on how 0-infinity v3 is better than v2 came to me from a great source on this.    When Uniswap v3 returns more fees for passive LPs  I can say two things.  Had I sold ETH and ENS for cash I would have done better, BUT there are some things I have a much longer time frame and view of.  The v3 ETH/ENS I personally have is one of my best performers.   Gnosis treasury via karpatkey also has a chunk there too.    The problem with pairing correlated assets is you can literally lose your shirt, but since they are correlated you have a higher chance they stay in your ratio/price bands.   Even so v3 is a tricky beast so you better really understand what you are doing there, tax implications can be significant as well.   I abstained because at least as how voting sits currently I don\u2019t believe governance is going to approve any expenditures along these lines.  Something else I am going to say.  Maker is sitting on a good chunk of cash and while hard to think about it, the time to buy is when everyone else is selling. ",

My own research based on actually using the things is that v2 and v3 both have their pros and cons.   Like my own experience suggesting token-stables do better than token-token (like token-ETH) because you get better arb opportunities with Token-stables than token-token. I simply referred to the article because it was interesting to even see \u2018some\u2019 solid research on the topic.  Do you know of any others or are you speaking from your own experience? ",

So LPing \u201ccomplexity\u201d is thus not very meaningful either. The meaningful risk here is further downward price pressure on the $eth that would have to be purchased.
