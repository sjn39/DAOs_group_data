As shared in past updates, SES is using lessons learned from the first year of operations and refocusing the incubation program on preparing and producing facilitator candidates (vs. incubating entire core unit teams). Supporting this process is Maker Academy, an incubating core unit that will graduate under the current structure of the incubation program. The team are currently working on introducing a best-in-class educational platform, purpose-built for MakerDAO. Leveraging this collaboration, SES aims to produce  educational content that will not only improve our incubator, but also reduce MakerDAO\u2019s barriers to entry once it\u2019s publicly made available.

The team\u2019s focus has shifted from technical development of their solution to preparing for their governance campaign. Learn more about their agent and scenario based testing infrastructure by watching this recording of their Core Unit Overview.  Maker Academy is deep in development, both of their educational platform and content. They are making progress towards releasing their platform\u2019s beta for community feedback. The Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit (LTS) presented their Core Unit Overview on last week\u2019s SES Weekly Status Update.
