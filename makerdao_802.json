                    "content": "*This is my view as a Delegate and does not represent Maker Growth\u2019s. The Maker protocol is run by various Core Units that work hard to secure and expand the Maker ecosystem. And many are well compensated as well as given sufficient resources. Now, there might be some Core Units that do not have enough, and in such situations, asking for an increase in budget is reasonable. However, we are seeing more and more requests for an increase in budget and new Core Unit onboarding applications with large budgets that I fear are overwhelming the Maker community. This is especially critical as the profit for the Maker protocol has been declining dramatically. Each budget modification request should be examined carefully, but in reality it has been difficult because: 1. Too many budgets to review -Even right now there are more than 5 budgets that the Maker community needs to review and likely more. This dilutes attention from the community as we have limited time. 2. Whether directly or indirectly, the community is pressured regarding the budget decision -I heard several feedbacks that It is difficult to challenge the budget especially for existing Core Units because of many factors including:   Especially for Core Unit contributors, they work closely with other Core Units, so they don\u2019t want to create potential \u201chostile\u201d situations.   Core Units are experts that are on boarded by the Maker community, which means the community will give Core Units the benefit of the doubt if they request additional budget because they are \u201ccrucial for Maker to scale\u201d   In addition, some also shared that it\u2019s difficult to assess whether such an increase is high or not. For example, if a Core Unit wants to add a new contributor. Is his/her salary high or within the industry standard?   Considering there\u2019s no risk for Core Units to ask for the raise, unless there are changes in the process or the community sentiment, we will likely see more such requests and ultimately will undermine the Maker protocol\u2019s budget for truly needed initiatives. In addition, we have seen that returning unused budget in reality hasn\u2019t been respected as much as the community wished. So here are some suggestions that we should discuss: 1. Implement hard freeze for increase in budget request for a long time frame -For example, a Core Unit once they have an approved budget should not be allowed to ask for an increase in budget request for at least 6 months or 1 year. While this might hinder some flexibility, it also encourages Core Units to do more with less. 2. Limits the number of Budget Reviews per cycle -For example, we can set a cap whether that\u2019s 1 or 2 instead of too many to allow the Maker community to fully discuss and examine the budget increase request. I believe the SES can also help by encouraging only a limited number of potential CUs to be presented. 3. Require or at least encourage the budget submissions to also provide market rates. -For example, what\u2019s the market rate for a potential new contributer\u2019s role? If it\u2019s a budget for a new service, how much would this service cost if it was a third-party professional company? Even for major companies like Apple, they don\u2019t build everything by themselves as it\u2019s sometimes more efficient to use partners instead. 4. Rethinking the structure of Core Units. -Currently, Maker Core Unit is quite heavy with both budget and MKR vesting. There are a lot of benefits to allowing a more flexible approach especially with services that are more likely to be temporary. Closing: This budget issue we are facing is actually a common problem that even has a term for such phenomenons: \u201cParkinson\u2019s law\u201d but I believe we can work together to help to mitigate this issue.

Coupled with slowing Dai supply growth and shrinking non-stablecoin collateral, it\u2019s not something that we can afford to ignore. I won\u2019t pretend to have a perfect solution for controlling expenses, and I think what you\u2019ve proposed so far is a great start. I\u2019d like to add two suggestions:  Each Core Unit should have to continually justify its existence by tying its cost to the explicit benefit it will ultimately generate or the costs it will ultimately save (as any business unit in a traditional company would need to do on a periodic basis). To use simple examples, the Risk CU can easily point to the anticipated stability fees the applications that it reviews will produce. Growth can point to the anticipated Dai demand and/or earnings from various integrations (e.g. the D3M). The DAO should have a global budget that is approved by MKR holders and all CUs should need to fit their expenses into this global budget. It\u2019s frankly unheard of to not have this in any organization; even fiscally inept governments do this.  By controlling expenses and focusing on productivity, Maker will exist on a strong foundation for which to attack the next bull market. ",

We in SF agree and think there are several reasons contributing to this problem:   We have outgrown MIP40 - while it served it\u2019s initial purpose, it is much too broad and needs more structure so DAO members can more easily assess budget requests a. SF will be proposing a revised MIP40   The existing expense reporting is highly fragmented and not standardized, making it extremely challenging even for those who are full-time to assess how CUs are spending their budget a. SF is collaborating with SES to standardize this process and provide best practices, but it will require CU buy-in   Lack of performance evaluations and accountability for CUs - this should be a part of any budget increase request a. SF is collaborating with SES and delegates to launch a qualitative and quantitative review process   In the interim, we wanted to provide the below analysis summarizing the financial impact of the most recent budget requests. I would note that this excludes any incubated core units (Chaos Labs, Talent, Academy, Lending Incubator, Lending Oversight) which will increase costs further if successful passing through Governance.  image973\u00d7397 18.8 KB      g_dip:  The DAO should have a global budget that is approved by MKR holders and all CUs should need to fit their expenses into this global budget.

It seems like that got lost in the \u201chow to DAO\u201d bit.   (Somewhat random quote, not specifically in reaction to @twblack88 ) I\u2019m all for transparency, KPIs and ROI numbers where they make sense; indeed this is why we\u2019re creating the performance dashboard. However, one thing that we\u2019ll need to accept is that not everything is measurable as a direct ROI. This is exactly where vision and strategy matter: some activities need to be supported because they fit in the direction that Maker wants to go and they make logically sense, even if the impact is difficult to measure. We can still try to evaluate these activities through general industry and academic research, but there are limits to this: we should not fall into the trap of believing that the outcome will be a number that turns green or red and gives a simple answer. For example, the impact of many outreach activities, investment in security, etc., may be very hard to measure directly. And this becomes increasingly more difficult as we\u2019re considering long-term effects (or the absence thereof.) One of the things I\u2019m afraid of is that a too narrow focus on cost cutting will kill the project in the long run. Yes, Maker needs to spend responsibly, but we also need to dare to dream big and place some bets. It is a matter of finding a balance. In any case, we can do much better than we are doing today when it comes to systematic performance evaluation. ",

We need a cohesive framework to evaluate performance, and my offhand comment about P&L is one good way (certainly doesn\u2019t cover everything).

This might be the most valuable artifact to work towards: what framework is Maker holistically choosing to set its teams up for success?

Or consider the SB vs Burner debate. We are currently increasing the SB because it is an important reserve in case of trouble, but at the same time, it seems, we are not paying enough attention to controlling and keeping the expenditure side under control.  In the meantime, we need to stop the Burning mechanism, the only one that actually exists to compensate MKR owners for having their skin in the game. There are probably many people here who understand the principles of economics much better than I do, but even I am struck by the parallels that spark knife-edge debates between representatives of different schools of economics when discussing public budgets. Some argue that in slowing economic conditions, austerity must be applied: raising taxes, reducing investment, etc., in short, austerity. Others argue that we need to finance investment, including through borrowing, and give tax breaks to people to spend more and thus boost the economy. Which is the right way? I think the eternal rule applies here: well, it depends on\u2026 What depends in our case is what we have to find out.  I think it\u2019s important to have different perspectives because that shapes the direction of action. But the fact is that Maker\u2019s revenues have been on a rollercoaster lately, we have to be careful. ",
