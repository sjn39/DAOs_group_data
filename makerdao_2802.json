Could those projects be collateralized or partially collateralized by the client?

We would need separate construction management firms to estimate the final value of the project. I don\u00b4t want to sound harsh just looking it as the very worst case scenario (no intention to offend anyone)   What are our tax implications in the US? Just by being in delaware are we exempted from taxes when loaning out for operations outside of delaware?   In the security agreement we have the rights to the assets, most of the assets in themselves are related to the loans issued and are subject to the question 2.

It really depends on who \u201cwe\u201d are in this context? Will a Maker Representative (that has executed an NDA), the answer is yes. Without an NDA, the answer is no (unless the tenant is a publicly traded company). That said, the role of the Maker Representative isn\u2019t to evaluate risk, per se. It is to be the informational proxy between LendCo and the DAO. However your point is well taken that members of the risk team, may and probably should also execute an NDA to be able to review financial statements.     mario:  Could those projects be collateralized or partially collateralized by the client?   By the client, I assume you mean the tenant. Assuming so, no, they will not collateralize the transaction more than with their lease.     mario:  At the end of the process it all sums up to the project\u00b4s market value being greater than the debt, how do we ensure that there is no agreement between developer, client & the construction management firm to inflate the projects cost (mainly land value) cash in on the difference & walk away?   All transactions require LendCo to rely on an independent appraisal (from firms like BBG) explicitly to avoid that scenario. And if somehow that did happen, LendCo would immediately start litigation against the principals for fraud (which is a felony).     mario:  What are our tax implications in the US?   The tax implications for LendCo are straight forward. It has to pay tax on its income w/ in the Untied States. For the Trust, it is a work-in-progress where we are planning to utilize an off-shore structure for tax optimization.     mario:   Just by being in delaware are we exempted from taxes when loaning out for operations outside of delaware?    It doesnt matter which State it is in.     mario:  In the security agreement we have the rights to the assets, most of the assets in themselves are related to the loans issued and are subject to the question 2. Will there be capital contributions (cash) from lendco 1 from which we can deduct in case of liquidation assuming the market value of the project is below the debt and the 70/30 ratio?   Correct. That is the reason why LendCo has an equity requirement per transaction. The maker facility in basically lending at 70% (in the case of construction) and getting first position on the security interest. ",

The question about if a Maker Representative wants to review is more a question of \u201cwhy not\u201d\u2026 and also being constrained by the underlying objective of oversight and ensuring compliance with the underlying credit agreement. In that context, a valid counter-point would be, does a Maker Representative \u201cneed\u201d to see the personal financial statement of the principal of a borrowco (not the company the person) to see that the credit agreement requirements (between LendCo and the Trust) were met? The answer is probably not, since it is LendCo\u2019s discretion what guarantees (personal vs completion) are in place between borrowco and lendco. Just having the PFS is more than sufficient to demonstrate that LendCo is collecting relevant data. What would matter that a Maker Representative should care about is that a loan agreement also included the guarantee, not specifically the private data thereof\u2026 ",

Welcome to another call of the RWA working group. In this case, I\u2019m joined by Matthew Rabinowitz and of course S\u00e9bastien Derivaux and, at this point, 11 more participants willing to bridge the fascinating world of crypto with the RWA. Hopefully we can get things moving today. Today, we have Matthew Rabinowitz, who is going to be speaking about the Maker Representative. He posted a very interesting forum thread. Basically, he wants to find one or ideally more Maker Representatives that can serve us as a bridge. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   6S/Maker: Maker representative  Calling community members to be a Maker Representative - Forum Thread  Matthew Rabinowitz Presentation 01:45 Intro1030\u00d7575 140 KB What is needed?1032\u00d7576 111 KB How is this similar to an &quot;auditor&quot;1026\u00d7580 144 KB Why is this important1033\u00d7574 128 KB Maker Rep can execute NDA1030\u00d7578 98.2 KB Reporting1031\u00d7576 115 KB Reporting II1032\u00d7578 131 KB Graph1030\u00d7575 193 KB Graph I1026\u00d7567 110 KB Contact1036\u00d7582 199 KB Discussion  13:10 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you walk us through an example? Let\u2019s say someone wants to do some construction. They would contact 6s Capital, potentially you need to approve the loan, then you would come with that loan to Maker to get Dai. These Maker Representatives, where would they fit and what would the process be? 15:35 - MakerMan: I want to make a point about one thing you mentioned. If there is an issue, the Maker Representative could only recommend a lowering of the debt ceiling, I don\u2019t know if Maker Governance would give us the ability to do it. My first question is, you are going to approach banks to do this, who is the person that oversees the financial stuff? What do you put up with a bank to be able to get a loan? I want to see how this works with the bank to understand who\u2019s the auditing role for the bank. My second question is, you are trying to keep track of fiducial data in a private way, and that\u2019s why you want the Maker Representative. With your clients, if they presummably say they that LendCo can share this private information with an auditing firm as long as they follow the NDA effectively, I think that you got to have that in the contracts so that they know there\u2019s some other agency that\u2019s auditing it. And with respects to how a bank does this, who is the auditor that performs this function? 18:40 - MakerMan: Let me do a follow-up on that. Normally, you are giving a loan out on a project and you have to verify that the assets that are backing the loan have an actual matching value and that whatever project is going on matches the loan profile. Inherently you are saying LendCo is going to do that when, in reality, a bank or another agency would do that that\u2019s independent of Lendco. 23:30 - Gregory Di Prisco: Maybe an example would help here. Let\u2019s say you originate a new loan, you go to the DAO and you say it\u2019s going to \u201cWawa\u201d and this is the amount, etc. and then the Maker Representative sees the actual loan documents that you can\u2019t post publicly and they see that the tenant is not \u201cWawa\u201d but it\u2019s \u201cMcDonald\u2019s\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a good example to highlight where the Maker Representative would raise their hand and say Matt is not being forthcoming with the DAO, he is lying about what he\u2019s putting in his documents. 25:30 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Where would you see that? In some kind of reports? How does the representative know that those reports are real and is there any legal recourse if they are not? 26:25 - MakerMan: It sounds like you have in your head certain requirements for this representative. If you are going to do a spot audit it means you have to have some capability to be able to perform an audit and you\u2019ll probably going to have to be able to read contracts, so what other abilities do you see that a Maker Representative is going to have to have to be able to perform their function? 28:20 - Maarten: I think what we should avoid is to start relying on an army of advisors and specialists in all kinds of areas. We should get the lender do all of the homework and then somebody who has some understanding as a Maker Representative to sign off on it. My own background is legal and I would ask for legal opinions to be provided by 6s in this case, that all the documents are enforceable and that the entities actually exist and that there\u2019s a standard format for legal opinions. As long as that is delivered with the content that we would put on a checklist as a Maker Community before we do this, I think the Maker Representative should work with a checklist but without actually being a lawyer or an accountant. 30:40 - MakerMan: So we have this checklist, potentially a Maker Representative could dig into one of the pieces of the checklist if they wanted to. Inherently, the Maker Representative is a quality assurance check: that all the i\u2019s and t\u2019s and details of this are done. And they\u2019re going to have to have the ability to do that potentially. You say, it shouldn\u2019t have to happen but this is why you do quality assurance checks. If everybody that has the responsability to provide the accurate information, also have the liabilities to go with not doing it right then everybody is covered. 32:35 - User: Who would do the the compliance checks on the appraisers to make sure appraisers are operating within the boundaries of their engagement on a collateralized project? 33:00 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I believe MakerMan said that the Maker Representative would not be able to lower the debt ceiling, if there was any risk, we would need Governance for that. Maybe you can touch on the Governance side a little bit? 34:10 - Frank Cruz: In a traditional bank, when you apply for a commercial loan, you have a loan officer. Would you say that LendCo is the loan officer in this scenario? 35:55 - MakerMan: My expectation is that you are going to want this to be a single facility versus a kind of multiple facilities that are broken for each of the projects. If we do it as a single facility and have, let\u2019s say, five project in there, if one of them it\u2019s going to close, I don\u2019t want to be in a situation where one of the projects is falling under and it might affect the other projects that are within the total loan profile and the debt ceiling of what we are going to give LendCo. How do you see that being handled? Are we are going to have one facility or multiple facilities that are specific to projects?  42:20 - MakerMan: My impression is that the Maker Representative should be a team of individuals that collectively are working on probably the entire loan portfolio in RWA, it shouldn\u2019t just be one person. 43:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I want you to touch on two topics before we close. First, is the question brought in by LongForWisdom in the chat. What happens with the Governance side of this? Do the representatives need to be elected? Paid? Second, if we were to do a pilot, how would we do it? How do we form these representatives? 47:25 - LongForWisdom: How would the DAO judge the performance of the representatives? How could we figure out who the good people are? 51:30 - Will Remor: What about a 360 degree approach where some of the critical areas have such a due diligence and risk have a couple of people always onboard so they can collaborate with each other and peer review work reviews while also keeping each other on check 53:55 - Next steps discussion  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 57:20  I hate to cut you and the whole conversation, but we have the collateral call with tBTC and Balancer next, so if you guys want to join us over there you are more than welcome! Let\u2019s keep the conversation going in the forum. I feel like we are making a lot of progress so let\u2019s keep this going and if we need to have another of these calls to clear doubts, let\u2019s do it. Thanks everyone for presenting and your participation. See you on the other side!  Credits  Gala Guill\u00e9n produced this summary.

                    "content": "Hey guys, just saw the maker representative call uploaded. I think the process is very neat and we are now in the process of having proper assurance that everything is properly done.Before I start I want to make one thing clear, I always prepare for the worst and hope for the best, having said that, the whole process is in principle very clear & assuring. One issue that I want to disclose is related to audits, I was a former auditor so one key factor for an audit to be signed is a management representation letter (suggest for everyone interested to check one out) basically it operates as a disclaimer for the auditor and is signed by the client were it states that, among other things, accounting estimates were performed diligently by top management, in order to have back up evidence of the estimates of appraisals (for example) they will request the appraisal report, check it\u00b4s effectively signed, read on it & move on unless there is something very clear that it is wrong (they could eventually request their own appraisal and charge it to the client too), the purpose of an audit is not to detect fraud (because if it were they would basically have to redo the entire accounting processes which can\u00b4t happen, you must be able as an audit firm to reach a conclusion with the less amount of hours invested by your personnel). I emphasize on this point because I\u00b4ve been an auditor and I\u00b4ve been audited and although audit reports assure that the company complies (if it\u00b4s a clean report) with the accounting norms, accounting standards & management accounting for decision making do not always come hand in hand. Perhaps there was no need to disclose this but I wanted to make it clear just in case that the general knowledge of an audit is that \u201cok, the report is clean, everything is perfect\u201d it may well be or it may not, it\u00b4s not an audit\u00b4s purpose to determine that.  Also an audit does not cover loan to ratio requirements by maker, what they state are if the financial statements are fairly represented and for loans they will likely check if there are indications that they could be subject to an impairment analysis, not that it complies with our own requirements. A particular analysis of loan to equity would fall under the category of an agreed upon procedure, I really like this product for this use since it basically is a focused analysis on a particular item of the balance sheet or business process like, for example loan to equity requirements for approval purposes and they do not need to be performed at year end, same goes for loan disbursement against construction progress. Lastly ref appraisals they are subject to market conditions, @mrabino1  could we request a quarterly review of the appraisals? It doesn\u00b4t have to be extensive, perhaps a quarterly update from the construction firm if there are material deviations would suffice, this would also help any potential claim of impairment analysis of the loans that could (or not) be presented by auditors.
