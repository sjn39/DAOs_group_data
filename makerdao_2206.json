I am extending the RFC period to give more time for feedback as the current state is in the process of migration (or not). This allows for resources to remain focused on the current efforts, while still allowing feedback to be gathered on this Notice DAI. Any potential issues can be addressed during the extended RFC period. For example, due to short-term rates forecasted to rapidly change throughout this year, the notice period and rate will need to be updated prior to submission (if submitted).  Preamble MIP#: 118 Title: Introduce a 7-Day Notice Option to the Dai Savings Rate to Support ALM Author(s): TRUEMAKER Contributors: Tags:  Type: MIP Type Status: RFC Date Proposed: 2023-02-20 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: <List of dependent MIPs> Replaces: <List of MIP it is replacing> Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip118-introduce-a-7-day-notice-option-to-the-dai-savings-rate-dsr-to-support-alm-rfc-only/19873/1   References  Discussion on Enabling the DSR  Alternative Options to the Current DAI Savings Rate (DSR)  Modeling DAI maturity  MIP103: The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework  MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution   Sentence Summary This MIP proposes adding a 7-day notice option to the DSR with a rate of 1.25%.  Paragraph Summary This Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) proposes adding an alternative option to the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offering. Currently, the only option is instant access with funds unlocked immediately. This proposal would create a 7-day unlocking option (7-day notice option) at a rate of 1.25%.  Component Summary MIP118c1: Dai Savings Rate (DSR) A protocol-wide savings rate that incentivizes users to lock DAI and earn interest. It\u2019s a cost to the protocol. The rate is determined by the community and can vary based on revenue generated by the protocol and funding need. MIP118c2: 7-day notice DSR Introduce an optional 7-day notice period at a higher rate of 1.25%  Motivation   The motivation behind this proposal is to fill an identified gap in the current Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offering that can better serve Maker\u2019s ALM strategy today and in the endgame state. As a balance sheet expert and experienced ALM member at multiple global banks, I am confident this proposal would enhance the offering and provide DAI holders an incentive to grow their holdings.   This proposal would introduce an additional option to the DSR offering with a 7-day unlocking period at a rate of 1.25%, which is a 25% better rate than the current instant access option (i.e. 1.00%), and could potentially attract more stable DAI funding at a reasonable rate.  Chart1200\u00d7742 18.6 KB    The competition for funding, i.e., stable deposits, is intensifying as many banks and stablecoin issuers report lower year-over-year deposits and market caps, respectively, due to a shrinking money supply and alternative higher-yielding options for cash (see chart below). To compete in this rate environment, it is necessary to have a diverse range of options with various interest rates. The addition of a DSR option will help us compete and increase our stablecoin market share. There is still a large gap between market rates and DSR rates, but with the introduction of a notice DAI option, the protocol can now test demand by altering the DSR rate between instant and notice and identify the optimal cost of funding to fund its ongoing lending and investment program.  952\u00d7446 23.4 KB   952\u00d7508 27.2 KB    The 7-day notice period would increase DAI\u2019s competitiveness, reduce liquidity risk, and increase liability duration. This would allow the protocol to have higher-yielding assets (e.g., dated treasuries), increase stability through locked funds, and test the demand/supply dynamics of different rate offerings.   Additionally, the 7-day notice period is attractive to Maker as it allows the protocol to unwind RWA investments such as MIP65, MMFs, and ETFs, while offering incentives to DAI holders. This proposal aims to reduce the gap between the asset and liability sides of Maker\u2019s framework, strengthen liabilities management, and create a buffer in uncertain times.    Specification / Proposal Details MIP118c1: Dai Savings Rate (DSR)  The Dai Savings Rate (DSR) is an incentivized savings program that rewards users for depositing and locking their DAI into a smart contract. In return, users receive instant rewards calculated by applying the DSR rates to their deposits. The DSR rate is set and adjusted through governance polls voted by Maker holders. The most recent DSR update was proposed by the MakerDAO Open Market Committee in 4Q 2022 which raised the DSR to 1%.   MIP118c2: 7-day notice DSR  This proposal would create an additional DSR option of 7-day unlocking option (7-day notice option) at a rate of 1.25%. This would provide an alternative option to the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) offering. Stability - The 7-day notice period would allow users to lock DAI into the DSR and receive a variable rate of 1.25%. DAI would be locked in the DSR and would be available for withdrawal after the 7-day lock-in period is triggered by the user. The 7-day notice period would enable users to access their locked funds and also provides an incentive for DAI holders to keep their DAI in the DSR for longer periods of time, thus providing stability to the protocol. Security - The 7-day notice period would be implemented using the DSR smart contract that would ensure that funds are securely stored and that users can access their funds after the 7-day lock-in period.

Doo_StableLab:  What would be some cost estimate I am curious   In the collateralized stablecoin world, liabilities create assets so its only a cost if DAI\u2019s collateral is uninvested (i.e. usdc) but we have ability to reinvest it into higher yielding investments such as MIP65, Coinbase Custody, etc. So this aims to align liabilities and assets duration profile to earn a spread and reduce liquidity risk. If you mean the development cost, I have no idea. ",

They would be able to seamlessly offer all the different variations of this kind of product (alongside other fixed rate products) in an integrated interface next to the DSR, and could continuously A/B test and optimize in other ways to make sure they are providing the most UI real estate to the most popular products.

Maker also has allocated resources into investing in MMFs, bonds, and ETFs. However, this is short-term (as demonstrated by DAI\u2019s market cap stagnation), Maker needs to attract funds to take full advantage of these negotiations and investments. What would be the advantages of partnering with companies that offer high yields and building efficient processes for investing assets if current investable assets run out?

Introducing notice DAI would enable Maker to keep a low cost of funds while experimenting with higher rates to attract new DAI, which would increase revenue and the surplus buffer, expediting the endgame goal ",

When SOFR/EFF/risk-free rates drop (most likely by the time subDAOs are implemented) from 5% to <1% like they have been for the past 15 years with sporadic increases and the DSR had to adjust accordingly, what would you expect to happen to DAI in instant access DSR? e.g. It was empty when rates were 0.00%. Holding cash wouldn\u2019t be king anymore and funds would flow back to riskier assets, resulting in quick outflows. Thankfully, this mechanism can help reduce some of the bleeding by providing 7 days of notice, adding other notice periods should be considered too, to unwind those investments and also reduce outflows.

                    "content": "Personally see term/notice DSR as a Maker core product, because the asset/liability duration mismatch will live with Maker core. Would of course be great if we could get outside resources involved in building it / managing it. But I think term liabilities will be an important part of Maker core\u2019s ALM toolkit. Existing DSR has low adoption because it is lower yield than alternative stablecoin options (Aave, Compound, Curve) and users are not very risk aware - seems people are happy to take on another layer of lending risk for ~0.5% yield. When DSR is integrated into secondary lending protocols, it will push supply rates a good deal higher than alternative stablecoins like USDC, which I believe could lead to a decent boost to usage. Agree we should take advantage of RWA opportunities but as the Silvergate situation has demonstrated, duration mismatches can cause severe problems. Maker has the benefit of DAI having a soft peg (eg we are not guaranteeing $1 redemption value like a bank), so unlike Silvergate we wouldn\u2019t necessarily be forced to unload long duration assets in a fire sale. But it would still be a big reputational hit if DAI fell significantly below target price due to excessive net duration exposure (too long of asset duration vs liability duration). I feel that something like this proposal will be an important way to derisk Maker\u2019s balance sheet deployment into RWAs. ",

The 7-day notice DSR is indeed a great way to bridge the gap between DAI instance nature and MMF redeem lag. The main limitation I had for this proposal was the lack of ERC20 composability. But I\u2019m changing my mind as it can be ERC20, and you just have to lock it when you want to exit. It should maybe even be the new DSR.  ",
