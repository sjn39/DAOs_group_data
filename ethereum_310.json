Problem: When NFT\u2019s point to optional metadata stored off-chain there is no on-chain mechanism that a browser/wallet can use to validate that the metadata hasn\u2019t been tampered with. Solution: In Web 2.0 the W3C standardized Subresource Integrity (SRI) which allows resources in HTML to declare their integrity digests & hashing algorithm so the browser can download the resource, hash it, compare it with the declared integrity digest, and then pass/fail the resource. We can do the same on-chain by providing a simple interface for getIntegrity(tokenId) that returns the SRI-formatted hashing-algorithm + base64-encoded integrity digest. Caveat: browsers/wallets will have to adopt both checking for the interface and validating off-chain metadata, but this can be a powerful tool against future malicious NFT projects.
