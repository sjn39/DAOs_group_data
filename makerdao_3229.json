Please could you try logging out of Metamask and logging back in again, we have seen some instances where something cached with the Metamask connection is sometimes causing an issue. Obviously logging out and back into Metamask shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but always best to make sure you have your seed phrases backed up somewhere when playing around with it. ",
