Frankly though I find it an interesting idea to have a form of decentralized USDC that will appear on it\u2019s own if the PEG drops below 1 significantly.   In the loosest sense these vaults can be Maker last bastion of USDC on the books for PEG control.   We also can sweep them at our leisure then. I would prefer to sweep these and have multiple layered PSM tiers with diff DCs and tin/tout settings but barring that it might be a good idea to keep them.  I mean PSM with 500M USDC is actually different than 100M USDC in the PSM and 400M in the USDC vaults as this 400M won\u2019t get accessed unless the PEG does drop dramatically below 1 and the ~100M USDC in PSM is exhausted. Hence I am mixed on what to do here since we probably don\u2019t get anything off the books. How much of these vaults are under the liquidation gun if we were to enforce liquidations?   I feel like we are giving these people a free unexpiring DAI put option and something about me says we should do something about that. ",

First, the probably is if we don\u2019t turn off all vaults as there is incentive to use the 0% vault, I am a bit worry that we will see the open vault going up. The option to set the DC to the limit here should actually probably come with the Usdc to 0. One of the issue with the vault is that we actually can\u2019t sweep them at our leisure. Even liq2 will use auction and the results is uncertain. Also I think we should not expect those vaults to get to 0 at all. I would expect in 3 months time we will be at may be 200M or 100M if we are lucky. Also our exposure to Usdc decrease significantly from 60% to 20%, same regarding the percentage of MKR 20%, so I believe we have a bit more room. I agree it is not an ideal but it still better. ",
