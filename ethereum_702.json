What types of real-world data would be nice to have on chain? (price feeds, ABIs, token information) Should we separate oracle-related topics into a different ring?

I haven\u2019t thought about it a lot, but it feels like the issues/solutions for \u2018data in\u2019 vs. \u2018data out\u2019 may be quite different as well. Thoughts? ",
