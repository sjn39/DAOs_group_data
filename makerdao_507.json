My name is Payton, and I go by prose11 online. I am one of the Governance Facilitators here at MakerDAO. I am joined today by incredible people who care about and are interested in the Maker protocol. This is our weekly Governance and Risk meeting, where we discuss current topics, things going on in the Governance realm, and potential risks or opportunities we see for the protocol in the future. Before we get started, you might have noticed that this call is being recorded. We post the calls in their entirety on YouTube afterward; keep that in mind for when you are speaking. If you have a question, please ask when the time permits. If you are uncomfortable or unable to hop on the mic, feel free to drop the question or comment in the sidebar, and we will cycle to it when conversationally appropriate. We will go into a presentation and discussion topics. The first topic is about the Dai stablecoin backing. We have been increasing that due to market volatility and a few other reasons I am sure we will highlight during the call. The second topic is more abstract but exciting. It is a multidisciplinary approach towards governance evolution; fancy academic-speak for drawing on different pools of knowledge. It considers what other groups have done and tried in the past and uses that to improve our governance system at MakerDAO. One of our recognized delegates proposed that, so that was also exciting.

Most discussion is about USDC, the fear of blacklisting of USDC, and Dai being backed by many USDC. Thanks to the help of David, Peyton, and others, I put up a couple of prompts. We will get started with the first prompt on ideas on reducing stablecoins dependency for Dai, especially in the case of a potential bear market coming along. We would love to be bullish, but we cannot always be bullish. We must expect and prepare for the worst. It is about steering collateral diversification and preparing a bear market.  Nikolaj: I can say that CES and Real World Finance 2022 is about scaling up the Dai supply generated against real-world assets. That is one part of the co-equation here, hopefully.   LongForWisdom: The main issue is the scale; we have a lot of USDC we want to offset. The other main thing we have been pursuing is the institutional vote side right for crypto sets.  Prose11: Thinking about the bear market is essential because unless Dai demand also dries up with a bear market, you have a problem where there is still a ton of demand. The only way to access Dai is through stablecoins through our PSMs. We have been seeing this last week\u2019s volatility will increase our backing on stablecoins. Although we have been doing well for a little bit, we are about to push 50% stablecoin backing as soon as the markets get more volatile again.   Unknown speaker: Bear or bull market, it seems Dai demand is going up only. It is an excellent problem to have, but it is a problem. We need to catch up on supply.   USDC-back Dai PR 15:04  2630\u00d71046 96.2 KB   Artem: The following prompt is a complete 180, bringing us to an exciting discussion on shifting public relations regarding USDC back Dai. The public sentiment was rather negative. Moreover, it seemed like a Dai wrapper. But what about promoting public opinion towards seeing it as a security buffer or as a positive sentiment overall?  LongForWisdom: It is best of both of these things, right? It is hard to flip the perception entirely if we get enough of it.   Unknown: Do you want us to say something nice about USDC? I did come across a funny post for somebody who reinvented Dai. People talked about how expensive transactions got with USDC on-chain and how it got worse because of the blacklist, upgradability, and poor memory management. Transferring USDC is reasonably expensive. If you want to transfer $100 worth of USDC, you are paying nearly half of that in transaction fees in gas. People theorized about making the USBC wrapper that allowed a more gas-efficient transfer. Dai is one of the most (if not the most) efficient stablecoin implementation on-chain. Maybe there is a positive PR angle where Dai is wrapped USDC. Then, all the people that want to use USDC start using Dai instead because it is cheaper to transfer it between people on-chain. Maybe you can pick up some positive PR that way.  Prose11: One interesting aspect that came to mind was that many risk-weighted assessments have to do with how much non-stable collateral we have. This made sense since the Black Swan scenario. We do not have to worry about the stable backing as we do the volatile ones. In some ways, having more stablecoin backing frees us up a bit on the risk side with the rest of our portfolio.   Artem: If not USDC, what would be the next best stablecoin backing?  LongForWisdom: PAX, GSD. If you mean non-centralized, it is a lot harder to find good backing. Unknown: PAX, GSD, and USDC are potentially regulated and backed stablecoins. There are also things like USD and more decentralized stables. We may want to take a look at that at some point too.   LongForWisdom: We have discussed a few of these before. In some cases, part of the issue is that market caps are not high enough. We have a lot of USDC that we would need to shift completely to one of these. Also, this questions how stable these will be over the long term.  Unknown: Fundamentally, if these coins are over collateralized, they will have the same supply issues that we have. They will plain explode if they are under collateralized. There is no Get Out of Jail Free card with any of these.   Prose11: The real world angle has been voiced a decent amount in the sidebar. One interesting challenge is that since it is not off-chain, we have to rely on legal structures that add some complication, particularly with the size of our surplus buffer. The liquidation for real-world assets will be much slower than an on-chain liquidation, assuming both work as efficiently as possible.  Unknown: The DAO prefers inaction regarding the USDC issue. There are different solutions, but people do not want to take them because they are not perfect. We can do on-chain DeFi stuff, but that has counterparty risk by investing in other protocols. We can do off-chain stuff and put USDC in treasuries or other liquid credit assets. People have criticized this from a decentralization standpoint. USDC is flowing in rapidly to the PSM. We have over four and a half billion dollars of exposure sitting there in stables. It is challenging because it is a lot of money, and it is a complex thing to discuss. At some point, we will have to come together as a community and do some deep analysis on it, or maybe hire people to do some deep analysis on it. Structuring even a traditional credit investment for Treasury-type services is much money, so we have to do it correctly. Real-world assets will help, but we are still quite far away from that scaling in a significant way.   Unknown: Until we get the real-world assets online, I see it as we have crypto assets. However, we can only get so much supply from those, and people want to leverage those in bull markets. Having centralized stablecoins is the only thing we can do at this stage. We may get a boost from stake ETH, which could give us a bit of a shot in the arm. However, in the fundamental long term, we need real-world assets. We cannot keep the supply up to match the demand forever.  Unknown: This is also a capital allocation issue derived from being highly decentralized. If we were in a centralized company, you would see a vast investment focused on scaling real-world assets quickly. Since this is so new and novel, the team is hesitant to request more funds and scale this. We are at the stage at Proving Grounds. Once we have proven a base model it is scalable, we need to look at reinvesting deeply in RWA. Given how vital real-world assets are to the protocol long term, we are significantly under-investing under allocating capital.   Brian McMichael: Boosting D3Ms is a risk, but it should be weighed against the risks of having too many stablecoins as well because much of the demand for Dai is coming from places like Aave and Compound. You have to decide where you want to take existential risks.  Unknown Speaker: Were there no competitive issues with Compound that were brought up on the GNR call before that made it less beneficial to partner than Aave? Are they doing something stables themselves?   LongForWisdom: They talked about launching their stablecoin like cross-chain a while back, called Cash.  Unknown: Looking back at shifting PR regarding USCC back Dai, I see some people with vested interests and bags speaking on Twitter. At the same time, we see an all-time high for Dai and Dai being used everywhere. The biggest issue is blacklisting risk, which has been discussed many times. It does not matter if there is 4 billion Dai or 2 billion Dai. If Maker could get blacklisted, it is game over. I am wondering what is the problem here? I am not seeing Dai being used less necessarily. Unknown: We have a good problem of too much demand. We need the supply to catch up, or we will essentially be wrapped USDC. Nikolaj: Why can it not be wrapped USDC? Why not 50%? What is the goalpost here? Because it is also good to have some stable collateral to cohesion us in the market and downturns.   Unknown: The goal is that we are not centralized on one particular asset; we can survive the collapse of anyone. We are critically dependent on USDC and probably even USDP as well. What we want is a basket of assets jurisdictionally distinct and diversified. That is the goal.  Brian McMichael: Since it was launched, I have been a pretty vocal critic of the PSM. I will take the other side and say that we have reduced the PSM and increased the supply for the last six months. It may just be the case where we have these shocks where we have to take on the USDC to meet the market demand for Dai. We can solve that later by slowly bringing back the collateral as the market allows. It might be working; we are now looking at a local shock.   Unknown: I have another view on that. From what I have seen over the past couple of years, Dai demand steadily picks up in the bull market side. It seems to tick up from farming yields. That is not the entire thing, or else in the reverse case, the demand would drop, which we are not seeing. There is a bit of a drop when we have a significant market drop, but demand seems to start ticking up again after a while. It seems we get demand from both the farming and people as a flight of safety out of volatile crypto assets. I do not see why this trend would not continue. In the bull market case, the supply grows to roughly match or exceed the demand growth because people can mint more. This past trend of demand ticking up over time only increases Dai demand. We need to prepare for bear markets where we take on stablecoins because we do not have any alternative.   Governance Evolution: Multidisplinary Approaches 31:59 - Payton Rose  I wanted to kick off the introduction to this topic to the recognized delegate whom you all suggested from Acre Invest, Young.  32:12 - Young  Hi to everyone. Thank you for the invitation to the recognized delegates to submit a topic for this call. I was intrigued by a post recently about multidisciplinary approaches toward governance. I would love to have a conversation or hear from people on this call about how our system of governance and recognized delegate function ought to move forward in a decentralized way. Also, the topic we are broadly speaking in the community around DAOs, voter participation, engagement, free-rider problems, contributions for work. We wanted to see the thinking and people\u2019s views related to MakerDAO and our future.  33:23 - Artem Gordon  I have a couple of prompts that you touched on. I have this one. Also, if we want to speak about Andrew Hall\u2019s post regarding incentives and MKR participation directly, we could jump to that and then come back to this.  33:46 - Young  Maybe one specific prompt, since I am new to the community, I would be curious what conversations have taken place on this topic up until now. Any background on the transition from the foundation to setting up recognized delegates and any history you think would be an important context for me or others who are new to the community as we think about this broad topic.  34:19 - Unknown  I can give a brief technical history of how things have changed. We were not always a protocol that had these delegates. This is a reasonably new development. MKR voting is intended to quantify some measure of skin in the game. In a way, it is a plutocracy. It is intended to be that way because we want MKR holders to make good decisions. They would be, therefore, financially penalized if they made bad ones. Good choices, you get a bigger burn. Bad decisions, you get diluted. That is the basic gist of it. From the very old days, it was always continuous voting. We stake our MKR on a particular state of the system. In the old days,  you could only change a couple of parameters like in single collateral Dai. When we released multi-collateral Dai, the system became infinitely more configurable and completely upgradable by governance, with a couple of caveats. The same thing, in continuous voting, your MKR had to park itself on an executive to guard the system\u2019s security. There is already this anti incentive to take your MKR and move elsewhere unless you ruin the security of the governance system, and you get diluted. After a while, it is too complicated to be voting on executives all the time. We started to have a lot more configuration changes. We went to polling to signal what we would not want to include in our governance executive. Now, you can poll. You send a transaction on-chain, but the transactions are quantified into the polling result. On-chain polling is not to be confused with signal polling in the forums. When you do on-chain polling, it is mostly events that are fired and then counting the results of those events. That allowed us to develop a better set of changes and for people to park their MKR and executive. Then, we took a detour into a design space where we could use Starkware and some other L2 to reduce the amount of gas that participating in governance was costing. That led to many ideas around a governance redesign. There is even a MIP for it, like snapshot voting and much other stuff. Then, the gas problem became big. There is one step in between the gas problem. We were vulnerable to flash loans for a little bit. We did a governance upgrade that prevented people from taking flash loans and voting executives. After that, to reduce the gas costs on individuals from participating, we effectively created a way for people to aggregate their MKR into a single delegate. That delegate can vote the MKR but not take possession of it. Now we are in this delegate system, which is working to help secure the hat but perhaps has the trappings and benefits of representative democracy. That is the history of how we have gotten here. Are there any questions about that?  38:22 - Young  Thank you, that was an excellent overview. Makerman, you commented about other stakeholders, vault holders, Dai holders, and their ability to influence governance. How do people view that dynamic today, and what is an ideal structure to incorporate their views if the current state is not perfect?  38:55 - Deniz DUX  I was talking to Colby Anderson. He is now with the SES team. We had a good conversation, and he changed my mind on some topics. I am with a DUX team. We have built a governance portal, for example. The voting tooling we are currently using shows that scalability and the gas costs associated with participating and making governance are huge user problems. We have been breaking our heads over an issue. As Christopher just mentioned, the main challenge I saw initially is that the Maker voting system is designed for security. A lot of it is on-chain and is therefore very difficult to tamper with it, especially as it is a relatively new CU. I learned from that discussion with Colby and after talking with other people that we should consider the voting system that we use as modular. This continuous voting mechanism to protect the on-chain Maker system makes much sense. We should not mess with that in the short term. We have many tooling out there, like Snapshot. Also, there are alternatives out there. We are already looking into gasless voting mechanisms. There is a lot out there that we can use for multiple things in the DAO. We should probably not use gasless voting for changing on-chain parameters. That is probably very risky. We are eager to explore together with GovAlpha to see which governance primitives or actions we can use these gasless voting mechanisms for. That is super, and it is on the radar from our side. It is one of our priorities for this quarter. We are looking into it, not only Snapshot but also other mechanisms.  41:09 - Young  Would the community ever have an appetite for polling Dai holders about their views? Could that be a gateway drug toward getting more involved in the Maker Core Protocol? Before being a recognized delegate, I was most active with the vaults and Dai. That is a relationship that more people understand, like stablecoin, and there may be layers of communication in which we can engage the holders of Dai and then draw them in.  41:57 - LongForWisdom  This comes up semi-frequently. Can we extend some governance power to Dai holders or vault holders? In theory, we could do stuff like that. Snapshot could work for Dai. We could have Snapshot systems set up versus Dai. Each Dai is a vote, and you can vote on things. We could probably do something similar for vault holders if we wanted. To what extent do Maker holders allow Dai holders and vault holders to affect the system? As Chris mentioned before, the key, I guess safeguard, in theory, to make all the decisions is that they are on the hook financially for bad decisions. That is true to a limited extent of Dai holders and vault holders. If Dai breaks completely, Dai and vault holders are potentially out of luck. For MKR holders, it is more graduated. If we do a bad job, then we get screwed over. If we do a little bit of a good job, we get like some good burn. The problem with this is the Dai and vault holders have opposing desires and stakes. The Dai holders want the DSR high, while vault holders want the vault fees below. If you let Dai holders set the DSR to a high number and vault holders set the fees to a low number, MKR holders will end up paying the difference. In extreme cases where you assume everyone is perfectly selfish, that is the system you end up with. Traditionally, MKR holders have the voting power because they balance the two.  44:25 - Young  There is a whole realm of conversation and engagement that is bigger than the technical functioning of the protocol and some operational details as to how it should run. We could maybe engage a wider audience with this. This post jumped out at me because I am a humanities person. We could add to the conversation, which is very operational on the protocols as a system. There is great potential and importance of our work as a decentralized stablecoin and an emphasis on clean money. I am thinking about how it could be marketed to gauge views that impact the adoption, scalability, awareness, and attraction of what MakerDAO stands for to people. However, I agree with and hear what you are saying. From a business standpoint, it is not giving those stakeholders a foothold in the important decisions around the operation and structure of the protocol.  45:56 - Someone  You bring a good point that would be relevant to the last conversation. We may pull Dai holders by signal beyond some Twitter poll or forum poll. We could ask people with skin in the game as Dai holders how much stablecoin backing are they willing to tolerate? We may be able to get excellent signals from them. We are in the stablecoin backing scenario because Dai holders and integrators effectively told us they were unwilling to tolerate a soft peg. If they were willing to tolerate a soft peg, we would not need PSMs. We would just be floating four cents above or four cents below peg at any time. But the Dai holders and integrators were specifically not using Dai because of the floating peg. You may be able to quantify almost where the sentiment is. At what threshold do they find it completely intolerable? Or would they rather have a floating peg than a tight integration without affecting any protocol?  47:11 - Nadia Alvarez  It would be interesting to ask the Dai holders what they think. We, in Growth, all of our interactions are with Dai holders, and they do not care about what is behind Dai. They care about Dai being a hard-pegged to one and to find different or on/off ramps with low spread and low fees in the middle. Of course, they care about having gasless transactions if it is possible. They care about liquidity and the fees in the middle of each transaction. They need Dai to be a stablecoin and keep the peg. That is what they care about. This is what everyone looks for in a stablecoin, not just in Dai.  48:39 - Prose11  Good conversations are going on in the chat here. I will encourage anyone if you are comfortable hopping on the mic to go forward.  48:46 - Nicolaj Lollike  In theory, I had written that MKR holders are incentivized to keep both Dai holders and vault holders happy. But as Chris notes in the sidebar, MKR holders might have imperfect information about the sentiment of these actors, which I completely agree with. And to Nadia\u2019s point, I was working with her in the foundation on integrations. We saw in the integrations team that integrators are not following Maker governance because there is too much to follow. I am sure people on this call also think sometimes there is too much. What integrators care about is a stable and useful product. We would try to make sure that no breaking changes were happening, for example, integrators or major upgrades that would have a major impact on the Dai holders, whether they would have to migrate that Dai or something like that.  50:09 - Prose11  Thanks, Nicolaj. Good reflections there. A number of people go from vault holder to Dai user to eventually MKR holder. That is a good path, but several people do not take this path. I appreciate conversations like this.  50:24 - Ultra Schuppi  It is hard to keep track and learn everything. It takes a long time. Suppose you complain about MKR holders not having enough information to make good decisions. How will we get better if we let in more people with even less knowledge, less attention span, and less willingness to learn? I do not think we have a problem with non-MKR holders participating. If you are a Dai holder and disagree with stuff, join the forum, complain, and interact. That is the only way to learn about this stuff. Vault holders wanting low stability fees is just one part of the equation. It is just one parameter of complexity. The system we have right now of signal requests is like the House of Commons. Regardless of whether you hold MKR or not and how much you hold, you have just one vote. It is pretty good. It is a great system that we have in there. In some cases, it is super slow, and sometimes you do not think that the reasonable results are going on-chain. I suffered from this during the surplus buffer discussions we had in the last 12 months. However, it is still a valid system. Of course, it is a system of compromises. It is healthy to do it this way. That is decentralized, I would say. We have a big issue on that topic.  52:03 - Someone  I would honestly argue that we have an issue because the voter participation rate is ridiculously low. This is one of the results of the current design of our voting tooling and our governance system. In my conversations with Andrew, I learned that one of the reasons real-life nation-state governments have periodic elections is that asking people to vote on every topic or issue is not feasible. There are many ways to redesign or improve the voting tools and the governance process to ensure that we do not ask for too much attention from our users and delegates. There is a lot to gain by exploring that. I am happy that we are having this discussion. We should not regard our current system design as the way to go because it is technically decentralized.  53:27 - UltraSchuppi  We are working on two things here. One is a governance problem. I advocated for a long time that we should hear from all stakeholders. All stakeholders should not necessarily have levers on Maker to adjust the system. You are running a business; you like to hear from the people using it to have your pulse on the people. I have been around the idea and governance issues for decades with many different organizations. I see the real issue at Maker, other places, and stocks are centralized ownership. If we analyze our Maker holder wallets and what happened in governance history, there probably are 50 wallets at most that have delegated. Probably five of those holding 90% of the major Maker delegated. If we want to talk about governance, we need a governance analysis to understand what is going on in governance. Then we need to think hard about the problems and what we think the solutions could be. A lot of us are going to disagree and discuss. I want to hear from other stakeholders. I would like polling not to cost an arm and a leg. I would like to see that move somewhere else because it does not do anything on-chain except give us a signal. I see this as two different things. I want to hear from stakeholders and have mechanisms for that. I want to look at an analysis of Maker ownership concerning governance. Then we can start to address these issues and think about if there are problems or not.  55:24 - Someone  I am going to give a bit of technical feedback. Today, the polling contract knows nothing about MKR when we do on-chain polling. You send a transaction that fires an event as cheap as possible. Then it is off-chain stuff that checks how much MKR was held. We could easily deploy that contract onto an L2, and people could send a transaction on that L2; it would be wildly inexpensive. We could quantify as many tokens as they were holding. We could ask a Dai holder, or LP token that had Dai in it, or 3pool token, whoever would be quantified as a Dai holder, we could ask them questions about Dai and get feedback.  56:08 - UltraSchuppi  That is a great technical solution, but it will not solve the problem. Even if the polling on-chain is for free, I do not expect much change because MKR holders have no incentive to participate in governance. The value of your MKR is not changing, if you are taking part in governance or not. That is the flaw that we need to fix if we want to drive up the participation rate of MKR holders. Most of the MKR holders have this as an investment. They do not want to care, and that is okay. But there should be a strong incentive to put their MKR at work by delegating to someone else, which will also drive more active delegators or delegates into the system. If there is zero incentive, it will not change if we do Snapshot voting or polling on an L2.  57:25 - Someone  For some time, this is one of the reasons why I brought up this idea of having some reward for participation. If the rewards in Maker were printed, then in this loose sense, the people who do not participate get diluted away by the ones who do. I worked hard trying to come up with a model. The model was this idea of just paying a reward, like putting a bounty on per poll, and particularly executive participation. And that way, it rewards the people who participate in direct proportion to their participation. You can use that reward if you do not have any of these issues about arbitrary levels of whatever. I had it at the point 2% level of Maker inflation. We could have a 50% pass-through on delegates and compensate delegates. And then the 50% pass-through can go to the rest of the people, and the issue is gas paying them out. You could do this over time, or you can have it fast. I agree with you. The whole idea is that there is no disincentive for people not to participate. I have seen this in so many communities where everyone had equal shares. There would be small groups of people who would not participate in the community. All these people were doing a huge amount of work, yet the people not doing anything benefited. That ends up not working well in the long term. So I agree with you, Schuppi, that some approach to do that would work. Unfortunately, Maker governance has not wanted to step toward some reward that would dilute the rest and not participate.  59:20 - Artem Gordon  That perfectly brings up the next prompt between you and Schuppi. We cannot meet everyone\u2019s needs, and we have to decide on the best approach going forward. We want to improve incentives, user experience, or gasless voting. Also, we want to control some voters\u2019 power. Let us say gasless voting would be bad for risk parameters. We also want realistic steps going forward, like short or medium-term plans over the next six to 12 months. How do we decide the best approach, and what could be the best approach to meeting people\u2019s needs and not pissing everyone off?  1:00:11 - Someone  Can we start with getting polling off L1 and figure out how to get some of our additional stakeholders in? If we get other stakeholders playing, they might buy Maker and play more, and we will get more participation. I see that as low-hanging fruit that, at least if I hear Chris, is an easy one to tap.  1:00:39 - Christopher Mooney  It is more UI work than anything or whatever the off-chain quantifies. I do not know who is responsible for that right now.  1:00:50 - Prose11  You have to be a little careful when you change these things because you can have unintended consequences from the governance perspective. For instance, if you go to Snapshot, that kind of changes a lot of the assumptions you are making. It is taking a snapshot of voting waiting time. People who may have sold their MKR past that time can still have their full voting weight. Let us say they are your proposals losing and you wanted to acquire more MKR, currently in the system, you would be unable to do so. There will always be advantages and disadvantages to making a change like that. It is important that when you have a method in mind, you consider what you are losing by making this change.  1:01:38 - Someone  One consideration for Chris Mooney\u2019s suggestion from a technical perspective is that it would decrease gas costs. Still, it would require anyone participating in those polls to have whatever L2 gas transaction token is required. They would have to get that before they could participate in those polls.  1:02:09 - Christopher Mooney  Alternatively, we could count the Snapshot data on all chains at once. We could deploy it to Optimism, Arbitrum, and Mainnet and then count up anyone that sent a transaction. If you are not already on an L2, you must move funds over to that L2 to make the transaction.  1:02:50 - Someone  Would it be possible to get data on other protocol\u2019s results using Snapshot? I enjoy working around other protocols like Balancer, FAKE Protocol, or whoever else, and they do not get a big turnout with Snapshot. They get maybe 20, 30 different addresses. The only time I ever see a lot of excitement and a huge voter turnout is when you have a new protocol that gets many people excited. Maybe they got an airdrop. Suddenly you see an onslaught of voters come out to participate on Snapshot. Because obviously, it is free. I wondered if someone could collect data and see these OG protocols and what type of turnout they are getting with Snapshot. I am willing to bet that it is not big. If Maker goes into a Snapshot model, you will get a few more turnouts, but I do not think it will improve 100%.  1:04:07 - Prose11  I will mark down the link to Snapshot.org. It is pretty easy to browse through. It would be nice to get some comprehensive data. We have looked into some stuff in an upcoming research report, GovAlpha, but it was not specifically related to delegating. I do not believe those metrics are going to be included. I will see what I can do on that trend.  1:04:36 - LongForWisdom  I think investigating some cheap gas or alternating makes sense. It is more or less an obvious progression from what we have. But as people said, I did not expect it to change the amount of participation we are getting drastically. It is worth doing because it makes it cheaper for those participating, which is a benefit in itself. I do not think it will fundamentally change the game.  1:05:32 - Prose11  Considering the timing, we have potentially a little bit for open discussion if there are no last remarks on this topic.  1:05:50 - Someone  The governance contract redesign was MIP 26. It was a technical MIP that included some features. There is a forum post about it. People can add comments if they have more ideas, although that current development path is on the backburner, at least from a political engineering perspective. Still, if you have ideas, it is a good idea to quantify them because, at some point, this is going to come to the forefront. We will want to redesign everything.  1:06:25 - Brian McMichael  I should mention that the current delegation contracts have a one-year expiration. I do not remember when we started that, but those will all come to an end at some point. Delegates will have to reinitialize a delegation contract. It might be worth considering changes around that time; otherwise, we will roll into another year of the same system.  1:06:59 - Prose11  The reason behind the expiration is that something happened to a delegate, especially one that uses a personal address, or what have you to make the votes ramp, that MKR will be stuck. Anyone who did not realize it or is not paying attention would have their MKR delegated to someone who is not doing anything. So a few different reasons.  1:07:26  The other more powerful one for me was in the opposite direction. Let us say, for example, Micro Whale. You have got a couple of 100 MKR 1000 MKR. You delegate that, and then you get hit by a bus. Without the expiration, the person you delegated to effectively controls your voting power into eternity. This is something I have seen blown up happen in the real world with like HOAs and stuff where people age out, and they delegate their voting to a particular actor, and that person ends up having like a supermajority. It becomes a bit of a dictatorship. It would help if you had an age-out delegation.  1:08:14 - Brian McMichael  There is also a perverse incentive for a delegate to ensure that their delegates cannot un-delegate from them. So you can imagine all the ways that that could happen. And then they are dark when you get on that path.  1:08:37 - prose11  Awesome, any topics or open discussion? Now is a good time to circle back to something said earlier and that we have moved on from.  1:08:56 - Someone  I want to make a quick comment on Snapshot and compare it to Aave. Our forum activity looks like we have around 6x the number of forum posts a month for topics. Their voting participation on Snapshot is significantly higher than ours if you look at any closed poll on their website. I doubt that is unique to Aave. We can go through many other protocols, but I would assume that higher forum participation should generally translate into higher voting through Snapshot.  1:09:40 - Prose11  There are external factors as well too.  1:09:44 - LongForWisdom  There are staked Aave and other things like how people get paid and rewarded for being staked in governance. That is the compounding factor.  1:10:00 - Prose11  They do not have to vote; they just stake.  1:10:04 - Someone  The effects of staking are effectively the same as holding an MKR token. We do not require people to stake it.  1:10:14 - Kirk  People staked in Aave are the first in line to be recapitalizing the protocol? Is there a trade-off?  1:10:23 - LongForWisdom  Yes. It is not quite the same as Maker. They get more than their proportion, it is not split overall token holders, but they are all stacking holders. It is right that they still get it even if they do not vote. But that is not about the point that I made earlier.  1:10:42 - Prose11  I was also going to suggest that our system potentially discourages active voters because we have so many votes, polls every week, executives every week, the potential for emergency things, and many different types of polls. That complexity and the continued need to appear new things can be intimidating for some voters. Have them conclude. I can keep up with this protocol because they only vote a few times a month, whereas, in Maker, we had 21 polls go up on Monday, for instance. That was an abnormal week for sure, but it does happen.  1:11:21 - Someone  We are overcomplicating it. I just clicked through like ten different DAOs, and they all have tremendous voter participation on Snapshot. I do not see any that have less than us. These are even smaller projects than us. I am sure some data can be pulled somewhere. Maybe Snapshot themselves has a report they could share with us to analyze. But from what I see, participation is significantly higher than ours from an individual\u2019s wallet standpoint.

PSA LongForWisdom is not going to be hosting today. Likewise, Prose is actually on vacation this week. This is a public call at MakerDAO where we bring together internal and external stakeholders and go through a handful of different things. The call\u2019s contents involve four main components of governance roundup, where we go through the votes, MIPS, and the forum update for the week. We have a new segment called the initiative updates. I will be covering that shortly; we will cover three initiatives that we have been tracking and coordinating stakeholder alignment, including layer two and then on off-chain collateral management. We will discuss upgrading the surplus options. We will talk about options in order of resource investment, other considerations, and timelines. Lastly, there will be an open discussion if there is time at the end of the call. Anybody can bring up what they want. We have an anonymous question box.

Initiative Tracking and Cross-CU Collaboration  Initiative Update 14:24  For this next segment, we will talk about the initiative updates presented by stakeholder alignment call needs, which two of those happen to be so. This is a recurring segment; we are figuring out how often we update the various initiatives. We need to balance giving too much information and to update you guys. There is much information and many initiatives, as you will see in one of my coming slides. In general, we are iterating and improving the reporting format. This is the first pilot run of the format, and we are open to suggestions. This initiative update section is powered by the Initiative Tracking and Reporting project and the Cross-Core Unit collaboration involved. Our team GovComms has been taking on a brand new project to track all of the various initiatives at Maker to coordinate the different stakeholders involved in these initiatives, with the modular framework that we are developing in partnership with Wouter from SES. Why is stakeholder alignment and initiative tracking necessary? We are in a DAO; it is a headless organization. There are many reasons to do this, but the main ones are: it prevents stagnating initiatives, produces natural accountability, produces feedback loops, improves accuracy and projected timelines, identifies existing resources and potential needs and creates efficiency and execution. It reduces responsibility gaps for people who do not know who is responsible for what. It syncs the globally diverse cross-team planning is involved in any of these initiatives. We improve clarity by focusing on initiative output rather than team output because we recognize that initiatives have a vast ecosystem with overlapping CUs. Unless you keep them accountable, it does not make sense to follow CoreUnit updates individually. We believe this is important for stakeholders and thinking about MakerDAO from a more holistic roadmap perspective for focusing on initiative output. Also, it creates confidence for external stakeholders and clarifies the work we are doing, not just who is doing it. In general, decentralized organizations need a modular shared framework for work planning, execution, and reporting; individual Core Units need to collaborate to deliver results in a DAO. This is a natural part of that process. It also reduces the bus factor. When you bring all of these different cross-functional teams, cross-functional knowledge sharing and cross-team training happen. Moreover, it also produces shared roadmaps, which I already mentioned, are essential for clarity. There are 11 buckets that we have identified, like L2 collateral management for on and off-chain, Oracle\u2019s technical upgrades, organizational improvements, growth, stakeholder content, special purpose funds, risks, security. All of these have projects underneath. There are some process requirements for all these Core Units that should self-organize, identify stakeholders, identify common goals, identify the solutions that need to be implemented, and agree on the work breakdown of tasks associated with those milestones. Dependencies have to be mapped, understood, and agreed upon. At the same time, timelines have to be estimated correctly and orchestrated between all these different teams that do all this different work. Autonomous execution is what we are going for, and it requires well-understood best practices to avoid amateurism and stagnation of initiatives due to responsibility gaps. This whole process can be leveraged to create a lot more transparency through precisely this process of reporting. This is how the framework is structured, but every initiative has four stages that can be in.   2686\u00d71426 242 KB  20:00  There is an ideation workshop stage for an initiative, but a lot of thought has to go into producing the right game plan for it. Eventually, that results in a solution design. Solution design is relevant to technical projects, with multiple dependencies and considerations. Every initiative goes through a work breakdown format. This is where an initiative decides, and all the stakeholders decide on the main milestones that have to happen over the next quarter to a year. They take the initiative and map out all of the individual work to be done. After that, the status and owners are placed, and the stakeholder alignment call moves into this production coordination phase. This is where all the deliverables are flattened out, and it becomes formulaic for people. Before the call, they updated everything that happened. The call is used to surface blockers, discuss key points to move forward on various milestones, and share information on the Governance and Risk status updates. We are already doing stakeholder alignment calls and project tracking on our collateral management on-chain initiative. The off-chain version of that same initiative is separate, but there is a nuance between the two. The third one is L2, which we first piloted the stakeholder alignment calls on. Those are the three that we will bring you today. Some next ones that are planned are the security/emergency response planning initiative and the new education and onboarding initiative.   L2 Stakeholders Coordination Update 22:26  2734\u00d71400 177 KB   2724\u00d71506 179 KB   Derek: As David said, this is about bringing together cross-functional stakeholders, defining milestones, ensuring a work breakdown to align tasks, and understanding the following steps about dependencies blockers. It is a weekly process on the L2 sides to understand what those blockers are talking about the accomplishments and provide GovComms and others with a weekly progress status update. Moreover, that helps us keep an eye on the expectations, understand the tasks, their relative priority, and the relationships between those various types of work. As you will see on the next slide, there are a lot of different stakeholders involved. I have not captured all of them because they are updated regularly, as people said in the sidebar. As the following slide shows, ensuring that we have engagement from different CUs is critical. David mentioned L2. I will be talking about collateral onboarding and offboarding. Then the two coming shortly, for security stakeholders and Maker Academy, have already been talking to the Maker Academy guys and understanding how protocol engineering can contribute to that and work with other Core Units. We have a coordinated response to these dedicated topic meetings; we still maintain the mandated active meeting, as that is an essential roll-up to coordination across facilitators in the different groups. I will not spend more time on that. I will move to the next one as David covered everything here.   L2 Progress 24:57  First, let us talk about the scope of L2 progression specifically. We are talking about all efforts related to scaling Dai adoption across L2 roll-ups and side chains. You notice I am not discriminating between roll-ups or side chains. It is about the fact of scaling Dai adoption. Anything contributing to that is fair game for this focus, this meeting of stakeholders. You will see the snapshot here on the right side of the page. It brings out the entire product lifecycle, from inception, architecture, development, testing, auditing, and working with third parties.   2712\u00d71472 255 KB   Third parties can be external to Maker and internal CUs, then deployment and maintenance once live. A couple of the key points from the snapshot I have here is working on technical specification and documentation so our work can be scaled towards other domains. By working with growth on understanding domain liquidity, we can work with third parties and get them more involved in building the ecosystem in these different domains. Also, Oracle Support has been working on a proof of concept, which is functional, and ensuring that that integrates with the work we are doing on the protocol engineering side. We have upcoming discussions with the risk team\u2019s parameters and integrating with growth and GovComms. We ensure integration with other teams and that communication to the forum, Twitter, etc., is all included. Also, we are working with keepers, tech ops, and third-party keeping networks to ensure they are engaged in these new ecosystems. Moreover, that includes L2 user interfaces. In terms of working with third parties, there is a lot of testing auditing within this case, chain security, and making sure that the contracts are as we expect them to be. This all rolls up to the milestones, which I will break out on the next slide. So we split these into three groups. Our multi-chain strategy referenced flow withdrawals, fast withdrawals, and MCT on L2 as the main milestones with the respected domains. Before I go into the plotting of these on a roadmap, we have received many discussions around risk considerations. This is a multifaceted and ongoing discussion about roll-ups for side chains. What are the implications of wrap Dai versus canonical Dai? What is the behavior of Dai in the wormhole and across domains? Then, what are the attack vectors present as a result of that? These security implications and discussions steer our approach for side chains, such as in Polygon and others. This is not restricted to rollouts but also includes side chains. It is a broad discussion that introduces many risk considerations to have a broader view. There will be a community call next week that I will schedule as soon as I talk to David after this call. That call will dive into precisely these topics and help illustrate that the roadmap on the next slide is not the complete end-to-end roadmap.   2820\u00d7746 218 KB   Here, we talk about milestones for three domains: Optimism, Arbitram, and Starknet in blue. The technical work that is enabling them is in beige. There will be others, and over time, this will expand as we look at the various liquidity pools that exist and the ecosystems we built. You will know that the Optimism and Arbitram have been delivered so that you can click through with me, David, slowly as I go through these.  29:16  The StarkNet Dai bridge is currently targeting the end of February; we have medium confidence for that. There are some dependencies here. We are working with it, and this is the StarkNet Core Unit team, predominantly led by Louis and Maciek. We have got some dependencies on the StarkNet UI. Some event audits will be completed mid-February, and there is also work to integrate Oracles. We have medium confidence there because of those dependencies. The technical work enabling the fast withdrawals and Dai wormhole is ongoing. I alluded to some of the previous points: liquidity requirements, technical specifications, working with risk, and ensuring keeper third party involvement. We target the end of Q1 for the fast withdrawals space (Optimism and Arbitrum). We have high confidence in this one. Some test net reviews need to be done internally, and some audit responses are our dependencies here. We have got medium confidence for these Starknet fast withdrawals because there are still audits and quite a bit of healthy discussion that has to happen around the approver trust assumptions. They do not have the slow withdrawals that the optimistic rollouts have, so further discussion is needed in this space. Following that, we have got technical work for enabling MCD on L2. There is quite a lot of work here. This includes technical documentation governance processes and the documentation and understanding of message relaying. We need governance engagement with L2 liquidations and integration that ensures third parties participation. We have liquidity and involvement, but there is not much point in being in the space without the liquidity. Working with third parties market makers will be a key part of leading us to the MCD L2 implementations for Optimism and Arbitrary. Again, we have medium confidence here for the end of Q2; dependencies include audits and MCD deployment. There is quite a lot of work across the CoreUnit, hence the medium confidence. StarkNet has a slightly different implementation with DVD on the exact date there. I am sure Louis and the team will provide input on that as we get closer, have those audits, and understand the trust assumptions of the approver.  31:48  That is the high-level roadmap we are working towards all of these steps in the tiny thumbnail that I showed earlier. They have a breakdown of individual tasks that we work through. On the next slide, I wanted to reiterate that the vertical engineering L2 team will be deploying Optimism by Wormhole to Kovan Testnet next week, which is awesome. Stay tuned for more updates on this and opportunities to test. We will have more news on this soon as it is a massive move towards the milestone overall, and keep an eye out for this one, which is cool. Just a reminder: next week, Bartek and the political engineering team will be holding a multi-chain strategy meeting. We will discuss those risk considerations I mentioned on the previous slide, scaling Dai beyond roll-ups; the key participants of this meeting will be protocol engineering, risk, growth, to continue the discussions we have had already. I also see value in the community and delegates. We mentioned the CoreUnit on one of the first slides there, but it is broader than that; it is community and delegates. This will be a good opportunity for that broader communication.   Collateral Management On-Chain (CMON) Status Update 33:48  David Utrobin: On-chain collateral management has a handful of involved stakeholders, mainly CU, Comm SAS, Risk, Protocol engineering, CES, SES, Growth, and Oracles. Many people are involved in our chain collateral management, a key part of the MakerDAO business. In the work breakdown phase of our stakeholder alignment calls, we have identified six significant milestones, the fifth one we asked for the last call, so forgive us for not updating the milestone numbers. The first is to deliver the next major revision for the collateral onboarding process. The current process is a little bit outdated. It does not scale as well as we would like it to, etc. Milestone Two is liquidations infrastructure cleanup, which involves sanity checking ourselves on the auctions infrastructure that exists, ensuring the handoff tests to SAS, and more. I will cover a little more detail. Milestone three is to onboard curved stake ETH through this renewed process that maps all the touchpoints of the different CUs involved in launching collateral; we want to integrate our public communications around collateral onboarding, etc. Milestone four is to fully define the criteria for collateral offboarding. This is important for regular business practice. A vault exists and there is Dai does not mean that it is necessarily profitable. For example, overhead costs, like Oracles, may make it unworth it. We are skipping milestone five and going straight into six and seven. These are more bonus milestones, but the goal is to fully clean out the stable coin vaults in the next two quarters, not just TUSD, the old USDC vaults, and more. Lastly, there is a desire and milestone for gas optimizations for the PSM. For the first milestone, I created a little legend at the bottom right: yellow dot means progress, blue dot means pending, and green means have done.   2840\u00d71552 258 KB   In general, these are the big components, which have mapped out work breakdowns under each. I will go through it briefly. One is to provide the renewed criteria for onboarding admittance and prioritization for the next six applications. There is also a review of the diagram and process currently hosted at the Collateral Maker.com site. Once the new processes are drafted, we must communicate them with the existing greenlit application authors; there must be complete process documentation. Then we have to determine the formal role of SES in liquidations and auctions; this is ongoing. According to this new criteria and process, we also need to prioritize collateral types with a two-quarter-time horizon. Lastly, we need to attach the parallel work stuff. That has to happen on the engineering side, like crafting spells and partner relations. That is the general overview. The second milestone is the liquidations infrastructure cleanup. First of all, we need to collect relevant information to determine the pinpoints that are currently in progress. We also have to ensure that SES has full ownership over the process of extending auction services that are also in progress. We also have to ensure relevant infrastructures are up to date and risk minimized, which is a big part of our work this past week due to Flappy Friday. Lastly, we need to clarify and document auctions and liquidations aspects in the different lifecycle steps. The third milestone is to onboard crvstETH. These components are part of every single onboarding. There is a MIPS six application, Greenlight poll; the collateral is chosen as the next priority by the teams. Then there are collateral assessments that have to happen: the Oracle risk and smart contracts assessments. Then, after that happens, there is a governance poll. After the governance poll passes, various implementations have to happen, and that is where there are many cross CU touchpoints. About a month before the projected launch of collateral, there needs to be an established partner initiative, so we reach out to the collateral partner to organize all of the needed comms and any special promotions. Lastly, there is the final deployment and activation. This is more like the previous milestones; there are a lot of overlapping steps. However, this is a lot more sequential. Maybe it is easier to follow than the other ones.  40:04  As you can see, we are close. We are in the implementation stage, and it will happen soon, likely at the end of February. Milestone four is to define the criteria for collateral offboarding fully. CES\u2019s Robert Jordan facilitates the initial discussions in progress. Other CUs involved are Risk Oracles and Growth. There is also an initial draft document that is in progress to define these. After that, there will be a few feedback rounds that the document goes through. Also, access to it will be expanded to other stakeholders. Finally, a forum post for public feedback before the final documentation is republished. Ignore milestone five. These are some bonus milestones that we added last week after reviewing the major milestones. Milestone six will fully clean out the stable coin vaults as I covered. Milestone seven is the gas optimizations for the PSM. It is in the backlog, but the goal is to get it done by the end of Q2.   Collateral Management Off-Chain (CMOFF) Status Update 41:30  I also happen to be the coordinator on the Collateral management off-chain stakeholder alignment calls, so here is the status update for those. The involved CUs include Real-World Finance, SES, CS, Growth, StarkNet, Risk, and us, GovComms. Here is the overview of the milestones. The goal for the next two quarters is to lead the existing deals through the due diligence pipeline, not all the deals, just the most feasible ones. Milestones two is to graduate the different real-world asset-related CUS from the SES incubation program. Milestone three is to develop shared documentation around leading these deals: what are the common touchpoints? What are the things that we could standardize around these deals? What are the things that are essentially different for each deal? Milestone four is a revamp of MIP6 in partnership with CES. There is a revamp being planned, in general, for MIPS six applications to do more pre-filtering of applicants so that they know the criteria ahead of time. If they do not fit it, they should not be applying. They should fulfill the criteria before the application hits the forum. Milestone five is the infrastructure solution design. This is the technical and user experience side of interacting with these deals. When we set up a real-world asset deal, what is the client experience? What are the UIs they use? What is the backend stuff that has to happen? Let us move into the details. To lead existing deals through the due diligence pipeline, the timelines for these deal completions will be withheld until they go through. This is important because significant partners do not want this. They do not want timelines because that exposes them to insider trading, just like there are real-world considerations for tremendous partners around being public on timelines for these kinds of things. As a result, they will be withheld.  44:30  Big partners and deals, especially public companies and sensitive timelines, find it important to withhold timelines. Timelines change, and people trade accordingly. Until the deal is done, MakerDAO will not know that it is well done, but rest assured, progress is happening. The two main components of this milestone are the work breakdowns. We have very high granularity on the two major deals we are focusing on and all the others to varying degrees. Additionally, much progress has been made on defining all the touchpoints for CUs and other stakeholders involved in each deal. The two primary deals focused on for this milestone are SocGen and Monetalis. There is a parallel set of components for each of these deals. First of all, the business side of the partnership has to be solved; there has to be a point of contact for the partner and multiple point people depending on the part of the deal. An agreement on the term sheet has to happen. Legal engagement with partners counterparties has to happen. Components of the transaction need to be mapped out and documented. After all that, the IT infrastructure integration has to be planned and mapped out. While this is happening, usually after the term sheet agreement and the legal engagement with counterparties and the components of the transactions, the risk work can happen. All of these things are in progress for both SocGen and Monetalis. That is the basic overview. The purpose is to educate our stakeholders on the complexity of the work. The second milestone is to graduate the different real-world asset-related CUs from the SES incubation program; this will be a key step for Maker succeeding in the real-world asset space. We need to upgrade our operations regarding handling these deals. Three main real-world asset-related core units are in the works. The first one is the real asset portfolio Core Unit incubator with Will Remor as a facilitator. We also have the real-world asset, legal review Core Unit. The facilitator, TBD, works with Christian Peterson. Lastly, we have a compliance CU, which is facilitated or will be facilitated by the prosperity. Each of these is in various stages. So the first one is to get the starter agreements in place. This is part of the incubation program itself. After the incubation program, OKRs are set up; then the bootstrapping OKRs are set up. After that, finally, the team publishes their MIPS set MIP 39, 40, and 41 sub proposals, which govern the facilitator. The 39 is the mandate, 40 is the budget, and 41 is the facilitator. Lastly, the graduation is marked by the reception of the first payment from the protocol. That means that they are ratified, sailing full speed ahead, and no longer a part of the incubation program. So likewise, the Real World Asset Legal Review Core Unit is at an earlier stage than the previous Core Unit I mentioned. It is in progress looking for a facilitator candidate. In the meantime, SES has to implement a temporary budget to ensure that it can fund this particular Core Unit. After that, all of the other components have to happen. Finally, there is a lending compliance Core Unit with a precarious that would be facilitator, the starter agreements are in place, and it is currently in its incubation program, OKRs and bootstrapping OKRs phase. Those are all happening, and the MIP set has not been published yet. Stay tuned for that.   Team-Led Discussion  Upgrading Surplus Auctions (FLAPs) 50:40  David Utrobin: This is a pertinent topic because of the liquidations on Friday. Surplus auctions underperformed and incurred, according to Proses\u2019 analysis, an average of 20% slippage overall. The community acted quickly through governance to pause them in order for the DAO to take a step back and consider their next steps. The next lowest hanging fruit is the rate limiter. Sam has already built some code for it, which seems to be in the pipeline. The real open questions around us are whether Dutch auctions are a high priority. This is what liquidations 2.0 did for collateral auctions. I converted them from English auctions into Dutch auctions. That same consideration is happening for FLAP auctions. I will pause and give it over to anybody who wants to comment.   Options for Resource Investment 52:35  851\u00d7444 81.6 KB   UltraSchuppi: Over the past couple of months, the community sentiment was a strong favorite over doing some burning. I have been advocating for no burn for quite some time, but at some point, I realized there is no majority for doing that. From there, the whole idea of looping back the surplus buffer was born. If we do not have any majority on reverting this plan to something different, like no burning at all, we should default to coming back to the looping option. I do not like this option, but it is the current sentiment. Therefore, I put up the signal to bring back the bond. I would personally like to see a majority within the signal request not to do this. However, there are good things about occasionally doing at least a bit of burn. If we want a bit of burn, we should prepare ourselves following the rate-limiting that Sam put up. We have two main questions. Do we stray away from our path of the past months and decide to have an insanely high surplus buffer? This will ensure that we will not go to interfacing again. Or do we stick to our current path with some burn? We would then need to prepare ourselves by contributing to local engineers working on different things. In the end, there are priority questions. What are our opportunity costs of distracting protocol engineers from their roadmap? We must ask ourselves that question.  54:49  David Utrobin: Kurt Berry spoke a lot about this in the forum. How do you increase the connection between what Maker holders want, what is wise, and what PE and other engineering teams need to prioritize? Many potentially higher priorities are on the table, even from the layer two initiative update. Over the last few quarters, the risk team has identified this risk with the FLAP. This was not something that people did not expect. Everybody knew this was going to happen in the event of a large liquidation event. It is an interesting operational and governance question; how do we balance that need for prioritization? Also, how do Core Units push back with reasoning? This is a big aspect of this conversation that potentially scales other future issues. Wouter frames it nicely: the better question is should we prioritize X? Should we prioritize Dutch auctions? And if we do, should we deprioritize Y? Why should we favor Dutch auctions? There is much debate around Dutch auctions. One part of it was the prioritization piece. Another part asks if it makes sense to do Dutch auctions, given that they introduce Oracle costs to the FLAPs.  Niklas Kunkel: There are no extra Oracle costs, but there is an extra risk because the auctions do not have Oracle\u2019s dependency. That is almost seen as protection against an Oracle attack. Wait, we would not need an MRK Oracle, so there are Oracle costs. Let us factor in at least 300k annually for an MKR Oracle. This can be a bit expensive. However, we can think of this in terms of slippage. We have a five percent slippage and expect better performance through Dutch auctions. So, instead of five percent, we have two and a half percent slippage. If you take the Oracle cost and divide it by two and a half percent slippage, the inflection point is about 12 million. This nets out an economic advantage if you think you will do burns greater than our current burning scale.    58:42  UltraSchuppi: I have been asking for the cap for quite some time already. It is not about the time frame (2-3 months) of when this can come. It is about many resources are we going to bind with this initiative? If only Dereck must do the extra work, I am fine with that. However, I am not okay with taking three engineers out of his team. I am exaggerating again, Derek. The concern is the time frame and our inactions and recognizing the delay. Honestly, I do not think we should burn at all. Should we optimize for perfect burning and rethink our attitude about the burning amount in the first place? One of the questions should be to allow some burning to take place. Derek said in some forum posts that it would take a couple of weeks until we have optimized the rate-limiting Flapper in place. I am fine with not having a couple of weeks of burning. Is this going to bind to engineers\u2019 full time? Or is this just waiting for some audits and then spending a couple of days on the results? How much is it hurting Derek to engage in this process? He probably supports it if he says it is reasonable and makes sense. I will wait for his advice.  1:00:33  Mark: We should not divert any resources to implementing improvement on the FLAP design but instead be 100% focused on making Maker and Dai a better product. Designing is a waste of time. Figuring out a way to optimize Maker burning does not do anything for our customers and is 100% selfish for Maker holders. It will drive significantly less value long term, especially when we can better allocate that capital by hiring more resources, particularly developers. I am firmly against allocating any significant number of resources (really any resources at all) to building a more robust burning mechanism.  David Utrobin: For context, Mark Phillips is the new facilitator strategic clients Core Unit. Mark: I speak as a personal person outside of the Core Unit.    1:01:46  Niklas Kunkel: Rune will publish his new version of the previous tokenomics revamp, and having looked at it, it does not have a burning mechanism.  David Utrobin: I have conflicting information there, Nik. Even in the governance chat room, I thought Rune said it preserves burn, but the goal is to alter that mechanism over five to seven years. Niklas Kunkel: Interesting, things must have changed. But still, until we know how we are going to change the tokenomics, it does not make sense to invest a bunch of resources into a mechanism that may not even exist anymore in six months to a year. If you invest resources into building something, it should be around for at least a couple of years. That would make sense. It would not make sense to create something that you will discard soon. We can do a band-aid type fix. Rate limiting seems like a good idea in avoiding the 15-20% or worse slippage days. You completely solve the zero-bidding problem. However, it is not worth the resources to completely redesign a flapper to get the five percent slippage down to something less. There is low-hanging fruit here, a rate limiter in resources invested in fixing the core problem to a certain degree.    1:03:46  Brian McMichael: This was also the first time this had happened. Since Friday, several community members have upgraded existing tools and have built new tools to participate in these auctions. So, the real problem was that we had too many of them go out at once. We showed the community a 20% discount available here overall, which is essentially offering a coupon to keepers.   Related Considerations 1:04:47  834\u00d7458 124 KB   David Utrobin: I hear a common sentiment from the engineering teams and a few key people. Do recognized delegates on the call have any considerations towards this prioritization question? There are also some related considerations. For example, what can improve with the FLAPs besides rate-limiting? Are there parameter updates that can be adjusted? There is also a topic in the governance channel and other discussions. This is hiring a third/external party not just for market-making OTC but also for managing surplus auctions, perhaps completely off protocol. That is another interesting thread of conversation around this whole topic. I wanted to pause there and read what Brian was saying. His point was that new tooling has existed since Friday to manage FLAPs better. After each event, the system battle hardens itself by bringing in new participants who want to close the Alpha gap. This is very true\u2014the beauty of anti-fragile.  1:06:22  Unknown: I am in favor of keeping a high surplus buffer. If we want to go back to some burning activity, sending it to a centralized party market may sound weird, but it is not a bad idea. They can do more efficient market-making; that is their whole thing. They also have smaller feeds than the three to four percent we get on the flapper. This is only if we want to go that route. Preferably, we want the high surplus but do not worry about it. It is not an issue, and we have got higher priorities.  1:07:45  Kirk: There is a third position between paying some centralized entity, continuing to the FLAP, or leaving no solution for market-making by establishing protocol-owned liquidity. You would buy back MKR through some mechanism, then create Dai MKR LPs owned by the protocol on its balance sheet. This has a lot of beneficial effects across the whole ecosystem by making MKR a more liquid asset. That is important because MKR is part of the tokenomics of the Maker system. Subsidizing that liquidity in some way is also essential; when the protocol owns it, it can be trustless. There is no other third party to interface with. It would be less capital efficient than a decentralized market Maker and does not touch centralized exchanges. However, an active arbitrage community is looking to extract energy from the chain. Our that arbitrage with centralized exchanges will take care of itself if there is depot and chain liquidity. People should keep that in mind as a third option market-making front or use surplus buffer for MKR liquidity.  1:09:35  Chris Mooney: Some of the mandated actors heard my arguments about this. There are no dumpster fires to put out, but there are a lot of comments to address here. In this case, we will be better off staying focused on the problem of too many auctions going off at once and fixing it. How do we fix that? We rate limited. There is almost no impact on rate-limiting because it is not like a liquidation to take losses. It is the lowest hanging fruit to implement, and we also do not drag in the additional burning questions. I will put up a passionate defense of some amount of burn because our game theory is based on that. I do not want to drag in this additional argument. The mandated actors heard me make this argument in response to Jasu\u2019s comments. I think even Rune and Sam are in favor of this. We should not pick a direction where we take the protocol elements and put them on more humans. This breeds centralization and creates weakness. We want to do is keep pushing towards automation and decentralization. We are so close on this, just a couple of tweaks, and it is okay. It does not make sense to farm this out to some human. I like to think of the protocol as like the Hoover Dam. Some neutrino bomb goes off, and all the humans die. How long after that does the Hoover Dam continue to operate? Due to some attack, how long can we get the protocol to continue to operate with complete automation? I like thinking about that as a way to drive future development. This also frees our time to work on new stuff like L2 expansion.  1:11:59  Unknown: I will take the other side, a centralized Maker. Even with this fix, we are taking three to four percentage slippages. That does not sound like a lot, but that is 103 to 104 million in losses. If we want to turn on some amount of burn, having ideological purity with not having centralized parties in all aspects can be damaging\u2014bottom line. The FLAP is not about restlessness and decentralization. The goal of it is to burn the most Maker. If shipping it to a centralized party in a streaming fashion will burn more Maker, I think that is a good thing. We must look at what our risk exposure is. In the worst-case scenario, they start stealing Dai. Then we turn it off. We can do that in a two-day delay, so the most they can steal is about 200k. We are losing that amount already just by the FLAPs\u2019 inefficiency.  1:13:54  Chris: I support what Chris Mooney said and add an additional clarifying point. The more nuanced problem is that too many auctions hit the market simultaneously. Within that was not enough time to react to those auctions. There is something that is not being discussed here. Increasing the auction duration would have given us (and the market) more time to react. In addition to the rate-limiting, is there a small tweak in zero engineering effort other than writing the spell that would help harden this aspect? Then we can focus on efficiency, the surplus buffer, and using the resources for growth outside of this one-off emergency to alleviate the problems that caused this particular incident.  Kirk: I need to jump in and provide a counterpoint. It was not just a problem that too many auctions went out at once. The English auction mechanism for FLAPs is fundamentally sub-optimal for the blockchain environment. It has broken game theory that is centralizing and encourages winner take all dynamics, even if you limit the rate at which they go out. That is a rather technical discussion for a call like this. I am posting this thread in the chat from the forum. I encourage everyone who wants to have an opinion on this to read every single reply under that thread and understand the entire discussion of how the FLAP auction mechanism is fundamentally centralizing, anti-competitive, and broken. A compromise that is a band-aid and trickles it out is okay because some people insist on burning and others do not. However, I push back that the only problem is too many auctions went out at once. Too many went out at once, and we do not have a scalable or effective long-term mechanism.    1:16:22  Mark: I have several points to make on this subject. First, with Rune likely releasing the new tokenomics, I do not see any rush to get back to burning immediately. Is this even relevant? If the community loves it, we need some time to assess which direction to go. We also need to take a step back and think about what drives value to Maker. To me, it is our long-term cash flow generation. In the stock market, you will see cyclical companies like auto, steel, and other commodities with extremely low PE ratios because they go through boom-and-bust cycles, just like crypto today. The income fluctuates significantly. You may see Ford with a PE ratio of six at the peak of the cyclical market. Simultaneously, you have businesses not affected by market cycles, such as Procter & Gamble and Costco, with a PE ratio of 25 or 30 in normal times. Part of the issue with Maker today is that our incomes rely on these boom-and-bust cycles for crypto. This may or may not be changing. Regardless, one of the biggest things we need to prioritize is investing in real-world assets. This will require a lot of capital. Firstly, real-world assets have hundreds of trillions of the total addressable market. Second, it is entirely uncorrelated to crypto markets. The valuation will increase when you have income streams that are not correlated. There will be more stability in the income that will drive the protocol. I hate to see us burn MKR today when there are so many different things we can reinvest in. Chris and Kurt made some comments in the forum for items they would love to do today. However, we do not have the resources to do it from the technical side. I favor increasing the surplus buffer because that will allow us to invest more in real-world assets and take upon more risk when onboarding real-world assets.  Luca: I wanted to double down on your two points. Firstly, what you said on the corporate finance side is essential. The simplest way for non-corporate finance experts to consider it is by paying out capital outside the protocol. We implicitly admit that we do not have better ways to use that capital internally. This is not the case for a protocol with growth potential, such as Maker. As Mark suggested, we could use that capital in many ways to expand the revenues of the protocol. Now I move on to my other points. In normal crypto markets, you can buy back and expect a positive impact on price. Crypto markets are not there yet. Our current effort is insufficient to sustain the price and is not a good use of capital at this stage of the crypto markets. I agree with Mark\u2019s second point regarding real-world finance. Firstly, we have huge potential to grow in several avenues that will require capital, so it is better to keep that capital within the protocol. Secondly, we should not forget that we are running a currency. And we have seen what happens in a currency that keeps a very thin buffer, like Abracadabra, for example. We should never forget that it is much better to sacrifice some yield for MKR holders. It is not even there yet because the markets are not mature enough to appreciate us buying back the token to get some extra buffer inside. Our credibility as a protocol is that our asset number one. All the elements favor keeping these resources within the protocol to ensure better buffer efficiency and incentivize MKR holders.    1:21:38  Makerman: I want to echo Luca here. Companies will buy back their stock because they have nothing better to invest in. This is particularly true of dividend companies because they will pay themselves dividends, loosely speaking. However, it is also true earnings. You buy back when your PE is low and sell when PE is high. Buying back Makers is not helping us for price. This is a political issue other than anything else. To Chris\u2019s point, building an SB buffer here is good for Maker holders because it means we are covering ourselves in a loss event in the loosest sense. We are building cash as an asset against dilution related to a loss risk profile. As Luca and Mark said, we have better investments that can net us higher returns than even the excellent PE that Maker has right now. We need to do this when times are good, and we need to bank some cash for when times are bad. It is a real financial thing, but it is becoming a political issue. These two things are battling quite strongly, and I would like to settle it. I am also sensitive to comments about how we do not have engineering. Well, fine. Let us not burn and build cash. If we get lots of cash, we can decide to do it when we have engineering and time. If things are deficient in the environment, we will not have a lot of things to work on. We can fix stuff in the protocol after.  Chris: Growing surplus buffer helps us grow revenue. This is long-term thinking. Burning Maker is short-sighted thinking. Based on this discussion, I feel there is a need for a chain vault for the whole DAO. Our burn versus surplus buffer strategy is for the next year, not two months. All the teams need to plan appropriately so this will not change too often. We are missing something like this: why would you work on better FLAP actions when it is not used next year?     Conclusion  David Utrobin 1:24:32  I want to note the time; it is 30 past the last top of the hour. I want to thank everybody who came for the call and those who participated in the discussion. Thanks to Derek for putting together the awesome update. I will stop the recording here, but I will keep the room open for maybe another 10-15 minutes for people wanting to continue to conversation.

This is our first meeting of the New Year. I hope everyone enjoyed their time off. Hopefully, everyone\u2019s excited and back and ready to get back into Maker. I will do the usual preamble. We like to hear from people in this meeting, so feel free to comment or ask questions. We are recording, so try not to talk over each other too much. As always, be polite and respectful of other participants. This week, we have our governance roundup and a couple of presentations. We will look back at 2021 then take a brief look ahead to 2022. We also have a presentation from Deco on what their core unit has been doing; I believe talking about the DSS gate, which is one of the important smart contracts related to the fixed rate.

If you think of having a yet unposted proposal entering this Governance cycle, you still have six days until January 12th. Before I close, I mentioned several recommendations in RFC MIP 16-61. Please give them a rate if you have not yet and leave some feedback. Thank you.   Forum at a Glance  Artem Gordon 5:49 Post: Forum at a Glance: December 16th, 2021 - January 6th, 2022 Video: Forum at a Glance  Team-led Discussions  David Utrobin  2021 Recap, Metrics, and Looking Ahead to 2022 11:39  1676\u00d7934 105 KB   Before I get us kicked off, I wanted to highlight the importance of looking back and recognizing just where the protocols started in 2021, where they ended in 2021, and the massive occurrences in-between. As Artem mentioned in Ace\u2019s post, we have increased our revenues by 20 fold since 2020. But really, we progressed so much more than that. And this is an attempt to capture most of it. I missed in the recap all the core units that we have onboarded. So before I start on the first official slide after this, I wanted to say we have onboarded 18 different core units this year, which is Herculean.   1682\u00d7942 93.9 KB   Q1 2021 was pivotal. We had news of the Maker foundation dissolving. Likewise, as an ex-foundation member myself, internally, many of the people from the Foundation broke off. Some left, some started their own CUs, others became contributors. It was an extremely pivotal moment. For the life of Maker, we had the Foundation bootstrapping us. The real goal was to step back once the protocol was self-sufficient. I think that is what we will achieve in 2021. As a result, the Maker foundation dissolved, actually ahead of schedule, which is incredible.   1684\u00d7936 142 KB   1682\u00d7940 123 KB   With the dissolution of the Foundation, we also had the sunset of the development grants program. In its place this year, we have seen several different tools for doing grants through Maker, not through the Foundation. We have seen the special purpose fund MIP come about. We have witnessed SES, the core unit that does incubations and various grants, come about. We have also seen different core units doing their micro-grants and granting programs. Thankfully, Maker is still really healthy on the grants side.   1690\u00d7922 74.8 KB   1678\u00d7934 96 KB   Continuing their dissolution process, the Maker Foundation returned a huge portion of the debt fund holdings to the DAO, leaving themselves just a bit for operating expenses and whatever else. That was also a cool pivotal moment to see that good faith from the Foundation. And they were seeding Maker with what it currently has in its treasury, around 84,000 MKR.   1700\u00d7932 93 KB   1690\u00d7936 78.7 KB   1686\u00d7942 105 KB   In Q3, we had another awesome product innovation, the Aave direct deposit module, the D3M. The D3M is not exclusive to Aave. We consider other ways to implement the D3M mechanism to spread Dai\u2019s prevalence in DeFi.   1686\u00d7942 101 KB   1692\u00d7928 97.3 KB   This has greatly improved our throughput in governance. Since the launch of this program, we have seen an incredible increase in efficiency for passing executive votes and discussing topics for bringing up issues. The spawning of this type of DAO member has been very pivotal to 2021 as well.   1686\u00d7946 106 KB   1690\u00d7948 99.3 KB   1686\u00d7942 107 KB   As a result of a lot of Governance action and a concern about the over-concentration of USDC-backed Dai, governance took many steps to reduce that. Including onboarding new PSMs. Factoring in the group that sets rates or proposes rates through monetary policy, trying to make generating Dai from non-stables a bit more attractive, etc. And as a result, USDC\u2019s collateralization fell below 26% from its high of 55%. That was a great success story for diversifying backing collateral. But of course, it is back up to 45%. Thanks to this looming market crash.      1690\u00d7942 99.3 KB   Another pivotal thing we saw in Q4 is an infusion of vision by one of the cofounders of MakerDAO, originally Rune Christiansen. He published the case for clean money, advocating for a whole different class of collateral that should be prioritized, mainly ESG collateral positive for environmental impact worldwide. It is also a subset of real-world assets. And likewise, part of his vision includes a redesign of MKR tokenomics. And really, he proposed many exciting ideas that I believe many of us are still chewing on and thinking on and eventually hopefully will implement in an ideal sort of way. And I believe Rune is gearing up to post a refined version of this vision sometime this year.   1690\u00d7946 125 KB   Monkey Irish, the collateral engineering services core unit facilitator, is an ex-Foundation employee presented beyond the Maker Foundation, the past, present, and future at ETH Portland. And the reason I put this on here because I feel like his talk resonates with a lot of the people who went from being at the Foundation, centralized sort of company bootstrapping Maker to being an independently funded core unit, amongst many at a DAO. This transition from a centralized company to a decentralized organization is interesting. It resonates with me, and I think it resonates with many other core unit facilitators. We are really on the bleeding edge here. We give a huge pat on the back to people engaging and making a career out of their involvement here at Maker.   1690\u00d7942 89.6 KB   1692\u00d7944 111 KB   2021 also saw the first few offboarding of collaterals. Business is business. Gas costs, particularly on layer 1, have gotten more expensive, leading to the offboarding of specific collaterals. This is important for the maintenance of the protocol, and it is important as a process to solidify and nail down.   1690\u00d7936 95.7 KB   1694\u00d7950 88.2 KB   We also had another amazing product innovation: the Maker wormhole official release. This breakthrough was designed to get around layer two and bridge deposit delays. It spawned this new way of thinking about getting Dai minted and efficiently transferred to other layer twos.   1686\u00d7942 86.2 KB   1686\u00d7934 135 KB   If I missed anything major, please DM me. We did try to cover most of everything. Let us move on to the next part of the segment. Here are some interesting Governance metrics that we pulled. If you are interested in where we pulled them from, you could go into the presentation linked in the forum agenda for this call. And you can go to the slide and click on those links below. They are great.   1690\u00d7942 120 KB   1692\u00d7936 144 KB   1690\u00d7938 135 KB   Another interesting thing is that the first poll in 2021 passed with around 67,000 Maker and 25 unique voters. The final one passed with approximately 80,000 MKR but with about half as many unique voters, 17. This outcome resulted from increased gas costs, which deterred many smaller voters from voting in every single vote. It was also affected by the introduction of the delegates. We have a more consistent cohort of people, albeit a smaller cohort voting. Many of these smaller voters who might have been voting themselves have delegated and entrusted various recognized delegates to vote on their behalf. And nevertheless, we are seeing a steady but healthy amount of MKR voting in the governance contract. But of course, one of our goals for the series is to increase that.   1686\u00d7946 170 KB   1684\u00d7936 146 KB   Looking ahead towards 2022, I wanted to ask what the focuses are for this year. Since 2017, we have evolved a lot as a protocol, as Maker. So we put these slides together because we took all of the various core unit updates and roadmaps. Then, we parsed them out and organized everything into the various higher-level initiatives at Maker, which GovComms is working pretty hard to map out.   1686\u00d7940 156 KB   The first big-ticket item is layer twos. MakerDAO has three different L2s focused on; Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. In reality, it can get a lot more. We can get a lot wider coverage with layer twos with Wormhole, so I am very excited about the Wormhole.   1670\u00d7942 100 KB   1676\u00d7836 186 KB   1684\u00d7940 142 KB   1688\u00d7948 177 KB   1686\u00d7932 181 KB   1684\u00d7936 140 KB   1682\u00d7944 121 KB   We have operational security audits planned. This will help safeguard core units from hacks and exploits and ensure everybody is mindful about their OpSec.   1680\u00d7938 135 KB   If you have not checked out the risk dashboard by our risk core unit here at Maker, I highly recommend checking it out.   1684\u00d7934 177 KB   1680\u00d7938 138 KB   We also have special-purpose funds, which have not been ratified yet. There are a number of them in RFC leftover from last year. One of them is a legal fund, which provides legal funding for the protection of DAO members to fund the legal opinions and various other legal initiatives. We have a Singaporean jurisdiction study to source real-world asset deals from Singapore. And we also have RealDAO, which focuses on decentralized SPV infrastructure in the works. And I think one thing I might have forgotten about for growth is more videos, from content production on tutorials, how to interact with us, how to vote, basically how do we educate our would-be stakeholders to come into MakerDAO and participate.   Deco-001  Vasmi Alluri  DSSGATE  710\u00d7406 67.6 KB   Hey, everyone, I am Vamsi from the Deco Fixed Rate CU. I have a quick update on our work since our proposal acceptance in early December, particularly on a module that we have just finished designing and implementing. Later, when we launch, it can interestingly integrate Maker. We have yet to form a legal entity on the operation side, but it is underway. On the technical side, we have taken all the extensive feedback received on a proposal and are almost done with integration redesign. We have finished designing and implementing the DSS gate, which came out of discussions with the SES and PE team. During November/December of last year, priorities lay in teams like Deco getting involved with parallel smart contract development to lower the amount of work added to like teams (unlocking) and get work done faster (parallel development).   691\u00d7386 35 KB   DSS gate sounds ominous and a little vague. However, a gate here simply means an access gate that opens an access permit. It is a governance tool to limit vats.suck integration risk. You may be asking why we are adding more stuff to governance by forcing governance to deal with vats.suck. We developed a small module that will further affect trade vaults integration. This is my take on Maker protocol control value and how we could use its standard to onboard more integrations. We took the SES project sandbox report recommendations published last November/December to deal with sensitive functions like vats.suck. We then condensed that into this DSS gate design, the design of gate high-level features, how governance could use this as a tool to make a protocol control valuable integration, and a couple of links to the codebase.   693\u00d7390 47 KB    We classify Maker liquidity into two buckets: the ilk and the suck bucket.    One small mistake will lose the surplus buffer and suck, for example, 10 billion or 1 trillion Dai. Getting authorization to VAT to obtain direct access suck is also scary. Last year we talked to SES, and they mentioned that there is no way to get direct access to suck from MCD VAT because of the many risks. They suggested a sandbox that limits the amount of risk Maker is taking on. If the sandbox says the total suck limit is1 million Dai, there is no way DECO can access more than 1 million Dai using that sandbox. If DECO or the integration just gets hacked for like 100 million Dai, the sandbox would block it, saving the entire Maker protocol from that risk. We took that concept, and then we tried to implement it.   691\u00d7387 44.4 KB    Any integration that needs access to suck needs additional upfront work into auditing the integration completely to ensure that it does not impose risks. The primary reason is that VAT has almost a binary approval process. When it gives access to a smart contract, it authorizes that smart contract to call all restricted functions and an unlimited amount of Dai out of that. DSS gate acts as an intermediary between that particular sub-call. A gate contract does two things. First, it implements a dollar amount as a type of token approval. Second, it implements a back-off balance.    Questions 58:07  Nikolaj Lollike: This is a potent design pattern, and it is excellent to see it being used now. It can also really help in terms of parallelization of work. As Brian wrote in the chat, the issue with adding new modules to the mega protocol today is the binary authorization system. If we grant authorization on the VAT, it has full authorization on all the functions and has no limitations. The written code limits it, but we need to extensively review and audit that code. If we want a lot of external contributions, the sandbox pattern is very powerful because we can limit the integration surface to the specific functions that integrators would need. We can also impose the certain limits that Vamsi mentioned, for example, a 5 million limit for suck. We discussed this when I presented this exact topic to our team at CES. We will also look into doing some of this for collateral onboarding. When onboarding new collateral types, you are also messing with many parts of the Maker protocol that external teams cannot do. When building a spell, you have root access to all parameters. There are no limits to what harm you can do. When you are building a new adapter, you are getting authorization on the VAT. There are places where we can make a neat integration surface that can improve the overall security of the mega protocol and decrease the time to market. We will not necessarily need to verify every single line of code, and we can minimize the attack vector. If anyone is interested in knowing more about this, please reach out.  1:00:32  Vamsi Alluri: To answer Frank\u2019s question in the chat, the right way to do things is one integration per gate. Although nothing stops ten integrations from practicing the same gate, the right way to deal with this is to deploy one for integration and then operate directly on top of the approval limits. This is like a lack of balance. A backup balance may not even be needed. Those decisions are to be based on integration.  1:01:04  Brian McMichael: How do the repayments work on this? Or do you envision this as a one-way suck?  Vamsi Alluri: The suck itself is one way. If integration has to repay it, they could transfer Dai to pause proxy. For the backup balance, you can essentially implement a withdrawal condition. Governance could load it up with 100,000 Dai and then declare it will only deal with this Dai at the end of the quarter. Before the end of the quarter, the backup balance cannot move. The integration can only access it, and the government cannot take it back. But after the end of the quarter, governance can now withdraw Dai back. When it is a backup balance, you do not use it as a primary one. The suck is one way, and if the integration has to give it back, it will push it out. We tried not to add any requirements on the integration to implement any of these limit checks. We replicated the suck interface so that the gate would look exactly like what we did to them. They would not have any else inside the integration to handle this.    1:02:41  David Utrobin: I have a question about how this relates to the DSS vest contracts. The DSS vest draws directly from the surplus buffer through the suck. If we were to upgrade the DSS best to include a DSS gate, it would create an intermediate step. Instead of sucking directly from the surplus buffer, it would suck from the gate contract. Then, the gate contract would hold that balance in the interim and consistently re-up it over time as it gets depleted. Is that the right way of thinking about it?  Vamsi Alluri: Maybe not. The goal is not to aid every single suck call. The goal is about things like joint adapters and DSS vests. These contracts can be audited once to ensure that the suck calls coming from these contracts will not do anything shady or high risk. You can create a contract that is already risk-limited. Once you create a website, it is about redeploying the same thing repeatedly to handle different payments. So, there is no need for the gate contract to step in again. A gate would not benefit from being between something like a DSS vest or joint adapter. Small and well-tested contracts can continue to use vat.suck correctly. This is more about, let us say, an integration like Deco that is a large protocol, from the Maker protocol perspective, is completely new and not sufficiently well tested. However, there is an opportunity to go through quick parallel development, fast deployment, and testing. Outsiders can audit this vest contract. The question is how we get these large surface areas, like new smart contracts, from accessing vat.suck faster. The gate would be well tested and audited. Then, the actual protocol Deco could be audited down the road. However, it is almost like a chicken and egg situation. You will not be confident about Deco without testing it and accessing vat.suck. But then you cannot do that because giving untested protocol access is scary. David Utrobin: To reiterate, simple contracts that suck calls like that are low risk. You do not need to do a DSS gate because it is additional gas and simply unnecessary. But the DSS gate enables you to integrate with way more complex external modules without worrying if those modules are 1,000% foolproof. You can limit your risks while also doing the due diligence of auditing mechanisms. At a minimum, you can limit the risk. That makes sense, thank you.    1:06:20  Christopher Mooney: Imagine Maker goes to a hackathon and gives everybody a $25,000 balance to implement their project. We can give out ten different projects access to this $25,000 balance. There is also a guarantee that they cannot mess with the systems accounting or break anything. We do not have to do a full audit. The idea is that some will prove themselves, so we then increase their balances. Eventually, we can find a more gas-efficient implementation to find a product-market fit. However, this allows for a lot more experimentation. The paradigm I was thinking of views the Maker protocol as an operating system terminology. It is like kernel space. We add many modules to the kernel, and we need a system call interface that limits the damage that userspace can do to the kernel. So DSS gate is like the beginning of that restricted interface into kernel space.  Vamsi Alluri: People have questioned if the plan is to eventually remove gates after a couple of years when the integration is well tested and give direct access to vats.suck. Having a gate will still help due to the backup balance feature. Direct access to suck means Dai can straight disappear. All Maker governance has to do is deny the integration address, and then it will be gone. This can be abrupt for integrations. They thought about that in a way for deco. The deco protocol has many obligations for the next three months if that happens. These obligations would not be new issuances, but they would still be a mess. The gate can still be a long-term piece of that puzzle in this sense. The ability for Maker governance to hit rock bottom at any time can be mitigated by governance locking up a backer balance. They could put a stamp on it and lock up 1 million that cannot be taken out until the end of the quarter. No matter what we do, you have access to a million. In that sense, a gate can still be a long-term piece for integrations that demand that additional trust lessness from the Maker protocol side. It limits investment risks not just like for Deco but Maker integration.    1:10:43  David Utrobin: How do we manage the overhead costs of the protocol in the event of something like a Black Thursday, where the surplus buffer goes negative, and we must mint MKR to raise Dai? There were ideas about taking out funds from the surplus buffer and holding them in separate pools to ensure continuity of operations. Like mine, I know some core units have an operational continuity wallet for three or six months of operations. I wonder if the DssGate can be used as a limiter to retain the 20 million or 30 million in overhead liquidity. It is kept in and does not get removed from the surplus buffer. I am thinking about how we can improve our safeguarding operational continuity in the event of massive losses while not relying totally on diluting MKR to fund operations after the fact.  Nikolaj Lollike: You could upgrade it not to use the gate contract. That is one of the reasons why the interfaces are kept the same. From a technical point of view, you could. However, I am not sure we would ever want an external protocol directly accessing suck. David Utrobin: D3M is an ilk generator, right, not a suck generator? Vamsi Alluri: Yeah. That entire class of ilk is deposit-like collateral and then your access limit. The debt ceiling acts as a natural risk limiter, but that does not exist for vat.suck.    1:13:25  Vamsi Alluri: Someone else commented the other protocol access to Vat seems like a recipe for a bad time. There is something like this in the protocol-controlled value meme in that it has been an under-explored concept here at Maker. If you can manage the risk, try a couple of experiments, and see what happens.  1:14:05  Nikolaj: I want to point out the concept of quantifiable risk. We saw that compound had that weird governance bug. The empty contract saved them as they could only siphon comp from a specific smart contract. This was not a mint function. This is an example of a sandbox setup because there was a limit to how badly it could go. It was a high limit, so it was not good. But that is essentially the same concept here. When we implement new modules, DeFi is moving fast. We cannot formally verify everything and audit everything. We could, but we would not be able to innovate fast enough. Here, we can quantifiably risk managing new modules such that even if, in the worst case, we can say we would lose 5 million and not cause an emergency shutdown. It does not mean that security goes out the window. But in general, being able to quantify risk is helpful. If we were to authorize external modules on the Vat today, it would be hard to quantify risk because there is unrestricted access to do many bad things.  1:15:30  Christopher Mooney: We could get through an audit, but it would severely underestimate the amount of time it takes to audit something safely. We saw this with Centrifuge. They had a whole liquidation module designed, but when we finally started cracking it open, we learned it would take us many man-hours and times to grok this code fully. So then, it just made more sense to limit it with the RWA sandboxing. It is the same thing. We will get a lot more integrations and set lower debt ceilings if we have these more restricted modules. This is not as easy to do with collaterals that have liquidations turned on because the liquidations can violate the debt ceiling constraint. You may think that you cannot exceed the debt ceiling. But if you have liquidations, you get a chance to remove that debt ceiling. The first-order collateral types of liquidations are not easy to constrain in this way. But there is a range of integrations that do not require liquidations or manage their own. And if they go through this one interface, we can guarantee that the constraints hold. We can then do all kinds of integration safely.  Nikolaj: We are looking into the cumulative debt ceiling in CES; I am not sure it will solve the problems. But it could solve the case you are talking about where you keep maxing the debt ceiling and take out more Dai even though it is liquidated.     Conclusion  LongForWisdom 1:17:43   We still got a few minutes left. Are there any final questions or comments anybody wants to as before we wrap up for the day? Any shoutouts anybody wants to do for upcoming meetings or anything like that?  David Utrobin: Yeah, I will shout out the calendars that we have. We have votes and an important dates calendar that you could subscribe to. It is a public calendar. It includes all the important MIPS cycle dates and the various votes, both like governance polls and executive votes. We have a second calendar for calls, including public calls like this and semipublic calls, like stakeholder alignment meetings. We have begun listing them in public. They are not public per se, but you can request. If you are a stakeholder and you see an initiative relevant to you, you are welcome to request access. Subscribe to those two calendars. They are very helpful. I will post the links in the chat.    Perfect. Thank you, David. I know we have had a bit of a presentation-heavy meeting this week. I am still trying a little more discussion next week. We also wanted to get some lighter topics for these calls from the recognized delegates instead of the court units. If you are interested and have an issue you want to bring up in the next meeting, please reach out to David or me before the end of the day Thursday. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will talk to you all next week. Thanks, guys.  David Utrobin: Thanks, everyone. Happy New Year.

Should we have a review committee responsible for assisting with decisions for offboarding? The signal process for offboarding should be extended;  It\u2019s currently too short for such a significant and unique event We need additional and formalized intermediate steps   Currently, the offboarding process is harsh and public, which should be considered Offboarding should require accompanied responses containing financial and performance reviews of that CU and/or Facilitator We need more unified expectations for CUs rather than subjective and individualized expectations Rapid offboarding should only be implemented if there is actual damage done to the protocol There needs to be a balance between public and private discussion for such situations in consideration for PR and cleanliness  Potential legal repercussions also come into play with being \u201ctoo public\u201d   Paper has a public document being constructed to help revise and improve the offboarding process A revised offboarding process should be very specific and implement guardrails to prevent subjective opinions It\u2019s difficult to codify objectives for CUs when they may shift during the regular course of business However, the DAO is not a company and can\u2019t sign agreements. But can execute the decision of MKR holders  Makes the idea for recourse difficult DAO should possibly stay out of the internal affairs of CUs, and instead, the DAO should handle the macro but stay out of the micro affairs    Community desires:  More fair review process Definitions for bad behavior warranting swift offboarding vs. regular offboarding Voluntary communication steps on both a private and public level   \u201cWith great autonomy comes great responsibility\u201d - JustinCase, 2022   We need some kind of creative feedback framework between CUs and contributors  Please be patient for the full semi-transcription summary to this call!

I am Payton, I go by prose11, and I am one of the governance facilitators. I am happy to be here today, joined by many awesome Maker people and others interested in the vertical. In our weekly call, we talk about what is going on in governance, some of the risks the protocols face, and try to factor in some open discussion so the community can talk about the points that matter to them. This meeting is being recorded. We encourage you to speak up and engage in the conversation we have today. You can drop a note in the chat as we will monitor and incorporate things when appropriate.   Agenda and Preamble 02:05  We start with a Governance round-up going over current votes in MIPS and what has been going on in the forum in the last week. Then, a presentation/plan discussion board. We will talk about the offboarding process for CoreUnits and facilitators, what we can do better, their lessons learned, and general discussions on improving. If the time allows, there will be an open discussion to ask other questions at the end of the call.

As a note, it would be very helpful when we post up the discussion segment for the GNR calls. I typically post before the call in the Governance chat, asking for feedback and suggestions on prompts. Feel free to respond in the Governance channel if you want something specific listed. Today\u2019s topic is about the offboarding process for CUs and facilitators. We will focus on general issues, improvements, and suggestions. Delegates and facilitators, I encourage you to be the primary commenters on this and other stakeholders voters who might not be delegates necessarily. This is a question of organizational improvement, ways to make things better and less disruptive. Also, Paper Imperium is in partnership with GFX labs; they are putting together a MIP that has been shared with a few people about amending the existing offboarding process outlined in MIP 39, 40, and 41. Here is the first prompt. What components of an ideal policy for offboarding CUs prove to be unvital or not worth the spend? We have seen in the country cases like with DUX, it was voluntary, where two team members agreed to switch positions, essentially. Then we had a couple of different involuntary proposals where people external to a team, a given Maker, DAO stakeholder, will propose the offboarding facility of a facilitator or a CU. We saw that with said from Real World Finance, and we are seeing it now with Seth, from marketing from content production. Would anyone jump in?  Mariano Ventura: I recently joined Maker in September. It was surprising how the onboarding process is; it affects a person\u2019s opportunity to find a new opportunity outside another DAO. I strongly believe that we should keep the ball rolling the way it is; the very last option and the policy that we create has to follow different processes that we need to follow. Keep the devoting because it looks like a public execution from the outside. We are in an entire niche, and everybody knows everything. It is hard to see a person being voted. The second thing is, I have an idea: let us set a small commission with delegates and assess the situation. I think that the power of delay could be useful if we could use it here. Try to avoid the situation as much as possible and reach an agreement with the person. I think it could be a good way of starting this conversation to see if this person voluntarily wants to leave or return the agreement or, maybe, make time to find another opportunity in another CU. This is just a general point of view from someone who has joined recently.    17:31  David Utrobin: Basically, you want to make sure that there is as little involuntary offboarding as possible; you want to take the steps beforehand so that even if the facilitator might not want to be offboarded, they recognize the reasons and whether they are valid or not. Eventually, they come and resign, essentially. You never really want to fire a person, you want to work with them to fix it, and if it can not be fixed, there should be a kind of amicable resignation. That is an interesting idea. Also, if you are coming on the mic, please briefly introduce yourself. Mariano, do you want to mention which incubating CU you are part of and where you are?  Mariano Ventura: My name is Mariano. I am from Maker talent. SES is currently creating our Core Unit. We started in September. We had our lunch boat session yesterday, where you continue to if you are interested. I have been attending these permanent sessions that I found very interesting. I am happy to receive any comments that you might have. I will make a talent because our voting process will start the second Monday of February. We are working a lot to make it happen.    18:56  David Utrobin: Something that you said relates to the second question, the prompt: who would enforce or perform the policy or interim review process? There has been this kind of question before somebody just goes and posts a proposal to offboard somebody; there has to be valid reasoning. There should even be an investigation - I do not want to say delegated party but like some party. You mentioned forming a review committee. That is a mix of the delegates and some key facilitators, and I want to note that point as it is an interesting point.  Unknown: I agree with the points that Mariano is making. I think what is missing from the process right now is signaling and predictability; the vote should probably be the ultimate expression of the MKR holder\u2019s displeasure, resulting in the facilitator\u2019s removal. My opinion is that the process leading up to that vote is way too short. In a more traditional organizational environment, you will have performance reviews; going through this probably will be some sort of chain of command and organization that will signal their displeasure with you in some way, long before you even get the performance review. I mean, there are going to be small nudges along the way. I think this reveals a little bit of the weakness of the very flat structure that Maker has organized along because it is essentially just two levels of the organization, you have Maker holders at the dial level, and you have a facilitator level. There are no intermediate steps there. I think a process will have to extend the offboarding process into smaller steps along the way; there should be some chance for a facilitator to change course. There should be some way to signal disagreement by the community with the facilitators\u2019 actions before getting to the offboarding vote. We can do that through forum posts single requests - there are some ways to do it, but I think there should be longer and more formal loops we should jump through before we get to offboarding someone. Compared to the traditional organization, it seems incredibly harsh and seems extremely public, as Mariano shows here. I think some of the public parts of it, I am not sure we can avoid it as long as we are doing this as a DAO, but I think we should do everything in our power to try to make this as voluntary as possible before we get to that point. Managing the community\u2019s expectations versus what the facilitator and the unit are doing is key to a successful offboarding process. It should not come as a surprise. I mean, the vote should not surprise the person being put up for a vote.    22:33  MakerMan: When I looked at how this goes, it seemed appropriate to have a forum post where someone can bring up a performance issue, right? And then do that in a way that it can be answered, so you would expect some give or take. The idea of going into a poll without even a discussion, much less going to an on-chain poll and making it formal with Maker governance voting. It is all very rushed. I find the CU where I am working here - that will scare me. That is not what happens in traditional appointments, as Justin said. In the place where I work, when we hire, there is a formal probation period where you can be let go for any reason at any time. Now, contractors and Maker that is a little different. One of the things we do not have out of the gate with a CU is what we expect out of them. Right? You look at our pros post and demos on marketing, and they both have different views of what they expected, but that was never really delineated when we brought the CU online as what the timeline was and what the expectations were right. How can you meet performance requirements if you do not have expectations when bringing people in, much less how you can question it, right? At some point, you can question it. When I look at this, I look at Maker and the stuff that we take on, and it is like we can make a half a million or a million-dollar mistake in a year\u2019s budget. We are looking at potentially making $10 million mistakes bringing on collateral, so it has kind of been a wash of a fair amount of money. I have dealt with media and production content producers in some sense, and they are very different beasts. Some of them are very slow, very methodical. Other ones are just going to jump right in and start producing content. What you get will vary dramatically with Sub. This is a whole other issue. I want to see a better process where we can have a review team. Still, if people have questions, we should bring them out in the forum before we start polling and have an honest discussion that involves the people being questioned and the questioning people, and then move this to a more formal process after sufficient time and discussion has had. The only criteria for a fast on offboarding is if someone is damaging the protocol, we are losing money, or there is some real, tangible hurt to the protocol. Otherwise, we can buy a little bit of time with a couple of weeks to a month in any organization. Unless you are under probation, you can not get rid of someone within three months; you have to retrain them or somehow be able to bring up their performance to match before you can even think about getting rid of that.  David Utrobin: Thank you for sharing those comments. Feel free if anybody in the chat wants to bring up some of the things you mention. In the meantime, Nick brings up an interesting point than an alternative to public governance driven offboarding is governance, select something like an executive branch, which has to do performance reviewing and correction and eventual firing, like McManus mentioning, perhaps not on a one-month timeline, but something more like a three to a four-month timeline. That is an idea. I wanted to note that LongForWisdom also mentions there is a one month RFC period for any given proposal that comes through, so although the initial proposal right now does not have a vital requirement for listing out the reasons for offboarding, there is some argument that one month is a decent amount of time, I tend to agree with that. It is my personal view.    27:11  Unknown: In terms of us being a DAO, public versus private, we should hold space to be thoughtful about what may be helpful or appropriate for the bigger context of this protocol scaling and operating for the long term. If, as a group, there is a public discussion and agreement to have a committee or decide that there is some, we can put parameters around what is private and what the accountability is around reporting of things that happened privately. I would not want us just to say, \u201cOh, it is a DAO, nothing can be private,\u201d but that I think that some consideration of what may be helpful in a situation like this, I resonate with some of the comments about how this could harm us in terms of attracting the best talent if we do not handle this? This process is super important.  Mariano: I want to highlight how important the initial part is to consider all the scenarios because I think we are too focused on performance and we do not have policies; this is also in my pipeline as a major challenge for diversity or harassment, which could be reasons for offboarding a delegate out of a conciliator. We need to think about what scenarios will lead to this situation? Who are the members of this committee that we are thinking about? One of the best ideas should be a third party, someone neutral. In terms of performance, we do not have anything to say, to score the performance or say if someone is not performing well. The third scenario that I can see is suspicious activity regarding funds or this kind of thing. So this, I see three scenarios that will lead to entirely different investigations and completely different actors involving the involved in the voting process.    29:47  David Utrobin: Yes, that is why there is a case to be made for the DAO granting somebody responsibility for making that judgment. There are entirely different kinds of contexts for different kinds of offboarding.  Mariano: We need to be very clear on the conditions that put you on one side or another? It reminds me of the policies that they use in social media. When you are there judging, it must be clear that you are on one side or another. We need to delegate this because the whole community needs to play a part. I believe that having a harassment policy is something that we need as a diversity policy when it comes to hiring, which leads to another question: we can not have policies, and we can not have CU that forces them to apply to those. Maybe this has to be another MIP. Maybe we will need to put together some guidelines of something that we will apply to, and then this will be connected to a new policy and harassment and diversity policy. We will put these in a new context if that is possible. Is that possible?   David Utrobin: I want to lead to a long answer because they are the government\u2019s facilitators. They know a lot better than me with regards to that question. Payton Rose: The simple answer is that we go off of what we have, and if we do not have something, we need a new policy. The CU MIPset defined what would need to happen for offboarding. In some cases, an amendment to that right might make much sense. Maybe you want to define an exit package or some of the other issues that we are talking about today, where those would probably make sense as a new map entirely. Right? Because they are not necessarily going on with the direct offboarding of the CU itself.  David Utrobin: I also think there is a point to be made about strict policies around hiring and that I would rather see recommended policies than strict policies that are enforced because at DAO like it is all independent teams, I think there should be a level of autonomy, especially regarding hiring decisions. I would not like a tough diversity requirement; I will use that in my hiring practice, I will look for a diversity hire, absolutely, but at the end of the day, I want to prioritize meritocracy about everything.    33:30  Mariano: When you talk about hiring, it is your deciding if you want to onboard someone from outside DAO, but what happens if you promote someone on diversity policy? There has to be covering situations like this as well or so.  David Utrobin: Let us bring it back to the CU offboarding stuff and how we manage that. I see Tim black and Will Renmore had their hands up, so Tim as he is at the top of my screen.   Unknown: I just want to echo something you said earlier, David, because I think we got off track from that. I think there is a balance to be struck her because there are these situations where we do want offboarding to be relatively swift if there are bad actors or malicious intent or things that adversely affect the DAO. We also want a better process for offboarding either a CU or the facilitator leading it. One of the things that you brought up as a prompt for a question, which I actually think is a better part of our process, is the voluntary versus involuntary nature of onboarding a facilitator, which I genuinely think is just a revision to the facilitator myth which is sort of in the process. I think PaperImperium put a dock down there. I just want to add a callout that would be helpful if I have some more eyes in there. I think that might solve many of our problems if part of offboarding is that you have to be very specific about the problems and fill out a template. There are somewhat of a set of guardrails around actually removing someone versus the set of subjective arguments put into a public forum, which is, obviously as we can tell what as we can tell, less than ideal.  Unknown: I think this discussion brings on many policy-related discussions that have been happening for a significant amount of time, and there have been concerns of mine for a very long time; I have had numerous discussions, I think. Being a private person, we tend to have those out of time, in private. I do not want to harm anyone in particular by having a discussion that is a concern. This is not necessarily related only to facilitating onboarding or offboarding, but more policies that can be good or best practices. I think these two levels here will depend on the teams involved in the CU. To this probably like a very high level, they will policy around defining, for example, what is the definition of serious misconduct off someone or anyone. It can be facilitated, but it can also be contributed, because we should consider that because contributors are involved in much important indirect decision making for the job, right. Otherwise, facilitators would not be doing the whole work for everybody. It is essential to have a little bit of definition on the DAO level, one more on the CU level; it is probably harder to define policies that should apply across the floor. If I think, for example, on areas closer to real word financing, I am thinking about practices that are more related to codes of conduct around conflicts of interest and an end alike. I think it is important that those codes of conduct be drafted up, even if it is just for a specific CU, because this specific CU has many implications in things that should be found at a DAO. At the same time, facilitators were involved in any misleading on, for example, in real words, real-world assets, kind of relationship with counterparties, and so on. If we were considered a serious protocol in this space, now we have institutions, but counterparties of larger, bigger size and all that involved. We do need to put our big boy pants on and keep an eye out should not be any more like, you know, it is it, DAO who cares. We must show that we are serious about what we are doing. Maybe to the code of conduct for us in this specific area of real-world assets. I do not know whether that applies across the floor. I just wanted to point out that this has been a long concern, and this is maybe something that then abides by those related.    40:09  Unknown: I just want to mirror a bit of what Bill was touching in here. I think this also ties in that we need to discuss facilitators\u2019 autonomy. The organization form we have will give the facilitators big room for autonomy. Offboarding, as mentioned, is not only a process that happens at the dial level, but it also happens in the CUs. We need to distinguish which kind we are talking about. My perspective going from the Maker DAO level is that once we have been dealing with it, we have not seen anything from inside to see us so far. That is something that we will also have to handle down the line. It also touches on another bigger issue: who can make commitments on Maker douse we have. Like it was said, when someone is talking to someone from CU, it is a natural reaction to assume that that person is speaking for all MakerDAO. At the same time, that person may or may not be in a position to do so. We have also seen some of those same troubles surface with counterparties and contacting delegates contacting near CU members, basically, more or less trying at random to find someone Maker DAO to speak to. That is a bit of a tangent, but it is still essential to recognize several levels here.  David Utrobin: These are my notes for what the components of an ideal offboarding policy seem to be, based on the things everybody has said. 1. Desire for a better review process and a fair review process. 2. Desire for definitions for explicitly bad behavior that warrants swifter offboarding versus intermediary issues that might require repair. 3. Prioritizing actions that make offboarding voluntary when possible. This ties into the private and public conversation that we were having that Kianga was bringing up. Where is privacy appropriate? At what level? Does it get escalated? These are vital things that I am hearing to focus on everybody at a high level.    43:26  MakerMan: I have been a freelance contractor for a good chunk of my life; I had very formal contracts with all the clients I worked with, including exit clauses, complaints, performance measures; straight up, these contracts were enforceable in a court; right? In a jurisdiction, they were signed by a client and an intermediary, possibly, right. We do not have this on the DAO; we do not even have a mechanism to do it, which leaves contractors in a weird position, right with the DAO. Governance can do what they want and dump a contractor at will, right? For no cause straight up, and what is the recourse? I will leave it there because I see the real issue sitting here is that we need a mechanism to manage that kind of relationship in a contractual obligation way that\u2019s well defined.  LongForWisdom: The DAO can not directly offboard like contributors, right? We do not have votes for that. I agree it is not so simple to define contractors and facilitators regarding contractors or employees. The contracts have some sort of relationship with the contributors or relationship with a facilitator, which might be legally enforceable or might not be, like any position that does not have the option of doing that, the relationship between the facilitators and the DAO itself. The DAO can not execute legal agreements; I would not say it is the case that the DAO can go out of contractors and then get rid of the facilitators or CU as a whole.    45:39  David Utrobin: There is also something to say about at will be the default in employment instead of such a rich set of producing contracts and CU; I am sure they can produce those contracts like many CU have their entities and their relationships with their contractors. I do not know if everybody is doing at one point. I am sure some might not be. It is an interesting topic to consider.  Payton Rose: From the governance perspective, it is a question of scaling as well. We have talked about several different reasons why the DAO, why Maker holders might want to remove CU, and several different levels or reasons that can lead to that. When writing our processes for the future, it is important to keep in mind that we are trying to pick something that is both flexible, where it needs to be, and rigid, where it does not. You have to go through many of these things once to see the flaws or the holes in what you initially propose as like text versus when it happens in real life.    47:06  845\u00d7476 97.5 KB   David Utrobin: I have a second prop slide that people are interested in. We covered a lot of these questions, so I am sanity-checking myself. People have already answered the second question asking what general issues we can bring up. We covered sufficiently how to navigate these instances with minimal PR damage. This applies to would-be hires and the disruption of morale within the organization of existing core units. Let us go back to my first prompt, which is more fundamental. Rimmer asked an interesting question: should we at least have some form of contract between core unit facilitator entities and contributors enforced by the DAO? That is an interesting one. Niklas, do you want to comment?  Niklas Kunkel: The DAO should stay out of the internal affairs of core units. The DAO does not have the opportunity to hire or fire contributors. Instead, the DAO offers people the opportunity to be facilitators who present them with a plan and budget to the DAO. From that point on, the facilitators can run that operation however they see fit. This is the only way a DAO can work with the previous discussion regarding public executions. You have corruption behind the scenes, or you are transparent in public. Those are the ropes for being in a DAO. This is not a corporation. To an extent, facilitators take a career risk with everything being aired out in public. You could get fired, and then everyone sees your actions. This could affect your career. A simple solution for this is called self-selection for people. If people see the consequences of being a facilitator, fewer people will want to. That is fine. In a free-market economy, the DAO adjusts by offering people more compensation in those positions. This is the same relationship that contractors versus employees have in a traditional corporation, where contractors are typically paid more because they have less job security. This dynamic is similar. I want to get away from centrally managed policies from the DAO for internal affairs. The DAO should handle the macro side and not get involved on the micro side. Justin: I agree with what Nicolas just said. The DAO should deal with facilitators, and facilitators should deal with the CUs. That should be the default setting and basic workings. I can see occurrences happening inside the CU that would be serious enough for the DAO to prompt the facilitator. However, these scenarios would be extremely severe. We will drown in micromanagement if we start meddling into the CUs a DAO. This will be inefficient. Niklas is making a valid point stating that we need to react appropriately. As I have seen in traditional organizations, higher management\u2019s temptation to micromanage increases as more information becomes available. As a DAO with essentially full access to information, there will be greater temptation to micromanage. This means we must show restraint and allow the facilitators to autonomy. Of course, with great authority comes great responsibility. There is a greater chance of the DAO removing a facilitator that mismanages a CU. Regarding the public versus private discussion, Niklas also has a point. There will be difficulty in getting this into private channels in an organized manner without empowering agents. Empowering agents would threaten the decentralization of the whole protocol. When it comes to processes, we can do better. The keyword is predictability. We could keep the public discourse if we had more steps along the way, such as raising and discussing issues publicly before launching the onboarding process. We would also normalize negative discussions before they become so damaging that we undergo an involuntary offboarding process. If we do this enough, facilitators will see the writing on the wall. If someone complains about their actions every second week, facilitators will likely take the hint and step down voluntarily. They will see that they are not a great fit for what the community wants. A forced offboarding should be a last resort from the DAO when handling a facilitator or Core Unit.    54:07  Mariano: There is an agreement that nobody wants policies that will micromanage. I agree as these policies go against the spirit of the DAO. But Jesse talked about scenarios that realistically necessary calls the DAO to act. We need to take this direction because we will never distinguish the different cases if we only focus on the general image. When working for traditional company startups, we cared about employees after they disconnected. For example, we started an outplacement program to help people find another opportunity. Although this is not the current case, it is a brief idea on how to stop the collaboration between a contributor and the DAO in a good manner. As Niklas said, there is a status quo for public execution. How would we position ourselves when offboarding a facilitator that contributed much to the DAO? What are the reasons beyond the general idea? Some scenarios call for DAO intervention into the core units because our public image can be compromised at a different level by important internalities in the core unit. There are cases where it is vital to have some guidelines and good practices. We have the general idea and processes in place, so it is important for us to now go into the details.  David Utrobin: It sounds like you are arguing for an internal affairs type core unit that allows contributors to raise an issue if they feel unfairly offboarded. Then this core unit can investigate. Is that about right? Mariano: Yes. They could be a community for different situations. The idea is that the core units will be completely independent, but their actions towards the markets, social media, and product management can affect one another. We should have an internal affairs core unit if you want to call it that. However, we should distinguish the type of situations where this is important.    57:56  Prose11: The sidebar was talking about a previous topic we had with the ability of pseudo-anonymous people to raise these own to raise these proposals, particularly with offboarding. That messes with the game theory a bit.  David Utrobin: The offboarding requirements revisions, particularly the template for a higher standard for presenting reasons, will make troll offboarding requests disruptive. When somebody brings up an offboarding request, it takes time for the facilitator being off-boarded. They must respond. You could DDoS a facilitator\u2019s time by spinning an end on their account and forcing them to make a case for themselves every couple of months. Even if it is invalid, that creates negative sentiment around the core unit; to an extent, we saw that with the marketing core unit.    1:00:06  Derek: Thinking about everything said today, I am leaning on radical transparency for facilitators and not team members. Anyone in the community, such as delegates, MKR holders, or interested individuals, can come to the forum or Discord to ask me directly as an accountable and responsible individual for the protocol engineering CU. I am open to that to continue happening. We should be accountable for anything that the Core Unit does. Nik\u2019s point was great: that should stop at the facilitator and not the team\u2019s individuals. If there is a problem with the team, it is my problem. That discourse discussion must happen. I also like the point around expectations and predictable steps. We need to know our goals and discuss the performance over time. It would be beneficial to have a checklist that states where people lie on the performance scale. We do have KPIs, although these can be improved. I like Elpro\u2019s recent comments on various posts copied to different core units. I am taking that on board for our potential new term for the PE team and answering those questions upfront. I am not saying anything new but merely leaning on the side of transparency for facilitators. I will be happy to have the dialogue continue. The discussion is not overly noisy or time-consuming, but it has to happen because facilitators are for it. I am happy to work with anyone on what the predictable steps may look like.  1:02:56  Nadia Alvarez: Firstly, I agree that all facilitators should start conversations with delegates and other coordinates to get feedback. I also know that maybe we are like sub facilitators. We are in the middle of 1000 things and not starting these conversations as frequently as we should. Perhaps, we do not know how frequent a process should be. It would be interesting to work together on our feedback framework. I think that collaboration is missing because we get a lot of comments about it on the forum. We do not know what the community thinks about our actions. We just know that there is much noise in the forums. The community may have difficulty trusting and following directions of the unknown. It may be beneficial to have some feedback framework and checkpoints between core units and improve core unit management. In the DAO today, SES creates this standard. We can improve upon that. If we have feedback that we can trust, we can build a better onboarding process if deemed necessary.  David Utrobin: The noise on the forum makes it difficult for people to gather all the facts, especially if it is split across several threads. Furthermore, is everyone following the new information added closer to the vote to the appropriate level? I lean towards supporting an internal affairs core unit or an assigned independent party to gather the facts and data to present to voters.     Open Discussion 1:06:44  David Utrobin: While people gather their final thoughts, I want to mention an upcoming change to the format of the G&R calls. As many of you know, GovComs has been working with Wouter and other CU facilitators to map initiatives and to do these coordination calls (stakeholder alignment calls). We are developing this framework to have a more scalable tool to track the different initiatives at the DAO and their progress. These practices of coordinating across various stakeholders help on many different levels. Our planned format change will bring out the status updates that result from stakeholder alignment calls. Starting next week, we will be adding a small section after current events. Depending on the week, cadence, and initiative, we will be giving roadmap and status updates. On the next call, something to look forward to is an update on the L2 roadmap. Much of your feedback has been heard. People have a hard time following the details of various initiatives, so we are addressing this issue. We are doing our best to make things better.  Payton Rose: Appreciate that, Dave. This is our big weekly event where we get a lot of talking heads together. So it is great to see so many people interested in making sure it is as good as it can be. David Utrobin: I also want to push for a better culture of feedback. I see a lot of mixed views around feedback, such as who is responsible for giving it. Being proactive and proposing improvements with the proper gate holder will make MakerDAO better. Food for thought is essential regardless of validity. We have many intelligent people here with such diverse perspectives. In various publications, there are feedback surveys. On various teams, there are user interviews you can sign up for. I want to push for that culture of feedback here at MakerDAO.    1:10:08  Justin: I found Maker to be a great lecture of incredibly talented people. When you have something good or impressionable to say, say it. It means a lot. We are scattered all over the world. Sometimes you are working in isolation, and having someone recognize your work is noteworthy.  1:11:38  Unknown: I just have one last comment. Our superpower is attracting overachievers as we do not need supervision. This is probably our best hedge against poor performance. While core units should be in charge of recruitment, checklists are probably checked candidates from a cultural standpoint. Having some recruitment guidelines that are more on the cultural alignment and soft side will be helpful. Recruiting the best people is our best hedge against the bad experience of boarding. My recommendation is to interview guides. I went through probably 2000 interviews in my life because that was my job.  David Utrobin: SES might provide some guidance on interviewing best practices. I believe the talents may also be cooking something up in that regard.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:13:49  We have many resources we can leverage. We are going to wrap up there then. I appreciate everyone for coming out. The video will be posted on our YouTube shortly. See everyone next week!
