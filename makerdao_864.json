So they said \u201cWe will keep DSR spread at 0.5% for 6 months\u201d What are the various ways they could go about to promise this? Meaning how could they restrict themselves from changing the spread? Even if hypothetically a 6 month cadence was set in place, what\u2019s to stop someone from submitting a signal request to reduce the cadence? Then the promise would be rendered useless Option 1: Smart contract that does not allow votes on DSR spread to be changed. Problem: Someone who works for the maker foundation told me this impossible from a technical perspective Option 2: On-chain governance poll that says \u201cSet DSR spread, and do not allow it to change for 6 months\u201d then no one will submit a signal request to override it for that time Problem: What if someone creates a brand new governance dashboard and disregards the old poll and starts submitting malicious executives and somehow gets MKR holders to vote on it Option 3: MKR holders put their assets in a contract that says if they change said parameter their holdings will be taxed Problem: I don\u2019t think anyone would actually do this What do you all think?

Maker Protocol (via executive spell) creates a prediction market on Augur v2 and places a 100,000 Dai bet against the DSR changing in the next six months. In practice, this is staking Dai against it changing. This gives us some very cool things:  Gives us a credible pre-commitment backed by Dai. Allows us to see how trustworthy the DAO is perceived to be by the market as a whole. Gives us another source of income from the trades on that market, and potentially winning bets.  ",

Like lock in your 100 DAI today and in return you get a contract that says in 6 months you are entitled to say 103 DAI. Once the contract is issued the 100 DAI would get locked in the DSR. Now assuming 8% APR you would assume that the DAI would be worth 104.07 DAI in 6 mo time, so the MKR holders stand to gain 1.07 DAI from this arrangement (if they keep the DSR at or above 8%). If the DSR drops below 8% though they might end up on the hook for the foregone interest which would presumably result in the difference being added to the debt buffer. In the meantime though, the person offering the 100 DAI gets the peace of mind that he won\u2019t need to worry about fluctuations in the DSR and can just count on his extra 3 DAI being there in 6 months time. Disclaimer: I have no idea how technically feasible this would be, just an idea for how you might go about this. ",

You use Tinlake and split this revenue stream into a fixed part (Tin) and a variable part (Drop). You wanted stability so you keep Tin and sell Drop in order to compensate for the lower returns of the now fixed stability fee. @spin how doable is this with some minor adjustments of Tinlake? ",

Here are some pictures to explain cFRA750\u00d7500 108 KB   infog31126\u00d71280 132 KB  As you can see in the second image, the size of the difference between forward rate and DSR is the size of injection to or extraction from vault. However this approach leaves the DSR spread completely unhedged. I\u2019ve spoken to some experts about this and they believe the best way it to have a poll and then for MKR holders to have integrity that they won\u2019t change it. I can understand the desire to want a flexible spread during times of uncertain DSR utilization, but once that stabilizes I think a precedent of low volatility spreads should be in place. ",
