                    "content": " MIP39c2-SP13: Adding Oracles Core Unit  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 13 Author(s): Niklas Kunkel Contributors:  Status: Accepted Date Applied: 2021-05-12 Date Ratified: 2021-06-28   Sentence Summary Add an Oracles Core Unit to handle all of the Oracle needs of the Maker Protocol and build out an Oracle business.  Paragraph Summary The Oracle Core Unit (OCU) is responsible for developing and administrating the Oracle Protocol. Oracles are a critical component of securing the Maker Protocol to ensure positions are sufficiently collateralized. The OCU is essential to ensure the Oracles can adapt rapidly to scale the Maker Protocol in a responsible manner. A key focus of the OCU is to monetize the Oracle Protocol and build out a business around it. This enables the DAO to subsidize its own Oracle expenditures, and ultimately turn Oracles from a cost-center into a profit-generating arm of MakerDAO. Real World Assets (RWA) in particular, are a highly promising vertical the business side of the Oracle is targeting.  Specification  Mission  The most decentralized, secure, scalable, resilient, and transparent Oracle protocol. Purpose-built for MakerDAO, available to everyone.   Motivation The Maker Oracles are a critical dependency of the Maker Protocol that regulate Dai generation, Vault liquidations, and protect the solvency of the system. MakerDAO needs proprietary Oracles for a multitude of reasons:  Security Cost-Regulation Flexibility Oracles as a Service (OaaS)   Security The Maker Protocol ought to minimize external dependencies to reduce the attack surface and maximize resiliency of the system. This is especially true for Oracles, as manipulation of the Oracles can result in printing of unbacked Dai and mass-liquidations. Outsourcing the security of the Maker Protocol to an external Oracle protocol is extremely risky. Therefore, it is vital for the DAO to maintain control of this critical infrastructure to ensure the security of the Maker Protocol.  Cost-Regulation As the Maker Protocol scales it will require more and more Oracles. The DAO is incentivized to invest in its own Oracles to enable economies of scale and reduce marginal costs. Failing to do so would put the DAO in the undesirable position of being at the mercy of a monopolistic vendor with no recourse. By maintaining the ability to control the sensitivity of each Oracle, the DAO can further fine-tune costs to its particular requirements.  Flexibility An in-house Oracle team gives the DAO an enormous amount of flexibility and agility relative to using an external Oracle solution. Oracles can be tailored specifically to the requirements of the Maker Protocol. Development and deployment of new Oracles isn\u2019t prone to the conflicting prioritizations of an external vendor and can be further optimized through tightly coupled coordination with other Core Units. In-house Oracles facilitate faster time-to-market for collateral onboarding which may drive substantive benefits in the rate of market-share and stability fee accrual.  Oracles as a Service (OaaS) The DAO has a unique opportunity to become a major player in the Oracle industry. A MakerDAO Oracle product has strategic advantages over competing Oracle providers. Economies of Scale Since the Maker Protocol has the largest TVL in all of DeFi and should continue that trend going forward, an Oracle Protocol embedded in the Maker Ecosystem achieves immediate economies of scale that competitors will find difficult to challenge. Subsidize DAO Overhead through Revenue Revenue from Oracle access extended to third parties can also subsidize overhead costs incurred by the DAO and reduce the marginal cost of the Oracles making them even more competitive. Credibility The Maker Protocol as the de facto leader in DeFi has a brand that signifies technical excellence, security, and integrity. An Oracle Protocol used in the Maker Protocol, generates instant credibility due to the established expectations of the quality of MakerDAO. This credibility can be monetized to the extent that clients may even be willing to pay a premium. Evolving Attitudes Around Risk Opens New Opportunities Currently DeFi protocols are in their infancy, and established traditional finance companies are just educating themselves and have yet to really enter the market. This will change. Both as DeFi begins to mature, and more sophisticated institutions enter the ecosystem, attention will shift towards risk management and security. One area that will be heavily scrutinized is Oracles. As Oracles are the root of trust, the Achilles Heel, of most DeFi protocols, demand for decentralized secure and resilient Oracles is expected to grow. DeFi protocols or institutional-grade applications may even get to the point where a single Oracle solution is not enough to give them the security and resiliency guarantees they require. It\u2019s conceivable that clients may duplicate Oracle services from different providers, creating an opportunity to gain marketshare from incumbent Oracle protocols. Real World Assets are the Future MakerDAO has been a trailblazer in connecting TradFi to DeFi through the introduction of Real World Assets. The Maker Protocol is perfectly positioned to be leveraged as a credit facility for a whole swath of non-digitally-native assets. Multiple private entities such as 6S Capital and Centrifuge. are lining up to onboard Real World Assets into the Maker Protocol. Demand from asset originators waiting on the sidelines is in the hundreds of millions of Dai. It is abundantly clear this sector will experience an enormous amount of growth in the coming years. Maker with its nonexistent cost of capital, is best positioned to seize it. Asset originators profit directly from securitization, sometimes with fat margins. Rather than Oracles being a cost borne by the Maker Protocol, these costs could be passed on to asset originators. In this configuration, purchasing Oracle services from the Maker Protocol could be framed as a prerequisite to being onboarded as collateral. For the asset originator paying for Oracles to get onboarded into the Maker Protocol is just a cost of doing business that eats into their securitization margin. While there are certainly significant costs involved in coming up with an offchain system for verifying the price (and other related data) of an RWA including 3rd party auditors, the on-chain gas-costs should be quite minimal for something so illiquid whose price changes infrequently. This implies Oracle margins for RWAs have the potential to be substantial if a scalable solution is developed for the offchain component. This has numerous benefits in that Oracle revenue would scale linearly with the number of Real World Assets onboarded into the Maker Protocol. If Maker maintains its position as the leading crypto credit facility for asset originators, then by default the Oracle Protocol can dominate all of that high-margin marketshare. It gives the Oracle Protocol the most exposure to working with RWA, which over time will develop into domain expertise, and ultimately a moat around Oracles services for RWA. This is a niche MakerDAO is well positioned to dominate. The synergy between the Maker Protocol having its own proprietary Oracle Protocol that also doubles as a lucrative business opportunity with a diversified revenue stream is a no-brainer for the DAO to invest in.

After reading your proposal, I see you are aiming big with the OaaS idea:     NikKunkel:  Focus on growth over profit       NikKunkel:  Create incentives for use (token?)       NikKunkel:  Create an independent brand around the Oracle Protocol   etc, which is great. What I\u2019d love to hear (maybe not as part of the MIP, but just as a personal curiosity) is how you see this folding out. For example in terms of increasing market share vs ChainLink (today\u2019s n1 OaaS I guess), over the course of the next, say, 4 years. Where can we outcompete them? For what kind of customers?

This is a vertical where Maker is way ahead of the curve, and we expect significant growth over the coming years.  Not only that, but Maker should have a moat around this as we have no cost to source Dai whereas secondary lenders like Compound and Aave need to source it either from Maker or from Dai lenders. This is also a very high-margin business as asset originators we\u2019ll be targeting will generate hundreds of millions of Dai rather than just tens of millions or single digit millions. This means the Oracle costs for these customers are fairly trivial meaning we can charge fairly high. The key here will be to build out a generalized process that can be scaled to apply to all RWAs. All Maker has to do is just insist that RWAs have to use Maker Oracles to qualify to be onboarded as collateral into the Maker Protocol and we eat the entire marketshare for free. The strategy is essentially go really big on RWA because that\u2019s where we foresee the biggest growth potential for both the Maker Protocol and the Oracle Protocol. ",

Oracle related contracts are completely under the control of Maker Governance. Maker Governance can delegate certain administrative tasks to the Oracle Core Unit (for example whitelisting), but ultimately it\u2019s all owned and control by the Maker Protocol.

As an out-of-the-closet wall-to-wall scaling fetishist, I think it is possible to manage the risk in a couple of ways. First is to limit the IAM to actions that are not instantly catastrophic - you mention appending the whitelist. Another would be to make the IAM really expensive, but refundable for certain addresses (like the Oracle CU). So if somebody else pays for the IAM it raises a red flag. The third would be to include a sizeable delay in IAM action so it would be possible to counter the effects if detrimental. I guess the fourth would be to stake the IAM with MKR. ",
