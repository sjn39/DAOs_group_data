                    "content": "Basic Details Project name: Passage / GYSR Author name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project.): Zac Choi (Twitter: @ w3bzac), Josh Peters (@ joshpeters_), Devin Conley (@ devinaconley), Alex Jebb (@ jebbathehut) L2 recipient address: Optimism multisig wallet: 0x462cc7EA60a364410FeF8c621b73a1f1c78De513 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 25 and Growth Experiments 24 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes Project Details What are you going to build?: We are going to build a deep integration between GYSR\u2019s upcoming v3 functionality and Passage Protocol to provide membership tooling on Optimism. We will integrate the GYSR protocol with Passage products to enable loyalty rewards, community incentives, and other new membership capabilities. Passage and GYSR will provide a seamless end-to-end tech stack and launchpad for web3-enabled projects, memberships, and communities. More specifically, the diagram below outlines the planned integration between GYSR pools and the Tollbooth membership framework:  1600\u00d7542 97.9 KB  Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Passage is the leading membership protocol for web3 communities and projects, and GYSR is a mature DeFi tooling platform that has processed over $1.5B in transactions over the past two years. GYSR has also recently invested in and seen rapid growth on Optimism. Overall, we believe there\u2019s exceptional product-market fit in terms of expanding Optimism\u2019s reach and presence for memberships, NFTs, and community incentives. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, both Passage and GYSR have a strong existing presence across a variety of L1 and L2 networks. By integrating with various Passage products, engaging both Passage and GYSR resources, and expanding this fullstack membership toolkit to Optimism, we expect to attract more new builders and users to the Optimism ecosystem. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, by expanding to various Passage products and engaging both Passage and GYSR resources, this will attract more quality developers to the Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, with GYSR being a no-code, secure, launch platform, this helps raise the bar for quality projects on Optimism while reducing burden on development teams. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, we believe the GYSR+Passage+Optimism experience will be an intuitive, enjoyable, valuable experience for developers. GYSR has recently joined forces with Passage protocol, so we are working arm in arm to build a seamless user experience. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo:  Passage Tollbooth: www\u2026loom.com/share/b2f401ccfefe467eb1a170f6d0dba842 GYSR v2 demo: www\u2026youtube.com/watch?v=dCNlTnqCm-M GYSR NFT staking: www\u2026youtube.com/watch?v=JKyq5Zgz7kU   Websites:  www\u2026passage.xyz/ www\u2026gysr.io/   Twitter:  Passage: twitter\u2026com/passageprotocol GYSR: twitter\u2026com/gysr_io   Discord/Discourse/Community: https:// discord.gg/74SnuTM8 Github: www\u2026github.com/gysr-io/ Technical/Economic Documentation: www\u2026docs.gysr.io/  Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): GYSR has seen a spike in Optimism activity over the past several months, largely due to a smaller grant from Layer2DAO and our co-incentives program, and we expect the advanced capabilities from GYSR+Passage integrations to have a similar effect to continue this upward trajectory. Some overall GYSR metrics include:  Project TVL: $3M (down from high ~$50M) Transactions: To date, GYSR has handled over $1.5B in transactions and $26M in rewards across all networks (mainnet, polygon, optimism) Users: ~6k overall, 225 on Optimism (up from just 13 Optimism users in December 2022) Reference:  www\u2026thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/gysr-io/gysr www\u2026thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/gysr-io/gysr-polygon www\u2026thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/gysr-io/gysr-optimism    Who are your competitors?: xToken Terminal (only in Uniswap v3 LM) What differentiates you from your competitors?: The end-to-end tech stack of Passage - where the project\u2019s overall ambition can be comprehensively solutioned, instead of piecemeal task solutions - and the foundation of the GYSR platform combine to bring a unique and highly complementary combination of incentive and membership capabilities spanning both DeFi and NFT use cases. The two groups have worked together closely for over a year as technology partners and just formalized the relationship by having GYSR become a part of Passage Protocol. Prioritizing building solutions on Optimism would be a win-win-win solution for all parties. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes! Passage and GYSR are each focused on tooling to enable other projects and communities, so building more solutions on Optimism will inherently benefit other projects on Optimism. Team Who are your founders?: Zac Choi, Meral Arik, Josh Peters (Passage) + Devin Conley, Alex Koren (GYSR) What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: Strong experience in overall project/company execution, integrations, web3 partnerships, marketing/sales/growth. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): The broader team has combined decades of engineering, R&D, delivery, and product expertise across crypto, fintech, and consumer rewards. Is this your first Web3 project?: No. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): The GYSR team has built and deployed v1 and v2 of the GYSR platform, with v3 coming soon. Some Passage products include:  Dynamic NFT API - Build custom membership NFTs that evolve with member engagement Customs - Add advanced wallet, token, and metadata verification to authentication and rewards Loyalty Ledger - Spin up a scalable on-chain point or badge system on any EVM-compatible network Tollbooth - Collect subscription payments & aggregate dues data across fiat, crypto, and NFTs Gridiron - Automate your membership program with web2-to-web3 workflows 3DP - Unify and activate on-and-off chain membership data for CRM, Telemetry, and Automations  I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: \u200b\u200b No, GYSR is community driven and self-sustaining. The project is funded through usage of the platform and ecosystem grants Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? The sheer number of integration possibilities between GYSR\u2019s v3 functionality and Passage\u2019s suite of products offers a long roadmap of value to the Optimism ecosystem. We believe that investing in more established tooling capabilities will benefit the entire Optimism ecosystem, and see this as truly a co-investment of time and resources to drive the ecosystem forward. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:  Build smart contract \u201cactions\u201d and callbacks framework for Tollbooth protocol Build smart contract controller for GYSR pool to set earning rate for a user as a function of membership status updates Build factory contracts for easy configuration of membership reward system Engage security auditor for review of new smart contracts Integrate membership reward system into webapp UI for easy usage  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) Optimism multisig wallet: 0x462cc7EA60a364410FeF8c621b73a1f1c78De513 Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Yes - while GYSR v2 is already on Optimism and v3 will be, prioritizing the integrations and support work for building GYSR/Passage products on Optimism is largely reliant on receipt of OP tokens. This includes the costs of an audit to ensure and prove we are building safe, secure, reliable tools! What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: Our plan is to use the OP token to incentivize and reward those who contribute to our GYSR/Passage Optimism integrations and support. We support the 1 year lock-up of these tokens as we believe it will only help to ensure that projects are building solutions with the long term outlook of Optimism in mind and will lead by example in this regard. Additionally, the OP token will go towards subsidizing costs of the audits for our integrations. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. We will provide regular development updates on the integrations. We will leverage the active Optimism community to help us prioritize the value of product integrations, offer feedback as users and even beta testers, and continuously iterate to develop the best products possible. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Some of our critical milestones include:  3 months: build actions framework for Tollbooth protocol, build smart contract controller action for GYSR pool 6 months: build factory contracts for simplified configuration 9 months: security audit 12 months: integrate membership reward system into webapp UI  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Yes, similar to other ecosystems, Optimism is a young, rapidly evolving space. There is a massive demand for modular and reusable building blocks that can help to accelerate development speed, increase interoperability, and improve safety. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We solve these problems for projects by providing easy to use tools so that they can focus on their core missions. In particular, we believe the membership space is one of Optimism\u2019s major growth opportunity areas and is one of our specialties. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: The integration of GYSR+Passage on Optimism will help solidify Optimism as the preferred ecosystem for membership incentives, community growth, and overall as a hub for activity. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: The GYSR team has enjoyed building on Optimism thus far, and is excited to invest more time and energy into the ecosystem while joining forces with Passage. Is your project Optimism Native?: GYSR is multi-chain, and supports Optimism native projects. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes ",

It shows the transactions as per the new entities introduced: userOp, Bundle, Bundler, Entrypoint, factory, paymaster, etc. This is helpful for all the participants of the ecosystem: Developers can test out their applications in an easier fashion, for users to easily confirm their transactions, and for researchers to get a holistic view of different participating entities. You can also check out the Product Requirement Document for the next iteration (by May\u201923) Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?:   First Mover\u2019s Advantage: We are the first and only block explorer for the standard and its new entities. We have a POC live and are working on revamping the UI to integrate with wallets.   Presence in EIP-4337: We are actively engaged with all the EIP-4337 related communities, including different wallets, and infrastructure providers, and are being guided by the Eth-Infitism team (creators of the standard).   Team: The team has been building products in the web3 ecosystem since Oct\u201921 (>1.5 years). In this span, we have won multiple hackathons on Ethglobal, gitcoin, devfolio, and a few independent ones. Our previous projects made us ETHIndia grantees. We\u2019ve also got accepted early on in fellowships by polygon and Solana. One of us is also a Kernel BA3 member. Our previous venture was also backed by consensys mesh and protocol labs (through the Tachyon accelerator). Prior to working in web3, our team has expertise in building large-scale data systems at Amazon and Zeta (a banking-tech startup now a unicorn).   Low incentive for others to build: Block Explorers are not easy to monetize products and mainly rely on each chain/community supporting the explorer. Because of this, we expect low competition from new players entering the space.   Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, with additional tooling and API available for the optimism chain, developers can get started building applications leveraging EIP-4337 with ease on optimism over the other chains. We\u2019re prioritizing Ethereum and Optimism as the first two chains to support and mature the explorer for. This will make it easier for developers to build on these chains over the other chains. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Absolutely, let me show you how! The developers will be able to analyze different UserOperations in a bundle, understand different entities at a granular level, and look at the economics for each party involved. They will get a sense of the wait times and issues faced by previous transactions. We will also be creating content on how to leverage the standard by showing how to build dapps or integrate with existing wallets and verifying the status on explorer. This will enable more mature and aware developers to build on the chain. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Jiffyscan is being built as a public good, supporting the ecosystem and looking for support from the ecosystem to keep it alive. We will, first and foremost, lead the way in building for the community instead of building for a venture economy by doing it ourselves. This naturally creates a desire for both community and the project to thrive. The same will be shared in our communication to projects who want to continue building and can do so by being active and supporting the ecosystem to grow. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: JiffyScan Walkthrough and Demo for Optimism Grants Cycle 11 - YouTube  Website: https://www.jiffyscan.xyz/  NewSite (WIP): https://jiffyscan-frontend-ptc5u0ht0-jiffy-labs.vercel.app/latestUserOps  Twitter: https://twitter.com/JiffyScan  Discord/Discourse/Community: Github: GitHub - jiffy-labs/jiffy-explorer: An explorer for account abstraction  Other: Notion \u2013 The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): N/A. The project is still early stages of development, and the EIP-4337 audit was done a week ago. So it\u2019s early to show tangible traction. We do have a few developers reaching organically and showing gratitude for the explorer. We\u2019re revamping our infrastructure and have a few paymasters and wallets reaching out for integrations. Who are your competitors?: Blocknative recently released a simple user op explorer: https://4337.blocknative.com/ They are no mature competitors for EIP-4337 currently. Existing explorers and tools to understand transactions are best suited to eventually move into this space: Etherscan, Blockscout, and Tenderly are having the most volume. What differentiates you from your competitors?: We are providing block explorer views created specifically for the EIP-4337 ecosystem. This standard brings a lot of additional complexities, including new entities such as paymasters, factories, bundles, etc. A single blockchain now includes multiple individual user operations which are shown as one transaction on existing block explorers. We will provide a crystal way of understanding the operation relevant to individual users, researchers, and developers. This will include a clear view of the transaction history of a smart contract wallet, actual gas charged for the operation, and not the complete transaction (or a bundle). It will treat all different entities of EIP-4337 as first-class citizens while designing the explorer views. Blocknative only has a simple list of user Operations in the Goerli chain so far. There are many more entities that need to be shown. Also, we\u2019re the only one decoding the transaction input calldata and showing relevant fields from it (already live)! Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Our project will be composable with other dapps and wallets leveraging EIP-4337. Most wallets guide a user to an explorer view to see the details. We would be this link wallet will use. We also expose APIs for fetching historical User Operations for different entities which can be used by the wallet to show the transactions of a user. Eventually, we will expose Gas APIs at the bundler level which can be used by dapps developers to charge appropriate fees. Team Who are your founders?: Aditya Agarwal (Co-Founder & CEO): Previously co-founded HighFi.me, a decentralized wallet-to-wallet messaging platform backed by Consenys Mesh & Protocol Labs through the tachyon.xyz accelerator. A Devcon Bogota scholar has been building full-time in the web3 space for >1.5 years. During this time has won multiple hackathons, including hack money, roadtoweb3, arbitrum Bogota, etc. He has also carried worked on grants by Uniswap Foundation to improve their subgraphs. Prior to getting into web3, he was the first data engineer hired at Zeta, a banking tech startup, which was a unicorn by the time he left. Gautam Sabhahit (Co-Founder & CTO): Previously co-founded HighFi.me, along with Aditya. A polygon Fellow, and has won multiple hackathons alongside Aditya. He started Jiffyscan in EthIndia in Dec\u201922 and won a bounty on Ethereum Foundation for it. He has been curiously participating in the blockchain industry for over 2 years and is a Kernel BA3 member and polygon India fellow. Prior to entering the blockchain industry full-time, he was working as a Full-Stack Engineer in Amazon for the Amazon Pay department. Note: In October\u201922, both the founders decided to halt their previous venture, returning 62% of the funds they had received from the accelerators in order to work on products that excited them (core-engineering problems), even if not venture-backable and decided to rely on hackathons and grants to take things forward. What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: History of building, quality engineering products rapidly and early in the market. We\u2019re efficient self-learners and will mountains to grow a new initiative we believe in. We also have established networks within the industry with folks leveraging EIP-4337. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): Currently, we only have a designer Martins Zemlick, from Latvia, working part-time on the project. He\u2019s been an enthusiastic designer for 11+ years and has worked for many fintech companies in recent years. He\u2019s been exploring web3 design space for 1 year now. We do have access to multiple developer communities (for eg: eth India/devfolio in India being a grantee, developers from Devcon Scholars, etc) to leverage and build the right team in due course. As of last week, a fellow enthusiast has started supporting us over weekends with FrontEnd development. Is this your first Web3 project?: No, we\u2019ve tried our hands on multiple web3 projects before this. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): HighFy: A end-to-end encrypted, fully decentralized web3 messaging system. https://highfy-me.vercel.app/ Github: GitHub - vintageplayer/highfy-me MetaLeap: NFT Renting & Access Management Protocol: GitHub - HighFiMe/meta-leap-pilot JointNFT: NFT Fund Manager SaaS: A protocol to let people pool together money and invest into NFTs passively by having a fund manager to manage the trades. Github: GitHub - JointNFT/jointnft-dapp I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post : [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: No, we\u2019re bootstrapped and have not picked up any form of external monetary support yet. We\u2019re working on getting a grant from Ethereum Foundation through their currently open AA grants round. Though we\u2019re working on wallet integrations already and are committed to working on the project at least throughout 2023 by bootstrapping, and maybe winning couple more hackathons if push comes to shove. Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 46k How do you justify the size of the grant? This project will require the support of quality engineers interested in understanding lower-level details of how a transaction is processed and stored by a node. We will also need engineers to host and manage the infrastructure to run the explorer stack. For meaningful adoption, we need to experiment with creating user-friendly, easy-to-navigate designs for the different types of information shown. Since AA is very early, the team will also focus on creating content for developers to understand EIP-4337 and gets hands-on with it immediately, rather than just conceptually. To make this happen, we will require contributions from quality engineers, designers, and dev-rels over an extended period of time. The tokens from this grant will be used to attract quality contributions and reward them for their support. 30k OP for Team & Engineers 5K Op for Support & maintenance operations 5k OP for Design contributions 6k OP for Content Creation and Awareness, Hackathons Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Each milestone shared below will be implemented in the following iterations:  Generate in-depth specs for the data to represent and factor in feasibility within the tech architecture/resource limitations. This could involve interacting with other wallets, bundlers, and researchers. (A detailed PRD will generally be created for each). This will involve getting feedback from a small set of beta users for each release on the upcoming feature set Implement the backend/graph logic to provide the new/updated APIs. Iterate over the design for the specific view. Update the front end using the design prototype and API details. Get feedback and fix make minor enhancements and bug fixes  The project updates will be shared regularly on relevant channels. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) We don\u2019t have a smart contract. Though we are doubling down on building in public and will be sharing all progress actively over Twitter (at least weekly if not more often). You can also check our GitHub repo for active commits and the Notion Doc for other discussions and research which we are updating actively. We are committed to building JiffyScan, a product that is very useful but extremely tough to reliably monetize, and bootstrapped for 3+ months now. Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Yes, to a major extent, we will need ecosystem support to keep the project running. So the OP tokens will help hire engineers and help the project grow and continue doing a good job. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: It will be used for further research, continued infrastructure cost, paying for project members, and sponsoring hackathons to encourage new builders to try out the APIs. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period.  Showing details of User Operations for Optimism-Goerli Add HighLevel Information about the new entities: Bundlers, Factories, Paymasters This will at least list/explore all bundles created by a bundler, smart contract wallet creations by the factory, and paymaster-sponsored transactions. Revamp UI to make the experience close to the quality of existing explorers. Enrich data shown for a UserOperation This should include a better representation of the various gas costs of the individual operation in a bundle. And the decoding of the transaction input triggering the userOperationEvent Show usage Metrics. Eg: Number of EIP-4337 wallets created, Avg Gas Cost per UserOp Avg Daily UserOperations Fees Collected by Bundlers Add support for Optimism Mainnet Enrich data for Bundlers, and Paymasters: This could include additional stats, staked amounts, and user balances at the paymaster level. Implement Partial Transaction Decoding For the top contracts interacted with, will need to collect the ABIs to decode the calldata and show it on the explorer. Create an ABI cache infra to run transaction decoding at scale optimally Setup a Node Display non-EIP-4337 transactions where the receiver is a smart contract wallet Work on generic call data transaction decoding by running trace_calls. Show internal Transactions Display Smart Contract token balances  Post this we will expand to hosting bundlers and userOp mempool. The p2p bundler is still under development and by the end of 2023, we should be at the right point to work on providing visibility on the userOp mempool state. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Milestone 1 (ETA- Apr\u201923): Release an MVP for exploring user operations. Benchmark Milestones included: 1,2 Milestone 2 (ETA- May\u201923): Release a more user-friendly interface and enrich details for a better developer experience. Benchmark Milestones included: 3,4 Milestone 3 (ETA- Jun\u201923): Make it easy to understand how the space is growing. Benchmark Milestones included: 5,6 Milestone 4 (ETA- July\u201923): Bring the explorer closer to the level of existing mature explorers. Benchmark Milestones included: 7,8,9 Milestone 5 (ETA- Aug\u201923): Setup up a node and decode call data for specific wallet implementations. Benchmark Milestones included: 10, 11, 12 Milestone 6 (ETA- Jan\u201924): Setup up a node and show all transactions and token balances for the smart contract wallet. Benchmark Milestones included: 13, 14 Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Yes! Developers, researchers and users of EIP-4337 have to navigate multiple different screens and filter through different events logs and decode to understand what exactly took place in a specific user op. They will still have to do additional calculations manually to start understanding actual gas costs for a particular userop in a bundle. They have no easy way to explore transactions at a factory or bundler level. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We treat all entities in EIP-4337 as first-class citizens in JiffyScan and have views custom-created solely to give a better UX and custom metrics of this standard. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: EIP-4337 is a step towards better UX in EVM ecosystem and is set to be the catalyst to onboard the next large wave of users in web3. It will also make wallet interaction easier, secure. Wallets/Dapps building on optimism will be able to onboard these users to Optimism ecosystem. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We\u2019re prioritizing ethereum and optimism chains over all others. With or without this grant, we will role out all new updates for these two chains first. We\u2019re 100% committed to supporting Optimism and helping it grow. Is your project Optimism Native?: In a manner of speaking. The explorer data is specific to each chain, and thus information on userOps submitted to the optimism chain will be considered optimism native, i.e, strictly for users of the chain. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

It allows users to create custom alerts that monitor blockchains 24/7 and trigger notifications receiving messages on various platforms. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: We launched RoboVault, a DeFi product in July 2021 and were one of the first protocols to successfully operate delta neutral strategies that protected against Impermanent Loss. During its active period, RoboVault generated over $2M for users. However, while operating the product, we identified significant gaps in the available tools and infrastructure required to successfully run a Web3 protocol. To address this, we invested considerable resources in developing custom, state-of-the-art on-chain and off-chain tooling and infrastructure to operate RoboVault\u2019s advanced Delta Neutral Strategies reliably. We realized that the value of our technology lay in the tooling and infrastructure we had developed to operate RoboVault, rather than in the protocol itself. As a result, we decided to build a platform that other teams building and operating within the Web3 space could use to successfully develop and run their products. Our experience operating RoboVault has given us a strong understanding of the pain points that users and developers face within the Web3 space. Additionally, we have developed advanced infrastructure to create tools that can solve these problems, giving us a competitive edge in the market. With these advantages, we believe that our platform has the potential to succeed in meeting the needs of teams building and operating within the Web3 space. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: The RoboVault team invested considerable resources in developing custom tooling and infrastructure to operate their numerous yield strategies reliably. They identified significant gaps in the available tools and infrastructure required to successfully run a Web3 protocol. DeNotify on Optimism would help address these challenges. By implementing DeNotify on Optimism, developers can have access to an extremely useful tool that can assist in their ability to deploy and operate dApps on Optimism. This can help to address some of the pain points that developers face in the Web3 space and attract them to the ecosystem. Additionally, the availability of such tools can help to foster innovation and promote the best safety practices within the Web3 community, making it more attractive for developers to join and contribute. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes - we believe by providing access to more tools available to developers the ability for developers to operate and build protocols will improve significantly. Team Who are your founders?: Matt Smart Samuel Battenally What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: Matt has an academic background in actuarial studies & economics including research in quantitative finance techniques. Prior to founding Robo Labs previously worked as the CFO at a tech start-up Okra Solar overseeing its growth from a team of 5 to 30. Additionally has a strong background in Machine Learning & Data Science having developed machine learning models utilising satellite imagery and simulations to optimise the design of micro-grids. Sam has extensive hands-on experience in low level embedded systems and building engineering teams from scratch. Sam\u2019s primary technical experience is developing software for the Electrical, Automotive, Medical and Consumer industries. Sam\u2019s skills developing highly critical software for Automotive and Medical products transferred well into developing highly secure software in DeFi. Sam also previously founded and ran a HFT proprietary trading firm with a trading volume often made up >1% of Bitfinex\u2019s total volume. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): Hasan (Full Stack Engineer) Haan is a developer with a deep passion for DeFi and crypto. Despite completing the training to become a pilot he decided to pursue his passion of Software Development. He has extensive experience building DApps both on the frontend and backend. His past achievements include winning the first prize for the Oasis web3 hackathon in the GameFi category with his novel project that takes a dig at blending DeFi and GameFi together in an innovative way. Nate (Solidity Developer / Full Stack Engineer) Nate is a senior builder who always strives to push the decentralisation movement forward. He has extensive experience developing Delta Neutral Strategies including leading the development of Robo Labs Uni Swap V3 Pseudo Delta Neutral Strategies which are currently being tested & reviewed. Jen (Front End Developer) Jen is an experienced senior front-end developer. Jen has strong experience deploying and designing user interfaces across multiple industries. Jen\u2019s stacks are React Typescript, Redux/RTK Query, Loopback 4 framework, and GrapesJS framework. Jen is also an artist, she has an eye for detail and contributes to designing the user experience for Robo Labs customers. Is this your first Web3 project?: No, we previously built RoboVault (now sunsetted as a product) a DeFi protocol utilising Delta Neutral Strategies to allow users to earn yield from LP positions on AMM\u2019s while protecting against IL. More details below. If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): In July 2021 we launched the DeFi product RoboVault becoming one the first DeFi protocols to successfully operate delta neutral strategies which protected against Impermanent Loss. Since its launch until RoboVault was sunsetted as a product in January 2023 it\u2019s strategies generated over $2M for users. While developing & operating RoboVault we immediately saw a number of major gaps in the available tools & infrastructure needed to successfully operate a Web3 protocol. As a result considerable resources were devoted to developing custom state of the art off chain tooling & infrastructure to reliably operate the advanced Delta Neutral Strategies utilised by RoboVault. As a company we saw the majority of the value of our technology not in the DeFi protocol RoboVault but instead in the tooling & infrastructure we had developed that allowed us to operate RoboVault. Based on this as we decided as a company to build a Platform that other teams building & operating within the Web3 Space could utilise to successfully build & operate their products. I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in : [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: Yes, Approx 12 months runway Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 30K OP How do you justify the size of the grant? Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Step 1 : MVP Launch Launch our MVP of DeNotify on Optimism allowing users & developers to create custom alerts based on on-chain activity within Optimism. Step 2 : Optimism Custom Integrations Alert Recipe\u2019s are alert templates tailor for particular use-case. For example, a Velodrome IL monitoring alert could be a baked into a recipe so users can subscribe to alerts without needing to understand the protocol inner workings. The following recipe\u2019s will be built:   5x Custom Recipe\u2019s for Optimism Protocols   5x Custom Optimism Recipes (Governance alerts, OP Token alerts, etc)   Step 3 : User feedback & Product Iteration Get user feedback to make any improvements to UI/UX & add any additional features. Development additional features for DeNotify including:   API\u2019s for seamless integration with Optimism Dapp\u2019s   Advanced logic within DeNotify for advanced conditional logic on alerts.   Additional integration of platforms where users can receive alerts (Discord, Telegram, Email, Twitter)   Step 4 : Enhanced Features Deployment of advanced features for developers utilising real time alerts including   Custom scripting for alert logic   Custom scripting for notification message formatting   In-app trigger simulations   Critical Milestones :   MVP of DeNotify Live with Optimism Integration by 15th April 2023   Custom Optimism Integrations Deployed to DeNotify by 15th June 2023   Enhanced Features Live for DeNotify available to Optimism users & developers by 15th September 2023   Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) Contracts previously deployed on Optimism for Testing Test Vaults : 0x4E04f80a0b57b2375CD98dAd2cCf853d5236D448 0xA6C4D501Fa36a9d4E904764D871F120E9A929867 0x36Ca77a3a7BFD2D3b71f3f4830fDff90601D021c Test Strategies : 0xA43d8dfB836B5aA7A086A27c6C4A4cf37daEc615 0x3AFeb77D4df9393cD8dA93b29D0987C9D74538eB 0xC15D267586BD1E74A4192e49B0148B38bC60AFdB 0xCF11E554799DB755e670785dA9F9f5D8b9aE60eb 0x6702Ce6E7298a98AE5dceb1F63fdD7bf6100b25E 0x0ebaF8AD3504222f8311392641822b15a3CE6DdA Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: No What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: We plan to use the OP token to participate in governance & depending on the organisations financial situation potentially use as collateral to borrow assets to assist with operating costs. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. Milestone 1 : MVP Launch Launch our MVP of DeNotify on Optimism allowing users & developers to create custom alerts based on on-chain activity within Optimism. Milestone 2 : Optimism Custom Recipes Alert Recipe\u2019s are alert templates tailor for particular use-case. For example, a Velodrome IL monitoring alert could be baked into a recipe so users can subscribe to alerts without needing to understand the protocol inner workings. The following recipe\u2019s will be made available:   5x Custom Recipes for Optimism Protocols   5x Custom Optimism Recipes (Governance alerts, OP Token alerts, etc)   Milestone 3 : Optimism Custom Integrations Support 3x protocols in integrating alerts into their platform. DeNotify has an API that allows protocols to build alerts and notifications directly into their platform. In this milestone, we plan on partnering with three Optimism protocols and supporting their integration of DeNotify to enrich the user experience of their application. Robo Labs will provide this support and the API subscription for the protocols free of charge for the first 6 months. Milestone 4 : Advanced Features Make the following features available to DeNotify users on optimism:   Custom scripting for alert trigger logic   Custom scripting for notification message formatting   In-app trigger simulating   Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Yes, having access to real time alerts can help both users & developers operate more effectively & securely within the Optimism Ecosystem. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Real time alerts can be utilised by developers to monitor key on chain pieces of data which may impact the performance of their protocol. Additionally users are able to utilise real time alerts to mitigate various risks involved with the use of various DeFi protocols. Some examples of how real time alerts have been implemented by our team while operating the DeFi protocol RoboVault (which implemented & operated automated on chain Delta Neutral Strategies). Internally a number of custom alerts were used to ensure RoboVault\u2019s Delta Neutral Strategies were performing as intended while providing an additional layer of security by sending alerts if there were any real time issues. Rebalancing : RoboVault actively monitored each strategy\u2019s debt ratios & collateral ratios to ensure rebalancing was successful. In the past when RoboVault\u2019s keeper infrastructure had any issues this provided the team with real time alerts. These alerts would ensure the RoboVault team could manually trigger rebalances if needed ensuring users were not exposed to drawdowns from either Impermanent Loss or Liquidations due to Keepers failing to rebalance. Oracle Monitoring : We actively monitored oracle prices used in any of RoboVault\u2019s delta-neutral strategies against LP prices & CEX prices. On 26th of April a BAND oracle upgrade led to SCREAM\u2019s oracles not updating. The aggregation no longer used the latest values from BAND which led to the aggregated Oracle price used by SCREAM being incorrect (labelled in the chart as Compound Oracle). This posed a serious risk of Due to our team actively monitoring this data we were able to alert the SCREAM team while also ensuring RoboVault users were no longer exposed by pausing strategies using SCREAM. At the time RoboVault had over $10M in TVL that was potentially exposed to SCREAM, with the help of Arkiver RoboVault was able to ensure that these funds were not lost. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Providing both Developers & Users within the Optimism ecosystem with access to real time alerts provides additional tools to be used by both groups to significantly improve their ability to operate. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We are fully committed to launching and releasing DeNotify on Optimism. Is your project Optimism Native?: No, our products are chain agnostic Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined : [Yes/No]: Yes ",

                    "content": "Basic Details Project name: Alluo Author name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project): Didier / 0xec.eth L2 recipient address: 0xc7061dD515B602F86733Fa0a0dBb6d6E6B34aED4 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the [Builders 3] Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes Project Details What are you going to build?: A white-label payment API enabling fast on/off ramp for stablecoins to Optimism By white label, we mean a payment API that lets builders create the experience they want directly within their dapps. Much like Stripe, we want to be below the surface, with no friction for the end-users. First we want to focus on the on/off ramping of USDC and later to enable other currencies such as agEUR or sEUR for Euro. Today, USDC constitutes more than half of the stablecoins on the OP chain which is why we think it is the right focus to begin with. Given Synthetix\u2019s strength on Optimisim, it will also be possible for us to offer more native currencies in the future (Synhetix already offers sINR beyond sUSD and sEUR on L2 and more on L1 so we can only expect to see currencies such as sGBP and sAUD to come to L2s any time soon). We also saw this announcement (Optimism (OP) Soars 30% Amid Binance's BUSD Integration) regarding the launch of BUSD on Optimism but that was before the SEC got involved with Paxos so this may be something we will continue to monitor for now. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Today, we can already see that users are bringing funds on Optimism using Centralised exchanges  so we can clearly see that there is demand from people to bring funds to OP - at the same time, because people have to use those Centralised exchanges in the first place, it limits the potential uptake from users who are less familiar with the blockchain given that Centralised exchanges don\u2019t always make it easy for users to get funds out and onto the right chain. Particularly given that for CEXes, once funds are on chain they can no longer be used by the user to generate fees on their platforms. For novice users, sending funds from a CEX to their wallet on chain can be a nerve wracking experience between the risk of sending funds to the wrong chain or making a mistake when copying their wallet address (it is not rare for people to send funds directly to an ERC20 token address like USDC by mistake). We believe that letting end-users onramp directly on the Dapps themselves and with a convenient user-experience will lead to a significant uptick in the number of users experiencing Optimisim as their first blockchain in a way that is in line with their prior web2 experiences. Doing this without the need to go through a CEX like most of the times today is also something that is aligned with our and the foundation\u2019s ambition to improve decentralisation. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: We believe that having a good on/off ramp to Optimism could help bring new builders to the OP ecosystem, much in the same way that Stripe\u2019s arrival in the payment space has helped bring more developers to the e-commerce space. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: This is relatively difficult to assert but in general, having a good payment API is one of the key components in making the ecosystem more accessible to less tech-savvy users and broadening the developer community, hence increasing the potential to bring in high quality developers. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: We believe that a good payment gateway and interface to the real world may broaden the scope of projects that are built on Optimism given that it lowers the bar to access these projects by less crypto-savvy users. This, in turn, should increase the commitment of the developer community towards optimism. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project: Demos   Staking in a velo liquidity pool directly from a card (high quality):    Buying Velo directly using Euros from a bank account (high quality):    Website: https://www.alluo.com   Twitter: https://twitter.com/AlluoApp   Discord/Discourse/Community: Alluo   Github: Alluo \u00b7 GitHub   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We have more than 1k users with TVL of $2.6m across polygon and ethereum mainnet and 30k+ transactions Our yield bearing USD (29k transactions Interest Bearing Alluo USD (IbAlluoUSD) Token Tracker | PolygonScan) And the streamed version (13.7k transactions Streaming IbAlluo USD (StIbAlluoUSD) Token Tracker | PolygonScan) Other metrics:  TVL on Polygon DeBank | The Web3 Messenger & Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker  TVL on Mainnet DeBank | The Web3 Messenger & Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker   Regarding the on/off ramp itself, we have only recently started the build, initially on the Celo chain so it is too early for us to share metrics but we will create a dune dashboard that will let people follow our on/off ramp flows to Optimism and see how these are tracking against the benchmark metrics laid out below. Who are your competitors?: There are a few widget providers like ramp.network, transak, moonpay etc. but they don\u2019t focus on stablecoins and do not provide a white-label API to their services, instead they constrain developers in using their widget and function much more like a centralised exchange in an iframe rather than a genuine on/off ramp white-label payment API. What differentiates you from your competitors?:  Software developer experience End-user experience Fees  On the software developer side, our ambition is ultimately to give developers an experience that is similar to Stripe, enabling builders to go from landing on our site to getting API keys and testing their first transactions within 5 minutes. On the end-user front, we want to give end-users an experience that is on par with the best experience within the web2 space, where people don\u2019t even realise that they are interacting with a different vendor, just like people ordering online will often interact with Stripe without ever realising that this is the case. We will also enable smoother fiat to on-chain experiences, enabling someone to go from money in their bank account to providing liquidity in a pool earning rewards (see the staking Demo example). Finally, regarding fees, our objective is to have some of the lowest fees in the market from smaller (<100 Euro) to larger amounts (10k Euro+) where current providers only focus on one hand of the spectrum to the detriment of the other (e.g. MtPellerin is very competitive for <500 Euro transactions but quickly rises to 1.3% for larger transactions). Beyond card transactions, we will also offer direct bank to bank transactions with a twist in that each customer will have a separate account (vIBAN in Europe) which means that users will effectively be sending money to an account in their own name rather than in Alluo\u2019s or the Dapp\u2019s name - this is helpful because some banks in Europe have started to block transactions to crypto exchanges. In this case, those transactions will appear just like if the customer was sending money to themselves. Our focus on stablecoins rather than on a broader set of assets like most of the providers in the space should allow us economies of scale ensuring that we can consistently offer the lowest fees to our users. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: By definition, we are a white-label API payment gateway that brings fast on/off ramps for stablecoins to Optimism which virtually allows us to be used by any protocol on optimism - for the protocols who do not use stablecoins directly (e.g. NFT platforms using ETH as primarmy coin) we will use a combination of liquidity aggregators such as 1inch, 0x and paraswap to ensure the best price and execution for each transaction. This would effectively allow any token on Optimism to be bought or sold with fiat, much like a centralised exchange would have allowed but without the need to go through a formal listing process and the expensive fees that those typically entail. Team Who are your founders?: Didier Baclin https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbaclin/ Remi Tuyaerts https://www.linkedin.com/in/remituyaerts/ What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: Didier Baclin: prior experience as CEO/CPO in Fintech/Banking (SME and Consumer lending) scaling lending to $100m+ and getting a UK bank licence - this experience is highly relevant given the need to work effectively with payment partners in a highly regulated environment which is something he has done for years. Remi Tuyaerts: prior experience in Fintech in SME lending scaling to $50m+ in lending - again this experience is highly relevant given the need for Remi and the tech team to build the right technology infrastructure which is compliant but also delivers best in class experience for users. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): Bivu Das https://www.linkedin.com/in/bivu-das-17b4395/ - Bivu has a lot of experience operating within a highly regulated environment in operations and management functions Julia Shaer https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliashaer/ - Julia has also worked within the Fintech space for the past few years and as Product design lead, constantly raises the bar for customer experience Alastair Preacher https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairpreacher/ - Alastair has a 20+ years experience building products across banking, consumer retail and within the fintech space Also note that we have worked together in a previous fintech context so we are used to working as a team. Is this your first Web3 project?: Alluo is our first web3 as a team If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in [this post 1]: [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: 12m+ Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 30k OP How do you justify the size of the grant? This amount is proportional to the effort that it will take for our development team to build the best API-first white-label on/off ramp for optimism. We expect a team of 4 developers (across the blockchain and back-end API side) to work on this project for about 3 months, following which we would expect to be in maintenance mode where new features will be added on request but the bulk of the value should have been delivered. Roadmap Month 1: API enabling the on/off ramping of USDC on Optimism for UK and EU based-customers is live in Beta and available through a few protocols deployed on optimism. Month 2: Geographical expansion to either one country in LATAM or Africa - note that every integration with a new payment partner requires us to do some additional development given that each local providers have their own custom interfaces (for instance SEPA in Europe and PIX in Brazil are not the same and require different payment partners) Beyond geographical expansion, we would also like to provide unique features for an on/off ramp such as the ability to call a set of smart contracts after the funds have been brought on chain, enabling the ability to go from money in a user\u2019s bank account to funds deployed in a liquidity pool in just 1 transaction (leveraging meta transaction and batched transactions to optimise user experience). Month 3: Further geographical expansion to either one country in LATAM or Africa - in general, our ambition will be guided by the customer needs as they arise in the optimism ecosystem and the ability for us to strike new partnerships with local payment partners. Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Generally, we work in an agile way where we start from the outcome we are trying to drive and go backwards on what we need to accomplish to deliver the goal. In this case, our ambition will be to on/off ramp at least $25m within the next 12 months - whilst this may seem relatively low in comparison to the growth of some of the protocols, one has to remember that this money is currently sitting in people\u2019s bank accounts so it means we will be bringing new users and money on chain rather than merely channelling funds from one chain to another. With this in mind, our plan to accomplish this project is in 2 parts:  The build side, which we have already started given our recent Celo grant - with this in mind, the API structure of our on/off ramp is already well underway. The distribution side, which we also have started and hope to further strengthen through this grant and eventually enable us to integrate with leading protocols on Optimism such as Velodrome, Synthetix, etc. In some cases, we may elect to write the front-end code for these protocols ourselves to accelerate the integration timelines and ensure the best user-experience possible.  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) Optimistim Safe: 0xc7061dD515B602F86733Fa0a0dBb6d6E6B34aED4 Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Not really no, we are seeing the level of activity on Optimism picking up which is why we are interested in bringing our on/off ramp to OP but would see the grant as a mark of support from the OP team and the community which should help with future take up of our on/off ramp and spread its use within the OP builder community. In general, we believe that lowering the bar for people to come on chain is something that is very worthwhile pursuing so any incremental support from the foundation and community is helpful to increase trust which then increases usage and reach which leads to further trust as part of a virtuous cycle. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: We would like to participate in the governance of Optimism going forward. This is something that we expect to do whilst also generating yield when Velodrome will roll out Velodrome V2 which should allow liquidity providers to keep their voting power for governance tokens such as OP (from Velodrome: The Road Ahead. The Promise of DeFi | by Velodrome (\ud83d\udeb4,\ud83d\udeb4) | Medium). We would then expect to redistribute this yield back to our users which would further increase activity on OP. You can see that, of the Celo grant, we\u2019ve only used 500 cUSD to convert to cEUR as part of some of our early tests. Initial grant transaction here where we received 25k: CELO Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | CeloScan When we swapped 500 cUSD to cEUR here: CELO Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | CeloScan When we did our first cEUR transaction here: CELO Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | CeloScan You can also see that there was just a bit more than a month between the moment we received the grant funds and our first live transaction which is why we are confident that we can provide a first live API version on/off ramping USDC on optimism within 1 month of the grant. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. As all predictions, it is always difficult to be 100% accurate but it is likely that it will take us a few months to become known in the market but of course, integrating with the likes of Velodrome or Synthetix could increase these volumes significantly in a very short timeframe.      Monthly volume Cumulative     Month 1 $100,000 $100,000   Month 2 $160,000 $260,000   Month 3 $260,000 $520,000   Month 4 $410,000 $930,000   Month 5 $640,000 $1,570,000   Month 6 $970,000 $2,540,000   Month 7 $1,400,000 $3,940,000   Month 8 $2,000,000 $5,940,000   Month 9 $2,800,000 $8,740,000   Month 10 $3,900,000 $12,640,000   Month 11 $5,300,000 $17,940,000   Month 12 $7,100,000 $25,040,000    Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Critical milestone 1: Having our API live and enabling the on/off ramping of USDC on optimism with best-in-class speed (ie <60 seconds from when funds are received), fees (<1% for bank transactions of any size) and ability for protocols to tailor the experience and look and feel the way they want to. Critical milestone 2: Having our API integrated in production with at least 5 different protocols on Optimism - this will demonstrate our ability to build partnerships with protocols and showcase the superior experience we aim to create for both end-users and developers. Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: We believe providing a white-label payment API is a core feature to lower the bar for everyday people to transact on Optimism. This, in turn, could enable a broader range of use cases to be developed on Optimism, particularly real-world applications where interfaces with more traditional payment methods are necessary. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We do believe that it is still difficult for new users to get funds on optimism today - particularly if they are not familiar with Centralised exchanges and bridges. We believe that a \u201cnative\u201d experience that feels like web2 but gets funds on chain and deployed into protocols on Optimism is one of the keys to grow the ecosystem. Similarly, the ability for people to easily get funds back off-chain should also limit any fear that people might have going on-chain in the first place. Often, people will want to make sure they can get their money out before committing larger sums on chain. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We believe bringing new users and money to the Optimism ecosystem is fundamental to its long term sustainability - we would love for Optimism to be the first chain that 1000s of new people would interact with for the first time. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: Very committed given what the OP team has already managed to achieve in a relatively short period of time which gives us a lot of confidence in the future of the OP ecosystem. The recent announcement by coinbase to build on the OP stack merely reinforces that belief. Is your project Optimism Native?: No Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined [here]: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

                    "content": "Hi @Gonna.eth thanks for your questions:  Do I lose the self-custody of my assets when I deposit in Alluo?   No, Alluo is a non-custodial wallet which connected directly to the Alluo protocol which an on-chain liquidity direction protocol   Is Alluo open source?   Everything is open source today with the exception of the mobile app but that is something we plan on open sourcing in the future You can have a look at our github here: Alluo \u00b7 GitHub   Do you have any \u201cproof of funds\u201d where users can check the funds are on-chain and safe?   Given we\u2019re non custodial and the protocol is all on chain I don\u2019t believe we have the same sorts of risks as centralised exchanges such as Celsius, FTX etc. Alluo stakers vote on the where the liquidity of the protocol should go - today that is all on mainnet in curve/convex pools but as part of further work, we would like to Alluo protocol to also be able to deploy funds on Optimisim (e.g. Velodrome) The list of all our deployed contracts is here: https://library.alluo.com/ (you may notice some deployments on Opti already  )   Will \u201cfees (<1% for bank transactions of any size)\u201d be Alluo\u2019s revenue? Is there any other source of revenue for Alluo that I\u2019m missing?   The bulk of Alluo\u2019s revenue today is coming from the difference between the advertised APY and the realised APY - for instance if the USD Stablecoin farm is fixed at 7% during a governance cycle (2 week period today) and the actual yield was say 10%, then the difference, 3% is considered protocol revenue redistributed to Alluo stakers. Conversely, if the yield delivered is lower (say 5%), then the -2% (annualised) would be slashed from the Alluo stakers. This ensures that Alluo stakers balance risk and rewards given they get an upside from positive spread but a downside from negative spreads. We see this initiative as a way to lower the bar for people to get on chain after growing increasingly frustrated with the current on/off ramp offerings.   If I\u2019m correct you got to 30k OP given that is the effort it\u2019ll take devs to create this project. But Alluo is paying for their salaries and retaining the OP tokens to be used as governance?   That is correct   Is Alluo a traditional company or a DAO? do you have your own governance token or how do you decentralize the Alluo organization?   We operate as a DAO through a governance token, the Alluo token, which can be locked (staked) for voting rights (vlAlluo) and is used as part of governance cycles every 2 weeks to determine the liquidity direction for the 4 types of assets the protocol caters for today (USD stables, EUR stables, ETH and BTC). Alluo stakers receive the yield described above in the form of CVX/ETH which is further compounded in our boosted farms where CRV & CVX rewards are converted to CVX and staked in Curve/Convex for maximum rewards.

StationX.network is a protocol to create DAOs using customisable templates for any use-case and start governing & managing assets together, all in under 60 seconds. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed? There will exist millions of multiplayer structures on-chain for everything, starting from small pools of friends to a community of 50K+. Small & large people networks investing in opportunities, running different businesses/protocols, funding ideas, collecting assets together, lending/borrowing assets, selling different things & a lot more. DAOs\u2019 AUM was $13B in 2022 and is expected to go to $1T by 2032. And this will only be possible with a platform like StationX that lets people create, manage and do a lot more with DAOs effortlessly. Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how Yes, we plan to open RFPs where we would incentivize builders to create integrations and other features. Builders would also be able to create new templates & sell them on the marketplace ahead in our roadmap. The protocol SDK would allow anyone to integrate a pool/group creator on top of any dApp (imagine a bunch of friends being able to create a pool and add liquidity on any DeFi platform) Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: No Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: No Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: bit.ly/stnxdemo Website: https://stationx.network  Twitter: twitter.com/stationxnetwork  Telegram: Telegram: Contact @stationxnetwork   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.) We\u2019re currently in Private Beta. Some DAOs with whom we\u2019re having conversations & are testing our product are Wealth Ventures, Phree - Defi Lending Protocol, Paxo.finance, OGClub DAO & a few web2 syndicates who want to transition to Web3. Who are your competitors? Some companies that are currently working on this problem are Syndicate.io, Juicebox, Aragon & DAOhaus. What differentiates you from your competitors? We are creating a platform which has multiple templates (pre-built & custom-made) built for different use cases that our competitors don\u2019t have. Every club/collective has a separate use case and needs a customised solution that our platform can offer. For example we\u2019re working on a template that would have integrations & capabilities to seamlessly provide liquidity to DeFi protocols like Aave, Lido etc & would encourage DeFi DAOs & community pools. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes, DApp integrations to make the journey of DAOs on StationX smooth is one of our main focus areas. StationX contracts allow any DAO to interact with DApps for various use cases.  Team Who are your founders? 4 of us with CS backgrounds, ran a marketing & tech services company in India right after university from 2019 to 2021.   Rishav used to invest in crypto since 2017 (started with investing in projects through small pools & communities that had allocation with private investors). Invested in over 30 projects, this is where he first encountered the problem. Found out small communities came together to act as micro VCs, funds, and syndicates.  Subham has been building & shipping products since 2019. He soon transitioned into smart contracts. He has worked on multiple projects for clients ranging from retail, e-commerce, universities to build applications for custom use cases.  Pranav has more than 3 years of experience in product design, community & marketing. He started working with Web3 projects in mid-2021 and worked with over 10 projects to build their community.  Toshit is a performance marketeer with more than 3 years of experience in marketing & operations, worked with web3 projects since mid-2021 to generate traction & helped them with getting investors & partners on board.  What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)? The founding team has been working together since 2019, and scaled a profitable services business to $1M in ARR. Rishav has been in the Web3 space since 2017, where he used to invest in early stage projects as a part of multiple pools (or DAOs). Subham has more than 6 years of experience in development & 2 years of experience writing Smart Contracts. Toshit is a performance marketeer & has managed a team of 15+ people in his previous startup. Pranav has more than 3 years of experience in product design, community & marketing. Having worked together for more than 4 years scaling a business & the different skillset that each person brings to the table gives us an advantage over an equally qualified team. Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): The rest of the team is primarily based in India & are all developers across Blockchain & Frontend roles. Is this your first Web3 project? Not exactly, prior to this Rishav built a Twitter scraper for targeted news as a side project and a community of 3000 people went on to use it. I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post 2: [Yes/No]: Yes Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has We\u2019ve received grants from Polygon DAO, Aave Grants DAO & Filecoin and we\u2019re also a part of OVs Filecoin basecamp. We currently have about 6 months of runway.  Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50K How do you justify the size of the grant? The grant would be split in 3 core components :  Building on Optimism with top DeFi platform integrations. Exploring a grant DAO template based on Optimism Grants Model User onboarding on Optimism  The grant amount would be utilised to :  50% to Compensate the team 50% dedicated towards Quadratic Funding or Sponsored Liquidity to DAO/Pool treasuries that would be deployed on StationX. This component would be locked even for DAOs/Pools that setup on StationX.   Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:  Deploy StationX on Optimism Launch our marketing campaign Onboard users who want to create DAOs Adding features/DApp integrations based on feedback from the community  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): No Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: No What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: After a year of lockup it would be free for communities & team members to use the tokens as they will. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. Our milestones are centred around building the key infrastructure to enable the creation & functioning of DAOs on Optimism. Once the key infrastructure is in place, the next goal is around onboarding DAOs on StationX & working with them to improve the functionalities & adding features. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.  Milestone 1: 30-45 days to build and deploy on Optimism Milestone 2: 45 days to onboard users on the platform and test various DAO categories.   Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? Yes, through our project, people will be able to create DAOs for any use-case on Optimism. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?  With more DAOs on StationX, more TVL on Optimism, DAOs on StationX encourage more community initiatives, which leads to more initiatives that further the ecosystem\u2019s growth.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? The goal is to target the degen community, governance participants and early supporters of Optimism to build DAOs on Optimism. We have a strategy to build a sizeable DAO on Optimism and through it\u2019s members & their network effects more DAOs will be formed. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism? The team is fully committed to building on Optimism. Is your project Optimism Native? Yes  Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

ERC-20 tokens deployed with Aragon can be used to gate a DAO on StationX but cannot be used to vote at this point(we\u2019re currently working on such mechanisms where StationX can wrap such treasuries). Wrapping a custom ERC-20 token like the above is something that is planned in our roadmap where clubs can use any token created previously can be used to govern.   Wonderverse is a task management platform for DAOs, where you can assign taska & track progress. On the other hand, we are a treasury management platform where people can govern the treasury using action-backed proposals   Let me know if you have any more questions, would be happy to answer! ",

An example of a benchmark milestone here would be something like x new features every month, x new DAOs every month, or something we can check as progress. Benchmark milestones are meant to enable the proposer to display success to the Optimism community and for the Optimism community to monitor grantees\u2019 progress. Completion of benchmark milestones is not required for the full award of a grant; rather, the completion or non-completion of benchmark milestones will inform the community of a proposer\u2019s commitment to the Optimism community and may factor into future grant decisions. The same goes for the critical milestones if you can be more specific on what are you deploying in the first 45 days and how many users you aim to onboard on Milestone 2 we can track and measure.
