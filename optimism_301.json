Yes, the Tooling Committee.  Project description (please explain how your project works): We are proposing that Messari provide the Optimism community with quarterly governance, ecosystem, and financial reports while continuing to build out subgraphs for the ecosystem. This would serve to better inform existing stakeholders as well as attract new ones while building out the open-source data infrastructure for the community. These reports would live as free resources on Messari and would be distributed through our newsletter (250k subscribers), social channels, and third-party distribution partners including Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Thomson Reuters. Governance Services Governance Season recaps  Track OP distributions across Ecosystem Funds, retroactive public goods funding, and airdrops.   Category breakdown of Governance Fund distributions. Delegate analysis looks at how voting power distribution and delegate participation rates have changed. Governance process analysis aggregates individual proposal results and provides structural analysis on process pain points, community feedback, and potential improvements  Investor Relations Quarterly reporting  Present and analyze major KPIs and fundamental metrics (transactions, fees, protocol revenue) Network-level stats ( contracts deployed, developer activity). Distribution across Bloomberg terminal, S&P Capital IQ, Refinitiv Continued subgraph development for Optimism ecosystem projects  image1103\u00d7827 94.5 KB    Initiation of coverage  Our standard protocol deep dive that breaks down what Optimism is building and why it matters, while contextualizing it within the broader crypto landscape. It will also delve into a comparative analysis and breakdown of the token economics.  Ecosystem report  Ecosystem report highlighting the major project\u2019s building across various verticals such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, etc. contextualizing why they are built on Optimism compared to other base layers.

Yes, all reports generated on behalf of this grant will be open-sourced on Messari.  Optimism native?: No  Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: The release dates will vary by report.  Governance Services: Published prior to the beginning of each season, for the next four seasons. Investor Relations:  Initiation of Coverage: One-time report released end of Nov/early Dec 2022. Quarterly Reporting: Quarterly reporting for the next four quarters beginning Q4 2022. Ecosystem Reporting will be released in Q1 2023.     1600\u00d7900 181 KB   Ecosystem Value Proposition:  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? There are two main problems this proposal addresses: a lack of full-spectrum reporting and standardized data infrastructure. While projects often have scattered data dashboards, analytics pages, or other resources to better understand the protocol and the economic activity around it, there remains a need for standardized reporting so that anyone can analyze it like they would a company\u2019s annual financial statement. The standardized reports mentioned above are arguably more important in an environment committed to \u2018relentlessly iterating\u2019 on experimentation, where iterating on the impact of past decisions is the driving force behind future decisions. Without a full view of which aspects of past experiments worked (or didn\u2019t), the community faces an uphill battle in making the optimal decision for future iterations. Additionally, there is no readily available data infrastructure to pull relevant metrics to assess the network as a whole and individual ecosystem projects. This makes proper analysis difficult for any developers or analysts looking to pull raw data.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Messari\u2019s team of Data Scientists and Research Analysts are committed to providing credibly-neutral, data-driven reports to assist the broader Optimism community in making high-impact decisions. By combining our protocol and ecosystem deep-dives along with our recurring governance and quarterly reports, the community can easily remain informed on all aspects comprising Optimism. Additionally we\u2019ll be improving the tooling available to facilitate a more robust developer community through the creation and maintenance of subgraphs that bootstrap the open-source infrastructure for anyone to create powerful tools. While we recently became core subgraph developers we\u2019ve already seen this in action with third-party developers using our subgraphs to build dashboards to track liquidations across top lending platforms.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? This proposal is designed to grow the Optimism ecosystem by attracting new stakeholders through better surfacing of fundamental data, governance initiatives, and core developments. Without adequate investor relations services and standardized reporting, it can be difficult for new entrants to find reliable data with the necessary context to make sense of it in order to make informed decisions. We aim to create the 10Q equivalent in the same way anyone can go to Apple\u2019s financial statements to learn more about the company and its performance, anyone can publicly see Optimism\u2019s reports to learn more about the protocol and observe it\u2019s performance. Over time, this will bring more stakeholders into the ecosystem who will be more likely to contribute value to the DAO, allocating their time and money to grow the network. Not only are we creating these reports but we\u2019re ensuring they get sent out to a wide audience that can consume them. This is done through Messari\u2019s channels of over a quarter million crypto-natives, which reach most of the active professionals in the industry as well as through our distribution relationships with Bloomberg, S&P, and Refinitiv. This goes a long way to further professionalize Optimism to the vast majority of major funds, banks, financial service companies, and large corporates in the world that will better grasp the magnitude of economic activity generated by the protocol. There are trillions of dollars in AUM represented by these platforms so even a small percentage of users consuming this information and acting on it can drive meaningful volume to Optimism and its ecosystem projects.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. No.  Number of OP tokens requested: 365,000 OP (updated from 420,000k to reflect 30-day TWAP)  Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No  If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A  How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A  Proposal for token distribution:  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining.) The OP tokens will be used to fund internal resources. Which include:  Research - Our analysts spend several weeks each report along with an extensive internal editing and review process by the broader team. We also have protocol specialists working with engineering to create the schema for subgraphs (ex: standardizing what protocol revenue look like for different sectors on Optimism ecosystem projects) Data science - Each report will have its own dedicated data scientist tasked with providing all the relevant raw data Marketing - We have several members of the team working on distribution for these reports across all of Messari\u2019s channels along with the third-party partners   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals. N/A  Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Each milestone will be trackable by the timely release of each report, as outlined above.  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? N/A  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) N/A ",

                    "content": "Some thought on this proposal and the counter-proposal from DefiLllama.  It is true that Messari provides substantial value through their experience with reporting crypto ecosystems and their wide and influential audience. Being covered by Messari is a value in itself. Even though DefiLlama is a big brand in the crypto space (DeFi in particular) they\u2019re not known yet for their reports, the quality of the work is more uncertain However, from the OP perspective the more coverage, the better. And more entities covering the Optimism ecosystem from different perspectives, the better. In that sense Messari and DefiLlama proposals are not mutually exclusive and thouldn\u2019t be treated like this-or-that. Why not both? Even though the coverage in both services provides value for the OP ecosystem, it provides comparable (if not bigger) value to those services as well:  The data and the reports will be available within those services exclusively and will attract lots of users, especially from within the OP community. Those services hold copyrights to those reports and can reuse them. While preparing the reports, those services build unique in-house know-how.    Given that, I believe that even though Optimism Collective might incentivise those services to cover the OP ecosystem, it should not be expected to cover full costs of such coverage. Dunno what is the standard in other ecosystems but I believe that something like a 50/50 split of costs between the service and OP would be fair at the beginning (and should be expected to decrease later on if those reports gain popularity). And if OP is covering all the production costs, it should also hold all the copyrights to the produced reports and probably should consider doing such reports internally - providing licences, even for free, to all the interested parties to include their reports within their own services.

                    "content": "Appreciate the thoughts @kaereste on that 3rd points some clarifications:  While more users on our site reading the report is great, we don\u2019t have ads that would subsidize the cost of the reports We don\u2019t keep these reports exclusively on our site. We encourage projects to share them far and wide whether hosting on their site, distributing on newsletters, etc. Our goal is to get as many eyeballs on the reports as possible. Which is also why we enable 3rd parties such as Bloomberg and S&P to redistribute them for free. Analyst expertise is also great and it enables us to provide additional value-add over time but again there\u2019s no direct monetization form that that can subsidize the costs of these reports.  Messari Protocol Services exists as a business unit separately from the Enterprise (paywalled) portion and is therefore reliant entirely on grants to fund the significant resources that go into this work. If we were to only request 50% of the cost, this frankly wouldn\u2019t be sustainable at all. We have put a lot of thought into the pricing and feel we\u2019ve been able to leverage our size and expertise having done this for over 30 DAOs to minimize costs as much as possible. For reference, this is the budget for the financial reporting arms of other DAOs:  MakerDAO has a Strategic Finance team doing  their reporting for $1.3 million/year. Aave is spending $1.5m on similar services  We recognize this is not apples to apples and these scopes are broader than just reporting/analytics but I think it showcases the substantial work that goes into these types of services.

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2. About the project  Messari is a research and data analysis company with a mission to organize and contextualize information in the crypto space. Messari has become a reputable name in the ecosystem as an aggregator of information, data and research. With a high volume of daily visits, their website offers a data platform for graphs and advanced metrics for cryptoassets, offering a free tier and paid subscriptions. Similar OP Governance proposals:   DeFillama reports - 182.5K OP tokens (as a counter-offer to Messari\u2019s proposal, see original post here).   3. About the following  The proposal was published on October 20, with a good level of interaction and questions from some committee members.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): seems to be good. A pending issue for the ecosystem is governance and ecosystem reports. These data help the members of the governance to be updated.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. These reports would have a positive impact on the Optimism ecosystem, not only because they keep governance members up to date, but also because they can attract new players to the governance. The Optimism Collective would have a wider reach.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready. Messari has already produced 2 reports for Optimism governance: State of Optimism Governance and **Governance Fund Observations. also developed 4 subgraphs of the important Optimism protocols Aave v3 , Curve , Uniswap v3 2, QiDAO.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. The OP tokens will be used to fund internal resources. Which include: Research, data science and marketing. The proposal has a brief description of how the funds will be used.  Amount requested (high to low): high. the amount requested is 365k token OP considering other similar proposals made by reputable DeFi analysts at the moment.   5. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Abstain We believe Messari is a great product and has a great reputation in the ecosystem. There is no doubt that their reports add a lot to the ecosystem. However, we have some dilemmas with their proposals, since, as Messari themselves clarify that optimism would be hiring a \u201cservice\u201d. On the other hand, in case it is contracted as a service, we believe it should go through another governance process. Finally, the appearance of a counter-proposal reaffirms that it would be appropriate for governance to more calmly define the appropriate approach for this type of service and what it implies, considering the offers on the table.

While we do view this as an \u201cinvestor relations service\u201d there is still a public goods infrastructure component we feel fits into the Governance Fund. As the docs state:  The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects.  A clear gap in the Optimism ecosystem has been governance accountability which we are planning to directly address in our recurring governance reporting. These aren\u2019t just one-off reports but we\u2019ll be open-sourcing the entire data layer to enable others to extract valuable insights from and build on over time. In terms of driving growth, it\u2019s pretty clear how accessing over 250k crypto natives and 1 million active users across three of the largest research platforms in the world will get Optimism in front of nearly every major financial institution and large corporate who are not only getting smart on crypto but increasingly committing resources to partner with and even interact on chain with various protocols. Lastly, we feel the counter-proposal shouldn\u2019t be swaying the decision here as it was a last-minute copy/paste attempt to provide services we\u2019ve spent over a year building with a team of ~50 employees working full-time in our Protocol Services arm. Not only is there no experience having done any type of long-form financial reporting or governance research but no detail was given as to who would be producing these reports nor any insight into the reach they would receive.

The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects.

I am not judging the quality produced by Messari but my major concern is need and importance. At this stage of gov, to me, accounting of fund is more important than the state of gov.

The points made for abstaining/no have been the following:  Gov funding is the wrong route:  We\u2019ve received clarity from the OP Foundation that GF is in fact the correct path for us. So in the case that delegates disagree with the mandate, I\u2019d love to hear an explanation as to why DefiLlama\u2019s retro funding for their dashboards does qualify while ours does not (especially when DLs is entirely retroactive while ours is for work to be completed in the future)   Value vs. price  Our ask is similar to what DeFiLlama has requested with the bulk being their data dashboards. While our free dashboards are only a few months old and we\u2019re continuing to grow the product, what we\u2019re building is even more comprehensive tracking TVL, trading volume, revenue, liquidity added/removed not only from the macro level but on an individual pool basis as well (with the underlying infrastructure also open source-source) This is in addition to the long-form reports that reach >250k crypto natives and 1m+ through 3 of the largest research platforms that get in front of nearly every major financial institution and large corporate who are not only getting smart on crypto but increasingly committing resources to partner with and even interact on chain with various protocols. (Think Polygon/Starbucks or KKR/Avalanche)   Alternate proposal  I\u2019ve outlined my concerns here and in the above comments but the fact there has been not a response shows it was not a serious proposal with any thought put into actually executing on it    *While this comparison is to DeFiLlama\u2019s current proposal as that\u2019s the closest comp, I\u2019m not saying that is not worth funding, just that voting yes for DL while no to ours for reasons that apply to both is inconsistent.

Lets look at description on gov fund in our Operating manual.    Operating Manual of the Optimism Collective v0.2.1   OP distributions to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. Proposals should follow   This roughly translate to; any proposal is eligible to submit a grant request as long they are seeking fund from gov and believe that their proposal will grow OP ecosystem. Its not OP foundation job to evaluate each proposal and pass their judgement, any one can reach out to OP Foundation and ask if their proposal falls under gov fund or not and as long they are using the right proposal format and using $OP from gov fund, they will say Yes. And, in my opinion, that is what happened during the call. At the end its delegates duties to decide and make a call on the proposal. While comparison is good, we also need to understand that each proposal is different is one way or another. I dont have anything new to add one other points, though. Hope this help ",

Optimism GREATLY lacks an official DeFi media presence, so this proposal is an excellent step in the right direction. I\u2019d go further and say that Optimism should have these sorts of agreements set up with other media groups. Though I will say that I\u2019m afraid I massively have to disagree with this decision being pushed onto Delegates. The OP foundation\u2019s marketing + comms CCs should handle this internally (alongside other media agreements similar to this one). It\u2019s a tough decision to push onto delegates whose typical mandate has strayed far from this one. I know the OP foundation has advised that this is the correct path, but I disagree. They should handle this one internally and use the pot of OP they have to pay for it, or even do some 50/50 split. But anyway, this proposal is still up in the air, and I think it is helpful and a step in the right direction for OP. The Ambassador vote is still the same (abstain), but I just wanted to drop my thoughts here as other delegates decide. ",

We believe designing bottoms up professional reporting standards will be an existential need for the industry in the coming quarters given an imminent regulatory crackdown. Proving that communities are invested in reducing information asymmetries by providing grant funding for financial reporting will be helpful in showing policymakers - in the US AND internationally - that the industry is taking steps to self-regulate and clean up some of the messy self-dealing that has plagued us for years. The UX matters. We have analysts that cover: project descriptions and risk factors (human capital dependent), \u201ccorporate actions\u201d and governance activity (human capital and taxonomy dependent), and descriptive overviews of quarterly performance and key milestones (human capital dependent). We also have a large team invested in creating and maintaining open subgraphs with common data structures (as Jack has mentioned) that is fully open source, and we ensure these reports and data are distributed broadly and freely. This grant is about providing scalable data and reporting standards, broad distribution, and consistent messaging to policymakers about standards setting work the industry is working towards.

I was originally against this proposal because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s aligned with the purpose of the governance fund (same with the Defi Lama proposal) and would be better suited for the partner fund or the retroactive public goods funding program.  The Foundation clarified that the governance fund is the appropriate pipeline for this proposal, but governance is not really equipped to handle decisions around this type of vendor proposal at the moment.  @JackPurdy_Messari  has done a phenomenal job of addressing concerns and answering questions.  Ultimately, I don\u2019t think this is the right time for this particular proposal type and standby my decision to abstain, and not vote against.  I have massive respect for the Messari team and everything you guys do! ",

Since there has been a lot of discussion about the various funding routes this type of work could take, I wanted to provide some additional clarity about my comments on the last community call. My intention was to clarify that the best route through Token House was through the Governance Fund as there is not another proposal type (to contract service providers, for example) that is applicable at this time. Our next round of RetroPGF would be a good avenue for funding something like this (more details to be shared soon!) ",
