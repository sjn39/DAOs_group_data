Sentence Summary This SPF will fund the creation of the first DeFi-focused dataset to train models detecting DeFi community sentiment/narratives. It will be used to augment and extend the Risk CU\u2019s (RISK-001\u2019s) modelling to discover and predict currently hidden risks.  Paragraph Summary The Risk CU\u2019s modelling currently covers only part of market risks. Maker needs to augment the EMH-based risk model in use with a model of market sentiment and narratives and its mutual bidirectional interaction with on-chain activity. This SPF will fund the creation of the first DeFi-focused dataset for training sentiment/narrative detection models. It\u2019s part of the web3-native intelligence program.  Motivation This SPF will fund creation of the first DeFi-focused dataset for training sentiment/narrative detection models that will be used to augment and extend the Risk CU\u2019s modelling with products like:  An early warning system for events like Black Thursday: be aware in advance => get prepared, the UST case. Simulations and stress-testing: Chaos Labs are building a simulation environment to run Maker\u2019s software against agents and scenarios. Currently they\u2019re built around a set of theoretical premises. Models of crypto community sentiment/narratives learned from real-life data could be used to build true to life agents and scenaries. Products from pp 1, 2 could be wrapped into products for other web3 stakeholders: DAOs, users, investors. Could be serious competition for Gauntlet\u2019s business, which is suboptimal for web3. If open sourced, datasets and models could also be a valuable public good, from which the whole web3 community could benefit => PR/reputation benefit for Maker.  The Risk CU\u2019s modelling currently covers only part of market risks. Maker needs to augment the EMH-based risk model in use with a model of market sentiment and narratives and its mutual bidirectional interaction with on-chain activity.  The key assumption at the heart of the Risk CU\u2019s model is the Efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). It implies that an asset price is objectively determined by the entirety of available information about the asset and its value (in the form of present discounted value). The market is rational and each price movement is the reflection of the new information unpredictably emerging. Hence we\u2019re modelling it as a random process with Monte Carlo simulations. However, Nobel-winning research by Robert Shiller shows that irrational factors like sentiment and narratives play an equally important role in asset pricing. In fact, the Nobel Prize in Economics '13 was shared by Shiller and Eugene Fama, the creator of the Efficient-market hypothesis. This underscores that EHM- and sentiment/narrative-driven asset pricing are two complimentary mechanisms and market risk modelling should be handled accordingly. The most obvious example of irrational exuberance on financial markets are bubbles like the one happened around UST \u2014 all information about its model was open, yet the bubble emerged and then collapsed. Wild price volatility not explainable by objective economic factors, including crypto winters, happening to more mature assets like ETH is also an example of risks not covered by risk models based on the Efficient-market hypothesis.  This project is a continuation of the work on web3-native intelligence. At the previous step I showed that the UST stablecoin crash in May could be predicted by significant downward movement in sentiment towards UST starting in mid-April resulting in the loss of confidence => panic => death spiral. Now the goal is to improve model\u2019s accuracy by creating the first DeFi-focused dataset to train language models for analysis of the DeFi community sentiment.  Special Purpose Fund Name Pioneer a DeFi-Native Dataset for Modelling Sentiment-driven Dynamics and Risks  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials This SPF will fund the next step of the web3-native intelligence program as follows:  Assemble the first DeFi-focused corpus of English tweets for language model pre-training. Pretrain BERTweet_large on the DeFi corpus from step 1. Build a software pipeline necessary for dynamic adversarial data collection (DADC). Run around 20 (depending on intermediate results) small DADC rounds.   Funding Breakdown Fund the steps from the previous paragraph as follows:  5k DAI 5k DAI 8k DAI : 4.1 8k DAI after DADC round 5; 4.2 8k DAI after DADC round 10; 4.3 8k DAI after DADC round 15; 4.4 8k DAI after the last DADC round.

To me it looks very significant. And there is no reason to assume that crypto market is less irrationally volatile and more efficient than stock markets. Most likely on the contrary given the role social media and social networks play in initiating and reinforcing trends in web3/DeFi. These risks remain uncovered at present. ",

But fundamentally, as Dai itself is over collateralized, it didn\u2019t suffer as badly as others. In other words, it was not our understanding or lack of understanding of sentiment that helped us, it was the structure of the Dai peg.   Sure, DAI is overcollateralized. But how does it actually work? How is Collateralization Ratio determined? Surplus buffer? If all Maker needed was overcollateralization, if overcollateralization solved all problems, why would we need risk modelling? It\u2019s important, because if collateral price drops fast enough + other factors like slippage => Maker is unable to recover full vault\u2019s outstanding DAI => bad debt is accrued. In the worst case scenario this may lead to Maker becoming insolvent. Hence, price drop (aka market risk) scenarios must be predicted (simulated) to determine optimal parameter values. Problem is at the moment Risk CU is only able to cover about half (maybe less) of price movement risks, aka market risk. They couldn\u2019t even if they wanted because they don\u2019t have tools. In a nutshell. Risk CU runs a Collateral Risk Model trying to predict collateral price shocks\u2019 effect on protocol economics. Its output determines a bunch of risk-driven vault parameters like Risk Premium and Debt Ceiling. Current design of the Model assumes market to be efficient and simulates price movements as a random process. That\u2019s the definition of the Efficient-market hypothesis.  Image (7)1886\u00d71069 194 KB  However, it was shown that only about 7% of the variance of annual stock market returns can be justified in terms of efficient market factors for the aggregate U.S. stock market 1871\u20131987. For individual-firm stock price variations it was estimated the standard deviation of the \u2018\u2018atypical discount\u2019\u2019 was about 25%. It was concluded that the inefficient component of stock price variation that generates predictable movements in future returns \u2018\u2018still has an economically significant impact on firm-level stock prices\u2019. Importantly, given high correlation between crypto assets and due to the impact of sentiment/narrative on the crypto market through social media/social networks like Twitter and Discord, it\u2019s very likely that the impact of inefficient market factors on crypto asset price movements is far higher than that for individual firm stock prices and closer to 50%, maybe more. See crypto bubbles/winters. This SPF is an effort towards covering the other (inefficient) half of market risks, which have an impact on collateral price variations => determine whether Maker is solvent at the end of the day. Moreover, The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been gauging public sentiment since 2013 and integrating this data into its models. Baker and Wurgler reviewed the investor sentiment literature and showed that a \u201csentiment index\u201d is highly correlated with aggregate stock returns. See also Handbook of Economic Expectations and an overview of literature on Expectations data in asset pricing in particular. See also Shiller\u2019s book on Narrative economics. Bear market, the time when downward price shocks happen threatening protocol solvency, is exactly when such tooling is badly needed. You can\u2019t just ignore inefficient market risks and hope they won\u2019t materialise. @Matt_NZ ",

Then there\u2019s a layer of complexity to quantify it well and of course to integrate it into the existing modeling framework. The latter is a unique challenge as the model is not accommodated for this kind of input (which is crucial and lacking in your proposal). Leveraging modern language models such as FinBERT with additional tuning on crypto corpus definitely helps but that\u2019s a relatively small part of the final solution that adds value. I wouldn\u2019t put too much trust in behavioral economics literature (regardless of Nobel Prizes received) given that it\u2019s a subset of behavioral science which has a massive replication crisis (37% of the research results can be replicated). Also, behavioral economic interventions have (on average) a 1.4% impact on outcome variables in the real world. Needless to say, the field as a whole mostly over-promises and under-delivers empirically. To move beyond theory, in our Collateral Risk Model there is no EMH assumption. As @lyt mentioned, we don\u2019t try to predict price movement (Black Swans), we rather focus on what we see as knowable. For all the unknowable aspects of the Maker system (there\u2019s many) we try to minimize related assumptions in the modeling process. We also don\u2019t use any random processes for price movement that you mentioned as a proof for EMH assumption. We look at historical patterns for price shocks and add an additional layer of conservative assumptions. The key aspect of the model related to EMH is that we don\u2019t divide market risk between efficient and inefficient movement (nor focus on either of them explicitly). We estimate a certain price shock, how the Maker system would respond and the consequences on protocol economics (as explained in the post that you shared). ",

My initial premise was based on Risk CU\u2019s presentation outlining Risk Model design. In particular it states that the input about asset prices was modeled with GBM \u2013 Geometric Brownian Motion. GBM is a standard model of a random process. Hence, the assumption is that collateral price movement is random => Efficient Market Hypothesis assumption.      The GBM methodology has been deprecated, because it required inclusion of estimates about non-EHM volatility => it doesn\u2019t allow to adequately assess risks of price shocks. Now the approach is to assess collateral price volatility risks based on historical extremums. This leads to extremely conservative protocol parameter values => reduced capital efficiency. I\u2019m reworking my proposal to highlight that integrating the crypto community sentiment component into the Risk Model will  bring risk assessments to the more realistic middle ground between underestimating risks (random process + arbitrary volatility multiplier) and conservative policy based on the worst case scenarios ever happened on the market. This will improve capital efficiency, which will bring value both for the DAO and to the Maker users. ",

Reminder to let us know after you make your edits (tagging GovAlpha is great), once they sit for at least 7 days we can move this to a weekly poll the following Monday. ",

By acting as intermediaries that accept deposits from many savers, banks can allow depositors to access their money when they wish, while also offering long-term loans to borrowers. However, their analysis also showed how the combination of these two activities makes banks vulnerable to rumours about their imminent collapse. If a large number of savers simultaneously run to the bank to withdraw their money, the rumour may become a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2013 a bank run occurs and the bank collapses.
