The parameters to discuss are  Debt ceiling Liquidation Ratio Stability Fee  Auction parameters are likely not needed as the stablecoins will go in with a fixed oracle price of $1 (the way USDC currently is). Additionally, liquidations will remain disabled. As a result of this thread, a governance poll will go up (likely) Wednesday with a specific package of risk parameters. ",

Suggested Parameters: USDC  Stability Fee: 0% Liquidation Ratio: 110% Debt Ceiling: 10-20MM  We believe a 0% stability fee is the most effective given the spread of secondary borrowing rates relative to the stability fee. Additionally, we believe a liquidation ratio of 110% is more capital efficient for market participants than other secondary platforms with liquidation ratios between 133%-150%. With liquidations disabled, MKR holders are still protected. We see value in having a debt ceiling between 10-20MM for USDC. Given PaxUSD, TUSD, and USDC involve 3 different counterparties, we propose having the combined debt ceilings of the 3 stablecoins be less than 20MM to mitigate counterparty risk. PaxUSD and TUSD  Stability Fee: 0% Liquidation Ratio: 110% Debt Ceiling: 2.5-5MM  PaxUSD and TUSD would be new stablecoins for Maker, so they may warrant a lower debt ceiling. If the demand for PaxUSD and TUSD increases substantially, governance can always raise the debt ceiling. USDT USDT likely requires significantly more time on the diligence side, so we propose focusing on USDC, PaxUSD, and TUSD. ",

The third obvious candidate, Tether (USDT), is a special case so I will not include that one in this analysis. Do they have the funds they claim they have? Both USDC and PAX provide monthly attestations where a law firm provides a written statement about the number of outstanding stablecoins and the corresponding amount of fiat reserve. TUSD provides realtime attestations of funds through Armanino. USDC: https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency PAX: https://www.paxos.com/attestation/ TUSD: https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/token/TrueUSD Although not perfectly watertight, as the attestation could be manipulated by financial engineering (i.e. ABB 2002 scandal), the setup will hold in the vast majority of cases especially as it is done on a monthly basis. Additionally all the companies in this analysis are US based, so the uniformity and strictness of accounting practices should rule out most if not all attempts to present wrongful data. USDC: Consortium owned by Coinbase and Circle. USDC managed by Circle Internet Financial. Registered with FINCEN as a Money Services Business in the United States. PAX: Paxos Trust Company, LLC. Jurisdiction: United States. TUSD: Trusttoken. Listed as private company registered in San Francisco, US. That were the obvious parts - now on to the details. It is in the interest of MakerDAO that collateral types have high market cap and distributed use in order to maintain liquidity and lessen the risk of centralized failure. All data from Coinmarketcap.com. USDC: USD723 million market cap. Listed on 220 exchanges. 75% of volume on BitMart, Omgfin, Folgory, Fatbtc and Binance. PAX: USD245 million market cap. Listed on 96 exchanges. 80-85% of volume takes place at BitMart and BitZ exchanges. TUSD: USD136 million market cap. Listed on 156 exchanges. 78% of volume takes place at the BitZ exchange. Conclusion It is identical collateral and same security but with varying market cap and concentration of volume. The Planet_X recommendation: USDC: Debt ceiling USD40 million. Liquedation ratio 120%. Stability fee 2%. PAX:  Debt ceiling USD10 million. Liquedation ratio 120%. Stability fee 2%. TUSD: Debt ceiling USD5 million. Liquedation ratio 120%. Stability fee 2%. The only difference between the collateral types is the debt ceiling which is based on the market cap. It is debatable whether it is worth adding TUSD based on the small debt ceiling, but in the interest of widening the collateral base they are included. ",
