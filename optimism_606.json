As you may know, community engagement is a critical factor in building a strong and sustainable community, and Praise has been developed to facilitate this. The Praise system allows community members to acknowledge each other\u2019s contributions and practice gratitude by \u201cpraising\u201d their peers. This approach values peer recognition, keeping the community engaged and invested while promoting a more positive and productive online environment. Praise also provides active builders with more influence and power within the organization, which is essential in building a strong and sustainable community. Furthermore, the Praise system is user-generated data, trustworthy, and ungameable. We are excited to share that we are currently working on developing new features for Praise, including a reputation token minter that could potentially be integrated for governance, AI integration to better understand the community, 1-click self-deployment, upgrade reports exports, and analytics, NFT reputation badge minter, and Praise decentralization by using Ceramic. Praise is designed to benefit the Optimism ecosystem by fostering a more positive and productive online community. The ability to recognize and reward community members for their contributions will help grow a strong and committed developers community, which is essential for the growth of the Optimism ecosystem. With Praise, we aim to create a system that will help incentivize developers to contribute to the growth and development of the Optimism ecosystem. By providing a platform for peer recognition and rewarding contributions, we hope to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation that will ultimately drive progress and growth in the Optimism ecosystem. How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: Praise has 1284 active praise givers from 12 active communities (DAO\u2019s). These users have given a total of 34554 praises since the inception of the platform. We arrived at this estimate by analyzing the usage data and metrics of the Praise platform. This includes tracking the number of active users, communities, and the total number of praises given on the platform. Our team is constantly monitoring these metrics to ensure that we are providing the best possible user experience and that our users are satisfied with the platform. In addition to the 12 active communities currently using Praise, we also have a waiting list of over 150 communities who have expressed interest in integrating our platform. However, due to budget limitations, we have not been able to move as quickly as we would like to in onboarding these new communities. This is precisely why we are applying for funding from the Optimism ecosystem. With additional resources, we can accelerate the development of new features, improve the user experience, and onboard new communities more quickly. Ultimately, this will help us to fulfill our mission of fostering a more positive and productive online community within the Optimism ecosystem. How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: Receiving a grant from the Optimism ecosystem will enable us to further our mission of fostering a more positive and productive online community within the Optimism ecosystem. Here\u2019s how we envision the grant helping us to maximize the number of users interacting with Optimism: Step 1: Develop new features - With the grant funding, we will be able to accelerate the development of new features such as the reputation token minter, AI integration, 1 click self-deployment, and NFT reputation badge minter. These features will help to further incentivize developers to participate in the Optimism ecosystem and attract new users to the platform. Step 2: Improve user experience - We will use the grant funding to improve the user experience of the Praise platform. This will include upgrades to the user interface, analytics and export reporting, and additional user support features. By making the platform more user-friendly and accessible, we can attract and retain more users. Step 3: Onboard new communities from optimism ecosystem - With the additional resources, we will be able to onboard new communities more quickly and efficiently. This will involve marketing efforts to attract new communities to the platform and provide support for onboarding and integration. By bringing more communities onto the platform, we can increase the number of users interacting with Optimism. Step 4: Foster positive community culture - By incentivizing peer recognition and gratitude, Praise helps to create a culture of collaboration and positivity within communities. This fosters a more engaged and invested user base, which in turn drives progress and innovation within the Optimism ecosystem. Overall, the grant funding will enable us to develop new features, improve the user experience, onboard new communities, and foster a more positive community culture. By doing so, we believe that we can help to maximize the number of users interacting with Optimism, ultimately driving progress and growth within the ecosystem. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Our target audience includes Web3 communities, DAO members, and Web2 organizations seeking to leverage Web3 technology for community building. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: With Praise on Optimism, we\u2019re aiming to enable easy minting of ERC-20 tokens based on Praise scores, which are converted into reputation amounts using an algorithm that takes inflation into account. The tokens are non-transferable by default and can be used for various purposes such as token gating, access to governance functionality, and Sybil resistance. The project will initially be deployed on Optimism and Mainnet, with plans to expand to other chains including Gnosis, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Binance. The reputation minter is a core feature of Praise and will have its own endpoints in the Praise API. Users will pay gas for token creation and there will be restrictions on token creation access. The project aims to enhance the functionality of Web3 communities and promote the adoption of Optimism ecosystem and Web3 technology.

If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): Aragon 1hive Gnosis Commons Stack Token Engineering Commons ENS 1 Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: One of the key areas we plan to focus on is the development of an AI ask-me-anything bot. This bot will be designed to respond to user inquiries in a fast and efficient manner, making it easy for users to get the information about the community they need. To achieve this, we plan to implement three bot commands that will make the experience seamless and enjoyable for users. These commands include: /whois, which will generate user bio information; /tell-me-about, which will ask a question about the user; and /ask, which will enable users to ask any question they may have about the Praise data. In addition to the AI demo bot, we also plan to create an ERC-20 reputation token minter as part of our grant proposal. This project will involve the development of Solidity contracts, including an ERC-20 reputation token and a token factory. We will also create Praise API endpoints to manage contract addresses, distributions, and more. To ensure that users have a seamless experience when using our products, we plan to develop a frontend that includes a token creation wizard, a reputation minting wizard, and an overview page that provides a summary of minting and distribution information. Another key aspect of our grant proposal is the backend migration and upgrade. We plan to migrate from Express to Nest.js, allowing us to host many communities on a single server. We will also ensure that our API is secured and documented, with Open API specs and Swagger. Finally, we will implement robust API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: Phase 1: OpenAI Integration (17.5k OP)  Conduct user research to identify top use cases Create automated org charts, contributor bios, and AI AMA bot Integrate backend with OpenAI API and create AI analytics engine Develop frontend with AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles Create Discord bot with AI AMA commands  Phase 2: ERC-20 Reputation Token Minter (22.5k OP)  Develop Solidity contracts for the ERC-20 reputation token and token factory Build endpoints to manage contract addresses and distributions through the Praise API Create a frontend token creation wizard and reputation minting wizard, as well as an overview page with a summary of minting and distribution data Test and refine the token creation and minting process  Phase 3: Backend Migration and Upgrade (10k OP)  Migrate the backend from Express to Nest.js to improve performance and scalability Implement the ability to host multiple communities on a single server to reduce hosting costs Secure the API with proper documentation using OpenAPI specs / Swagger Implement API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems Test and refine the backend system to ensure stability and security  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 3): Based on the proposed milestones and their estimated costs, the distribution of the OP tokens could be allocated in the following way:  Milestone 1: Open AI integration and  ask-me-anything demo bot (35% of total OP tokens) Milestone 2: ERC-20 reputation token minter (45% of total OP tokens) Milestone 3: Backend migration and upgrade (20% of total OP tokens)  Justification for allocation:   Milestone 1:  OpenAI technology integration. The plan involves conducting user research to identify the top use cases, including the creation of automated org charts, contributor bios, and an AI ask-me-anything (AMA) bot. The backend will be integrated with the OpenAI API and an AI analytics engine will be created. The frontend will include AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles. A Discord bot will also be created with AI AMA commands. Allocating 35% of the total OP tokens to this milestone will ensure that the most suitable features are identified and built.   Milestone 2: The ERC-20 reputation token minter is a key feature of the platform that will incentivize users to contribute and engage with the community. Allocating 45% of the total OP tokens to this milestone will ensure that the token contract and associated tools are developed to a high standard and organizations can reward their contributors in a frictionless manner   Milestone 3: Backend migration and upgrade are necessary to ensure the platform can scale and handle multiple communities. Allocating 20% of the total OP tokens to this milestone will ensure that the platform is secure, efficient, and able to handle increasing amounts of traffic and data.   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: Milestone 1\u2013> 6 wks Milestone 2\u2013> 4 wks Milestone 3\u2013> 4 wks Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:   Milestone 1: OpenAI Integration (35% of total OP tokens)  Conduct user research to identify top use cases Create automated org charts, contributor bios, and AI AMA bot Integrate backend with OpenAI API and create AI analytics engine Develop frontend with AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles Create Discord bot with AI AMA commands    Milestone 2: ERC-20 Reputation Token Minter (45% of total OP tokens)  Develop ERC-20 reputation token and token factory using Solidity contracts Build Praise API endpoints to manage contract addresses, distributions, etc Create frontend wizard for token creation and reputation minting Develop overview page for minting and distribution summary    Milestone 3: Backend Migration and Upgrade (20% of total OP tokens)  Migrate backend from Express to Nest.js Enable hosting of many communities on one server Ensure secured and documented API with Open API specs/Swagger Implement API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems    Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Milestone 1: OpenAI technology integration. The plan involves conducting user research to identify the top use cases, including the creation of automated org charts, contributor bios, and an AI ask-me-anything (AMA) bot. The backend will be integrated with the OpenAI API and an AI analytics engine will be created. The frontend will include AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles. A Discord bot will also be created with AI AMA commands. Milestone 3: Backend migration and upgrade are necessary to ensure the platform can scale and handle multiple communities. By accomplishing this goal we will ensure that the platform is secure, efficient, and able to handle increasing amounts of traffic and data. If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: To clarify, the OP tokens are not directly distributed to users as rewards, but rather are used to incentivize platform development and feature implementation. By allocating a significant portion of the total OP tokens to critical milestones such as the ERC-20 reputation token minter, backend migration and upgrade, and OpenAI integration, the goal is to create a more robust and engaging platform that will encourage user participation and retention even after the initial incentives have dried up. The ERC-20 reputation token minter, for example, will allow organizations to reward their contributors in a frictionless manner, incentivizing continued engagement and participation. Additionally, the backend migration and upgrade will ensure that the platform can handle increasing amounts of traffic and data, providing a more efficient and secure user experience. Furthermore, the OpenAI integration will provide users with powerful AI-supported features such as automated org charts, contributor bios, and an AI ask-me-anything (AMA) bot. These features will make the platform more engaging and valuable to users, providing a compelling reason to continue using it even after initial incentives have been exhausted. Overall, the goal of the grant is to create a sustainable platform that provides ongoing value to users, rather than relying solely on short-term incentives. By investing in critical milestones that create a better user experience and incentivize continued engagement, the hope is that the platform will continue to thrive even after the initial incentives have dried up. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): 0x0B7246eF74Ca7b37Fdc3D15be4f0b49876622F95 Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?

With the grant funding, Praise plans to develop new features, improve the user experience, onboard new Optimism communities and foster a more positive community culture. By doing so, they aim to increase engagement and productivity within the Optimism ecosystem, attract more developers and provide valuable insights into the community\u2019s activities. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Praise can be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem by incentivizing peer recognition and fostering a positive community culture. Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes, our project is Optimism Native. We are planning to build a reputation token minter on the Optimism network, which will be fully integrated with the Optimism ecosystem. This will enable us to take full advantage of the benefits of the Optimism network, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, to create a seamless and efficient user experience for our platform. By building our solution natively on Optimism, we can help to further strengthen and grow the Optimism ecosystem as a whole.

Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: Reward Systems: The Heart of DAOs - Livia Deschermayer 1  Website: https://givepraise.xyz/ 1  Twitter: https://twitter.com/givepraise 1  Discord: General Magic  Github: GitHub - givepraise/praise: Praise community contributions to build a culture of giving and gratitude.  Technical/Economic Documentation: (To be released) Other: N/A  Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Praise has 1284 active praise givers from 12 active communities (DAO\u2019s). These users have given a total of 34554 praises since the inception of the platform. We arrived at this estimate by analyzing the usage data and metrics of the Praise platform. This includes tracking the number of active users, communities, and the total number of praises given on the platform. Our team is constantly monitoring these metrics to ensure that we are providing the best possible user experience and that our users are satisfied with the platform. In addition to the 12 active communities currently using Praise, we also have a waiting list of over 150 communities who have expressed interest in integrating our platform. However, due to budget limitations, we have not been able to move as quickly as we would like to in onboarding these new communities. This is precisely why we are applying for funding from the Optimism ecosystem. With additional resources, we can accelerate the development of new features, improve the user experience, and onboard new communities more quickly. Ultimately, this will help us to fulfill our mission of fostering a more positive and productive online community within the Optimism ecosystem. Praise has been trialed and tested in communities such as; the Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, Giveth, Gnosis, Shapeshift, BrightID, Dappnode with few more organizations in the process of launching their Praise deployment. Who are your competitors?: Gitcoin - Not on optimism Coordinape - Not on optimism Layer.xyz - Not on optimism Lighthouse - Not on optimism What differentiates you from your competitors?: The Praise system is a unique tool that sets us apart from our competitors. It empowers community members to express gratitude and acknowledge each other\u2019s contributions through the act of \u201cpraising\u201d. By prioritizing peer recognition, the Praise system promotes a positive and productive online environment that keeps community members engaged and invested. Additionally, the system provides active builders with greater influence and power within the organization, ultimately helping to foster a strong and sustainable community. What truly sets the Praise system apart, however, is that it relies on user-generated data that is trustworthy and cannot be manipulated. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: ****Yes, our project is designed to be fully composable with other projects on Optimism. This means that any tokens minter, airdrops platform, as well as NFT minters can seamlessly integrate with our Praise system. We understand the importance of collaboration and interoperability within the blockchain ecosystem, and we have built our platform with this in mind. Our Praise system is flexible and can be integrated with other projects without compromising its functionality. By embracing composability, we are creating a more robust and interconnected blockchain ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.

If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: We\u2019re currently funded by General Magic but the funds are limited, we have a runway for 3 months Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50K OP How do you justify the size of the grant? One of the key areas we plan to focus on is the development of an AI ask-me-anything bot. This bot will be designed to respond to user inquiries in a fast and efficient manner, making it easy for users to get the information about the community they need. To achieve this, we plan to implement three bot commands that will make the experience seamless and enjoyable for users. These commands include: /whois, which will generate user bio information; /tell-me-about, which will ask a question about the user; and /ask, which will enable users to ask any question they may have about the Praise data. In addition to the AI demo bot, we also plan to create an ERC-20 reputation token minter as part of our grant proposal. This project will involve the development of Solidity contracts, including an ERC-20 reputation token and a token factory. We will also create Praise API endpoints to manage contract addresses, distributions, and more. To ensure that users have a seamless experience when using our products, we plan to develop a frontend that includes a token creation wizard, a reputation minting wizard, and an overview page that provides a summary of minting and distribution information. Another key aspect of our grant proposal is the backend migration and upgrade. We plan to migrate from Express to Nest.js, allowing us to host many communities on a single server. We will also ensure that our API is secured and documented, with Open API specs and Swagger. Finally, we will implement robust API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems. Roadmap Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Phase 1: OpenAI Integration (17.5k OP)  Conduct user research to identify top use cases Create automated org charts, contributor bios, and AI AMA bot Integrate backend with OpenAI API and create AI analytics engine Develop frontend with AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles Create Discord bot with AI AMA commands  Phase 2: ERC-20 Reputation Token Minter (22.5k OP)  Develop Solidity contracts for the ERC-20 reputation token and token factory Build endpoints to manage contract addresses and distributions through the Praise API Create a frontend token creation wizard and reputation minting wizard, as well as an overview page with a summary of minting and distribution data Test and refine the token creation and minting process  Phase 3: Backend Migration and Upgrade (10k OP)  Migrate the backend from Express to Nest.js to improve performance and scalability Implement the ability to host multiple communities on a single server to reduce hosting costs Secure the API with proper documentation using OpenAPI specs / Swagger Implement API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems Test and refine the backend system to ensure stability and security  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) 0x0B7246eF74Ca7b37Fdc3D15be4f0b49876622F95 Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Yes, our plan does depend on the receipt of OP tokens. As with any project, the resources available to us will determine our ability to execute our roadmap effectively. The receipt of OP tokens will allow us to access the necessary resources to build and improve our Praise system, enabling us to deliver a more robust and feature-rich product. What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: Our plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up is to use it to reward our core project contributors for their hard work and effort in building and improving the Praise system. We believe in recognizing and valuing the contributions of our team members, and the OP token provides an excellent mechanism for doing so. Specifically, we plan to allocate a portion of the unlocked OP tokens towards a reward system for our team members who have made significant contributions to the project. This could include developers, designers, community managers, and others who have played a critical role in the success of the Praise system. By incentivizing and rewarding these core contributors, we hope to foster a culture of excellence and innovation within our team, ultimately leading to a stronger and more sustainable platform. In addition, we may also explore other use cases for the OP token, such as incentivizing community participation or supporting other projects within the Optimism ecosystem. However, our primary focus will be on rewarding our team members for their hard work and dedication to the Praise system. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period.  Milestone 1: OpenAI Integration (35% of total OP tokens)  Conduct user research to identify top use cases Create automated org charts, contributor bios, and AI AMA bot Integrate backend with OpenAI API and create AI analytics engine Develop frontend with AI-supported reports and integration of AI data into user profiles Create Discord bot with AI AMA commands   Milestone 2: ERC-20 Reputation Token Minter (45% of total OP tokens)  Develop ERC-20 reputation token and token factory using Solidity contracts Build Praise API endpoints to manage contract addresses, distributions, etc Create frontend wizard for token creation and reputation minting Develop overview page for minting and distribution summary   Milestone 3: Backend Migration and Upgrade (20% of total OP tokens)  Migrate backend from Express to Nest.js Enable hosting of many communities on one server Ensure secured and documented API with Open API specs/Swagger Implement API key handling to securely give access to third-party bots and systems    Please define critical milestones for this project.
