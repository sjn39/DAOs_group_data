                    "content": " image1200\u00d71125 135 KB  It\u2019s about a year ago since I posted the Case for Clean Money and the IPCC AR6 report gave a clear indication that even mainstream, greenwashed climate science cannot hide the fact that humans are a few years away from irreversibly breaching the tipping points that will bring the earths climate into a new and much hotter equilibrium. Since then maker has accomplished absolutely nothing, and the world as a whole has not only accomplished nothing, but rather accelerated the crash with things like coal burning and renewed fossil fuel investments due to the Ukraine war putting the nail in the coffin on any kind of long term thinking. \u2018Dirty ol\u2019 coal is making a comeback. While in theory it is still physically possible to prevent breaching the climate tipping points that will cause irreversible, locked in collapse, what actually matters is whether it is pragmatically possible to do so given the \u201cclimate change meta\u201d of global human society. \u201cThe meta of something\u201d is a broad concept describing all second order, contextual effects related to human interactions around a particular subject, such as the game theory and political, social and socio-economic conditions that impact the subject. What matters isn\u2019t whether it is still physically possible for humans to stop collapse-inducing economic activity, the question is if they want to Unfortunately the climate change meta has always been locked in the same spiral of doom - the costs of dealing with the future problem is too high, and even acknowledging the costs (let alone the consequences of doing nothing) would cause immediate financial damage due to forecasting, so the best option is to ignore and downplay it. The problem is of course that every year no action is taken, the physical requirements, and thus the cost, of trying to prevent collapse just becomes even higher, making it even more unlikely and out of reach that the meta of climate change would ever change to the point where ignoring and downplaying isn\u2019t the best available short term option. That brings us to today, a year after the IPCC AR6 report, and the \u201chead in the sand\u201d meta is stronger than ever. Instead of casting doubt and dismissing the possibility of global collapse, it has transcended to  Westworld style \u201cthat doesn\u2019t look like anything to me\u201d Catastrophic climate change outcomes like human extinction \u2018not being taken seriously\u2019 - BBC News Honestly, the above video is one of the most amazingly meta things I have seen in a long time, and unfortunately it is exactly because of what\u2019s being displayed in the video - the broken, suicidal meta we are locked in and cannot break free from, that many of us are already doomed to a horrible fate. Those of us who aren\u2019t lucky enough to live in the few resilient places on earth, and aren\u2019t rich enough to get there in time, could very well expect unavoidable economic ruin and starvation, and early death from the collapse of society. While collapse cannot be averted, it is still a possibility that total collapse can be prevented and we can hang on by a thread in what I call partial collapse. This basically translates to the lucky and the rich choosing which of the unlucky and poor are going to die. And as much as that sucks, that\u2019s the best case outcome we have to look forward, with the other alternative being extinction or near extinction with cultural reset. In the context of such a catastrophe, unlike anything we have ever seen - even global nuclear war - we need to think about what Maker can do to deal with this. First and foremost how to survive as a system, but also how to help some of the billions of unlucky humans survive - what we do with Maker specifically is much more impactful than anything we could do individually, because nothing is more relevant to the crisis we\u2019re facing than the financial power of currency, and the ability for DAOs and blockchain to create more collaborative metas. If we are unable to grasp this responsibility we will never be able to govern Maker properly and we will be doomed to the same tragedy of the commons that has befallen all of humanity, and rightfully deserve it.

However, as they point out themselves, all of the combined positive trends and technological adoption and advances still puts us on track to 3 degrees heating (and that\u2019s the IPCC mainstream greenwashed data that excludes some of the most inconvenient feedback loops). I also think they are not including the latest physical science data about just how bad 3 degrees is, or consider it in light of all the other systemic pressures - I have a hard time imagining it would be possible to find any expert that would consider 3 degrees survivable in the global south when combined with all other systemic pressures. That would result in billions of migrants to the west, which may not result in total collapse of civilization but I think it counts as partial collapse, and it is a fate that is effectively locked in and unavoidable. I would guess that Kurzgesagt don\u2019t actually believe that a miracle can happen and we can just work hard to redirect our pathway from 3 degrees to 2 degrees - they just think that using such a message is most likely to get people to act, because even redirecting from 3 degrees to 2.9 makes a huge difference. The worse things get, the higher the marginal impact of each ton of CO2e is, so the response to things getting worse and looking bleaker shouldn\u2019t be to give up and just let it happen (which would result in literal extinction of humanity), it should be to react more fiercely and decisively to try to save what\u2019s left of the future. IMO I think the time for hopium is over and it is time for collapse acceptance and the necessary grief, so that it becomes possible to let go and adapt. It is no longer enough to try to get people to act to become more sustainable and prevent worse future outcomes, it is also necessary for people to seriously consider what a partial collapse future means to them, so that they can start preparing today and save themselves and their families.
