How fast transactions are accepted by the blockchain\u2019s network  How much bandwidth it uses, How much blockchain data needs to be stored and in what way the data must be stored. Important metrices:  numbers of blocks are added to the blockchain, block and transaction sizes, transaction rates    Also, '- How does blockchain respond to increasing number of nodes  How does blockchain respond to increased number of transactions for one specific node. Thanks  ",

They achieve Finality after 2 epochs   Recommended hardware requirements to run a Full node is 25 MBit/s bandwidth. This will be lower after the implementation of EIP-4844 (blob transactions)   Ethereum stores and manages data using a trie. There three types of the trie in the Ethereum Blockchain:  State Trie Storage Trie And Transaction Trie    Important metrices: https://beaconcha.in/  After The Merge a block or \u201cslots\u201d is added every ~12s Each slot can store up to 256 bits (32 bytes ). 21000 is the minimum amount of gas an operation on Ethereum will use.    The most \u201ctangible\u201d answer is that Gas prices will rise due to supply and demand law.  https://etherscan.io/gastracker   ",
