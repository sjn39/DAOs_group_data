                    "content": "Objective The objective of this post is to clarify the content of the executive spell of 2022-10-26. Fee structure on Starknet Since version 0.8.0, Starknet has implemented a fee mechanism. Without a minimal fee, Starknet risked facing infinite transactions which would make it impossible for the system to be performant, regardless of sequencer optimizations. Fees are charged by the sequencer for:   Any L2 transactions   L1 \u2192 L2 messages. An L1 \u2192 L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction\u2019s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block.   To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 \u2192 L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the StarkNet Core contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. Throughout the lifecycle of the message, the associated fee is locked in the Core contract. If the message was not processed for any reason, then cancelling the message will also return the fee to the sender. Updates to the bridge included in the spell In order to enable the fee mechanism on the Starknet DAI bridge, we had to update the functions of our bridge that induce a L1->L2 message to accept fees via payable modifier, namely the following functions on L1DAIBridge: L1DaiBridge.deposit and L1DaiBridge.forceWithdrawal.
