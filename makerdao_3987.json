                    "content": "Greetings from the Content Production Core Unit! Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to over the past couple of weeks:  Administrative Updates  Interviewing candidates for our writing position   Accounting Update I\u2019m happy to share that the Content team has managed to make it through its first three months of operation moderately under budget and well on track to continue scaling and manage any unforeseen expenses. We\u2019ve managed to retain the entirety of our 20k contingency fund and along with the continuity funds coming with August\u2019s budget distribution, we\u2019re well-equipped to manage any further administrative, legal, tax, and software-related expenses for the year. Our payroll turned out slightly different from what was originally projected. We originally planned for five full-time contributors and one part-timer; our part-timer got busy with their full-time gig and the design CU that was being discussed in CommDev never got proposed so we made space for the design role that @kat\u2019s taken on. The final full-time role we\u2019re looking to fill is for a writer. We made an offer to a candidate several weeks ago who had to drop out for personal reasons and are continuing the search. Now that we\u2019ve successfully passed two quarterly budget proposals, we plan to make our next proposal for a longer period of time (considering four to six months). The three-month cadence means submitting a MIP at the end of month one, which makes planning difficult. In the future, we recommend new CUs propose at least a four-month budget.
