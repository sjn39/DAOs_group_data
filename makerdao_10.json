Huge thank you to everyone involved, but especially to @Gala for handling the launch and signing up for ongoing management.  @LongForWisdom, @prose11 have been spending time planning for the next year of work at GovAlpha. At this stage, primarily identifying priorities and reaching out to other Core Units to organize collaboration and shared work. This week we spoke to @0xdeniz from DUX.   Quarterly Focuses As we enter Q1 2022, we have two new quarterly focuses - Participation and Exploration. Not too much to report for these yet, but we have some plans which we\u2019ll start talking about and actioning over the coming weeks.  Other Stuff   @hernandoagf and @TheExistence have been speaking to @s_ben about the sourcecred payout process and how we can bring all the maintenance work in-house (so to speak.)  @Blimpa has been working on a guide for using the MIPs Portal effectively.  @Prose11 got stuck with a lot of document reviews and meetings.  @mkrorbrkr is know known as @Patrick_J.  @LongForWisdom and @Patrick_J working on some new docs for the manual for Flash Mint and D3M Modules.  @Gala launching the Maker Operational Manual, and organizing domain redirection, updating templates with new links, etc.  @LongForWisdom working on the GovAlpha quarterly review and on the Intangible Asset Assignment MIP.  @Sebix working on MIP55 amendments and translating some content for the Operational Manual.

Delegation showing up strong this week, with 2 Executives passed and over 55k MKR delegated to our Recognized Delegates   We won\u2019t interrupt his R&R w/ a tag, but LongForWisdom is on vacation this week, so please direct any Governance questions and concerns to me (at least until Monday  )   Votes  There was a minor delay in getting this week\u2019s executive posted but it was still able to pass within a few days. Mandated Actors discussed not having an Executive proposal for this week again, a more detailed post will be put up after today\u2019s Governance and Risk Call.   Calls   @Gala has been producing call summaries for many Governance related videos, like the Meet Your Delegate series, take a look at the forum threads to see the great work!  @prose11 hosted the latest Meet Your Delegate Call - #4 featuring @MakerMan. Those wishing to delegate to any of the people featured on these calls can do so from the Delegates Tab of the Voting Portal.   SourceCred  Governance Boost has been further delayed  we\u2019re giving our model of incentivizing Signal Requests and MIPs one more go, but will be exploring other options for further incentivizing Governance posts in the forum if we\u2019re unable to find a satisfactory algorithm tweak. On the brighter side, work on the Onchain Technical Design is moving along on schedule, following a meeting to review some code with @NikKunkel and the SourceCred (Kevin and @s_ben <3)   MIPS   @blimpa has been hard at work, updating repos, fixing typos and formatting to keep our MIPs looking clean. Additionly, Pablo has met with DSpot for the latest push to the MIPs Repo fixing some minor bugs and improving menu selection.   Continuing Maker Operational Manual (MOM) Work  Not much to update from last week, but worth noting the PRs and contined drafting/editing/and PM work dont by @Gala , @Patrick_J , and @AstronautThis !

Next steps are to sort out participation and communication tracking for Recognised Delegates, and continue to push for integrations of the delegate contracts with custody providers such that larger MKR Holders can vote securely. Our combined Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 Budget is now up on the forum, covers the next 6 months. In general we\u2019re moving towards longer budgets, aiming for 12 months, with the goal that Governance only needs to deal with this once a year.  @Gala is helping us organise and make concrete progress on launching the Maker Operational Manual, a set of documentation written for the individuals, groups and delegates that make up Maker Governance. Pablo is now a full MIP Editor! Congratulations @blimpa!   External Governance Stuff Delegation Proceeding well, see highlights above. MIPs Portal Work continues on bug-fixing and additional features. Snapshot Proceeding nicely. @LongForWisdom looked over the admin and settings stuff since last week and looked over the functionality. Looks very useful. Particularly it implements approval voting, which is really useful. Tags and Forum Continued work on this from Sebix. Maker Operational Manual See above, but this is now proceeding much more effectively thanks to Gala. Also using these tasks as stuff to onboard @Gala, @AstronautThis and @Patrick_J. SourceCred Remains stalled. Nothing too much to report here. Video Production In the process of putting together frameworks for educational videos to help people understand the Maker Governance framework and some of the key parts of the DAO. These will be handed off to @Content-Production for production once done.  Random other stuff Handing off some responsibilities to GovComms Things like \u2018forum at a glance\u2019 are being handed over where possible. Also giving them more responsibility on communicating the mandated actors discussions and work items going forward. Working on DAI Supply @LongForWisdom spending some time figuring out possibilities for DAI minting and trying to understand the costs they impose on MakerDAO. GovAlpha Trying to figure out how to make GovAlpha more effective with communication between facilitators and effectively dealing with contributors that come from timezones across the planet.

This brings the number of Recognized Delegates to 8. This is definitely an improvement but I\u2019m hopeful that we can push the total into double digits over the next few months.  @Patrick_J has really stepped up the last few weeks to take charge of managing GovAlpha\u2019s responsibilities in relation to delegates. He\u2019s been keeping track of metrics, and is going to be taking the lead on the first set of delegate compensation for November.  @LongForWisdom spent some time with @tiago of DUX Core Unit discussing and brainstorming ideas for the delegates UI on vote.makerdao.com. The current UI is already fantastic, and it\u2019s largely thanks to Tiago\u2019s efforts on the UI/UX. Thanks for putting up with me, guys!   Robustness  Over the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve been focusing more heavily on sharing knowledge around the executive process, further reducing bus-risk for the CU.  @blimpa has spent some time helping identify and squash bugs in the MIPs portal alongside his usual responsibilities helping MIP authors tidy up their proposals.  @Patrick_J been ensuring that there are no errors or issues with delegate tracking and compensation.  @TheExistence has been learning how to handle the Maker SourceCred payouts.   Other Stuff   @LongForWisdom continues to work on getting the Maker Operational Manual ready for publication. Planning fallacy has been hitting me hard on this one. I\u2019m still moderately confident I can get it up in November, though may slip til early December. @AstronautThis and @Patrick_J have been helping too.  @prose11 spent some time working with the incubating talent core unit to share some of GovAlpha\u2019s personnel requirements.  @Sebix has been working on a website documenting what GovAlpha does in practice. We\u2019ve written about this before in a few places, but we\u2019re hoping to get it all compiled so that we can use it for transparency and onboarding.  @ceresbzns and @TheExistence are continuing to research governance in other DAOs and crypto-protocols.

Huge props to @LongForWisdom for managing the delegation process and all the documentation work. Budget drafting has begun with the intent to file a 6-month budget by the August 11th cut-off for the September Governance Cycle. Last weekend a replacement executive spell was put up through collaboration with GovAlpha and Protocol Engineering. You can read the Governance Report detailing what happened and lessons learned for similar situations in the future.   External Governance Stuff MIPs Portal @blimpa has been working closely with DSpot to upgrade the MIPs Portal. Keep an eye out for the latest version launching today, featuring subproposal groupings and new menu options.  Delegation In addition to the documentation work, @LongForWisdom has been crushing, the first Meet Your Delegate call has been scheduled for July 28th @ 18:00 UTC. Come participate and see what @flipflopflapdelegate, @PaperImperium, and @twblack88 have to offer as delegates. VC Communications A separate task has been added to the GovAlpha weekly assignments list for communication on voting events with VCs. While this has been done by @LongForWisdom solely in the past, the split effort among facilitators has brought increased participation to this month\u2019s Ratification Polls. SourceCred @prose11 continues his efforts to bring a Governance Boost to the SourceCred algorithm. A revised batch of parameters has been sent over to the SourceCred team for data verification. Additionally, GovAlpha is coordinating a meeting to touch base on future payment administration and the Onchain Technical Design detailed last week.  Internal Governance Stuff  Onboarding tasks continue for @Sebix, @AstronautThis, and @Patrick_J. @Gala has started doing some initial Forum and MIPs tasks. It\u2019s budget time again. @LongForWisdom and @prose11 have started their list, will be checking it twice, and consulting with the rest of the Core Unit before publishing the subproposal.

We had several examples of contributor growth this week with @blimpa drafting today\u2019s executive and @Gala handling the admin work for our internal February compensation distribution.   Quarterly Focuses  Participation   @TheExistence and @LongForWisdom continue work on off-chain incentives.  @prose11 and @LongForWisdom met with @0xdeniz and @Andrew_Hall to sort out on-chain incentives.  @Patrick_J working sorted out Recognized Delegate Compensation and finished out the final steps for our new Recognized Delegates, after @LongForWisdom hosted the most recent Meet Your Delegate call on Wednesday.   Exploration   @prose11 is drafting a post-mortem on the Content Production Offboarding (and what recommendations GovAlpha can make for community governance to improve the issues uncovered). Stay tuned for that early next week.  @hernandoagf has been developing tools to make our ownership of SourceCred payouts much smoother.  @TheExistence is preparing his first of a twice-monthly post on SourceCred happenings (inspired by the previous updates from @s_ben).   Other Stuff   @AstronautThis continuing to investigate how to determine a good value for the ESM Threshold. GovAlpha Leadership discussed and amended our MKR Compensation Proposal.  @blimpa showed us he can still crush Meet Your Delegate graphics.  @Gala presented on the G&R Call for the first time!

                    "content": "    swakya:  Would love to know more about that!   Sure. So to be honest I was maybe less precise than I should have been here (which comes from writing this like 20mins before the G&R call.) I\u2019ll explain what\u2019s been done. I\u2019ve also updated the initial post. Executive Process So the main change here is that the frontend now takes it\u2019s content directly from github. Previously, Maker Foundation members had to \u2018whitelist\u2019 any executive that went up on the voting portal. Now it reads from github. What this means is that the Governance Facilitators can control what shows up on the portal directly, now, rather than relying on people working for the Maker Foundation to rubber stamp each executive. Polls Process So this is where that precision issue comes in, because while the polls process has been improved, it\u2019s not really any more decentralized at this point. The improvements here are related to how the Governance Facilitators submit polls on-chain. Previously there was an input form to fill in on the voting portal where you would enter poll options, start and end time, etc. Now we have a system where all that is read + validated directly from github when we provide a URL. This seems fairly unexciting, but it\u2019s going to make submitting polls like 5x faster, and that\u2019s a weekly task that I normally need to do on Sunday night. So needless to say, I\u2019m excited about it.  On another note, Payton has been whitelisted to put up polls on the frontend now as well. So one could argue that that has made the process slightly more decentralized.  Also of note is that these improvements are thanks to the dUX (incubating) core unit - I\u2019m only really reporting it here because it\u2019s related to governance and they don\u2019t have a weekly update slot in the meeting at this point.

Highlights  We discovered a MIP63c4 subproposal that we had inadvertently marked as archived and it consequently did not go on-chain last month when eligible. It will now go on-chain next week. Read the post-mortem here. We launched our new Prioritization polls - announced here. These can be found on the voting portal here and here. After launch, we were notified that voters selecting multiple options in the IRV poll had their selections reversed. This was caused by a bug that was introduced in a recent update to the voting portal and has now been fixed. Read the post-mortem from DUX here. We distributed May\u2019s sourcecred on Friday - this was the last distribution using the \u201cold\u201d system. Moving forward we will use the new sourcecred implementation described here.   Other Work   @prose11 hosted a Meet Your Delegate Call with Chris Blec, check it out on Youtube here.  @Patrick_J hosted a Meet Your Delegate Call with mhonkasala & teemulau and ChicagoDAO delegates, check it out on Youtube here.  @Gala and @blimpa teamed up with @adcv from Strategic Finance to host a Know Your MIP about the recent budget MIP changes, Youtube upload is pending.  @Gala has been fine-tuning the Maker Operational Manual, and assisting with the team invoices for May  @hernandoagf has made some improvements to the sourcecred bot and is starting to look at ways to (at least partially) automate the delegate tracking process as we welcome more and more delegates to MakerDAO.  @TheExistence has been assisting with setting up the new sourcecred and off-chain incentive workstreams.  @LongForWisdom is taking a well-earned break, we look forward to welcoming him back in due course.

Going to be figuring out exactly how much, and how we send this back to the protocol, hopefully over the next few days.  @prose11 and I owe you a Quarterly Report, but they\u2019re long and we\u2019ve been busy. We\u2019ll try to get it out before the end of October. Going to be posting these updates on Friday going forwards as part of pushing towards standardizing CU communications.   Quarterly Focuses  New quarter brings new focuses. For Q4 it is delegation and robustness.  Delegation - LFW currently working on delegate compensation. Signal is in progress, aiming to have delegates compensated starting November.  Delegation - Still waiting on custody providers to integrate with delegation contracts to allow larger MKR Holders to delegate. Anchorage is making good process.  Robustness - @blimpa is working on hardening the MIPs process to prevent last minute issues with MIPs going into formal submission.  Robustness - @LongForWisdom made post about standardizing the format of CU Budget Implementations so that it is more clear for governance and GovAlpha.   Other Initiatives   Discord Migration is on track. Should be opening up access to the server on Monday 18th October.  @Patrick_J working on implementing some common voting algorithms as part of a spreadsheet. This will help us compare and contrast various options with respect to prioritization.  Maker Operational Manual work continues. Aiming to get something like this month.  @TheExistence working on auditing governance processes being used in other protocols, and looking to see if there is anything we can learn.  @LongForWisdom working on governance processes with respect to Rune\u2019s recent forum post.  @blimpa working on video scripts for educational governance videos.

Next week we have @twblack88 and @Planet_X (same time.)  @Sebix has started to take a look at the tags on the Maker forum, with the goal of figuring out how to make them more useful, better organized and less sprawling.   External Governance Stuff Delegation Proceeding well, see highlights above. MIPs Portal Work continues on bug-fixing and additional features. Nothing super new to call out here, just lots of fantastic incremental progress. Forum Tags @Sebix working on figuring out an improved framework for tags. We\u2019ve set some general goals, and he\u2019s going to be suggesting changes to meet those goals. Snapshot In the process of setting up snapshot for Maker, with the assistance of DUX and @tmierzwa. ENS domain secured for testing. SourceCred Still making slow progress on Governance Boost - don\u2019t want to break anything while attempting to improve it. Discussed on-chain technical design again this week. SourceCred have been going through some growing pains, but still confident they can deliver this.  Internal Governance Stuff  Onboarding tasks continue for @Sebix, @AstronautThis, and @Patrick_J. @Gala has started doing some initial Forum and MIPs tasks. Budget drafting is in progress with the intent to publish a 6-month budget by the August 11th cut-off for the September Governance Cycle.

Thanks to @Sebix for helping with this. Still working on getting custody platform integration moving so we can expand the MKR available to delegate. Putting pressure on platforms via speaking to VC\u2019s, DUX offering integration help, the delegates themselves on twitter and potentially now the @Growth-Core-Unit.   Maker Operational Manual  Making concrete progress on the Maker Operational Manual under @gala\u2019s management.  @Patrick_J and @AstronautThis producing parameter documentation for the RWA vault parameters and finally covering the Flap and Flop parameters. @LongForWisdom reviewing.  @prose11 documenting the governance vote hash-checking process. Someone on PE (I think @Derek?) working on updating the executive audit documentation to cover the DssExecLib stuff.   Onboarding   @Sebix now spending the majority of his working-time with us and looking to take on more projects in the coming weeks. Looking to expand into MIPs and forum organisation stuff.  @Gala working well on the Maker Operational Manual, may try to expand responsibilities here as her availability allows.  @AstronautThis and @Patrick_J spending additional time on documentation. Moving around our weekly meeting to accommodate more time zones so these guys can sync more effectively with the team. A couple of leads on additional recruits, too early to say anything either way.    Other Governance stuff MIPs Portal Work continues on bug-fixing and additional features. Progress is steady. Snapshot Proceeding nicely, currently DUX planning to work on creating voting strategies (required to have snapshot pick up votes from MKR in the Chief, being delegated, in VoteProxy\u2019s etc. Video Production Process continues, we now have a set deadline from Content Production, so sketching out what goes in these videos over the next month.  Other Non-Governance Stuff MKR Compensation @prose11 working on this over the next few weeks.

Tags and the Forum  Not too much to update on, but wanted to shout out @Sebix for continuing the Tags grind. Classifying tags to create parent/child groups and eliminate seldom-used options is no short work. We have asked Tech-Ops about implementing a new Forum plug-in based on @Sebix\u2019s research and suggestions.   MIP World   @blimpa continues the excellent work coordinating with DSpot on the MIPs Portal and he realllllly wants you to utilize the feedback feature (bottom right of the site) Additionally, another round of formal submissions is upon us! If you have recently written a MIP keep an eye on your DMs as @blimpa will be contacting you to confirm the submission status.   Video Content Collaboration   @GovAlpha-Core-Unit is collaborating with @Content-Production to get some videos about Governance processes, concepts, and Core MIPs produced for the YouTube Chanel.  @blimpa and @Gala have been taking the lead on script outlines so far.   DssVest Communication and Documentation  A lot of time and effort has been put into coordination efforts for launching DssVest on tomorrow\u2019s executive. Upsides and Downsides were discussed amount the Mandated actors for various implementations of MKR vesting for Core Units that have had plans approved.  @prose11 met with @brianmcmichael for a walkthrough of the code. Prose will be writing documentation for the community as well as the current and future Core Units that might wish to utilize DssVest for DAI or MKR distributions.   Snapshot/Staffing Update   @Elihu will be taking some time off this month and has passed the Snapshot Project over to @prose11.

Going through the process for this has already highlighted a number of weaknesses and issues which we\u2019re looking forward to fixing. See a breakdown and some links here. @Patrick_J did a great job here getting this sorted. We have a ninth soon-to-be recognized delegate joining us. Welcome to @ACREinvest, you can find their delegate profile here. Having more people consider this role is extremely encouraging and speaks well for the future and quality of delegates at Maker. We spent a little time speaking about where we\u2019re at with respect to delegation in the recent governance and risk call.   Robustness   @blimpa been continuing to help get bugs fixed on the MIPs Portal, along with his usual activities spent helping authors make their MIPs as clear and effective as possible.   Other Stuff   @ceresbzns and @TheExistence have shared some of the results of their research work on governance in other DAO\u2019s internally. There is still a good bit of polish work before this becomes fit for public consumption, but it looks quite positive so far. Work on the Maker Operational Manual proceeds, we\u2019ve now got domain\u2019s and such setup so we\u2019re more or less ready to officially launch once we\u2019ve done a final pass over the content. I was hoping to get to the official launch today, but got side-tracked. If anyone wants a preview in its current state, you can find it here.  @LongForWisdom is away for the next few weeks, I\u2019ll be back in January! @prose11 will be around, but I\u2019ll be checking in periodically to cover anything very urgent.

Wanted to thank @LongForWisdom for staying diligent and his patience with me. They\u2019ll be a bit more at the bottom of this post, but wanted to apologize to the community for the recent lack of communication.  Highlights   @LongForWisdom is rounding up the work on the Maker Operational Manual. Keep an eye out for our soft launch forum post  !  Special thanks to @Gala for getting this project off the ground.  @blimpa is putting together a MIP Editor Handbook that focuses on Onboarding. This will greatly aide in getting more MIP editors onboarded to GovAlpha. We\u2019ve been onboarding @ceresbzns as a GovAlpha contributor. Ceres comes from 1Hive, bringing a wealth of DAO experience and some technical knowledge in SourceCred instances. Say hello next time you see them     Quarterly Focuses  Delegation  Big news this week! Custody platforms have finally added compatibility for MKR Delegation. We expect to see some serious MKR being delegated over the next couple weeks. Delegate Compensation Trail update below, still on track for our first distribution at the end of the month.   Robustness  The Maker Operational Manual coming online is a big step in our goals for more robustness. We\u2019re preparing to onboard more MIP Editors which will offer greater decentralization and redundancy. You might have noticed a new #SourceCred channel in Discord, we have always had a chat with SourceCred, but decided our coordinations could be beneficial to the community and opened up Read access (and emoji reactions  ) to the channel. Currently running a preliminary poll on about instance there.   Internal Developments  This week @Patrick_J took a stab at the Executive Copy and did a great job. Having more members able to accurately draft Executive Copy is a great development for the CU. We look forward to seeing his name on future commits. Thanks to a great call/report from @gov-comms-core-unit , @blimpa has been tidying up the MIPs repo.  We have a few action items to unify our communications with the DAO that we will be focusing on this coming week.  @Sebix\u2019s PC died  but we were still able to get some effective work and coordination done. Stay tuned as @Sebix and @prose11 collaborate on a GovAlpha webpage!   Weekly Assignments  Executive Process - @LongForWisdom  Polls Process - @prose11 , @Sebix , @Patrick_J  Governance and Risk Meeting Chair - @prose11  GovAlpha Weekly Update - @prose11  Delegate Metric Tracking - @TheExistence, @prose11  MIPs Update - @blimpa  Collateral Status Sheet - @Sebix    External Stuff  With the recent poll raising the compensation during the Recognized Delegate Compensation Trail passing, GovAlpha is collaborating with @data-insights-cu to record average MKR voting weight. Distributions will be made to Recognized Delegates at the end of the month.  @prose11 met with @Aes to talk about formalizing budget returns. Once this week\u2019s executive is executed our excess budget will be fully returned to the protocol.   Thanks for checking out our weekly update! I\u2019ll be more diligent in ensuring these keep getting posted every week. As mentioned at the top of the post I\u2019ve been struggling personally and organizationally. But this week has been good on both fronts, with me creating a new personal task tracker to ensure obligations like this post don\u2019t fall by the waist side. On the personal side, I\u2019ve been dealing with mental health struggles exacerbated by some familial circumstances.  Wanted to drop a link to some Mental Health Resources for both people facing mental health problems of their own and those around them. I was quite fortunate in that my new insurance made seeking therapy fairly easy. This won\u2019t be the case for everyone, but wanted to plug the importance of reaching out to someone when you\u2019re struggling. I added this to our update because I don\u2019t think mental health is talked about enough in this space and I hope me being willing to talk about my struggle publicly might open others up to seek the help they need. We have a wonderful community here at Maker and our strong network of personal connections means no one should have to suffer in silence. ",

As mentioned at the top of the post I\u2019ve been struggling personally and organizationally. But this week has been good on both fronts, with me creating a new personal task tracker to ensure obligations like this post don\u2019t fall by the waist side. On the personal side, I\u2019ve been dealing with mental health struggles exacerbated by some familial circumstances. Wanted to drop a link to some Mental Health Resources for both people facing mental health problems of their own and those around them. I was quite fortunate in that my new insurance made seeking therapy fairly easy. This won\u2019t be the case for everyone, but wanted to plug the importance of reaching out to someone when you\u2019re struggling. I added this to our update because I don\u2019t think mental health is talked about enough in this space and I hope me being willing to talk about my struggle publicly might open others up to seek the help they need. We have a wonderful community here at Maker and our strong network of personal connections means no one should have to suffer in silence.   Really glad you mention this.   I have been side swipped by my wife with physical issues.   Already in and out of the hospital twice in past 2 weeks not to mention doctor visits, blood tests etc\u2026  So it isn\u2019t just mental health but personal and familial physical.   I basically have to do everything including taking care of my wife while we try to kick the healthcare system into actually working to figure out what right now is putting my wife in bed most of the day without energy to do anything (she is out of breath easily, and ends up with muscles that basically act like they have been worked out - that sore pain you get when lactic acid builds up).   Tests show seriously low iron, and D3 yet we have been waiting now two weeks to get her in for iron infusions\u2026   This hospital can\u2019t do this because of order Y, and insurance and the infusion center taking their own sweet time - reviewing her case.   All the while taking care of a 2 and 6 yr old, full time job, and Maker on top and my wife slowly being taken down by what we think is some form of anemia (blood cell counts already below normal range and still falling - but not bad enough for a blood transfusion - yet). On the bright side I think most of my growth thesis is almost ready to post and even though I have a few components they appear to number around 5.   I am just trying to clean them up before posting.

Also of Note  Core Unit Onboarding   @LongForWisdom getting our new CU\u2019s set up and running on the forum, rocketchat, getting them added to necessary meetings and documents.  @LongForWisdom actually wrote down the process this time, so in the future he can make @prose11 do it (it\u2019s not laziness, it\u2019s redundancy!)   Tags   @Sebix continuing his work on clearing and consolidating tags on this forum with the goal of making navigation and browsing easier.   Education   @blimpa continuing to work on scripts for a number of educational videos to be created by @Content-Production.  @Gala continuing her work organizing the Maker Operational Manual project - this week mostly setting up the gitbook structure for the docs and making some final decisions on content.   Process Improvements   @Patrick_J finalizing optimizations for the Delegates Tracking sheet, aiming to swap in the new sheet next week.  @blimpa and @LongForWisdom working on tightening up the MIP quality assurance process. More soon!

We have new Core Unit contributors and  @prose11 (it me) is taking on more facilitator duties previously owned by @LongForWisdom. New version of the MIPs Portal is live, check it out! Thanks to DSpot and @blimpa for all work that made this update possible. Our Quarterly Review for our first 3 months as the GovAlpha Core Unit has been published, take a look to see all our successes and failures and why we only spent a fraction of our Quarterly Budget.   External Governance Stuff Delegation  Meeting organized with potential delegate group again next week. Working on getting delegate statements to go on the forum so MKR holders can more easily decide where they\u2019d like to delegate their votes.  Voting Front End  New process for Executive Votes and Polls in in place, with @prose11 able to add polls to the front end from his permissioned address. Thanks to dUX for all the work, designs are underway for voting delegation on the front end too.  Forum  You might have noticed the new forum banner with some helpful tips and reminders. Working on framework to make tags more efficient/helpful to readers.  MIPs Quality + Process  Created new system for assigning new MIPs to the MIPs Editors and a checklist to help authors throughout the submission period.  @blimpa has fixed a number of images within the MIPs to display properly on the portal.   Internal Governance Stuff   @prose11 has completed his almost cross country move. Now in UTC -6, so you might see some shift in times around the forum/chat. Payments went out from the GovAlpha Multi-Sig. Work continues on developing a Snapshot integration to allow for weighted polls.

Other Stuff   @LongForWisdom working on executives, working on GovAlpha Quarterly Review for 2021-Q4 (very nearly done.) Also spent some time running through the onboarding checklists for our new Core Units.  @blimpa has been continuing to work with @Sebix and @Gala to onboard them to work with MIPs.  @Patrick_J helped with executives (plural) and has been working on the delegate compensation MIP. Also helping to hand-over the Collateral Status Sheet to CES.  @AstronautThis has been working on D3M documentation for the Maker Operational Manual.  @Gala working on setting and tracking post-launch goals for the Maker Operational Manual.  @prose11 helping to onboard @Gala to GovAlpha\u2019s budget and accounting setup.  @prose11 taking a week off (the above notwithstanding.)

Quarterly Focuses As we enter Q1 2022, we have two new quarterly focuses - Participation and Exploration.  Participation Continuing from Q4 2021, we retain a focus on improving Governance participation. Internally, there are ongoing discussions about how to improve this, and we continue to seek new Recognized Delegates to join MakerDAO.   @mkrorbrkr posted the latest editions of the Delegate Round-up and the Delegate Compensation Breakdown for December 2021    Exploration   @ceresbzns and @TheExistence continue their research project into DAO Governance; @prose11 has been reviewing some of the work done thus far. Hopefully, we will be in a position to share this work with the DAO soon.   Other Stuff   @Gala is coordinating the finishing touches to the Maker Operational Manual - expect a post with further information in the coming days and working on the Governance Polls for the first time! The Facilitators have started onboarding Gala in GovAlpha budget organization.  @prose11 has been focusing on contributor onboarding and outreach and working with the Content Production CU on some documentation.  @hernandoagf has been working on the Sourcecred bot.  @LongForWisdom is back from a well-earned holiday and is writing a Q4 2021 GovAlpha review, working on D3M documentation and internal CU organization.  @mkrorbrkr wrote the CU Weekly Update for the first time this week. There are a lot of Governance Polls scheduled for next week, so there has been an all-hands-on-deck team effort to get everything ready for this.

I\u2019d like to extend a warm welcome to JustinCase particularly as the first example of someone new to the MakerDAO community putting themselves forward as a Recognized Delegate. We are also coming up on our first distribution of Recognized Delegate compensation. @Patrick_J will be taking the lead on coordinating this. We believe we\u2019ve already identified some pain-points with the current structure of the trial compensation and will be following up on those most likely in the new year.   Robustness   @blimpa has been continuing to work on an onboarding manual for potential MIP Editors.  @prose11 has been handling contributor onboarding and 1-on-1\u2019s this week. We are continuing to share knowledge within the Core Unit, most recently in the form of writing the executive-copy. @blimpa and @Patrick_J have both taken turns on that in the past few weeks.   Other Stuff  The Maker Operational Manual work is still on-going. New target it to get it launched on manual.makerdao.com by the end of November. We were able to integrate the awesome budget flow diagrams created by @liberuum from SES, big thanks to them for putting that together.  @ceresbzns and @TheExistence have continued to work on a \u2018governance-in-other-DAOs\u2019 research report.  @Patrick_J has been taking a more active role in managing signals and delegation in the forum the past week.  @LongForWisdom posted the \u2018governance over the holiday\u2019 post for 2021/2022.  @prose11 has been working on drafting GovAlpha\u2019s MKR Compensation budget.

We\u2019ll we sending DAI back to the DAO either today or early next week. @Prose11 has put together a post commenting on the issue which will be up on the same timescale. Quarterly Review post for Q3 - first draft is done. Hoping to review it early next week and get it posted for everyone.   Quarterly Focuses (delegation and robustness)   Delegation - Initial delegate compensation poll has passed which means that we can start rewarding delegates tangibly for spending time governing the Maker Protocol.  Delegation - Anchorage is extremely close to offering Maker Delegation functionality to their customers.  Delegation - Looking forward to @ultraschuppi coming onboard as a recognised delegate.  Robustness - Working on figuring out discord permissions and roles to be less of a pain for core unit folks when they try to manage private channels.  Robustness - @blimpa has been working out some bugs in the MIPs portal with dSpot.   Other Initiatives Maker Operational Manual  Work continues to continue. I know we\u2019ve been talking about this for months, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to be singularly unimpressive when we share it (who likes documentation, anyway?) We are in the home stretch now. We\u2019ll have it live on a placeholder URL next week. Huge thanks to @gala, @Patrick_J, @AstronautThis, @prose11, @Derek and everyone else that has contributed so far.  Discord Migration  Having some minor issues figuring out the best way to structure permissions such that everything is functional, but also as private as possible for private channels. On the other hand, opening up some of the working channels to public visibility seems to have been positive.

Essentially I wanted to let @s_ben know that we value all the work he and others have done for us while also making SourceCred aware that we are planning to experiment with our set up, leaving it up to the community if and how we continue with SourceCred. The SourceCred folks are constantly adding new features and analysis to the SourceCred algorithm, but deciding what makes sense to implement for Maker has been a bit of a challenge. One of the things we agreed on was it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to keep SourceCred/Seth on retainer for customization going forward in April. SourceCred is still open to helping us out (especially if we continue our tithe to the organization), but ultimately neither side (GovAlpha or SourceCred) really has the time to make the previous retainer arrangement worthwhile. Depending on how these discussions go it is possible that we\u2019ll want to contract with SourceCred for a particular design in the future (one of the things we\u2019ve tossed around for example is crafting a seperate delegate instance to utilize the cred scores for delegate activity). But it all depends what the community wants to do with our forum incentivization. ",

A couple of new prospective delegates joined delegates group. If you\u2019re interested, please get in touch.   MIPs Portal  Work ramping up again going forward, big list of pending feedback for dSpot to work on.  @blimpa has been working hard on making this more awesome, working both with dSpot on the UX side, and with @Davidutro and @charlesstlouis on the MIPs Content side.   Maker Operational Manual (Governance Documentation)  Posted forum thread to solicit input on structure and contents. Still non-public, and needs some more work before we\u2019ll unveil.   SourceCred  Payton working with Seth to figure out how to boost Cred for specific categories and tags. Progress slow, more complex than it sounds. SourceCred lying low in June, back in July. Confirmed details of coming technical work to move SourceCred infrastructure on-chain.   Forum  Not too much progress here - lots of stuff half-done, but relatively low priority so has gone on the backburner this week.   Other External Stuff   @prose11 - Helping coordinate various community working groups.  @LongForWisdom - MKR Compensation discussions + Work  @LongForWisdom + @prose11 - Moderation and dispute resolution regarding RWA governance processes.
