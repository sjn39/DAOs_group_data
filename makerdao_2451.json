Discussion and signalling about the WBTC debt ceiling has highlighted that whereas ETH risks include market price but not centralization, and USDC risks include centralization but not market price, WBTC includes both. It may therefore be prudent to begin consciously considering centralization risk on its own. This could be done by breaking up the Risk Premium into two parts:  Risk Premium = Centralization Risk Premium + All Other Risks Premium  Then, a vault type\u2019s Stability Fee would be:  Stability Fee = Base Rate + Centralization Risk Premium + All Other Risks Premium  Note that for simplicity I suggest a single Centralization Risk parameter common to all centralized collateral, but it could also be per centralized custodian if the community perceives them to have significantly different centralization risk. The purpose of this topic is to gauge the level of support for updating the Fee Structure in this matter. ",

Custodial/centralization risk, some sort of price risk that scales with the volatility of the asset, and then idiosyncratic risk per collateral type. It seems like splitting the risk premium up this way could give us more consistent stability fees across collateral types. As @Spidomo brought up above, the wbtc and usdc custodial risk probably should have the same premiums since that part of the risk profiles are approximately the same. This kind of thinking is becoming more important now as we are adding more and more collateral types, and as we grow we risk having inconsistent stability fees for vaults with similar risk profiles. We have already seen this with KNC, ZRX, and BAT, with BAT having a similar risk profile, but a different premium. Likewise with ETH, which has non-zero risk associated with it, yet retains a 0% risk premium. With the base rate going negative today, we now have an opportunity to adjust these premiums and changing the Meta-Parameters without hurting the peg. ",

Also you can argue that USDT shouldn\u2019t have a full custody risk, they are only 74% asset-backed. 74% of the custody risk then?

Having these preset quantitative parameters for qualitative ideas makes it easier for us to have consistent stability fees. And if we accurately categorize types of risk, most collateral types should have 0% for unique risk premiums. For example, our existing collateral types WBTC, ETH, and USDC all are likely to have no unique risk premiums. This is likely the case for KNC, BAT, and ZRX also, although they have more volatility risk. All of these collateral types could instead be summed up by a price risk weighted by average volatility, and a custodial risk. I think maybe the only collateral type we have with unique risks that aren\u2019t a part of this framework yet is MANA. In the future then we wouldn\u2019t have to think quantitatively about every new collateral onboarded. The question would be a much more human question, \u201cWhat kinds of risk does this collateral have?\u201d. And we could also add new risk categories as we broke into new types of collateral. ",
