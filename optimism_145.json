For live metrics, please refer to our community dashboard at Velodrome Finance \ud83d\udeb4. Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): Velodrome\u2019s top priority is to provide a deep liquidity layer for low-slippage trades on Optimism. Based on a ve(3,3) design, Velodrome rewards behaviors correlated with the long-term success of the entire ecosystem:  Liquidity providers (LPs) receive VELO emissions, following an emission schedule running in perpetuity VELO holders can vote-escrow their tokens in exchange for veVELO proportional to the tokens locked and time locked, up to 4 years veVELO holders control the flow of VELO emissions to liquidity pools through gauge voting In return, veVELO voters receive 100% of the trading fees and bribes captured by the token pairs they select, as well as an anti-dilutive veVELO rebase  This design offers a capital-efficient, sustainable mechanism for protocols on Optimism to attract and retain liquidity. Protocols holding veVELO can incentivize liquidity for their token pairs in perpetuity with minimal dilution while capturing trading fees, a significant upgrade to classic LP rewards. Success cases include MakerDAO, Synthetix, Liquity, Qi DAO, and Optimism itself; all of which retain significant liquidity for their tokens on Velodrome. This design also simplifies the onramp for new projects joining Optimism and can therefore accelerate development on the ecosystem. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): Since its June 1 launch, Velodrome has attracted $15.5m+ TVL (>$40m at peak) and positioned itself as a key protocol on the Optimism ecosystem. Directing OP incentives to core protocol contributors such as active veVELO voters and strategic partners will add foundational strength to Velodrome\u2019s economy in these early days, giving us time to build out additional functionality critical to the protocol\u2019s success. How will the OP tokens be distributed? How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Velodrome will allocate OP distribution to support a healthy economic equilibrium of protocol incentives and reward further development on top of its liquidity layer:   15% - Long-Term Locking + Governance Incentive  veVELO lockers are making a long-term bet on both Velodrome and the Optimism ecosystem during a moment of great uncertainty. Token locking supports the health of the ecosystem by a) reducing floating supply of VELO, thereby reducing volatility, and b) aligning incentives between the token holder base and the overall ecosystem, as veVELO holders have a shared interest in the long-term success of Velodrome and Optimism as a whole. Rewarding lockers with OP tokens could not only increase the health of the Velodrome economy but also give more governance power to the exact kind of deeply invested, long-term thinkers Optimism is looking to attract.   Quantity: 450,000 OP  Delivery: Distributed to new veVELO lockers proportionally to locking balance  KPI: Exceeding and maintaining 65% VELO total supply locked      45% - Flywheel incentives: liquidity, partner onboarding and OP trade routing  In return for their active participation, veVELO voters receive the trading fees and bribes collected by the pairs they vote for. Bribes, therefore, are highly-capital efficient lever to attract liquidity to the pairs in the ecosystem that deserve it most, while effectively increasing the incentives for long-term participants (veVELO). Bribes act as a core balancing mechanism and can serve as a liquidity catalyst for new players looking to enter the ecosystem. Experience in Velodrome and similar protocols, such as Curve-Convex-Votium, shows that bribes yield a 1.3-5x return in emission value per bribe. Maintaining a consistent bribe program for core ecosystem token pairs would allow Velodrome to attract and retain liquidity in a capital-efficient way.  One of Velodrome\u2019s core objectives is to become the liquidity platform for new and existing projects looking to deploy on Optimism. A key aspect of Velodrome\u2019s initial distribution was the gifting of veNFTs to key \u201claunch partners\u201d both inside and outside the Optimism ecosystem. This resulted in the first ever L2 deployment for several protocols and tokens. The Velodrome Team retains control of additional veNFTs to be used as \u201cgrants\u201d for future protocol partners looking to migrate to or build on OP. To continue incentivizing partners to join the Optimism ecosystem, Velodrome will offer bribing matching, veVELO voting boosts, and OP token pairing (providing liquidity) for new partner tokens, using a portion of the OP grant, which would further strengthen OP\u2019s position as a central token for trade routing. As part of this program, Velodrome will seek to coordinate with other partners receiving OP grants to merge liquidity incentive efforts leveraging Velodrome\u2019s mechanics, increasing the sustainability of ecosystem incentives and reducing the potential price impact on OP Velodrome will also strategically pair OP with core tokens to establish OP as a central token for trade routing on the protocol, ensure deep permanent liquidity for OP   Quantity: 1,950,000 OP  Delivery: Bribes strategically added to key pairs, OP paired with key partner tokens, offered as incentives to partner onboarding, match partner bribe incentives. Distributed at an average rate of 160,000 per month  KPI: High liquidity on targeted pairs (TVL), TVL / bribe value, Trading volume / bribe value, number of partners onboarded      20% - Builder Incentives  Distributed to protocols that integrate Velodrome\u2019s liquidity layer into their dApps   Quantity: 600,000 OP  Delivery: Co-incentives positioned on partner protocols  KPI: TVL, transaction volume, transaction count attracted through partner dApps      20% - Building and Auditing Relay   Relay is a proposed addition to Velodrome that will be a first-of-its kind vote delegation and autocompounding feature that is directly built into Velodrome - i.e., not administered by a separate protocol with fee cuts, separate governance, and so on. Relay is a crucial part of the Velodrome ecosystem, one that on the one hand allows votelockers to enjoy passively optimized, compounded yield, and on the other hand provides the Optimism Collective more power to direct liquidity for the benefit of the greater community. How? By combining delegation to a strict profit-maximizing strategy, which would vote for pools offering the greatest potential for fee and bribe revenue, with pool incentivization from OP grants and bribes (e.g., the flywheel incentives mentioned above*),* we can help direct delegated votes to the most socially beneficial pools, while offering the best yield available to veVELO lockers.  While our work since our launch one month ago has for the most part been (and will continue to be) the continual improvement of our existing functionality as well as UI, QoL measures, and integrations, we see an urgent need to get Relay online; this offering would dramatically increase our value proposition to existing and new partner protocols. Unlike many of our peers on Optimism, we have never raised outside capital, instead bootstrapping ourselves off fees and grants after being invited by OP Labs to build on Optimism. This means we\u2019ve been building on a shoestring. This grant would enable us to reach out to the community to attract more builder and auditing resources. We\u2019ve already identified some people and orgs who can help - it\u2019s just a matter of making sure they can link up well with us. Because this is new, we want it done right and quickly.   Quantity: 600,000 OP  Delivery: Relay spec\u2019d, built, and deployed as broadly defined in the post linked above, or built to specs revealed to be better for proper ecosystem functioning  KPI: Relay successfully deployed and audited to the highest standard          Initiative Allocation     Locking Incentives 450,000   Flywheel Incentives 1,350,000   Builder Incentives 600,000   Relay Building and Auditing 600,000   Total 3,000,000    Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Velodrome\u2019s LP emissions are designed to run in perpetuity, following a sustainable and predictable schedule (see our docs for details). As a result, liquidity incentives will always be a key protocol feature. The incentive program outlined above will significantly boost the value of accumulating VELO and vote-locking into veVELO, supporting the health of the Velodrome economy while the natural tailwinds of Optimism\u2019s growth accelerate. Once OP incentives end, protocols and retail players alike will hold a long-term veVELO position that will allow them to further direct VELO liquidity incentives, while sharing the upside of Velodrome\u2019s and Optimism\u2019s success. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? 12 months How much will your project match in co-incentives? The VelodromeFi incentive model is designed in such a way that each of these actions will be reinforced and complemented with additional VELO incentives. In the case of the locking incentives, veVELO holders will receive a higher rebase (veVELO balance growth) every epoch, proportional to the share of total VELO supply that is locked (veVELO.supply / total.VELO.supply). Likewise, flywheel incentives such as bribes will attract an outsized share of VELO emissions to targeted pools, allowing liquidity providers to capture the increased emissions and creating a virtuous cycle of rewards for each $OP committed as part of this strategy.

That will yield exponential value for the ecosystem. We\u2019re also helping to deepen liquidity on critical ecosystem pairs like sUSD and sETH that support folks like Synthetix, Lyra, Aelin, etc. In the past 7 days, we were able to bring 1M in TVL to the sETH-WETH pair. And we\u2019re highly capital efficient in doing so, which should help unlock a ton of growth for those projects. The big thing though is that we\u2019re Optimism native and the protocol is designed as a public good. 100% of fees and bribes stay in the ecosystem and go back $veVELO lockers which are primarily projects on OP. Compare that something like Curve where 100% of the bribing happens on main-net and 50% of the fees go to veCRV stakers there. If we can capture more of the TVL and volume there, the ecosystem and Optimism wins. ",

We looked and could not find anything.   from proposal side you right, you have followed the template and there is nothing that needs to be changed and you read more about Phase 1 here:- Governance Fund Overview | Optimism Docs  What\u2019s your rationale for breaking into two proposals  great question, your first proposal will act as base for your second proposal, it will be easy to judge if the funds were indeed used in a valuable way.  and what is your implied \u2018limit\u2019 for number of tokens that ought to be requested  frankly hard to say and that is why i focus on multiple proposal, data is best evidence  We\u2019ve seen some pretty sizeable asks go through.  I am not which one you are referring to but max i have seen is 1M, apart from yours and barn bridge, i havent any others regarding Infinity wallet, you can read my comment why i supported it. But i am happy to write it one more time as you have spend some time going though my approvals. Its a desktop wallet, we dont have that many desktop wallet in the market which support complete defi integration. 45% is not for dev of the wallet but rather for DApps development on top of their own wallet. 40% is for fee rebate to those DApps and for user on boarding. sure, they will use few Ks for their own dev but their market is totally different, their user base is different and comparing them with Velo is like comparing potatoes with onions ",

I agree with all your point, but help me understand this, Millie. What they have done in the past or planning to do in the future, how is that related to Phase 1 proposal ? Their airdrop was a initiative to attract user and I dont see how mentioning their VeloDAO is any supporting argument here ? Same goes to their token economics, should we discuss project internal structure here?. I love the project and I use it regularly, i also got the airdrop but i dont see a connection here. From my side, I am only looking at the proposal and how a team is planning to use the requested token. If they are planning to use the token as LP reward, it must be matched with Velo and that amount of dev is also no from me. Of course, this is just my opinion and willing to discuss this more if needed. ",
