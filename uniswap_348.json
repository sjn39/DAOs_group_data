I\u2019ll use any validation system desired for your Yay or Nay vote, as long as it is is secure and anonymous. My philosophy is that any adopted changes must be overwhelmingly supported. Better to risk voting down a good proposal (which can be re-submitted) than risk voting up a bad proposal (which may be irreversible or may take time to fix). \u201cWe fear change\u201d As stated below, when I receive 20 likes on here I will post my address that you can delegate to. You can read some of my comments to see my opinions and such. Thank you ",

The current proposal is a prime example why voting NO matters, as Dharma is trying to change the voting rules in order to profit for themselves. As stated before, its much better to vote NO on everything, even a good proposal, which can just be resubmitted. I\u2019d like to have at least 500k UNI to have a decent voting block.
