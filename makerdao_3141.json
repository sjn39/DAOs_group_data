                    "content": "Every semester Professor Joel Greenblatt of Columbia University would ask his students of the Value & Special Situation Investment course, \u201chow do you beat Tiger Woods?\u201d The answer was, you don\u2019t play him at Golf. Instead of trying to figure out how to beat him and spend time banging your head against the wall, you play him in Chess.  When Maker Goes Up, I Get Those Wam Fuzzies With the recent success of the ETH and MKR price, many of us are excited and feeling gooey with those warm fuzzies you get inside\u2013you know what I\u2019m talking about  .  But with all of this success, we tend to forget that our main objective is not that exciting feeling of clocking DAI, or profits, and it\u2019s not necessarily the feeling of knowing you can pay the rent/mortgage for the next 24 months with no worries, or that you can finally take your dream trip to Madagascar. It goes beyond financial success. Our Mental Health is one that we must keep healthy\u2013it\u2019s important to take care of yourself and get the most from life. Remember, money is not everything.  If you, or anybody you know is experiencing anxiety/mental health issues, please reach out to someone and talk about your feelings, keep active, eat well, keep in touch, and ask for help. Because God knows, the Maker Community is going to need you   Why Should We Play Chess? With the success of the DAO in 2020, we must not forget about our ultimate goal  and remember that we are still in the early stages of developing a new product that has a lot of competition. Yes, we are the first movers in offering the World a decentralized stablecoin. But with that quick success comes a lot of development, vision, focus, and maintenance. We All know that centralized tokens like USDC, TUSD, PAX and USDT sell their solution as a digitized version of the asset they represent\u2013mainly the mighty U.S. Dollar\u2013reckoning they have 1-to-1 fiat reserves to back the tokens they issue. Other protocols like our beloved DAI, or sUSD have a crypto asset backed design, and others are elastic supply tokens governed by algorithmic mechanics to maintain a $1 peg. So, what is the difference when utilizing DAI, BUSD, USDC, USDT, FRAX, etc. for the consumer?  Let\u2019s see: USDC:  Certificates of Deposits BUSD: Opaque USDT: Opaque Algo Stablecoins: Algorithmic Mechanism DAI: Currently 50% ETH, 31% USDC, 9% WBTC, and the other 10% of assets that have not gain traction. I strongly believe we are ahead of the game versus all centralized and decentralized stablecoins, and consumers should choose and use DAI versus any other stanblecoin IMO. But when you look at which exchanges hold the most stablecoins\u2013Alex Svanevik of Nansen recently wrote: \u201cBy far the largest exchange in stablecoin holdings is Binance , which holds >$1B in BUSD, >$500M in USDT, >$500M in USDC, plus other stablecoins.\u201d And if we look at top 5 exchanges with stablecoin balances, Uniswap who is number two (2) with $700M+ has $188M of DAI liquidity, trailing USDT w/$205M, and USDC w/$260M. The reality is that ALL three (3) stablecoins have a lot of growing-up to do. So, how do we innovate and separate ourselves from the rest? Do we take the YFI approach and become another \u201chedge-fund in your pocket\u201d protocol, or do we become FIRST Movers in diversifying our Collateral? How do we play chess Maker Community? First Stablecoin Mover to Real World Assets Speaking of staying \u201cGrounded\u201d to the actual ground, we are on a mission to be the first Stablecoin to include RWA. We have Centrifuge, Six S, and a few others waiting on the sidelines, keen to help DAI decentralize beyond tokens. It is my believe and opinion that we make a strong push to onboard as much RWA that fits our risk tolerance into the protocol in 2021. We must play chess versus others. Chess is a game of strategy and tactics. The opening, the middlegame, and the endgame. What is your opening? If you don\u2019t have an opening, will you bring ideas & resources to the community that will help the DAO have a middlegame? I hope that your endgame is not the profits you have accumulated in 2020  because We can change help the world, We can make a difference. Let\u2019s play chess! ",

Remember, money is not everything.   This is worth repeating 100000 times as a mantra. Thanks @flipflopflapdelegate. This said, the community here seems to me mostly composed of balanced people, having regular jobs (not \u201ccrypto trader\u201d), very focused on growing MakerDAO and very generally relaxed. Sure, the price movement is good news, but I don\u2019t yet see hundreds of new people coming to the chat/forum with memes etc, so it\u2019s all good (for now!) I think. ",
