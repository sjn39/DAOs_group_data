What would need to happen in order for reward rate per week (in $UNI) to climb up, once you have deposited your LP tokens? I can see the weekly reward is fluctuating for me, hence the question. Cheers! ",

                    "content": "Hi there Anythony, The reward rate depends not just on how much liquidity you are providing, but also on how much others are providing at that moment. In liquidity pools fees are distributed among the liquidity providers, this is similar how the current initial liquidity mining pool works. For example: you provided $1,000 liquidity and receive 0.001% of the pool rewards. The total amount of liquidity provided at the moment is $1,000,000. If another $200,000 in liquidity were to be provided by other people, then the total liquidity pool would count $1,200,000. If volume didn\u2019t go up and therefore fees didn\u2019t go up, the same number of rewards would now need to be shared among $1,200,000 worth of liquidity providers instead of $1,000,000. So, your % with your $1,000 would go down at that moment. If there were less liquidity provided in the pool, then your % would go up. ETH Pools have seen mass increase in liquidity because of the UNI rewards - therefore your reward % has likely gone down. ",

So my question is, if one provides liquidity in a pool without any volume (no trades, just for the sake of calculation) what percentage of UNI is he gonna miss out due to no volume in the pool? ",
