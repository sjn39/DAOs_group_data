                    "content": " Increasing MIP efficiency community poll This post examines the current MIP proposal timeline and seeks the community\u2019s opinions regarding adjusting the parameters. Current timeline for MIPs includes:  4 weeks (RFC) request for comment period ~1 week intermittent time  ~3 days of formal submission ~4 days of waiting time prior to ratification polls   2 weeks ratification poll for formal voting  We believe the current 7 weeks period is too long and inefficient. We\u2019ve observed little forum activity after the first few days of initial proposals and then activity picking up again close to the formal submission window (likely somewhat inflated by GovAlpha posts confirming proposal status). Data presented in this post further supports this assertion. Further, the delegates have proven they can form an educated opinion during the shorter three-day votes. Therefore, we believe the delegates would still have sufficient time to form an educated opinion if the ratification poll period was shortened by one week following the Formal Submission period ending. RFC Data There have been over 1,300 total forum comments on the initial MIP proposals. Below is the breakdown of the number of comments in each week of the 4-week RFC cycle.  upload_e8609f0aea9ebeb4772d92e878769ec41206\u00d7364 18.8 KB   There is a very apparent \u201cdead zone\u201d of activity during weeks 2 and 3 of the RFC period. This aligns with our initial thoughts, as much of the hype and discussion around a proposal happens during the first week of a new post. Logically this makes sense as provide this initial opinion, and then discussion picks up again as the proposal nears the end of RFC and during the official vote. Given the lack of activity during weeks two and three of RFC and the responsiveness of the delegates, we believe it would be quite reasonable to reduce the overall MIP timeline as follows: Suggested timeline for MIPs:  3 weeks (RFC) request for comment period  4 days intermittent time 3 days of formal submission   1 day of waiting time prior to ratification polls. 1 week ratification poll for formal voting  Polls We\u2019d like to gauge community sentiment below for each of the three proposed timeline changes. Poll 1: Decrease the RFC period from 4 weeks to 3 weeks.     Option 1: Keep 4 weeks Option 2: Change to 3 weeks Option 3: Abstain     0 voters     Poll 2: Decrease the formal submission intermittent window from ~1 week to 4 days.     Option 1: Keep ~1 week Option 2: Change to 4 days Option 3: Abstain     0 voters     Poll 3: Decrease MIP proposals\u2019 formal ratification polling period. Options to reduce to 10 days and 7 days are included.     Option 1: Keep 2 weeks Option 2: Change to 10 days Option 3: Change to 1 week (7 days) Option 4: Abstain     0 voters     @Recognized-Delegates @Core-Facilitators ",

In order to evaluate if this change is appropriate, we would first want to determine the appropriate dependent variable to measure. In order to do this, we could perform qualitative interviews with the stakeholders. Based on these initial findings, we can help inform what variables we would look to invalidate our hypothesis ( if we still believe these are dead periods after interviewing). Starting with initial interviewing lends support and rationale to the selection of our dependent variable (DV). In other words, deciding what the appropriate measures are to evaluate our hypothesis. (Shortening the governance period will produce more \u201cefficient\u201d governance.) How do we measure \u201cefficiency\u201d?  Based on the above it is implied based on comment count across a term. The inference I draw from the above data is simply that work is happening, but not visible via the operationalizations (DV) you have selected (comments). If your hypothesis is that there is low activity, you could vary your DV to see if the hypothesis still stands (eg. views, polling core units or recent MIP authors, etc). This could be done in the manner above (qualitative interviews) or varying your operationalization/DV (quantitative measure). From there, you would have a better picture and it would be evident in the signal request if the parameters would benefit from modification because your hypothesis has different operationalizations and significant data while it is still standing (affords construct and convergent validity). Even if a change is to be implemented, we need a hypothesis to measure improvement, based on what we have here, measuring comments, the implied hypothesis is that you would have the same or greater comments during the shorter term? It is advisable to establish hypotheses upfront when running these kinds of experiments such that you can evaluate their success (or failure) without post-hoc theorizing. ",

So, I find it frustrating to have people not participate in that comprehensive work and just throw more governance clutter in the mix seeking a quick fix for a narrowly construed frustration. @Juanbug Have you had an opportunity to engage with the DAO Resiliency Improvement Strategic Initiative @wouter is coordinating? I voted to keep the status quo across the board. Let\u2019s consolidate the concerns here with the wider strategic work underway to come up with informed adjustments that have a full consideration for the big picture, determination of priorities, strategy, tactics, dependencies, etc. etc. Because work is not reflected in someone writing a post on the Forum does not make it ipso facto problematic for non-transparency or reflective of a lack of time being utilized (whatever that might mean). For example, I spend HOURS simply reading, catching up on recordings of meetings I was not able to attend real time, researching, etc and all that while meeting with no one behind closed doors. Let\u2019s not assume that all legitimate and important work going on to consider proposals must boil down to an arbitrary number of comments and interactions on a Forum post. Further, with the sophistication of what we are doing as a large decentralized group things just need to take more time than most folks would like. But that\u2019s the trade off for not being any number of organizations being taken out to the gallows right now and in the days to come. ",

When decisions have high impact and high risk, it is better to have them move more slowly where possible. Part of disinformation or governance exploits is to get high impact decisions to move quickly (reducing the chance they are caught or getting foot in door) or by slowing decisions that need to be done quickly (e.g. rate adjustments via SR). A taxonomy of governance actions (e.g. MIP, SR, etc), their use cases, and their attributes with a rationale makes sense and is needed if this interests your delegation. Aligning distinct governance actions to a a phased cadence could be a step forward, rather than changing the global governance cadence for all governance actions. ",

I just wanted to take the time to address the following:     Juanbug:  ~1 week intermittent time  ~3 days of formal submission ~4 days of waiting time prior to ratification polls    Regarding the 4 days of waiting time, bear in mind 2 of these days are the weekend. The remaining time is used by GovAlpha to ensure the following:  The MIP has been presented as formally submitted on a G&R call (a requirement in MIP51) The MIP version on the forum matches the version on Github and the MIPs portal That the MIP contains no significant risks/changes that require highlighting to the Maker Community/Delegates prior to a vote Where appropriate, it is confirmed with the MIP author whether eligible MIPs are to be submitted as a MIP set or as individual MIPs A ratification poll is written - largely template based but still takes a bit of time to ensure accuracy - it is much easier to batch the formal submissions and split between 1-3 poll writers, rather than writing them as the formal submissions roll in, to try and prevent any proposals being missed The ratification poll is checked by another member of GovAlpha for accuracy If the first check was not done by a facilitator, a final check is performed by a GovAlpha facilitator to ensure it meets the standards to be submitted to the voting portal If any of the above checks highlight changes are required, these need to be made, and this can cause delays in a team that works async The poll is submitted by a GovAlpha facilitator to the voting portal, such that it will be available at 16:00 UTC on the Monday for voting Appropriate changes are made by a GovAlpha facilitator to the relevant json file to allow the voting portal to display relevant tags  This is just to highlight that although it may seem like \u201cdead time\u201d - there is stuff happening \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d and once the weekend is accounted for, there isn\u2019t necessarily a whole lot of wiggle room to get things ready for submission when async working and other responsibilities are factored in. Any reduction in this timeframe should consider what needs to happen on the backend to get a MIP up on the voting portal. This time also allows a cooling-off period for a MIP author to retract formal submission - see MIP65 for a recent example where this happened. ",

To be able to meaningfully contribute in a discussion and to make an informed decision you need to independently research a fair bit. This is especially true for budget and greenlight proposals. Also not all questions are created equal. The first discussion might very well be to get the gist of the major issues before researching and then coming back for a discussion on the finer points once we are closer to the voting date. ",
