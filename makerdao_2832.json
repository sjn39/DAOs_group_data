But i come here in peace.  I just want to know like who\u2019s decision it is that maybe could go through the process of having send the dai back?? or considering they are now burnt (along with the 50K other dai that has been sent to the contract) - that who is the person, or group of people that make the decision to mint the dai that has been, for all-intense-and-purposes burnt, and sent back to originating address/es??? what would the people need to do, because i am sure that the other people that have done similar, given there is 50K dai sitting on contract address, would appreciate their dai being returned so what motions need to be done, who is it that one could approach or just who makes those types of decisions? heres an idea, maybe dai team can do even something like going through the process/effort of burning/minting \u2026 and maybe charging a fee to those that wish their coins to be returned >???   10% 20%  idk, id be more than willing to have like a service fee of x%, its more-so a thing to me of principle, versus just needing the money back, those were mine, they did belong to me, and i just want them back.  i know crypto can be brutal and very unforgiving, but idk i just didnt/dont know what else to do or where to go, so came here. I am a regular person, not rich, i was going to use that dai to pay bills.  it was dai i was going to send to bank account to pay mortgage last week, i have children and wife i need support in the grand scheme of things it is not a lot of dai, but it was enough to make me want to investigate and see what would one have to do to make the dai be returned. ??   please it is very important to me !!  and i suspect important to the many others that have also sent dai by accident to the contract address.   !!   please ",

I think this is, after all, not a ridiculous question. And perhaps we should really think about it. It has been discussed earlier (in the chat) that lost DAI (like the ones lost by Khameleon) have some influence on the peg and push the peg above 1.0. This is because, to close their CDPs, people need to get DAI, but there are less than intended available DAI in the market, and this pushes the price up. ",

But it does affect the pegged price, and it will only get worse, if these mistakes continue to happen. thank you for your attention and idk just kind of makes sense.  i suspect there could even be code written that after the dai is returned, that if it were to happen again, that it automatically resends it back.

But there are 12 pages of ppl sending dai into the contract - and that surely has an adverse affect on the pegging of 1$ i suspect. i realize/sense you understand the more intimate details of what were talking about but how or what needs to happen -but what would be like the first step?  needs to be voted on?  idk just curious really thank you!

There are different approaches to get a feeling of what MKR holders would like (they are the ones voting for changes) but I think that eventually this will need a MIP (Maker Improvement Proposal) to make a change to the protocol. I would advice starting with a written post that clearly outlines the advantages + a poll to measure the sentiment. Probably @LongForWisdom has a better idea on how to proceed. ",

I think it would be better to get some idea of the community feeling before putting more effort into a proposal. After that I\u2019d suggest a declaration of intent. You can see some details of these here: MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes (Note that signal request != informal poll) I would say that I think this proposal is unlikely to gain traction, at least without some development work. Maker Governance can\u2019t just mint unbacked DAI from nothing without paying for it. We can send DAI to those that sent DAI to the contract, but that DAI would get taken out of the Protocol reserves, which belong to all MKR Holders. So you\u2019re essentially asking MKR Holders to reimburse you out of pocket. Off the top of my head, I can\u2019t think of an easy way of managing the situation in such a way that allows the DAI to be returned without some party paying for it. ",

Correct. The protocol currently has no way of understanding that the DAI in the DAI contract is actually burnt and inaccessible. This is the main problem.     juan:  You are right that you would probably need to create a function that mints Dai manually, so it probably would weaken the security of the system.   We already have this. It\u2019s called the suck function and it allows governance to mint DAI and send it to an address, however, this DAI is unbacked, which means in order to balance the system, the DAI is then subtracted from the surplus buffer and potentially trigger FLOP auctions if the DAI is not available. As far as I understand there is no way for us to tell the protocol that some old backed DAI is now inaccessible and that this new DAI doesn\u2019t need to be backed (because it\u2019s backed by the collateral that was backing the old inaccessible DAI.)

Seems like a broad and sweeping statement without much backing it up. I agree with the general point you\u2019re making (having error-safe contracts where possible is sensible). In the future please try to phrase your comments in a more constructive way and refrain from implying predatory practices where none exist. ",

Today i was explaining my father how dao and maker and defi and stuff all works\u2026he is 77yo and well it is a tough sale  but i think i am gaining ground on him understanding at least. thanks maker team for all you guys do- i still am in support and use platform just wish there was a way to recover those funds that were accidentally sent to contract address. PS> incidentally i just looked at the contract, not sure if you guys look often or not, but in last 3 month, the amount of DAI there on contract address looks to have about doubled. its about 100k dai sitting in there now so it does keep growing at a decent rate too.  idk just saying.  at this rate (15k per month) could add up quick in just another year or so.
