Ltd. 2) Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Enjin offers an ecosystem of integrated blockchain products, tools, and services that enable anyone to easily manage, explore, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency used to directly back the value of Enjin-powered blockchain assets. 3) Provide a brief history of the project. Enjin was founded in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski. In the same year, the company launched a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, which has since grown to more than 20 million users across 250,000 gaming communities. In 2017, following a successful ICO that raised 75,041 ETH ($18.9 million), Enjin began building a blockchain ecosystem, with a suite of user-first blockchain products that enable anyone to easily manage, explore, distribute, trade, and integrate blockchain assets. Built on top of a robust on-chain infrastructure and comprised of the Enjin Platform, Explorer & Marketplace, Wallet, Beam, and other tools and services, the Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency used to directly back the value of Enjin-powered blockchain assets. To date, over 10.5 million ENJ has been locked into 52 million blockchain assets. Along with the many game developers using ENJ-backed assets in their games, Enjin\u2019s tools and products are trusted by industry leaders like Microsoft, Samsung, Unity Technologies, and Binance. The company has also received investment from Blockchain.com Ventures.

Thank you so much for your application @Marc_Enjin I think this is one of the more exciting release posts I\u2019ve read in Ethereum in a while\u2026 A real, production plugin for MineCraft using assets on Ethereum is no small thing. Question: do users have to use the Enjin wallet for this to work? (Not directly related to a collateral application I know, but I\u2019m curious). The \u201cSmart\u201d wallet and Easy Automatic Payments seem cool, but forgive a skeptic his doubts about safety. Seems like a fairly healthy distribution, and a not-insignificant market cap to me. I can\u2019t seem to find anything in the whitepaper that discusses this mechanism in detail though:     Marc_Enjin:  (ENJ) is a utility token used to directly back the value of ERC-1155 blockchain assets minted with the Enjin blockchain game development platform   What happens to the value of my \u201cSword of Ultimate Wrath\u201d if the value of ENJ goes down, or up? How tightly coupled are the assets minted through the platform to the value of the coin, which is just an ERC20 traded on the open market, correct? Is there some strong relation between the number and type of ERC1155 assets minted, and the price of ENJ? ",

I think this is one of the more exciting release posts I\u2019ve read in Ethereum in a while\u2026 A real, production plugin for MineCraft using assets on Ethereum is no small thing.  Appreciate the enthusiasm! I\u2019m really curious to see what people build with it!  Question: do users have to use the Enjin wallet for this to work?  For the time being, that\u2019s correct, the Enjin Wallet is required at the moment to connect/link it.  Seems like a fairly healthy distribution, and a not-insignificant market cap to me.  We\u2019ve mostly had small contributions during the ICO, we didn\u2019t work with any type of funds or capitals.  What happens to the value of my \u201cSword of Ultimate Wrath\u201d if the value of ENJ goes down, or up?  The price itself doesn\u2019t affect the performance of the item. In most cases, the value baked in could be seen as a \u201cvendor scrap\u201d or \u201cbottom value\u201d of an item on the market.  How tightly coupled are the assets minted through the platform to the value of the coin, which is just an ERC20 traded on the open market, correct?  Correct - There\u2019s very little correlation for the time being between the locked ENJ inside assets, but it\u2019s difficult to ignore that at some point it will start having an impact on the tokens scarcity. Keep the questions coming, happy to get into diverse topics and also hear out ideas from the community on the intersection of DeFi / Gaming / NFTs and how we could help play a part into it. ( This might be slightly off topic, but relevant to the overall reason we\u2019re applying ) ",
