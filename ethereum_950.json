Here is my \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening With Ethereum Classic?\u201d talk from DEVCON5:    SlidesLive    Bob Summerwill | What is happening with Ethereum Classic? 2019 has been an exciting year for the Ethereum Classic community. Three years on from The DAO the focus is on developer experience, on coordinating hard forks to bring Byzantium, Constantinople and...      I think that lots of people in the Ethereum community will be pleasantly surprised to find that ETC is very rapidly becoming a viable alternative to ETH1.   We added Byzantium opcodes in September and our next HF in January will get us up to Constantinople, and we will likely hit \u201cprotocol parity\u201d by next April. And we have funding \u2026 in the form of ETC Labs \u2026 but also a little from ETC Labs, where I am now Executive Director. For example:    Medium \u2013 10 Sep 19    ETC support in Hyperledger Besu I am very happy to announce that the ETC Cooperative are funding ChainSafe to implement Ethereum Classic support for the Hyperledger Besu\u2026 Reading time: 3 min read       Hyperledger Besu can sync the ETC mainnet as of yesterday, and the changes should be upstreamed within the next week or so:   twitter.com    Bob Summerwill (BobSummerwill)  Some awesome news from @gregthegreek and @ChainSafeth!  They have @Hyperledger Besu fully syncing the ETC mainnet now ;-)   CC @PegaSysEng.

WGs (or Rings) for various EVM-compatible blockchains would be welcome, particularly for ETC! One thing I will say is that the term \u201cEthereum Magicians\u201d is open, no restrictions of its use, and all are free to put together a Magicians-style gathering alongside any event. @anett and I (mainly, but @timbeiko has helped a lot) have been mapping out how the Operations Ring will support FEM gatherings and community organizing over the next year. A lot of the focus in the near future should move toward funding and communications. We learned a lot holding the boat together for the last couple of gatherings, now we need to make this sustainable. It would be a very positive development if a certain kind of Ring were to form around nearby systems in the wider Ethereum family, supporting the seeding of our principles toward governing technology in those realms.
