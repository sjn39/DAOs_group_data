I collect here some questions that I think are interesting (to me at least): Q1 from @iammeeoh )  I understand correctly from your post that the validator node and its rewards can be considered property of MakerDAO, as opposed of the Foundation? How can we manage these asset rewards (STAKE tokens?) in the most efficient and transparent way? Q2 from @iammeeoh ) How do you plan to decentralise (from you) as much as possible the Maker validator node? For example, how do you plan to deal with the rewards/tokens received from the Network, Staking etc? What about the management of the private keys? What if other people join the \u201cxDAI working group\u201d and need to share with you these secrets? Etc. The question of course also includes things like transparency (towards the MakerDAO governance), etc. Q3 from @iammeeoh ) due to Ethereum fees, the minimum dust/vault-size is currently set to 100usd and it could increase over time. Do you think xDAI-Network could provide some useful options for providing MakerDAO services to the less rich? @ejbarraza also writes: \"I would love to see MakerDAO explore using xDAI if only as an experiment for possibly scaling in the future. \" Q4 from @LongForWisdom: Do you intend to run the validator as an individual (which would be completely fair, imo, given that you ran it yourself prior to the Foundation being interested,) or do you intend to run it on behalf of MakerDAO? Q5 from @LongForWisdom: I think @iammeeoh is correct in that if you\u2019re running it on behalf of the DAO, we need to figure out answers to some of the questions he posed. Namely:  How to decentralize this function? What happens with the validator rewards? How to ensure resiliency + uptime?  Q6 from @LongForWisdom: The idea of a working group is a good one, I think. As far as I\u2019m aware, developers within the Foundation are not currently prioritising L2 solutions. Maybe if we\u2019re creating a working group we should make it L2 focused generally, rather than specifically focused on xDAI? Edit, new question: Q7 from @iammeeoh: what is the address of MakerDAO\u2019s validator among those of https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/validators ? ",

The xDai chain has been successfully bootstrapped and become a success with a thriving community, and we are happy that we have been able to support it. At the same time, the Maker Foundation is decentralizing its responsibilities and believes now is the opportune moment to return responsibility for the xDAI validator to Mariano. He has always been a great ambassador for Dai, and was the driving force behind our support of the project. What\u2019s more, he operated the validator himself initially, and is well-positioned to take on that responsibility again. We are planning to finalize the transfer of the validator to Mariano before the end of the year. ",

There is a 1-to-1 bridge between DAI (on Ethereum) and xDAI (on xDai-Network).   MakerDAO\u2019s product is DAI. But beside this, there is no link between xDAI-Network and MakerDAO. In fact (I asked @igorbarinov, the main guy at xDai-Network) and Governance could, potentially (even if unlikely), decide to modify the bridges for xDAI (e.g., with a 1-to-1 with USDC), etc.   xDAI network is a Proof-of-Stake (as opposed to Proof of Work, like Bitcoin). This requires a number of validators to build blocks. Currently there are 15, see: https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/validators One of these validators is run by @nanexcool and (this is the topic of this thread) it is supposed to be the \u2018MakerDAO\u2019 validator. So MakerDAO is running a validator on xDAI-Network, just like many other people/groups/institutions/daos (again, 15 in total at the moment). This should produce some value over time (the xDAI-Network rewards validators for creating blocks).   Question for @nanexcool: what is the address of MakerDAO\u2019s validator? ",

After talking a bit around it looks like Fact:  Mariano will run the xDai validator as an individual, i.e., in a way independent of MakerDAO. There is no MakerDAO validator anymore. I am sorry (@Monstrosity1, @mario) if my comments increased the confusion regarding this topic. This of course does not mean that MakerDAO and xDAI will not be able to cooperate in the future! In fact I hope the two projects can work together a lot in 2021 to fight the high Ethereum fees problems we all know about  Edit: @nanexcool if you share with us the address of your validator, I will stake my STAKE tokens on you!
