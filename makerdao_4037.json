                    "content": "Hi everyone, I work with @g_dip at RWA Co. and I am developing RWA Co.'s infrastructure for reporting to MakerDAO. Our goal is to give MakerDAO as much transparency and insight as possible about  the collateral assets the borrowers who own those assets the asset originators who lend to those borrowers the Delaware Statutory Trusts that lend to the asset originators.  We will make data available via API, spreadsheets, and dashboards. Wherever possible, we will push data and documents on chain and/or to the Permaweb with cryptographic digital signatures from the originator of the data. To kick things off, I have uploaded the 6s Capital agreements. Here are individual links to Conforming Copies (unsigned but matching the signed docs) of:  6s Capital Credit Agreement  \u2192 TXID: 43uA8HzhRbZvRFQmBI6I4HPFt0BrFqjIIx9vsBXaLSw 6s Capital Security Agreement  \u2192 TXID: dgMqqZkdH6c0IDm2ERNTeexKa1DCDaceVT4pWGNRFVU 6s Capital Trust Agreement  \u2192 TXID: dgMqqZkdH6c0IDm2ERNTeexKa1DCDaceVT4pWGNRFVU 6s Capital Escrow Agreement  \u2192 TXID: oFevWdg48WB5DKsx3y9dLUu0adBJMFotthdHgC_jShs  These documents will live on Arweave\u2019s Permaweb (purportedly) for at least 200 years and nobody (not even RWA Co.) can take them down. I wholeheartedly welcome your feedback and ideas about how to develop reporting infrastructure that gives the Maker community extreme confidence in the collateral value, collateralization ratio (and other health metrics), activities and solvency of borrowers, activities and solvency of asset originators, the cash flows, and the robustness of this real world legal structure. My background is in real estate data / technology and in consummating complex real estate transactions that require litigation and probate. You can reach me here and at [email\u00a0protected] ",

I hope to bring this data to the community. The vendor space for this data is an area of expertise for me. I\u2019m thinking we work with a data aggregator like Cherr\u00e9 to get API access to all of that. Longer term, if local governments get woke to the awesomeness of Web3 and DAOs, I expect that we\u2019ll see these real estate public records recorded on chain as the County Recorders DAOify. ",
