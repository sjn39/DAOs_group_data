                    "content": "I\u2019ve been asking myself for a while how rising yields on the treasury market and rate hikes could impact Defi and when it would be visable. DAI is especially interesting in this regard. I hope someone could give me an answer to this. The 10y bond yield is a benchmark for me in this game. It has risen from 1.5% (Dec. 2021) to nearly 3% now.  us_10y_bondyield741\u00d7465 29.1 KB  As yields are rising, I\u2019d assume, that this would put pressure on the liquidity of the whole stablecoin market. I hope I didn\u2019t miss anything in the Maker community in the last months, so correct me if I\u2019m wrong:  dai_supply1407\u00d7665 50 KB  The falling dai supply and also the falling collateralization of DAI via stables isn\u2019t surprising for me in this case. However I still don\u2019t understand a few governance mechanisms and why DAI to USD isn\u2019t already reacting. If liquidity moves out, I\u2019d assume price of DAI/USD would be much greater influenced. However price movement is rather normal. Idk what I get wrong: If there is actually demand to unlock USDC as collateral and leave the system, it would actually mean that there is demand to sell DAI for USDC or USD. In this mind example DAI/USD would fall below 1 (USD would become stronger against DAI) which it doesn\u2019t really do.  dai_usd977\u00d7885 58.7 KB  So do liquidations of DAI against crypto collateral (which are quite deflationary for DAI) and yield oriented capital flows (USD leaving to get yield on the treasury market) create a state of equilibrium right now? Did times change due to the high collateralization via other stables? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t want something like 2020 to happen again ;). I\u2019m simply asking myself what I\u2019m getting wrong. I\u2019d assume the following along the path if yields keep rising: More capital would leave the system and DAI would fall in value against the dollar. In order to counter that, Maker would have to raise saving rates to counter the depreciation against the dollar and defend its pegging. As rates for DAI would rise, this would also have severe implications for the crypto market. IMO the monetary tools of the FED must have implications on the market at some point, however I don\u2019t see it anywhere in the stats of DAI except in the falling supply. From a logic point of view I can\u2019t get another explanation. Even if we go back to the days of gold pegging during the financial crisis, where central banks had to hike rates to defend their gold standard against capital outflows, it was the same mechanism. Is the treasury movement still to low for something like that to happen with the DAI savings rate? Thx for your replies in advance. ",

Since it is a pegged stable, DAI hardly moves , although the 10y is at 3%. The more interesting number is the collateralization of the PSM module now. If it sinks to some point, Maker would raise rates, to counter it, right? Is there a number, you\u2019d be worried? Does it also depend on the speed of depletion? Is it programmed somewhere or decided via governance? ",

Once savings accounts are giving 1,2+%, I imagine there\u2019s no reason to hold dai if you can get that much more yield from a completely risk free and liquid bank account.  But you should still have some kind of demand from those who want to stay in the crypto world and are using dai for things like AMM.  Of course, if the fed wants to suck up all the liquidity out there, they can by going even higher.  It\u2019s kind of what you get for being a stablecoin linked to their currency\u2026  Anyway, this is why I think it\u2019s important that we have the ability to put what\u2019s in our PSMs in short term treasuries.  So that we can redirect their yield into our DSR and take away their power to influence Dai demand.  At high rates, you probably get even more demand for Dai if you can indirectly get people those high yields that are coming very soon. ",

There\u2019s a Parameter Proposal Group, and they put forth proposals that goes through governance to be approved.
