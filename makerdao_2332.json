                    "content": "At the moment MakerDao is the best \u201clending platform\u201d out there. You can get a loan with Ethereum as collateral at 0.00% interest, and with Bitcoin at 1.00%. Competition doesn\u2019t even come close: 4.50% - BlockFi; 11.90% - Nexo (5.90% if paid with their token); 6.26% - Celsius; 5.95% - Salt Lending. However, even considering that those who borrow through these platforms pay immensely more interest than with a loan on MakerDao, those platforms \u201cclaim\u201d to have originated loan volumes dozens of times larger than MakerDao. The difference between MakerDao and these others is not only the interest rate, but the awareness of the existence of the platform. Those private companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each month on marketing, and even considering that they have a worse product, they manage to have a critical mass of users. So I think that MakerDao should establish a long-term budget for marketing. There are many people who would use a loan with DAI, however, the technical barrier prevents it. So the creation of step-by-step guides could facilitate the entry of new users.  There are some services that I am aware of that sell marketing packages: https://cryptocoin.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/29m-PR-Marketing-Package-4.95k-1.pdf https://bitcoinprbuzz.com/services/ NOTE: I am not affiliated with them, and I have no interest in promoting them (it\u2019s just to give an idea of what\u2019s available).  Furthermore, there are many problems that would be solved through the increase of users, for example the PEG would be a minor problem if the DAI supply were 1 Billion instead of the only 100M, this because there would be much more liquidity on the system and the creation/redemption of a single CDP would have less impact.

For example, the fact that DAI is at $1.01 can be an advertising move to incentivize more people to take out a loan (hoping for a return to $1.00). You\u2019re also right for the \u201cBlack Thursday Event\u201d \u2026 I asked on the official Nexo telegram channel what are the advantages of using Nexo vs MakerDao, and here is the answer:  However, I also think that in the last month the protocol has improved a lot, and therefore I believe that MakerDao\u2019s voice should also be included in the public arena. In addition, that event attracted many new players, for example, I\u2019m the CEO of UgoliniCapital (a crypto fund), and we bought our first MKRs during the auction started to cover the deficit. We were attracted by this opportunity, not discouraged (however this is subjective). ",

First compensate the effected vault holders, at least with BlockFi or Nexo i know my money is SECURE on this side you cant even keep the protocol working properly!!! Who in their rite mind is going to take Maker DAO serious, nobody is locking up big money in Maker Dao with the chance of it being completely wiped out, Block Fi and NEXO have real capital that they are holding on loans for big companies and institutions because they have a model and it works and PEOPLE TRUST IT, who is going to trust Maker Dao after this? Nobody, unless vault holders have been made whole again and confidence is restored! ",
