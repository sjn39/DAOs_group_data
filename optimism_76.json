Our main product enables users to dollar cost average from any ERC20 into any ERC20 with their preferred period frequency without the user having to pay gas costs for each trade, while still being decentralized, open and traceable.Not only our protocol aligns with Optimism\u2019s general philosophy, but our users do too: DCA is considered to be a long term investment strategy, trying to get the best average entry price over time. In other words, being Optimistic about the future. From a technical standpoint as OP we aim to be completely scalable by design: Our costs will be the same if we execute 1 million trades or if we execute just one. Basically creating scalability at the app layer, on top of scalability on the execution layer (L2), on top of scalability on the consensus layer (L1). A little recap about our scalability data: https://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/15020361694288158873. Additionally, we consider our oracle infrastructure a public good since its open source and it builds (and hardens) upon Uniswap\u2019s V3 TWAPs and Chainlink. Equally important, we\u2019ve worked to improve lower the entry barrier for developers to use Uniswap\u2019s V3 TWAPs through their grants program. More info on this: https://twitter.com/mean_fi/status/1537854948398010374 Lastly, we\u2019ve shown our passion and compromise for the Optimism network by deploying our Beta version (December 8th of 2021, well before $OP token hunters show up) while onboarding new cohorts of users (via allow-listing Lobster DAOs\u2019 members, and several LATAM related POAPs) that didn\u2019t have other incentives to join the network at that time. How will the OP tokens be distributed?   Subsidies (45%) The main goal of this part of the distribution will be to incentivize the creation of DCA positions continuously. We aim to provide the possibility of a zero cost deposit by covering the  transaction fee for our users with certain base requirements as to avoid gaming the incentive system. Moreover, we would like to reimburse 25% of the swap fee (this is the percentage of the swap fee the protocol takes) in $OP as a distribution mechanism for real Optimism users.   Builders (30%) We know our trustless and open DCA primitive is just the tip of the iceberg and can be the base for new DeFi initiatives. That is why we want to create grants, bounties and incentives for builders and protocols to create new products, integrations and strategies while having our product be a core part of them.   Growth strategies and community engagement (20%) This is to help in the outreach of new community members (while maintaining and growing engagement of our current community) by creating and incentivizing behavior through trading competition, users quests, and more!   Early adopters (5%) We want to thank all genuine users created positions and used Mean Finance on Optimism in the most early stages.   Percentages may change a bit in the process of iterating and measuring impact. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? If conditions are met, users will be able to create long term DCA trades that will get their gas and fees cost paid (retroactively, since we have no on-chain mechanisms for that), basically getting near-to-zero cost on their trades. This is something we think will bring a lot of new liquidity and users to the platforms. Additionally our default market maker looks for liquidity on decentralized money legos already deployed on Optimism such as Uniswap and 0x, therefore increasing traded volume and liquidity providers\u2019 APY. Last but not least, we are also developing a product for DCA-ing with yield generated by other dapps. Meaning that users of this new product will need to lock their capital (to be lend, liquidity providing, etc.) in other Optimism deployed protocols, increasing TVL on the network. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? As Optimism we believe in having a long term vision for the ecosystem, and that is why we have focused on growing organically our community. Implemented incentives will continue in the same line of thought, searching for the balance between fair incentives and organic use of both Optimism and Mean Finance. Also, we\u2019ve got some products on our pipeline that will need users to lock capital in the network. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We anticipate that these incentives will be distributed over a 6-18 months time frame. How much will your project match in co-incentives? We currently don\u2019t have a token, so monetary incentives can\u2019t be matched. ",

I would see if this was mutual like you give grants to projects that integrate you and in return you do something for those projects. There is no clear information on this.   Growth strategies and community engagement (11.5%) - This seems to be for you to grow rather then as a airdrop or invective for user that may not already use Optimism to get on board.   Safety (30%) - This looks like you want Optimism to pay for your bug bounty, how does any of that drive adoption or usage?   Overall this proposal seems mainly for you to use funds to grow and develop out your project with little benefit in growing Optimism or providing value to the other projects in it. ",

Despite their traded volume, Mean Finance aims to allow users to DCA in a simple and seamless way. An L2 like Optimism should be a perfect fit for a Protocol like them. Safety allocation demands more explanations, but for the rest, I find plenty of value that such protocol may add to Optimism. ",

Just to share how our logic went about this:  Our biggest user base (by far) is Optimism. OP users might get hurt if a vulnerability is found (we still have an ongoing but bounty and audits tho).  Creating apathy on Optimism Maybe it doesn\u2019t increase Optimism value directly, but it aims to avoid any negative impact on the network.   Tokens would not be dumped if a vulnerability is not found, therefore locked capital does not affect directly $OP value.  There a few changes that I can think of: a) Reduce the % dedicated to Security, increase Builders %. b) Reduce the % dedicated to Security, reduce overall $OP tokens asked. c) Remove security completely, reduce overall $OP tokens asked. d) Keep it as is. Of course, personally I\u2019d like a, b or d. What do you guys think? @allera @OPUser @Justin Thanks everyone for taking the time for giving us feedback and helping improve the proposal  ",

We are a team of experienced builders creating novel, and decentralized products while having an Optimism-first approach. With the lack of experienced professional builders in the space I\u2019d urge any project to try to engage and get developers to commit to an Ethereum aligned network. But this is all my personal opinion, and not the team\u2019s. I just think is a good point to raise  Now, in terms of the distribution: - Builders: That is exactly what I meant to propose. Maybe (since I\u2019m not english native speaking) I was not clear enough when drafting the proposal. - Growth strategies and community engagement: Yes, its for us to grow (on Optimism). I don\u2019t see value on your counter-proposal. Airdropping has already been done. This is for growth, keeping community engaged (positive sentiment feedback loop) and user acquisition focused on Optimism. Additionally, our current smart contracts wouldn\u2019t allow us for liquidity mining, which we can also debate on \u201cif it adds real value, or just buys interest\u201d. - Safety: Added comment on the bottom of the post addressing what the logic was. Maybe my train-of-thought wasn\u2019t intuitive or the community simply doesn\u2019t agree, which is ok also. Again, I find a lot of value on your feedback so thanks for taking the time for reading our proposal and writing here anon. ",

I have been a purist when reviewing these proposals and have been focused narrowly on incentivizing usage and liquidity.  However, most of the proposals have components that do not incentivize usage and liquidity - so clearly it is acceptable to the community. The question for me is: how much is reasonable?  Safety + Builders + Early users  = 48.5%, too big of a % in my opinion.  My pragmatic advice would be to reduce or, better, eliminate the security % and allocate to subsidies.  Since DCA is really only possible on L2, then marketing activities that promote Mean\u2019s capabilities also promotes Optimism\u2019s capabilities - so i think it could make sense to also spend more on marketing as you proposed with the 11.5% that you already allocated there. As a user and fan of Mean Finance, I think that once you use it once you are going to use it a lot.  That\u2019s why i personally believe that the best use of funds is to spend 100% on incentivizing users to open their first position or first few positions.  I\u2019d encourage you not to do what Ricochet did and offer up n amount of tokens per day per stream - that clearly was used by mercenaries who didn\u2019t stick around.  But if people can learn about DCA and try it with a position or two - you are going to create users for life. This is all my personal opinion and my opinion only.  I appreciate everyone else\u2019s comments as well. ",

As a representative of DeFi LATAM and communities in the region, the majority spanish-speaking, Mean Finance is quite a popular protocol and even a reference when talking about Optimism here. It\u2019s natural because the community follow its progress from its very early stages, as mentioned in the proposal. As DCA protocol is a very genuine and convenient case at this stage. In fact, I shared some ideas with team before the publication of the proposal, such as subsidies, understanding that this would arouse even more interest, knowing the needs of the users. Then, I\u2019m OK with supporting the proposal, I agree with the feedback that others exposed and improvements made to it, optimistic that it will attract another class of user not only interested in DeFi, but ppl also thinking of acquiring long-term exposure in their favorite assets, through this and future (?) other strategies.

Proposal to stop Phase 0 Projects to submit new proposal in Phase 1 \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute the token while other does not. Here is an excellent summary by @MinimalGravitas .  Phase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token between Phase 0 projects. Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.

I believe DCA is one of the most effective strategies and do it myself outside of crypto too and I find it cool to see a crypto project geared towards it. And agree that DCA + L2 like optimism are a match made in heaven. Good distribution The team seems to be open to feedback, judging by what I read in this post, and adjusted the proposal already.

While the metrics/usage is early, I want to support Optimism\u2019s ecosystem growth in Latam (it\u2019s not a region for crypto adoption I have expertise on) and I recognize the early set of users might be retail and not necessarily higher volume. As I commented above, I am a fan of enabling easy dollar cost averaging for users so this positive use case plus considering further adoption of Optimism in Latam and a reasonable token amount requested is something I can get comfortable with.

Seems as if you deployed on Optimism at first in December and have migrated to full deployment with 18 pairs. Am I right in that understanding? Sounds like you were close to hitting the Phase 0 requirements but were a bit below due to TVL. Using this criteria projects with $1,000,000 TVL were entitled to 300,000 OP. Mean\u2019s TVL seems to be around half of this - $590,042 as of 7/7. Would it be fair to use this initial-phase framework to better understand a fair amount of OP? If so, it seems a more appropriate and proportional ask would be 177,000 OP. This is 59% of the 1,000,000 TVL allocation. ",
