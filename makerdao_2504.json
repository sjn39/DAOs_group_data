When the price rises to $50 then only whales will vote to push their specific agenda. We have to minimize governance and move to L2. ",

Yes, I would expect us to release this within 3 months. Re: Knowing current Maker developments Cool, thanks for sharing that link, I\u2019ll look into how we can better communicate the development pipeline while managing release expectations (which is the really challenging aspect as the ecosystem develops and new initiatives find their way into the roadmap). Re: Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions Agree! We are at the very early investigative stages of exploring Layer 2 solutions for Polling\u2026which if successful then I imagine we will scale a solution to support executive voting too. So, again, early stages on this but L2 solutions are a prime fit for such a use case. ",
