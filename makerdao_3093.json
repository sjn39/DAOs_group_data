We see this with the ETH-B vault type that got proposed in July, implemented in October, reduced its DC by 50% in November because of inactivity and shortly after got IAM with a line of 50 MM and since then provides a good portion of the DAI-minted-from-ETH. This Signal Request is about to find out the feelings of the community to start something similar with WBTC: a new Vault-type WBTC-B that allows for higher leverage with a lower LR a higher SF.  Pros  more DAI in circulation more fees collected   Cons  a lower LR creates a bigger exposure WBTC volatility   Should we add WBTC-B as a vault option?       Yes     No (please explain in the comments)     Abstain       0 voters      How high should be the Stability Fee?

I think the DAO is still trying to understand the risk around WBTC, but long story short it could carry significant slippage risks especially considering that your exposure is in the $100MM ballpark. IMO the exposure should be left alone for the time being. There are also recently added BTC leveraging options to mitigate dc problems. The particulars would need  investigation based on what the community decides on but my gut feeling is the current exposure is risk enough until that investigation is done. ",

You proposed this because you think it is good for our system, and ultimately I agree with that, I just didn\u2019t like that it went straight to a signal request. Sorry for being so careless with my words, I appreciate you and all your contributions. I guess my frustration came from sitting on all the calls with B.Protocol, because this entire time they have been asking how to move their proposal forward, and were advised against creating a signal request so they went with an informal poll instead. I don\u2019t like that this signal request gives the possibility of creating a vault with extremely similar CF parameters on the same asset in a quicker fashion.     ultraschuppi:  Poll will run until January 7th and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary   To me, this accelerated timeline has a real possibility to beat B.Protocol to the punch and I don\u2019t think that is fair. I think this should be considered a completing proposal, as otherwise the community will likely pass this one and all the work B.Protocol has done with rounding support will be a waste. I\u2019m admittedly curious if others agree with this assesment, or if my bias for the B.Protocol idea is causing me to throw up road blocks where there shouldn\u2019t be any. Either way, it\u2019s clear that a more leveraged WBTC offering is desired by the community, so I think the discussion should center around how we do that safely. To me, B.Protocol\u2019s idea makes a lot of sense from a risk management prospective as we would have committed liquidators, with a sizable backstop already deposited into our system. Currently, I\u2019m not convinced we should be rolling out more leveraged options on our own platform without Liquidations 2.0 in place. ",

So to comment a little on this, and on this process in general. I advised the B Protocol folks to take the more involved route because what they are proposing reflects the introduction of something which is a new class of change versus something that is a new instance of a change (I\u2019m borrowing from object oriented development terms here, for reference.) Basically, we have used the IAM for ETH-B, and we have used WBTC as collateral previously. Implementing a WBTC-B vault-type with the DC-IAM controlling debt ceiling represents a recombination of things the DAO has already done. This is contrasted with the B Protocol proposal that involves creating a new liquidation methodology which may allow for more efficient parameters as part of the risk is balanced by more efficient liquidations (something we\u2019ve not attempted before.) In terms of where this goes from here, I\u2019m happy to allow it on-chain for a poll (assuming the signal ends positively), with the understanding that this will result in the WBTC-B vault-type being added to the collateral prioritisation sheet to be prioritised against other collateral types and implemented when the mandated actors feel it is worthwhile to do so.

By lowering the average CR in the system you are increasing the risk for all stakeholders including MTH, dai holders, vault owners, integrated parties, RWA guys, etc. Calculated risk premium is just a calculated number, it doesnt actually mean that if SF=RP, this vault type is somehow risk free for Maker. Vaults with low CR (near LR), that are not additionally protected by some unwinding mechanism/online 24/7 are \u201cfree riding\u201d on the back of other highly collateralized vaults. Liquidation penalty exists to motivate vaults to not be liquidated, not to make revenue primarily. People trust in dai because it is over-collateralized enough, that even in some bad event, they can expect dai~usd. Imo, we must long for decreasing the risk in MCD over time (aim for high average CR in the protocol), not increase the risk for the sake of small victories along the way. I like the Global CR in UMA, we could make a ETH-C with GCR vault type and see what our high CR ETH users prefer (most important users). Regarding the B Protocol in low LR perspective - it does not change things. I highly doubt there would be a high amount of dai committed for liquidations. We are in a high yield environment, where one can achieve insane yield on dai. Also, dai price is not a function of total dai supply, but dai allocated to relevant markets; Curve, other AMMs. Thus, if we would achieve a sustainable vault type with significantly lower LR, it would only be possible due to large amounts of dai being allocated to B Protocol. But this also means that dai is not allocated to Curve and is thus not doing anything in regards to price premium. So we could just keep the current CR, print less dai, but also need to commit zero dai for liquidations in B Prot. in order for this to be financially sound. I would prefer the latter, seems a better option for the majority of Maker stakeholders. I also want to say that if some project shows interest in forum/collateral calls, it doesnt mean anything yet. They actually need to bring value/synergies with Maker, value which will clearly offset any additional risks/complexities/unwanted things etc. ",
