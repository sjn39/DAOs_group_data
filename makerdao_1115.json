The Endgame Plan is a long term vision and roadmap with a fully defined, immutable steady state as its end goal. It is also comprehensive governance overhaul that is aimed to narrowing the focus of Maker\u2019s core governance and simplifying it to the point where MKR holders can realistically keep up, while at the same time tapping into the incredible value that\u2019s been produced in the Core Units and the high quality talent that exists in the workforce, but that is right now being held back by the complexity and suboptimal structure. The plan is based around the concept of \u201cMetaDAOs\u201d, which are an evolution of the concept of \u201cSubDAOs\u201d or \u201cDAO Pods\u201d which are already well established concepts in DAOs and DeFi and the DAO Tools fields. Basically smaller and specialized DAOs that are connected to a main \u201cmothership DAO\u201d (Maker in this case) through shared tokenomics, incentives and/or infrastructure. On the call I will be making the case that MetaDAOs are a groundbreaking and incredibly powerful silver bullet that can be used to solve almost all of the problems we are facing right now, and in many cases allow us to get the best of both worlds in many of the trade offs we are facing. At the same time they are extremely simple, cheap and low risk to create as we already have all of the necessary prerequisites in place, and their instant value potential is significant because we have so much hidden value in the core units that is right now buried in the complexity, but that we can unearth using this simple method. Finally the plan is includes some very significant short term upsides for growth and MKR value accrual, and many other benefits.
