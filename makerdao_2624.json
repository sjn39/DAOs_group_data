If the value falls, does the MakerDAO system deploys the auction for these collaterals so that some auction vault has to buy it and return Dai to the system?

Does that make sense? 53:25 - Akash: Since ArCoin is a low-yielding product, what would be an acceptable stability fee for most users? What is the upper bound on the stability fee? 56:45 - Akash: If the Keeper ends up buying this ArCoin through an auction/liquidation, what\u2019s the process to redeem and get the treasuries and liquidate that? 57:10 - Akash: Could the same concept be extended to other collateral types besides US treasuries? 1:01:30 - Akash: Can the whole model be extended to other assets like ETFs or other securities that could be bundled up in this form? 1:02:20 - Akash: Anyone in the world can apply for KYC to buy or sell this ArCoin, right?
