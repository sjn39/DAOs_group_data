I\u2019m also launching a crypto hedge fund. I\u2019m surprised by the lack of topics in the forum and also how slowly topics move even in a protocol as prominent as MakerDAO. I know it\u2019s hard to get people to participate but I remember it being more busy and lively around here last year. Has it just been winnowed down to whales at this point? ",
