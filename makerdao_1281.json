This Signal Request will run until Monday, June 27, 2022 and end at 21:00 UTC.  Background The Signal Request titled \u201cDeploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn\u201d was published on Thursday, May 26, 2022. It proposed to MKR token owners if the DssKiln Module should be used to run a 3-month trial of repurchasing MKR in the open market. These are the proposed parameters:  3M DAI will be vested from the Surplus Buffer to the deployed contract for the duration of 3 months This configuration would result in roughly 33.33k DAI  being burned daily (limited by the vesting schedule) Includes further development and financing of the formal audit of DssKiln which will be paid by PECU form their existing budget. The Oversight Group will consist of Risk CU and Protocol Engineering CU, performance reporting will be conducted no less than on a monthly basis. General operation parameters   sell the token to be deposited into DssKiln and sold - [DAI]  buy the token to be bought in exchange for the sold token - [MKR]  hop duration specified in seconds. It represents a minimum number of seconds that must pass before the lot can be sold - [38880 seconds or 10.8 hours]  lot the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per hop - [30k DAI]   Specific operation parameters: to be published by Risk CU and Protocol Engineering CU once the code required is fully developed and all operation-specific parameters are defined.   The Outcome of the Signal Request and on-chain Poll ID: 827 Signal Request:  \u201d Do you support the proposed solution explained above, including (i) proposed operation methodology (ii) Proposed General & Specific (to be decided by Risk CU and PECU) DssKiln operation parameters, (iii) financing and further required development of DssKiln formal audit with the surplus buffer facilitated by PECU?\u201d  44% Yes ballots 33% Abstain ballots 23% No ballots  On-chain Poll ID 827 Results: \u201d Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022\u201d  47,724 MKR Voted Yes  9,054 MKR Voted No  6,000 MKR Voted Abstain    Motivating Community Reasons To Repeal  We currently have MKR token owners that believe the Signal Request and on-chain Vote was rushed, and MIP74 has yet to be enacted. We have some MKR token owners who believe this proposal \u201csneaked in through the cracks\u201d, and MKR token owners and Delegates need to be more diligent. When this Signal Request was made, the Maker Community was not properly informed that it could possibly be exposed to Counterparty Risk (Celsius, Nexo, etc.) and it should be preserving Cash, not burning. Some MKR token owners believe that burning MKR during a down-cycle is unconventional and MakerDAO should be saving every Conti, every DAI earned during a turbulent cycle.  Shadow Delegate 0x749 was not able to vote as they were in the middle of setting up their Delegate Platform, and re-delegating their self-owned MKR.  Recognized Delegate @Hasu was on vacation, as @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and @Recognized-Delegates have yet to design an alternative plan for taking time-off from Delegate Voting. We have MKR token Owners who prefer a Burn at a much lower daily capacity  and duration (Perhaps less DAI over the next 3-months, or 12-months?)  This trial along with MIP74 can be opine by some as an initiative for expanding the scope of the Maker Core into becoming an \u201cactive trader\u201d assuming MIP74 is enacted.

                    "content": "@flipflopflapdelegate thank you for posting this Signal. The following is a summary of the governance impacts of this proposal from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective, in the interests of providing clarity around this proposal:  This is a valid Signal Request, although the duration could perhaps be a bit longer, I don\u2019t think that should invalidate this proposal. This Signal seeks to repeal this vote in its entirety. As currently written, this includes the approval for auditing and deploying DssKiln as well as the proposed burn of 3 million DAI. If approved by > 50% of non-abstain votes, this proposal will be eligible for an on-chain poll on 2022-07-04, which will run for three days. This will be a binary poll with Yes, No, and Abstain as the only options. If the on-chain poll is successful, GovAlpha will not permit the previously approved proposal to proceed to an executive vote. I have assigned this a high-impact tag as it seeks to override a previously approved on-chain vote. As it has been posted by a Recognized Delegate, this proposal is eligible for off-chain incentives if approved by Maker Governance.   Tagging relevant actors that this proposal affects for visibility (this is a non-exhaustive list, please tag other people who you think may be interested or affected by this proposal): @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @Risk-Core-Unit @Protocol-Engineering @rune @Recognized-Delegates @strat-fin-core-unit @aburban90 ",

Should this poll pass, the natural next step for those in favor of the original proposal will be to make a new SR to repeal the repeal. In fact what is stopping anyone from doing that even before this SR is concluded? I hope the community can see how quickly this becomes silly. There was nothing in this proposal to put it apart from other proposals, neither were there less time or more proposals than at other times in governance. This is just another oportunistic stab by those that do not agree that the burn should ever be back on the table. If a single week is all it takes to change direction I feel sorry for Governance that will have to deal with repeating SRs every week going forward. As to the motivations that are listed:     flipflopflapdelegate:  We currently have MKR token owners that believe the Signal Request and on-chain Vote was rushed, and MIP74 has yet to be enacted.   This proposal has been on the forum for weeks before going on-chain giving ample time to give feedback for anyone interested.     flipflopflapdelegate:  We have some MKR token owners who believe this proposal \u201csneaked in through the cracks\u201d, and MKR token owners and Delegates need to be more diligent.   There is nothing special in this proposal compared to other proposals in this regard. Delegates are all required to be diligent through the code of conduct.     flipflopflapdelegate:  When this Signal Request was made, the Maker Community was not properly informed that it could possibly be exposed to Counterparty Risk (Celsius, Nexo, etc.) and it should be preserving Cash, not burning.   How on earth is it possible to be confused about the intention of the proposal when it litterally has \u201cressurect the burn\u201d in its title?     flipflopflapdelegate:  Shadow Delegate 0x749 was not able to vote as they were in the middle of setting up their Delegate Platform, and re-delegating their self-owned MKR.   Yet somehow the same shadow delegate was able to vote on other polls.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Recognized Delegate @Hasu was on vacation, as @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and @Recognized-Delegates have yet to design an alternative plan for taking time-off from Delegate Voting.   This really opens a can of worms. I\u2019m on vacation right now yet I still find a way to monitor what is going on. On the other hand I guess I better start a SR to repeal all votes that went through on Monday since I was on vacation and Gov-Alpha didn\u2019t do my work for me.     flipflopflapdelegate:  We have MKR token Owners who prefer a Burn at a much lower daily capacity and duration (Perhaps less DAI over the next 3-months, or 12-months?)   This can easily be handled by doing a SR to change the parameters for a long er duration. The proposal is set to last for 3 months. Hardly an urgent matter. And it would be much more in line with how we usually modify proposals.     flipflopflapdelegate:  This trial along with MIP74 can be opine by some as an initiative for expanding the scope of the Maker Core into becoming an \u201cactive trader\u201d assuming MIP74 is enacted.   These concerns were known at the time of voting. ",

When this Signal Request was made, the Maker Community was not properly informed that it could possibly be exposed to Counterparty Risk (Celsius, Nexo, etc.) and it should be preserving Cash, not burning. Some MKR token owners believe that burning MKR during a down-cycle is unconventional and MakerDAO should be saving every Conti, every DAI earned during a turbulent cycle.    While I am reasonably ambivalent about the substance of the deployment, it does seem like there are some pretty serious procedural issues that could be pointed out here. None of the above points seem like legitimate reasons to repeal the earlier vote and they could set a tricky precedent. (Edit: I see @JustinCase has posted at the same time and made similar arguments: I agree with his comments).   Anyone who disagrees with a particular vote could opine that \u201cMKR tokenholders need to be more diligent\u201d - given that the earlier vote was procedurally sound, this reason could be supplied for essentially any governance decision.   I\u2019m not sure what you mean @flipflopflapdelegate by the statement that the \u201cthe Maker Community was not properly informed\u201d and that \u201cit should be preserving cash, not burning\u201d. While I\u2019ve been vocal in advocating for some of the arguments against the burn in the past, isn\u2019t the decision to burn rather than preserve cash a legitimate decision for the community to make? There isn\u2019t an \u2018objective\u2019 correct answer.   Yes, while some MKR tokenholders believe that burning MKR during a down-cycle is unconventional, many others think that it should be a priority for the protocol - and the letter group won the earlier vote! Again, this argument could be made to roll back any governance decision, just by saying \u201cwell, another group of MKR holders thinks differently.\u201d   If a large MKR whale wants to overturn an earlier decision, per @Patrick_J\u2019s post that\u2019s a perfectly legitimate governance option. But let\u2019s not pretend that there are many other  \u201ccommunity reasons to repeal\u201d, especially if those risk setting a precedent for future governance decisions to be overturned in a laissez-faire manner.

This isn\u2019t an emergency because even if enacted it would have been buying 33K DAI worth of MKR a day  Personally I would like to adjust the conditions on the buyback (like this only buys if the MKR price is below a certain $$/MKR) and to reconsider whether to formally burn vs. just taking the MKR and putting it up with the remaining DAI in a MKR-DAI v3 position once say about 1.5M of the DAI has purchased MKR.    But that is about all I would want to change at this point. Goal here is to at least try and test such a mechanism and if governance wants to revisit this simply do a NEW poll not a poll to REPEAL a previously passed one.   Like if this was an executed executive that would be the correct path forward.  Maker governance for all its good or ills always MOVES forward and overwrites old proposals with new ones.   Make a new signal request regarding pausing the buying here and/or returning the funds but repealing a previously passed proposal sorry am a NO here just on principle and process. Now if this was some sort of emergency well then doing an emergency poll and executive would be reasonable. ",

Re: Sybil resistance, we monitor Signal Requests for signs of Sybil attacks and will intervene when necessary. This is also aided by restricting Signals to trust_level_2 forum members, this prevents new accounts from being created to brigade Signals such as this. Note that GovAlpha did not post this proposal and weren\u2019t consulted before it was posted, we are responding to the proposal as written to inform voters. We can discuss non-signal alternatives if requested/required. @MakerMan GovAlpha would be delighted to discuss alternative options if asked - after all, our mandate requires us to seek to build consensus. In fact, we were slightly disappointed that nobody attended our office hours yesterday to discuss this very issue. The above posts are neither an endorsement nor a rebuttal of this proposal. It describes our response to the SR as posted. If the author of the proposal wants to solicit feedback and make changes, that is up to them. ",

There is a method for bringing an item to vote without having to poll community sentiment.

Also seems worth mentioning that we create and maintain these systems to make sure the \u201cfront door\u201d to governance remains as accessible as possible. At the end of the day, the protocol is a series of smart contracts, it requires no governance process for new spells to be submitted. What we are building here is a social layer to make sure MKR holders can be informed about votes and their repercussions before being asked to place their MKR in support. Always up for jamming on new governance designs, but having a fast track to the voting portal that is not based on MKR weight is pretty important for the community. By allowing ideas to be debated and considered before they are voted on we give the chance to inspire true DAO work, the ability to build something permissionlessly and see if the community would like to incorporate it. This is a huge positive for the community, even if it does lead to occasionally skirmishes like this. ",

Having these polls encourages discussion and debate so we can uncover the issues with potential changes before they are put up to vote. Doesn\u2019t always work, but adds a layer of protection to large MKR holders thinking something is a good idea and going straight to onchain polling with it. In the signal route, we have a short timeframe but with heavily contested points of view and public votes for encouraging discussions and deeper discourse. With MIPs, it\u2019s a longer process so that people have time to comment on it before going to vote. ",
