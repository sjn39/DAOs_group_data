The basic idea is that each month there are at least 4-6 public calls that need documentation/summaries. We place two people on each call to cover live notes as comprehensively as possible. Each person attends the live call, and then cleans up their sections after the call with the aide of the recording once it\u2019s posted on youtube later that day. We aim for 2-day turn around time for this part of the process. ",
