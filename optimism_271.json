I enjoyed both being a committee member and being a proposer at the same time as it gave me a full picture of how this worked and where improvements might go. Time wasted It blows my mind to see so many talented people gathered for such a good cause to be pulled into meaningless and repeating conversations. If you take only (Regular badge on Optimism Collective) you have the 18 most active readers. There you can find Karl, Kelvin, Katie, Polynya, and more. If you add up some of the strong delegates who give feedback and show up to the community call you have Lefteris or Linda Xie. You can quickly understand this is not people with free time. And yet here they are trying to push this forward. I yearn for a 20 min talk with any of them to learn all the things they have and I struggle seeing how do they have to repeat themselves over and over until they leave the conversations. Lack of Optimism Foundation Involvement This is crystal clear, if the foundation is going to hold the last word, then we need someone from inside representing the foundation and at least saying something like \u201cthis is being analyzed by the foundation you will have an answer in 24hs\u201d We cannot have 48hs of unstoppable harassment over a committee member without any word from the foundation. I\u2019m not asking for fast answers I know they have a lot on their plate, but at least an acknowledgment to avoid confrontation. And if for that they need more people I\u2019m all in to vote for an $OP fund. By the way, I love the work the foundation is doing so far, this is just improvements on the amazing job they are doing already. About my vote on cycle 8 I abstained from EthernautDAO proposal as I am the proposer and I wanted the rest of the community to decide, I\u2019m sorry if those who delegated to me felt misrepresented we passed with 96%. For all other proposals, I followed the respective elected Committee recommendation. When the committee recommended DYOR like Velo and Messari I did. I voted Yes for Massari as I believe they come with a different proposal. I would love to have more clarity about the grant but at least the idea is new and I want to know the metrics that come from it. I voted no for Velo I don\u2019t think the second proposal repeating the first one makes much sense. (This applies to Gov and Partners fund). At the same time, the amount asked should be half of the first one and not more. This is a DeFi protocol, not a public good and they are profit-oriented, the project itself must consider a market acquisition of OP tokens if they need more to be sustainable and integrate this own demand in its own profit formula. Otherwise, they are just leveraging their own project with $OP.  If other DeFi projects want to use Velo as their main liquidity stream and they need $OP for the bribes etc then those projects should be asking for the tokens and not Velo. ",

The feedback is here: Feedback 1, Feedback 2, Feedback 3 As a final thought, we don\u2019t have the perfect system to move governance forward but at least Optimism it\u2019s trying to get better every season. Iteration, reflection, and tryouts are the best tools we have and I\u2019ll keep supporting these radical governance changes with an optimistic mindset. I voted yes for the Protocol delegation program. These protocols are the core contributors to the Optimism ecosystem and without them we have nothing. It is obtuse to think they shouldn\u2019t have a voice in their own space, native or not, we are all here to promote Optimism use. I hope to see more of these delegation programs to smaller projects too in the future. ",

I\u2019m surprised by how welcoming they are when you ask questions and you want to learn more about them. Bethoven and Kwenta are in the top 20 of optimism usage and they should have a say in this governance: Optimism Project Usage - Custom Period Code4arena It\u2019s good to see an audit project getting involved in governance. They have an innovative product and most of their projects are in optimism. I think it is also time to give security researchers representation in this governance and they were the only ones applying. Agora, they have been selected to deploy a new user interphase for Optimism governance, so most of the token house decisions will go directly into their product and this is the reason I believe they need to have a voice in this process.

He helped EthernautDAO in many ways and never asked for anything in return. His public goods mindset it\u2019s deep inside him long before there was any sort of personal benefit and he has been following one of the most complex DeFi protocols in the space since I know him. A great contribution to the Growth Council. @Michael: A no-brainer, he has hosted most of the community calls, has a great experience and it\u2019s innovative when it comes to communication, even made a youtube vid about himself for the reviewer\u2019s nomination and maybe, pioneering on how we should present ourselves in the future. @katie: She\u2019s been here before anyone, the first community call host, has deep experience in governance long before Op collective, outstanding feedback giver. She has a positive work frame and every project she intervenes ends up being better. I\u2019m very happy to root for her. ",

It\u2019s not easy to find people willing to commit their time to the collective and all candidates here have worked a lot: @OPUser, look at that summary with 8 days of reading time on the forum: Profile - OPUser - Optimism Collective. I have to say that summary is impressive and it shows a commitment way beyond any other candidate on this council. Positive feedback giver, I got contradicted by him many times and he has never been disrespectful. Worked with him on the DeFi Committee, well organized and willing to help anyone. I hope he can make it! @jackanorak, another impressive summary, Profile - jackanorak - Optimism Collective. He\u2019s been always in the front when it comes to ideas, the first to call for a rethinking of OP grants given we were giving too many tokens. The first one is to start a deep analysis of how distributions are going since they started. He is deeply involved with an Optimism native protocol from the beginning and the debates between him and OpUser are the most educational content you can find on this forum. Dhannte, this is the first time I vote for myself. I\u2019ve been against this until someone made me realize all the delegation I have comes from people who trust me and that will vote for me if they had to do it themselves. ",
