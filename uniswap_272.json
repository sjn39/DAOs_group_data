Many people have become homeless, and this is not something that will pass soon. The numbers will increase further! This is an urgent priority process and it would be helpful to act quickly on issues such as forum discussion and temperature analysis.  Outside of the 7 day DAO voting Solution Considering this difficult situation that the Turkish people are going through, I demand that 1.4M USD worth of UNI tokens be transferred to the Ahbap foundation\u2019s Ethereum address with DAO voting! Ahbap foundation - was founded by Haluk Levent. Non profit Provides support to disaster victims in the earthquake area! Why Uniswap support to Turkiye earthquake There are 8 million crypto traders in Turkiye.  If Uniswap shows its support in this difficult time, the Turkish ecosystem will not forget this support.  Turkish traders will try to support this vote by purchasing UNI tokens. Our country trader will then show their support for the UNI token with HODL. Layer 1 solutions and crypto influencers and centralized exchanges have provided massive amounts of monetary support to Turkiye. This time, the support of leading DEX organization Uniswap is needed to provide necessary humanitarian supplies to people in the disaster area. Uniswap is a decentralized organization that can provide and pioneer this within On-chain DAOs with 2.3 B treasury.
