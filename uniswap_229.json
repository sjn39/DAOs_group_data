As a project supporting Uniswap we thought it would be useful to provide a weekly recap of recent governance activity in the Uniswap community. Unlike the UNI Letter (which stopped shipping in May), this recap will focus exclusively on governance, similar to our coverage of Optimism governance. We believe this will be useful for delegates and voters due to the sometimes rapid pace of governance news and updates. When appropriate we\u2019ll also note a few specific areas for action on timely subjects. Within our weekly recap, we\u2019ll provide a look back at:  Proposals Governance changes Impactful operating suggestions, and Critical governance-related discussions across Discourse, Twitter, and Discord  The first recap will be posted today. We\u2019d love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you might have. Feel free to DM to set up a time to chat! ",

See below to find out about all that\u2019s percolating.  Proposals Proposal discussions:   Fund Uniswap DAO community operations through loans on Fringe Finance. This proposal offers the DAO the opportunity to open a line of credit with Fringe and receive up to ~$49m in USDC, which can be used at the DAO\u2019s discretion. This would be possible since UNI is already a collateral asset on Fringe, which has set the loan-to-value at 49%. The (floating) interest rate is currently 7.62% per year.

Proposals [RFC]: Community Governance Process Changes. @devinwalsh from the Uniswap Foundation restarts a conversation about adjusting the Uniswap governance process, primarily to \u201creduce overhead\u201d and \u201cenhance off-chain signaling.\u201d The main changes are: replace the first Snapshot poll (a temp-check, as below for example) with a request-for-comment (RFC) post in the forum (such as this very one); and increase the quorum to 5M UNI for the remaining Snapshot (the \u201cconsensus check\u201d). The intention to formalize a process for future changes to off-chain governance components is also expressed. A Snapshot for this proposal will be posted on December 12.  Leave your comments on the proposed process changes. [Temperature Check]: Deploy Uniswap V3 on Scroll. This proposal to deploy on Scroll, a \u201cnative zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum,\u201d was just posted to the forums this morning. The Snapshot is set to go live on December 1. [Temperature Check]: Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum. Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum do not have native access on-chain Uniswap governance, meaning that governance decisions must passed along from Ethereum to other chains via a messaging system. With this proposal, @bharat_eth suggests a fix for the currently \u201cmis-configured\u201d method of cross-chain communication with Uniswap\u2019s Arbitrum deployment. [Consensus Check]: Deploy Uniswap V3 to Boba Network. This proposal passed on November 24 with 78% voting in favor. In their considered dissent, @GFXlabs suggest that it might be time \u201cto set up a framework/checklist for future Uniswap v3 deployments\u201d to make sure upsides and downsides are fully taken into account by the community.  In the Forums Delegate platforms. @mhonkasalo updates their voting record, as does FranklinDAO (@pennblockchain).  In Discord Introduce yourself! When and how did you get into web3?  On Twitter Let\u2019s play a game, with Uniswap Labs and @Wordcelllabs. A quick summary of Uniswap governance this past week. Did you know there\u2019s a Uniswap governance bot?

As you consider each, also take some time to read through FranklinDAO\u2019s recently posted (and excellent) \u201cDeep Dive\u201d on Uniswap\u2019s governance. Update on the \u201cfee switch\u201d discussion: After constructive feedback, @Leighton writes about shifting the approach and creating a legal entity before proceeding to a proposal. This will take several weeks. In the meantime, it is good to see that \u201cthe simple posting and planning for the vote also generated a high level of engagement from new and existing stakeholders.\u201d  Proposals [On-chain] Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum. This proposal suggests a fix for the currently \u201cmis-configured\u201d method of cross-chain communication with Uniswap\u2019s Arbitrum deployment. [On-chain] Deploy Uniswap V3 to Boba Network. Boba is a multi-chain L2 already deployed on Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. [Temp-check] Community Governance Process Changes. Vote here on this important proposal if you haven\u2019t already. And see here the explanation by GFX Labs of a slightly different approach that would enable on-chain (instead of off-chain) polling. [RFC] Phase 2 - Optimism-Uniswap Protocol Liquidity Mining Program. The Foundation is seeking input into the second phase, \u201cwhere 100k $OP will be disbursed over 3 weeks time.\u201d  In the Forums Uniswap v3 on BSC. @GFXlabs post their thoughts on the idea. Delegate platform. FranklinDAO (@pennlockchan) update their voting history. Protocol Guild. @trent provides an update on the \u201cnew public goods funding mechanism that was launched with your backing\u201d six months ago.  In Discord You can hold any amount of UNI and vote, even zero (with delegation). Would anonymous proposal feedback be useful in Uniswap?  On Twitter Phase 1 of the Uniswap-Optimism liquidity mining program is \u201cin the books.\u201d Devin Walsh was on the Cross-chain Examination podcast.
