                    "content": "Project Name: rotki Author Name: Lefteris Karapetsas Number of OP tokens requested: 190770 (See the budget - work outline section.) L2 Recipient Address: 0x9531C059098e3d194fF87FebB587aB07B30B1306 Relevant Usage Metrics:  Over 10k users, 146k downloads, 88 code contributors \u2026 birds love us! Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): One of the stated intentions of Optimism is to fund public goods. rotki is a public good, as it\u2019s the only opensource portfolio tracker + accounting tool for crypto that protects your privacy and lets you own your data. rotki at the moment does not support optimism in any way or form. We want to change this and would like to support optimism to the same extent as we support ethereum mainnet portfolio tracking, human readable transactions and PnL report. This will be of great benefit to all optimism users as they will finally have a privacy-first, local-first solution for portfolio tracking and accounting. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):  How will the OP tokens be distributed?  100% development work of the opensource software. See the budget - work outline section.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  It will incentivize usage since users will now have an opensource solution for portfolio tracking and accounting and will be able to benefit from the human readable transactions decoding of rotki also in optimism and have PnL analysis of optimism defi activity and not just mainnet. As a bonus other optimism projects can check our code and our work and incorporate whatever they need in their project (so long as they respect our opensource license \u2013 AGPLv3).  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  My favorite question. Because rotki is not a freaking ponzi. We are a useful local application that solves a problem. All our users use us because we are of use to them and they stay because they love us.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Since this is for development work we would sell them to cover expenses, but only on a need to pay-basis. We would also be totally fine if the tokens were given to us in batches after completing milestones but in that case the token amount would have to be adjusted for the $ value of work done.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  Our project has no token or any other ability to provide co-incentives.  Budget proposal \u2013 Work outline In this section I would like to give a detailed budget spending proposal as we are asking the tokens for development and the optimism community should know how they are going to be spent and why. We are going to be using $ value here. We assume a weekly dev salary of $2,084. All these estimates also include a 40% markup on top for any extra work we may need to do, research but most importantly all other expenses these will incur for us such as taxes. rotki is incorporated in Germany and pays taxes there.  Architectural work to properly support EVM based chains like optimism Backend: 2 devs 4 weeks Total: $23,341  Implement address token + portfolio tracking for optimism in rotki\u2019s backend Backend: 2 devs 2 weeks Frontend: 1 dev 2 weeks Total: $17,506  Implement transaction decoder system for optimism and some sample decoders for biggest optimism defi protocols Backend 2 devs, 4 weeks Frontend: 1 dev, 3 weeks Total: $32,094  Implement pnl analysis + report for optimism Backend: 2 devs 3 weeks Frontend: 1 dev 3 weeks Total: $26,259  Total 23341 + 17506 + 32094 + 26259 = $99,200 With an $OP price of $0.52 (time of this post) then this would mean 190,770 $OP tokens.  Relevant info rotki github: GitHub - rotki/rotki: A portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting application that protects your privacy rotki discord: (has captcha verification \u2013 so have DMs open): Rotki rotki twitter: https://twitter.com/rotkiapp  Final remarks  This proposal is only for the initial development and specifically for what is outlined in the budget proposal. Further support, bugfixes, and development/upgrade of relevant future is not included. We will naturally support rotki further and help users but we will not be under any special obligation after the initial development is done. This is not an SLA agreement between optimism and rotki. We reserve the right to request for more funds if the OP prices skews too low and no longer meets the budget requirements or if our estimates were way way off. We also reserve the right for further optimism related rotki funding proposals in the future assuming this one goes well and the users of optimism appreciate our work!  ",

Also there are many portfolio tracker and account tools apps so how will yours be any different to the more well known ones?   The code is opensource and thus a public good. The difference between the more well known portfolio trackers in a TL;DR are:  rotki is the only opensource one. All others are closed source rotki is the only local one. All other are centralized SaaS so your data are all stored in centralized servers. rotki is the only privacy focused one. All other keep your data in their centralized servers and god knows what they do with it.   Another problem I have is that the prices and timelines you have quoted seem to be exaggerated,  That\u2019s simply false. The timelines are optimistic. I could have given 2x the time but want us to try to finish it faster and not spend too much money on this as it\u2019s an application for funding and want to respect the optimism community if they choose to give us this grant and not overcharge. The prices are european senior dev salaries. If I went with American they would be roughly 2x. But you are lucky we are based in Europe  ",

                    "content": "First I want to clarify that this is a personal opinion and not of the communities in which I am an active participant and contributor. Defi LATAM and OptimismESP During these days in the Defi LATAM community in the server they have dedicated to governance Optimism, we were discussing with other members of the group about the term \u201cpublic goods\u201d. How we should interpret it and if it was correct to call them that way or as Optimismo defines them. This generated a great debate in which, I believe, we did not arrive at any concrete definition. I think that the Optimismo Foundation together with the Optimismo Collective, of which I consider myself a part, are going to have to define what the characteristics and aspects of a \u201cpublic good\u201d are. In this particular case, my question is whether Rotki is enough to be a public good just for being open source. Since it has a \u201cpremium\u201d part that monetizes and it seems fine to me that it has a business model. But that premium section is not accessible to all web3 citizens unless you are endowed with extensive technical knowledge in programming. Some protocols collect or monetize through marketing fees and the funds are managed by a DAO, this would not be the case. Is open source enough to be a public good? What other characteristics should we take into account to label a project as a public good? All this questioning also arises from the fact that in this Phase 1 we have seen some projects of dubious provenance. In the case of rotki we all or at least most of us know the reputation of Lefterisjp and its contributions to the community and we trust or at least I trust that the grants it is going to receive will be well used as detailed in the [DRAFT]. In short, I think this particular case of rotki depending on how you look at it may or may not be considered a public good. It will surely happen with other similar projects, that is why I think it is necessary as governance to have more clarity in defining some characteristics of \u201cpublic goods\u201d. Disclaimer: Surely some of the ideas, including paragraphs, are not understood 100%. I am not a native English speaker. ",

And no worries I completely understand your English! Such healthy criticism and questions are more than welcome! So in short I believe opensource is a public good. True opensource. Like rotki. So any OSI approved license: The Open Source Definition | Open Source Initiative There is other licenses which may allow for the code to be open but limit usage in various ways such as non-commercial etc. These are called \u201csource available\u201d instead of opensource. The entire public good talks in crypto started from gitcoin. Gitcoin\u2019s stated mission back in 2019 was to fund opensource development. A category which has been and still is something that is considered \u201cimpossible to do\u201d. Later this changed to the more broad term public good, to include other projects non-software related. But why is opensource software hard to fund? Why is is a public good? Because opensource can be copied, modified and redistributed. And that is even encouraged. It\u2019s part of the very definition of open soure I pasted above! In the traditional for-profit model a venture will not get funding if it does not have an IP. Opensource software is not IP since it can be copied. For example you can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in development to create a piece of software and someone else can take that software, copy the code, repackage it and sell it. And that would be fine in all opensource licenses. This is why VCs do not touch opensource code. They touch opensource protocols, since there is tokens and all the ponzinomics that come with them but for pure code they do not. And to further cement my point about rotki specifically let me tell you a story. A German company created a portfolio tracking SaaS end of last year. And sold access to it for ~1k $ / month per user. Their code was closed. We had a look at how their app behaves and it was obvious from the start they were using rotki\u2019s source code. We confronted them. They admitted they were using our code but said they don\u2019t need to respect the license. Our license is AGPL, which means you can use it, copy, redistribute, sell it, but you should also be opensource and give credit to the original authors (so rotki). They refused to do that. We hired a lawyer. Spent ~3k EUR and 2 months of going back and forth with lawyers. At the end they simply removed some features and claimed they were no longer using our code. Our lawyer informed us this was the best case scenario and that we had no way of verifying anything. Did not really feel like a win. Why am I saying this? I am saying this to show you that even defending opensource licenses is hard and it falls on the opensource project. Projects that traditionally have no money to begin with. The idea is your code is out there, can be used by others and you are vulnerable and have to accept that fact or you have to not build opensource. For all the above, opensource is a public good ",

On the other side, Open Source Software(OSS) are built and developed by public funding and donations, precisely what Gitcoin and QF funding round are trying to do.

Public Good(OSS including) should be based on \u201cBottom Up\u201d approach; here you develop something and then getting the reward retroactively and not \u201cTop Down\u201d; here you ask for funding first and then develop something.

Gitcoin does not have a monopoly on funding public goods. Retroactive funding part of the development as gitcoin always does is simply not enough. Gitcoin is trying but the reality of the situaton is that the matching pots are simply too small and the projects applying for them too many. Funding development of specific features is even how gitcoin started. See gitcoin bounties. I would even argue that this is much more fair to the community that does the funding. As they know exactly what they are getting as opposed to the much more vague retroactive funding. It\u2019s also much more fair to the opensource project. And I can\u2019t stress this enough as a person who runs one. With a grant application such as this,  they know where they need to focus their development efforts on. Can\u2019t just develop randomly trying to satisfy as many different communities and people as possible in the hopes that some of them may in the future toss few coins their way which are almost always simply not going to be enough. The resulting opensource code is the public good. Who funds it and when does not have any effect on the end result. You can still take the end result, copy it, modify it, redistribute or sell it so as per the OSI opensource definition it\u2019s still a public good. I mean the question really makes no sense. The Ethereum foundation itself is also funding opensource projects with grants exactly because they are public good. Other protocols/projects also give grants to projects that produce opensource code that deals with their protocols. That does not change them from  being a public good. It\u2019s the curse of opensource maintainers. Trying to get funding from as many sources as possible just to keep afloat. So your definition of a public good would be opensource code that is not funded by grants but only with a few pennies retroactively? By the time those pennies flow into the project, the project is dead. Let\u2019s not perpetuate the myth of the poor opensource maintainer. That\u2019s just a myth, it\u2019s unhealthy and hurts opensource development. Software development costs a lot of money and opensource software is no different. I argue that opensource software is the most important kind of software and thus should be paid even more than closed source. ",

Yes definitely if the team has past work to showcase they are capable of delivering then this would definitely be a big plus as it gives you a confidence boost. In case 2 perhaps releasing the funds in milestones is what would be really cool as then you can be sure that work will be achieved and only iff they complete the first milestone would second one be paid out, then third one and so on and so forth. So if the first milestone is never done then a very small amount of funds would be wasted, as opposed to wasting the entire budget.

It is very mush aligned\u2026 Developers shouldn\u2019t be the only ones contributing to Open Source development\u2026 yes, they are the only ones that can do the LABOR\u2026 but capital contributions to pay for that labor are also valid contributions\u2026 The idea isn\u2019t that open source code should be built for free, the idea is that open source code should be free to reuse.

                    "content": "Thank you for the question! The answer is by providing the choice to the user. The user can run their own node or customize a set of open nodes to which to connect to. For example I run my own node and use it with rotki, with metamask and with otterscan (a local blockchain explorer: GitHub - wmitsuda/otterscan: A blazingly fast, local, Ethereum block explorer built on top of Erigon). That is for blockchain data. For most other data it\u2019s all calculated locally. For whatever we need to query external services we query multiple and try to randomize them so as to not leak data (in case user is not just privacy aware \u2013 but paranoid). For example historical forex prices etc. Let me give you an example. Say you use zerion/zapper. Just by you using the centralized website, they know (1) your location (2) your entire crypto networth and your (3) spending habits and possibly more depending on other factors such as having an ENS associated with the wallets you track etc. That easily puts a target on your back if any of this data leaks, especially combined with say the ledger data leak which contains a gazillion of home addresses. Now of course \u2026 they all say the same thing. They \u201crespect\u201d your privacy and refer you to their privacy policy. If you have ever worked in software you know that\u2019s a big load of bull. And I am not necessarily assuming malice. All it takes is one intern making a mistake. That\u2019s the web2 way. Trust should be out of the equation. Can\u2019t be evil is better than don\u2019t be evil. Which is why local-first apps like rotki are the only true dapps. All else is simply web2 centralized apps masquerading as \u201cdapps\u201d. Sure they are easier to start with as a user since they are centralized webapps but to what cost? I will refer you to: Local-first software: You own your data, in spite of the cloud for an explanation of our development approach. And just one of many questions you should be asking yourself when you use centralized apps: https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1540971616347250688 Keep in mind. Your financial data is probably one of the most sensitive data about yourself. Protect yourself. Finally all those centralized apps, zerion and zapper included, are completely free to use. Yet they have had millions invested on them by VCs in multiple rounds. Doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that the product of a centralized service like that is eventually you, the user. Those VCs are expecting a return in their investment. They did not invest out of charity. As for us, we don\u2019t have any investors. We also seek none. We are idealists. We have had a big initial investment by me (I have been around crypto for a while) and then it\u2019s all organic income from donations and development grants like this one. Thus rotki is not capturable by external interests. ",

In our view, this funding round\u2019s goal is primarily in increasing liquidity and users on Optimism. Supporting public goods is at the core of the Op retroactive public goods funding but we doubt the positive impact & return for the Optimism ecosystem with this proposal. (Funding Rotki support for Op with $100K will likely not add many users to Optimism as you don\u2019t have a large user base & platform support for Op will not offer network effects).  Ultimately, we are not very supportive of funding internal developments - especially when they don\u2019t have a meaningful impact on the stated goal. Sidenote: That said, we believe a bigger focus on privacy and your support for Optimism are important. On one hand, we hope to see another proposal from you that puts more focus on co-growth initiatives and the Op ecosystem. On the other hand, if the Optimism community clearly stated that they\u2019d also want to improve user privacy in one of the next Phases, this would be an easy yes too.

A delegate and OG among a myriad of Web3 communities we entrust Lefteris to build a product that furthers Optimism and the greater L2 ecosystem. Also - this transparency is important for the forum.     lefterisjp:  I am not sure if this is the right thing to do, since many rotki users who would like to see this implemented have delegated to me and asked me to vote with a YES.

No. Retroactive public goods funding is not a sustainable way to fund open source software development (or any kind of software development). You can\u2019t expect people to create a project for free and then maybe if you like it throw them a small amount of coins as a thank you. For (2) I asked around discord and some members of the optimism team and they said it\u2019s fine. I find \u201cincentivizing usage\u201d a waste of money as this is just creating fake adoption by buying users who come in just for the extra tokens and then leave. So called mercenary users. Creating real software that can help people is creating value. Not speculation.  ",
