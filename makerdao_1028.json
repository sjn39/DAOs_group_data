                    "content": " DssKiln DssKiln is a permissionless token purchasing and disposition tool for treasuries or wallets that need to permissionlessly dollar cost average their token purchases over time.  Summary In light of recent discussions about using the MakerDAO surplus buffer to purchase and diversify collateral holdings of a MakerDAO treasury, DssKiln has been created as a permissionless engineering solution for market buying tokens at market price on a regular cadence.  Parameters The following parameters are available for definition in DssKiln by Governance:   sell: the token to be deposited into DssKiln and sold  buy: the token to be bought in exchange for the sold token  hop: the frequency of token lots to be sold until no token balance remains  lot: the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per hop  The following parameters are specific to the DssKilnUNIV3SaveStrategy and are defined at contract creation. Other strategies may require a different set of variables.   uniV3Router: The address of the current Uniswap V3 router  fee: the UniSwapV3 fee pool DssKiln will participate in  receiver: the destination address for the purchased token   Example: Assume Governance agrees to deposit 10M DAI into DssKiln to be exchanged for WETH in order to bolster its treasury. Governance would specify WETH to be purchased at a rate of e.g. 30k DAI every 6hrs, and upon receipt be sent to the treasury. This would build up a store of ETH (or any other token as deemed valuable by Governance) in a safe, predetermined and permissionless manner.  Details:  Because DssKiln is permissionless, anyone in the community, including our existing keeper networks could call the contract in order to execute a buy transaction. Uniswap V3 has been chosen as the ideal initial exchange strategy because it enables slippage protection by preventing front and back-running sandwich attacks from occurring. Uniswap V3 also employs a block-based pricing mechanism - whereby it uses the price at the beginning of the block for the whole amount, making it difficult and prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to adversely move the price without great risk and expense. Future implementations of DssKiln could easily be extended to Curve, Uniswap V2, and other AMMs, each with independent parameters, similar to how D3Ms are able to support different ecosystems/markets depending on liquidity and business requirements. An alternate strategy is provided which demonstrates a \u201cbuy and burn\u201d model that can exist outside of the core protocol.   Code for review:  Github: Slow burner for protocol assets   Next Steps Although a working implementation is provided, it is merely an example; it has not been fully reviewed by PECU, nor externally audited, and therefore it is not recommended for widespread use. If there is formal demand for this as part of ongoing treasury discussions, PECU recommends taking this to a formal audit before implementation. ",

I don\u2019t have the sense we are in any way at the stage to look at an implementation tool for DCA token purchases. Who is deciding what is purchased and the parameters? Doesn\u2019t make sense to move on this in a vacuum of consensus on the overall approach given what I understand is the current work load. Treasury management is an issue ripe to be tackled by an internal committee who can come back to the community and governance with a recommendation. We need a better \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach to governance on some issues. Everyone doing a deep dive on everything is slowing us down for sure. I\u2019m looking forward to how the Resilience Initiative will help us determine an effective process for deciding the course on a host of issues, included treasury utilization and how metaGovernance may need to be provisioned as a complement.

Decentralization is important, but not in every aspect of the protocol.   This is point where we are in persistent disagreement. Maximum decentralization has been core to Maker\u2019s DNA from the very beginning. It\u2019s why we built vs bought our oracle solution, why the existing burn system is automated, and why the system was originally designed to operate with minimum human intervention.     Hasu:  We shouldn\u2019t build smart contracts for things that are cheaper and better done off-chain.   The \u201cde\u201d in DeFi, of course, stands for decentralized. So adding people, off-chain components, and trust assumptions to something that we still refer to as a \u201cprotocol\u201d is centralizing and counter to the very term. If you want Maker to be a business, be honest about that and let\u2019s have that discussion. Many of engineers have been trying to build something that works without middlemen though, in the same way that TCP-IP just works for everyone without permission or intermediary. Adding people in places that can be automated is regressive, lazy, and we\u2019ve been falling down this slippery slope for a while where we add trust assumptions and opportunities for corruption. Also keep in mind that the numbers here are effectively one-time cost, but adding a bonded handler to the protocol here is going to cost far more in salary and incentives per year than the audit quote.

The road of Maker as a business, albeit a sufficiently decentralized one, was decided when we switched to MCD (requiring collateral policy), reaffirmed by the decision against NIR and automated monetary policy, and finally cemented by the embrace of our RWA strategy. It would have been great to see PECU make a stand on any of these turning points in Maker\u2019s history instead of fighting past battles today. To be clear, I\u2019m a huge supporter of decentralization. My dislike of any form of governance, my dislike of RWA as collateral, and my support for NIR are well-documented. I didn\u2019t support any of the above decisions but I\u2019m also not criticizing them today. There are tradeoffs everywhere, and a more trustless and automated Maker could never have scaled to $10b DAI and beyond. The Maker that exists today scales much better and can help more people, in return for a much larger trust surface. Our decision to use a highly inefficient but decentralized mechanism to purchase MKR has cost MKR holders tens of millions of dollars. That money spent hasn\u2019t made Maker any more robust or decentralized, it\u2019s been all waste and destruction. Yes, Kiln may be an improvement, but it\u2019s still wasteful and not the right choice. ",

But, for instance, @NikKunkel about 1 month ago in a public interview said that He forsee MakerDAO in 10 years as just having 2 crypto callaterals: ETH and WBTC (and/or staking/LP variants). My point: even if we explored several directions in the last 2 years, it doesn\u2019t mean we are doomed to continue in that directions. There is always the possibility of backtracking a bit .

                    "content": "    Hasu:  It would have been great to see PECU make a stand on any of these turning points in Maker\u2019s history instead of fighting past battles today.   If you search the forums you\u2019ll find many examples of this. Some quick examples are posts on the TRFM, against RWA\u2019s, and against setting PSM fees to zero. There are more but I don\u2019t want to linger here. The PE team does not generally present a unified front on policy issues, and indeed I think some of my colleagues have some ideas that are short-sighted and take us in the wrong direction. Just so, we try to make our cases at the individual level and as MKR holders ourselves.     Hasu:  I didn\u2019t support any of the above decisions but I\u2019m also not criticizing them today.   Me either, but I also want to avoid falling into the trap of using prior poor decisions to justify future ones.     Hasu:  Our decision to use a highly inefficient but decentralized mechanism to purchase MKR has cost MKR holders tens of millions of dollars. That money spent hasn\u2019t made Maker any more robust or decentralized, it\u2019s been all waste and destruction.   I think this estimate is slightly high but this, like Black Thursday, resulted from a heavy reliance on keepers, an ecosystem which had not been cultivated. Contrary to being entirely waste, it\u2019s effectively an advertisement for system which draws resources to developing solutions that want to capture this alpha in the future though. These rare events are beacons to the broader community that development in these areas can be rewarded. Indeed, within 36 hours after \u201cFlappy Friday\u201d, several solutions had been presented in community discussion to harden this system in the future. Whether it\u2019s cost-effective advertising is probably debatable, and I think we all agree that the English auction system is indeed inefficient in a world with AMM\u2019s, which is why the team responded by developing our Liquidations 2.0 system. Kiln can be thought of as a lightweight Flapper 2.0, with the additional benefit that it can be used to buy collateral other than MKR, and whereby governance decides when and how much to invest.     Hasu:  I have to weigh cost and benefit, and it just doesn\u2019t check out for surplus auctions.   Buy and burn is only one possibility of this module, and not even the one presented here. This can be used to buy ETH when governance perceives the price to be low so that it\u2019s available for Oracles, it can buy MKR to replenish the incentive rewards that are leaving the pause proxy, or to convert one asset to another, say, by transferring excess USDC on the books to something with a different risk profile. The possibilities are pretty broad here. I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s the commitment to aggressive growth from some that\u2019s prompting the pushback here, since it can indeed be used by others who want to see some MKR burn, even if symbolic.

                    "content": "Let\u2019s just add this to the todo list?  Seems like less than a week\u2019s worth which is essentially nothing in the software development world.  I\u2019m confident the PE team can make the context switch minimally invasive and sometimes it\u2019s nice to take a break from larger projects to finish something small and different.  There has been enough talk on the forums about balance sheet/surplus buffer management that there is high potential this could be put to use at any moment and the savings would quickly be felt.  I imagine once the capital raise occurs and we have 250 mil sitting there in the SB, there will be even more impetus toward this direction.  I also think there are benefits to seeing it working in practice because it may spur other ideas for investment or growth.  This work is a tangible improvement to the protocol and I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t just get that last mile in when we often spend time to do other things like help people retrieve funds (I have nothing against this btw). I want to give great credit to @brianmcmichael for prototyping this on his own.  Obviously, it would have been difficult to get this prioritized by MKR governance, but it\u2019s work like this that really moves the protocol into a better state. ",
