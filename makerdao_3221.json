A key insight is that they are not actually undercollateralized - the bank doesn\u2019t need to call the collateral immediately, but the collateral exists, even if only in the form of the borrower\u2019s future ability to repay. For example, when a bank lends someone money to build a house, the house itself can collateralize the loan. How does this help Maker? Currently, Maker can only allow borrowers to create and withdraw Dai up to the safe collateralization ratio. If it allowed borrowers to withdraw more, the borrower would walk away with the loan and forfeit the collateral. However, if the loan itself collateralizes the loan, Maker can offer borrowers many times more leverage. Example:  User deposits $100k ETH User draws $200k Dai to use in a range of whitelisted applications, e.g. sell it for whitelisted tokens on Uniswap to create specific price exposure, or provide it as liquidity to whitelisted pools.  The whitelisting is necessary so that the user can only switch their collateral between different high-quality options. This should be very relevant to Maker\u2019s core userbase (market makers, speculators, yield-farmers).

With a flash loan the way you\u2019d do the same is to borrow 200k dai, and use that to buy 200k of collateral, and then combine that with your own 100k collateral to generate 200k dai in order to close our the flash loan, leaving you with 300k of collateral and 200k of debt But one big downside, as seb also points out, is that you cant use a larger portfolio as collateral, you need to manage your debt across each different type of collatearl you want to use.

Thank you for reinforcing this. The misunderstanding of \u201cunsecured\u201d and \u201cundercollateralized\u201d is agonizing. As for the rest of your proposal, I am not entire sure I understand? What is stopping a user from doing this today? The only difference is that they\u2019d need to deposit the assets they purchased into the Vault. You can already come to the protocol with $1 and end up with $3+ of exposure. I suppose my question is, what\u2019s the advantage of doing it the way you suggested. And on top of that, if it is advantageous, why wouldn\u2019t the protocol just purchase these assets itself instead of trying to incentivize users to do it? ",
