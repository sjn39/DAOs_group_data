                    "content": "This is a consolidated version of my topic on reddit, many thanks to those that commented there. I feel this could use further discussion though, so if you commented before, please use this as an opportunity to summarise your objections or agreements and try to form consensus. There has been some discussion recently over the potential for problems surrounding the DSR and the Stability Rate calculation for MCD. These are not simple concepts, so I think it would be useful for Governance to generate a problem definition that we can get consensus on, or at least, that no one actively objects to. Current System With that in mind, here is the relevant information on the currently proposed system. Please correct me if I am mistaken with these statements:   Collateral Package : A combination of a collateral type, along with attached values for the Risk Premium, Collateralization Ratio and the Debt Ceiling. There will be one or more collateral packages for each collateral type where these values are balanced differently.  Risk Premium : A collateral specific, semi-fixed value solely determined by the output of the risk model when applied to a specific collateral type. This changes only when the underlying risk of the collateral changes.  DSR : Dai savings rate, a system-wide payout to holders of locked Dai. Proposed to be used in the Stability Rate calculation as below.  Governance Fee : The fee we take for governing the system, which eventually ends up buying and burning MKR.  Stability Rate : The APR that CDP holders pay to mint Dai, which varies with the type of CDP.  The current plan is for the stability rate for each collateral package to be calculated as: Stability Rate = Risk Premium + DSR + Governance Fee The DSR is planned to be the only lever used to control Dai supply/demand balance, and is used in the Stability Fee calculation as stated above. Perceived Problem This is my understanding of the issue, please chime in if your understanding differs, maybe I\u2019m wrong!  DSR directly affects the utility of holding Dai, and therefore demand. The DSR is a single term equation: Utility of Holding Dai = DSR . The Stability Rate however is only one factor that controls the utility of maintaining a CDP of a certain collateral type, it is a multi-term equation.  Utility of holding a CDP = Average perceived utility of Leverage with that collateral / (Stability Rate * Collateralization Ratio)  Under the proposed system there is no dynamic, collateral specific component to the Stability Rate equation. The Risk Premium is collateral specific, but it is not proposed to be used dynamically. The DSR component to the equation is dynamic but it is not specific. The result is that there is no good option to react to a collateral-specific dynamic change in leverage demand.  We will be forced to fix a collateral-package specific CDP demand problem by using a tool that effects general CDP demand (as well as Dai demand). This has knock on effects on the balance of collateral in a way that causes the average risk of locked collateral to increase as the DSR increases.  Example For simplicity\u2019s sake, assume the following: Stability Rate = DSR + Risk Premium The DSR is 0%. We have three assets with different risk premiums (and since the DSR is 0% these are also their Stability Rates): SafeCoin at 1%, Mod(erate)Coin at 10%, RiskCoin at 40%. If we increase the DSR from 0% to 5% then we have the following effects: SafeCoin goes from 1% to 6%, a 500% increase over the previous rate. ModCoin goes from 10% to 15%, a 50% increase over the previous rate. RiskCoin goes from 40% to 45%, a 12.5% increase over the previous rate. Discussion If possible, I\u2019d like to keep discussion and comments solely focused on the nature of the problem (if one exists). If you think you have a solution, great! Write it down and save it, we\u2019ll get to that part later. What I would love for this post to achieve is a consensus problem statement: something no longer than a sentence that we can agree on and use to describe this problem. Here is an initial attempt: Under the currently proposed system and policy there is no adequate tool that can be used to curtail a high demand for a single collateral package without negatively affecting other collateral packages, especially those with lower risk premiums. Please suggest changes as you feel necessary, and we will try to come to consensus. ",

I think you\u2019re spot on. I would like to hear more from someone in the interim risk team on how they plan on adjusting stability rates in response to fluctuations in DAI demand. To me, the trade off seems to be an efficient centralized solution (risk team decides all risk premiums), and a less efficient decentralized one (MKR vote each risk premium change). Each solution comes with its own problems. While I think it is possible to change rates in a decentralized way, we may not be a stage in the project to allow this level of participation from voters. I think I will be okay with whichever route the risk team decides, but I would like to hear from them before launch about these valid concerns. ",

It isn\u2019t introducing any new risk to the system.   This is true, there is no additonal risk, but there is additional Dai supply that effects the peg. Combating this with the DSR leads to either:  Subsidising lower risk collateral packages (in the case where DSR > Stability Rate for those packages (this might be fine.) Increasing the base rate component of the Stability Rate for all collateral packages (I\u2019d argue this is not fine, as it makes lower Risk Premium packages less market-competitive)      Akiva:  The execs at the foundation have explicitly told me they want to avoid milking CDP users, they\u2019d much prefer to build trust with their users over a long term with better than elsewhere terms.   First of all, ultimately the DAO controls the governance parameters, not the Foundation execs, but you are right, we want to optimise for long term success, the DAOs image is important in that respect. However, what I described is not \u2018milking\u2019 the CDP holders, it is allowing the Price Mechanism to work in the most efficient and fair way for the market. Take the following scenarios.  Scenario 1: We rely on the debt ceiling to curtail high demand. A secondary market in CDPs develops shortly after we hit the ceiling and it becomes clear that governance consensus is to do nothing. The Price Mechanism works on this new market, CDPs are still available at a higher cost (a lump sum from buyer to seller). Why is this bad?  It privileges CDP holders that made their CDPs first. Participants should all pay the fair market rate. Our image takes a hit because different sets of users are paying different amounts for the same thing (secondary market buyers paying a lump sum). Some CDP Holders are still being \u2018milked\u2019, only now the money goes to first-come CDP holders rather than to the DCS (Dai Credit System.) UX takes a big hit. Now, rather than being able to open a CDP at any time with no counterparty, you require a counterparty to sell you a CDP, and you have to pay upfront for the privilege.   Scenario 2: We increase the Stability Rate specifically for that collateral-package. No secondary market develops, none of the problems from scenario 1 happen. Instead we have:  An increased market rate that effects everyone equally. Participants that are unwilling to pay the new rate can refinance elsewhere or close their CDPs. Total revenue for the DCS is higher. When CDP Holders complain at the rise, we explain that it is a variable rate loan, and that the system is the same in essence as lending on other DeFi platforms (Compound.Finance, DyDx, etc) The only difference is that the rate change is coordinated by MKR token holders rather than automatically calculated. It is still dictated by supply and demand in the market.  ",

This a risk question\u2026 and intuitively, it should not be 18%\u2026 and it should not be zero\u2026 that said, if we have a \u201cperfectly\u201d liquid market, we are only insuring against the black swan events\u2026 realistically it should be way closer to 2% than to 18%\u2026 point being is that when MCD launches and if the DSR is enabled\u2026 and IF we use the properly set RP\u2026  the market has already shown its hand\u2026 if the market in SCD will support 19% SF\u2026 the total SF (in MCD) will also end up being 19%\u2026 rather it will be just constructed there (meaning that if we assume the RP should be 5% (purely an example)\u2026 then all of the other costs (DSR + Oracle + Risk-team) should equal 14%\u2026 for a total of 19%\u2026 where we are today\u2026 so the question is from a principle level, do we change the RP to an elevated rate thus allowing us to have a lower DSR. or do we set the RP to what we believe it is\u2026 and let the DSR \u201cdo its thing\u201d\u2026 and float to really high levels\u2026 From an external perspective, I believe the only path is the second one. With the second one, we allow for the value transfer from the borrower to the saver and MKR gets its \u201cinsurance\u201d risk-premium\u2026 but it should not be more than is needed\u2026 if the DSR is unusually high, that is a reason for individuals to buy DAI and lock in the DSR\u2026 and be motivated to build capital market bridges\u2026 ",

Having the Stability Rate solely based on risk, and using the DSR to absorb supply only works until the DSR needs to go higher than the Stability Rate. At this point we have to increase both together (adding the DSR component to the Stability Rate) to keep the system solvent. I agree the Risk Premium should be set solely on risk, and that the other components, DSR + Governance Fee + Oracle fees should make up the rest to the current ~19% rate that the market is willing to pay. This works fine if demand is uniform across collateral-packages. However if demand is not uniform, then we may want to use specific increases to the Stability Rate for a particular collateral-package, in order to prevent the negative effect the DSR funding component has on other packages. This is largely a terminology problem, the technical lever labelled \u2018Risk Premium\u2019 can (but doesn\u2019t have to) include two components: the actual Risk Premium and a Collateral Specific rate modifier to counter demand.

Assume n collateral types t1,\u2026,tn, with respective Risk Premiums r1,\u2026,rn. The total fee rates are k1,\u2026,kn, with ki = ri + di where di is an arbitrary number. At the current time, borrow volumes are respectively v1,\u2026,vn. Let\u2019s also assume d > max(ri) for simplicity. Both of the following policies provide a DSR of d:  Set di = d - ri for all collateral types. Here di does not depend on volume. This has unequal impact on fees for different collateral types. Set di = ri * (DSRevenue / riskRevenue - 1), where DSRevenue = d * sum(vi) and riskRevenue = sum(ri * vi). Here di depends on volume. Impact on total fee is proportionally the same for every collateral type (i.e. ri/di is constant for all i).  I don\u2019t know if policy 2. is feasible within the constraints of the current Ethereum chain \u2013 all rates have to be recomputed (possibly lazily) at every borrow volume change. Anyway I think the answer will lie between those 2 extremes and that governance will use its discretion to set rates, but it seems good to have very simple models like this in mind. edit: I modified the post to assume that all of the fees (the ki's) go towards the DSR. Before, the Risk Premiums (the ri's) were assumed not to go towards the DSR, but that seems less realistic. Either assumption is simplifying. ",

This ends up having the effect that you can, in a way, use the debt ceiling to deal with the issue, but without at the same time running into the issue of artificially locking users out of access to a using CDPs because the debt ceiling has been hit. In practice how this would play out in governance is that every governance cycle, the risk teams would iterate over all collateral types their risk construct covers, that are nearing their debt ceiling, and if/when increasing their debt ceilings, also increasing their stability fees (predetermined by a exponential relationship decided by the general risk frameworks). In the long run it should be possible to deploy so-called \u201cinstant access modules\u201d to modify specific stability fees. An instant access module is a customized governance submodule that is approved by governance to give direct granular access to making small real time modifications to specific risk parameters of specific collateral types within secure pre-set boundaries (also set by governance). This would allow the community to react as soon as the data became available to try to counteract a sudden surge in a particular collateral type that\u2019s causing liquidity issues. Instant access modules can be controlled by their own \u201cmini-governance process\u201d. Typically it would be either a centralized multisig/risk team, or a small quorum of MKR holders. However, until this option is available, the type of manual solution that was already proposed here - the \u201crefrigerant\u201d parameter - can be implemented directly through the executive vote of each governance cycle, but will then be limited by the cadence of the governance cycles.

                    "content": "I think the DSR against the MCD-SF should be looked at from the risk profile(s) of collateralized assets and predominantly the PEG against liquidity. One thing I think should be considered is an option in Maker to basically exchange MCDAI for SCDAI as another lever to drive the transition and affect both pegs. In effect the above becomes a 4th lever to drive the SCD -> MCD transition and use MCDAI which can be minted as an additional market driver until the SCDAI outstanding descreases below the MCD outstanding and the markets supply/borrow rates line up on MCDAI vs. SCDAI. One thing I don\u2019t think people realize is that it will take a bit for secondary markets to develop on MCDAI and MCDAI-SCDAI exchange trading to develop (if it develops at all). IMO to me these markets look mostly to be driven mostly by liquidity vs. rate I think some consideration of how liquidity will be managed in conjunction with the MCD-SF, SCD-SF and DSR would be important.

Proposal interest rate adjustment by debt facility utilization Collateral Discussion       What curve is up for discussion.   I wanted one that pretty much is flat and at the desired itarget between the debt utilization factor from .25 up to about .7 and then a pretty strong move up as we go from .7  to .9 and up and a pretty good drop as we go below .1 to lower rates and encourage borrowing.   The goal of this is to design a fee curve that makes it hard to extinguish all liquidity (i.e. we don\u2019t want debt utilization to EVER hit 100%) as this exhausts the ability of borrowers to mint\u2026     and on the DSR side.     A Governance Model for Maker Governance       I may start another thread but I have been thinking of an alternate approach to the DSR by simply paying the DSR based on a % of the fees.  Simple example.  If we were to take 50% of ALL of the fees and pay them out to the DSR it would give the following rates based on DSR utilization.  ~110M in loans at ~5%/yr generates ~5.5M/yr in fees.  DSR utilization is at 30M which using above numbers would be paying a DSR rate of 9.15%  If the DSR utilization were to increase to 60M this rate would be ~4.\u2026     Attempting to micromanage markets with strictly manual governance changes will invariably not track market needs and be overly demanding on governance voting, it will tend to over and undershoot and do this with a latency related to the sensing of input and applying a change (in the case of governance latency is least a week)    In effect adaptive curves will always do better at tracking the system if designed properly (well bounded activity limits) yielding a better match particularly if the latency is much lower than a manual system. I see this all the time in applied control system practice either in steady state or pulsed systems using feed back as well as feed forward loops for device control. ",
