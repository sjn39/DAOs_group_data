Specification  Motivation I am applying to become a Facilitator of GovAlpha as the next step in my relationship with MakerDAO. I have been a GovAlpha contributor since June 2021 and have found working with the team to be a pleasurable experience. I feel fortunate that what started as a general interest in cryptocurrency sparked by buying my first Bitcoin in 2013, before discovering Ethereum in 2016 and making my first foray into MKR in 2019, has now developed into a full-time position with GovAlpha contributing, in my small way, to what I regard to be the foremost cryptocurrency project. The coming months and years are positioned to be very promising for MakerDAO as we continue to grow and cement our position in the ecosystem. The governance of the DAO is crucial in ensuring that DAI users, Vault owners, Core Unit contributors and MKR holders are able to collaborate and grow the Protocol together. GovAlpha\u2019s role in this is essential and I am excited to help the DAO in whatever way I can. I was honoured when Payton and Long approached me about becoming a Governance Facilitator. I hope that I will be able to live up to the examples they have set and help MakerDAO continue to grow into the future. In addition, they have been kind enough to give me a leadership role within the Core Unit. I view becoming a Facilitator as the next step in formalising this role within the team and allowing me to take on more responsibilities within the DAO. GovAlpha has many responsibilities within the DAO, but I believe that responsibility for the voting system and the executive vote implementation process are critical parts of the DAO structure. A high degree of competence and professionalism are required to carry out these responsibilities. I believe that I have demonstrated the attributes necessary to perform this role.  Core Unit ID Name - GovAlpha ID - GOV-001  Facilitator name and information Forum - @Patrick_J Discord - Patrick_J#2627 Github - @patrick-j-govalpha Location (Timezone) - Scotland/UK (timezone: UTC/UTC+1 depending on DST) Permissioned Address - signing.patrick-j.eth - 0x06ADa798f9323392cA30C755383Af879bd853168 (etherscan link) Note that this permissioned address will be used as a keyholder in relevant multi-sig wallets and not for compensation or budget distributions.  Facilitator Commitment I commit that as a Facilitator, I will adhere to the principles laid out in the GovAlpha mandate. These principles of neutrality, facilitation, effectiveness and communication are crucial for us to function within the DAO and ensure its effective operation. I will be open to criticism and comments from within and without the Core Unit regarding my and the team\u2019s performance and suggestions for how things could be improved. If ratified, I will uphold the high standards that Long and Payton have set as Governance Facilitators. I have an interest in continuing to enable growth within the team by allowing contributors to pursue projects and roles that interest them. Other commitments to the community include:  Ensuring the smooth operation of the polling and Executive Vote process. Being available to answer questions on governance-related matters. Close monitoring of the GovAlpha budget, returning the unused excess budget to the protocol every quarter and ensuring that we provide a good value service to the DAO. Chairing/hosting DAO calls and meetings. Communicating CU work and achievements. Interfacing between the CU and the community. Assuming responsibility, along with the other Facilitators, for the performance of the Core Unit.   Facilitator Credentials  GovAlpha part-time contributor since June 2021. Full-time contributor since the start of May 2022. Selected Governance Contributions:  Emergency response co-ordination:  Assisted Governance Facilitator with emergency response during the April 14th Emergency Executive. Assisting with post-mortem work.   Running Executive Vote process:  Finalising contents with PE. Liaising with relevant Core Unit Facilitators/Delegates to confirm details/addresses. Writing/reviewing Executive Vote copy.   Running Weekly Poll Process:  Maintaining a list of Governance items on the Governance Tracker  Assigning GovAlpha contributors polls to write and/or review polls and ensuring completion. Reviewing polls to ensure accuracy.   MIPs:  Contributor to MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation - passed. Author of MIP4c2-SP20: MIP16 Amendments - RFC. Author of MIP4c3-SP2: MIP62 Amendments - passed. Contributor to MIP40c3-SP59: GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 - passed. Co-author of MIP40c3-SP60: Modify GovAlpha MKR Budget - passed.   Signal Requests:  Should We Mint New MKR for Protocol Expenses or Fund Them With MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury? Should We Introduce a Performance Modifier to the Delegate Compensation Trial? Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold   GovAlpha Recognized Delegate Lead:  Spearheaded Recognized Delegate Metric Tracking efforts. Devised the spreadsheets used for calculating Delegate Compensation each month. Now working with new applicants onboarding as Recognized Delegates.   Monthly SES-001 budget auditing.     Other Credentials  Bachelor of Medicine. 8 years experience working as a physician in the United Kingdom.  This included many roles, including leadership, research, and education. Now no longer practising medicine.     Conflicts of Interest The following is a list of potentially relevant conflicts of interest.  From a governance perspective, I do not participate in any other DAOs or organisations that would represent a conflict of interest. However, I am a Rocketpool Node Operator and, consequently, own and stake RPL. I do not participate in Rocketpool DAO activities. I currently utilise ETH and G-UNI vaults. I am an MKR token holder.   cc: @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @MIP-Editors ",

                    "content": "While GovAlpha will maintain our neutrality on this proposal (and encourage healthy debate and discussion to take place), I think it\u2019s important for the community to know that this proposal is welcomed and encouraged internally. @Patrick_J is nothing short of a pleasure to work with. When he started contributing at GovAlpha, it was quite clear he is every boss\u2019s dream. Hard-working, with an eye for detail and a strong commitment to his word. But I admire Patrick for so much more than that. Within GovAlpha he has provided an informed outside prospective, bringing up tough topics and decisions that he would like to see improved. Proving himself consistently both compassionate and ethical, my interactions with @Patrick_J frequently remind me how much more there is to give for me as a facilitator. I don\u2019t want to wax poetical too much here, but do want all those that haven\u2019t had the pleasure of interacting with Patrick to know why I am so proud to be commenting on this thread. He started contributing to GovAlpha while still working a very safe and secure day job, and I was overjoyed when he made the switch to full time Maker earlier this year. Patrick is just as talented with his spreadsheets as he is with his contributor collaborations. I think the posts above illustrate how much of a leader Patrick is within GovAlpha and if you\u2019ve had the pleasure of sitting in a call lead by Patrick, you can already see why.  Your organization and pension for kindness are ideally suited for the decentralized world, @Patrick_J. We are incredibly lucky that you have devoted your time and energy to Maker and GovAlpha. Good luck with the proposal, and my messages are open for anyone wanting additions and stories behind the robust work mentioned above. ",

                    "content": "Last time I wrote one of these, I said that finding individuals suitable to fill the Governance Facilitator role is one of our most important responsibilities as existing facilitators. This is still the case. I am fully satisified that @Patrick_J is able to fill the role, both in terms of capability and attitude. Particularly, Patrick\u2019s approach to his lack of technical background in terms of both version control software (git) and the workings of the Maker Protocol has impressed me. He has quickly and effectively worked to understand both aspects better through a process of independent learning and asking effective questions. When faced with something he had a weakness in, he worked to mitigate that weakness and improve himself and his effectiveness in his role. Patrick has shown himself to be level-headed and focused, both of which I feel will be key attributes to maintain a facilitator position in MakerDAO as the DAO scales in the future. I have no doubts of his ability to maintain the mandate of neutrality GovAlpha has adopted, nor do I feel there is any risk of him taking advantage of the position. I believe Patrick will further grow as he (governance-willing) takes on the responsibility of becoming a facilitator of GovAlpha, and I look forward to working with him in the future. ",
