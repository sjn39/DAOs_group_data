It would be really helpful to reach an idea about how often this will be, and if any limits will be put in place on the number of delegates. This post is to provide a space to discuss adding more delegates. I look forward to reading your thoughts. ",

As far as I can tell the current Delegates have quite a bit on their plates with all the Proposals and posts they are currently trying to review - adding more now - and also clarifying the roles/responsibilities would be a good idea I think for sure. Seems a good time for this from my POV. ",
