                    "content": "As a Sai holder, who trust the original system and wasn\u2019t sure to migrate to Dai before the new system is bullet-tested or inevitable ES on Sai. The sudden 0 debt ceiling put me into a very difficult situation (I also thought it is only going to happen on April 24 date or whenever SAI was officially shutdown, no clear communication in advanced). I have encountered many people facing the same issues too after the proposal was voted in by only 17 MKR holders. I understand Sai should be gradually eased out but not in such a dramatic manner, at the potential expense of Sai holders. Instead, the migration debt ceiling should be tracking above the current Sai liquidity (currently ~3m) in the contract so that small and medium Sai holders can still swap their Sai to Dai at par without significantly increasing the risk of MCD system, in addition, it could inject liquidity for CDP holders to migrate their position before the ES. Therefore, I propose to increase Sai to Dai migration debt ceiling relatively above the Sai liquidity in the migration contract, eg. 5m, which is the middle round from the last decreasing (I believe the debt ceiling went from 20m to 15m to 10m and jumped to 0).

I think just converting on GS your SAI to ETH with 0 slippage IS the best option.   Then just sell the ETH for DAI when it is profitable to do so. While I agree with you the time to closure and PR in relation to that is pretty aggressive (I would have liked to see a 3month timeline from when voted to give everyone a last 3 months to clear the heck out of the SCD or face GS). Given that fees will be forgiven I honestly think it is in best interest for people in SCD simply to liquidate at OSM and claim remaining ETH than to pay fees to recover the ETH. ",
