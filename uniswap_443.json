I have nothing against Navad, Brendan, Chris, Hiturunk, Dharma or the Uniswap team, and I think governance of Uniswap is not broken, and keep working just fine. But at the end of the day this project belongs to the Uniswap team, and judging by the few interactions I had with them\u2026 whatever I am trying to do is not being welcomed, and I couldn\u2019t be more uncomfortable with that. I wouldn\u2019t want someone insisting on taking part of my project if I don\u2019t like what they are doing either, so I think is best if that I take a step to the side. I will keep working on my things and projects, some of them are Uniswap integrations\u2026 luckily for me I can interact with Uniswap without having to participate on this governance process hehe. I have two addresses as delegate 0x00000583Cf2C6aA7488471fbe12ac7f0DfeB1cDa 0x47701463ee3a42fb87d24746fb9d8b70f06e6e3a  I suggest everyone who delegated to me two change their delegate, I am going to be abstaining from voting on all future proposals. Good luck everyone! ",

Is that not the entire point of governance? I\u2019d be more worried if every single project which implements governance is filled with yes people and agree to absolutely everything the owners of the project want. Having a wide range of different view points is a positive thing when it comes to governance imo. At the end of the day, as UNI holders, I\u2019d like to think we all want what\u2019s best for UNI and UniSwap. ",

With that being said I too will be removing myself from this Governance Forum as I too feel in a similar situation where I am going against the teams wishes along with this forum seeming to have turned into a toxic wasteland with no substance and more and more of the same small few making fake accounts to overpower people with false non factual information.

So far the thread has just been an expression of lack of faith in Uniswap governance with no exposition for why the statements are being made. It creates an environment of uncertainty and unease that we\u2019re all aware is often used strategically. I\u2019d like people to provide exposition for what they\u2019re stating. @Agusx1211 stated \u2018whatever I am trying to do is not being welcomed\u2019, but from reading his activity on the forum, I\u2019m unable to understand what it is that he\u2019s trying to do (as he doesn\u2019t appear to have proposed anything in the past), nor am I able to see where people supposedly had a problem with his activity. @Uniguy772  made all kinds of claims about the intentions of the Uniswap team, the validity of governance, the state of the forum, and people sockpuppeting and spreading \u2018false non factual information\u2019 - but provided no examples. Its the first I\u2019m hearing of any of this. You provided at least some exposition about what all of this might be about, so thank you. But I feel statements expressing lack of faith in governance using reference to a theory that had been made on a completely different platform, without presenting the theory in reference (prior to my post), is fairly unhelpful hearsay.

I don\u2019t have bad blood with the Uniswap team, but I don\u2019t feel confortable with the way Hayden was tweeting yesterday, to be more specific, there were some tweets about some opinions being worth less, and cutting out untalented developers from the conversation. I am not saying that Hayden shouldn\u2019t say those things, but those comments make me feel not welcomed on the governance, and I prefer to not take part of something if I am not welcomed.   I don\u2019t think Uniswap, Dharma or Chris are involved on \u201cunscrupulous\u201d activities, I think everyone has some strong opinions on the matter and in the heat of the argument personal attacks are being made.   I don\u2019t think this toxicity comes from a single party, pro-dharma & anti-dharma, both are saying nasty things in order to push their proposals.   ",
