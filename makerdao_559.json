Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Exploring NFTs as Collateral @monet-supply kicks off a discussion on the use of NFTs as collateral in the Maker Protocol. NFTs offer a large opportunity for collateralization, potentially in the tens of millions of Dai to start. The post includes projections based on various factors around risk and demand and offers several solutions to the onboarding and management of NFTs as collateral.  How Should MakerDAO Handle Junior Capital Providers? @Allan_Pedersen kicks off a discussion on how MakerDAO should handle Junior Capital providers in the context of Real-World Finance. As the post explains, junior positions involve more risk and are liquidated before senior positions, which means both parties have different interests when a loan goes bad and Junior\u2019s capital is at stake. MakerDAO has expressed interest in maintaining senior positions in loans. The post outlines MakerDAO\u2019s options and offers some pros and cons to start the discussion.  Dai Supply at All-Time High  Imgur882\u00d7191 58 KB  The Dai supply is currently sitting at an all-time high, inching closer to the 10 billion Dai milestone by the day. Annual profits are estimated at 113 million Dai, and the system surplus sits at 66 million Dai.

During the trial period, we recognized that initial parameter requirements were too harsh and subsequently introduced the Performance Modifier to the trial via Signal Request, and this has been added to MIP61. As things stand, MIP61 has not been submitted for Formal Submission, as there are still a few changes being discussed. Consequently, January 2022 is the final month currently covered by the trial, and compensation for Recognized Delegates would cease after this month.\" In response to these events, @Patrick_J signals to the community by asking whether we should extend the Delegate Compensation Trial by a maximum of 6-months but end if MIP61 is approved.
