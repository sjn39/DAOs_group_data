                    "content": "Background: There are approximately 181 M UNI in circulation now. Here are some main ways that UNI holders treated their assets:  Deposit in money market protocols (Compound etc.) LP on DEXes (Uniswap,Sushiswap etc.) Trade on CEXes Delegated UNI Undelegated UNI  While you deposit your UNI in Compound or LP pools, you will make some profit with different APY based on different level of risk. clipboard1395\u00d7229 11.6 KB notice: The amount of \u201cDelegated UNI\u201d included the votes delegate from the teams and investors. If you just hold UNI in your wallets, you will take the risk of price drop and have no profit other than the price rise. Solution: Distribute UNI to the delegated UNI holders by a 4% APY profit, calculated on UNI. Pros:  Incentive UNI holders to hold their UNI as a governance token and participate in the community autonomous governance. Make UNI a little bit more valuable before transaction fees are distributed to the UNI holders.  Cons:  Could be just an interim solution before transaction fees are distributed.  Next step: Fully discuss this idea with all you guys, and make sure it\u2019s available to be coded.

We must create a incentive that is valuable and will take away sushiswaps competition and it needs to be done ASAP!! Before the end of the year. Before BTC resets. Maybe a collectible could be awarded each month!!?? I don\u2019t know just idea. But massive airdrops reduces demand. We need another use for the Uni token. Maybe Dharma would agree to a merger? ",

I am just wandering if we are looking at something for the long term or can we create a short term demand? Which ultimately drives supply and demand? I would  like to see a merger or something that creates a unique incentive other then Liquidity, voting, or delegating. I mean seriously what do we have to lose. We need a leader or group who have notoriety that we can trust to Ultimately increase the value!? Obviously, this is just my opinion and I\u2019m not a expert, but understand demand ans supply and our ultimate goal to increase and distribute wealth, while keeping the brand of utmost value. ",
