I think that DAO simply needs to limit how many FLAP auctions can be kicked at one time.  Say 5 or 10. There is no urgency in settling Flap\u2019s as they are system surpluses.  The issue was that 400+ auctions hit the market at once. On the positive note. Glad oracles, PE and Gov Alpha took their vested dai ($2,535,453) when they did as it saved potentially more dai from hitting the market in this flap auction attack. It also lowered the DAO\u2019s liabilities. ",

But since I\u2019m apparently writing this post anyway: the risk of this sort of event has been known for a long time and repeatedly brought up, particularly but not exclusively by members of the Risk and PE teams. We got into a \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d scenario where a subset MKR holders strongly wished to continue burning in the short term, but no one pushed hard for auction improvements. The technical teams probably should have been more vocal about the risks; MKR holders probably should have given more weight to those risks when brought up. For example, if you read the replies to this recent signal request, you\u2019ll see that many within the community were aware of the issue of low competition in Flap auctions, but the discussion failed to spur any policy or priority changes despite a clear (IMO) conclusion that continuing to flap under current conditions was unsafe:    [Signal Request] Adjust minimum bid increase(beg) and lot size (bump) on flap-auctions Signal Archive       Overview:  Over the past month we have seen the burn kick back into action. This has given us some data as to the efficiency of the burn auctions and how the system handles burns over some time. Examining the data it is shown that there is some inefficiencies when it comes to how we buy back MKR. For the auctions in November/December 2021 the average price of bought MKR was 3,62% over market price and the median was 3,47%. Due to a few outliers the median seems to give the more correct picture.  \u2026     In short, this was a systemic malfunction due to competing priorities and underweighting of risks.  What is engineering doing about this?  PECU doesn\u2019t have the kind of mandate from governance that is required to just \u201cdo something\u201d. I, as a PECU member, recommend that burns be turned off in the short term and a more robust mechanism be put in place before they are resumed (there are many good options for this, including some pretty low-hanging ones, like throughput limitations\u2013the roadblocks are not technical). As soon as governance can reach some consensus on the path forward, action can be taken. ",

Definitely need to address flapper mechanics generally. I think a discussion on how we could better approach both funding various buying facilities (not just MKR but ETH for oracle fees) as well as setting up multiple mechanisms to apply this funding is in order.  setting limit orders DCA market buying on exchanges (say Uniswap or others) at some fixed amount of DAI or with some maximum price (where it will stop) funding such a beast with some % of liquidation fees (automatically) so some buying kicks off when markets are stressed but with a controlled DAI rate and maximum price.  Maker governance had to pause the MKR flops during/after BT (because of insufficient liquidity) and now it makes sense to basically halt MKR flaps until we can put into place an entirely better buying model that doesn\u2019t just include MKR but also ETH for protocol fees.   I really think this is illustrative of how the protocol really doesn\u2019t do well managing both the buying or selling of MKR. I look forward to the discussion on this and for now given the current situation I am strongly supportive of changing the SB parameters so basically we don\u2019t flap until governance has a solution, and Engineering teams can implement it.

In my opinion the protocol took a calculated risk that backfired. From the thread that was posted that shows that the risks were known, it also shows that the consensus for the proper solution was the introduction of liq2.0 for surplus auctions. Liq2.0 for surplus auctions are in the pipeline. Given the likely efficiency loss from surplus auctions the assessment was that the opportunity cost of prioritizing liq2.0 over other engineering projects were higher than the expected gains of implementing liq2.0. In an uncertain world you have to put in your priorities and play the odds. Sometimes the dice doesn\u2019t turn out in your favor. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you undervalued the risk. ",

I.e is there some world where lets say 1MM dai per day is sent to the burner and that amount is just subtracted from the current SB? It seems to me that has been the direction the DAO wants to lean with all of the buffer lerping and maybe just explicitly making that the rule makes more sense. And is this the right time to be talking about such an \u201cimprovement?\u201d ",
