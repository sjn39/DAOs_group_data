V3 of Uniswap has been out for over a month now and is steadily gaining traction. Rather than incentivize liquidity to move to V3, I think it makes more sense to TURN THE FEE SWITCH ON IN THE FORMERLY INCENTIVIZED POOLS ON V2. This will give us data on how turning the fee switches on may affect the liquidity that is already in the protocol. I suspect most of the liquidity will stay in these pools despite the fees but we won\u2019t know until we turn on the switch. Also, turning on the switch will turn the UNI token into a productive asset, one that generates fees for token holders. I think that is a net positive for the protocol. What do you all think? ",

Saying \u201cwe enable the fee switch but only for a short while / testing\u201d is one of the worst thing you can do on v2. As on v2 the fees are moved from a user account into the fee switch recipient when the user remove liquidity. The only thing you incentivise then is just removing liquidity later as if you enable the fee switch but only for a short while, only the liquidity removed while it was enabled will count towards it. This would give unreliable data due to a part of LP that would prefer to wait when the testing is done instead of taking their money now (and giving up 1/6 of the fees to the goverance). ",
