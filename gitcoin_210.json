By the Numbers During Gitcoin\u2019s 15th consecutive grants round, we raised over $4.2M!*  $3.1M matching pool $1.1M from contributors 39.6K donors contributing  *These numbers are our best estimate right now, as results continue to update. For GR15, we received roughly 1300 total grant applications, and approved 600 grants. The grants support team + FDD managed to resolve all outstanding appeals in an average time of under 72 hours per appeal. FDD also detected multiple grants that were not Main Round eligible, saving over $100k in matching funds. Our Sybil defense efforts are working!  A big thanks to all those that made it happen: GitcoinDAO teams, grantees, partners, and everyone that donated! Also worth noting is that Gitcoin grants has distributed a total of ~$69M in funds to open source software and digital public goods projects since its inception!  680\u00d7501 138 KB  In this issue of the Digest:  DAO Kudos   Hot Topics   Twitter Roundup   New Posts in the Governance Forum   This Week\u2019s GreenPill Episodes   Weekly Gitcoin Blog Roundup     New and Active Governance Proposals  Upcoming Events   And now, on to this week\u2019s DAO Kudos!

From the Governance Forum  Knowledge Transfer; Vitalik Buterin\u2019s reviews of Gitcoin Grants, by Owocki  Owocki wrote this post about Vitalik\u2019s involvement with Gitcoin Grants rounds 3-9, and he provides links to the review posts Vitalik wrote for those rounds. From Kevin:  \u201cI am writing this post in order to highlight these to members of GitcoinDAO as part of a knowledge transfer. If you joined GitcoinDAO in 2021-2022, you likely were not a part of Gitcoin during the time in which Vitalik was deeply engaged. As grants 2 approaches product market fit in both Ethereum + NFT/DEFI/L2 ecosystems, perhaps there are some nuggets of wisdom in the above posts.\u201d   Fileverse Grant Deactivation, by Disruption Joe  There are some new updates in the replies in this thread. Essentially, the FDD team paused Fileverse\u2019s grant over the weekend of September 9th, and later unpaused it, citing that there\u2019s no evidence of link between the identified Sybil attackers and Fileverse. Fileverse\u2019s team worked during that time to identify a network of Sybil attackers that had been targeting numerous Gitcoin grants with micro-transactions using ZK Sync. Momonosukke, posting for the Fileverse team in the forum, says that the Fileverse team is: 1) working on a forum post that will list some tools and recommendations that may make Gitcoin grants fairer and more transparent, and 2) working on a proposal to co-fund a bounty with Gitcoin, to build on the research and evidence the Fileverse has done during GR15.  Benefits of Using Price of Forgery in Gitcoin, by porobov_p  Upala founder Petr Porobov posted another installment exploring using \u201cPrice of Forgery\u201d at Gitcoin, which he claims will ensure a fairer trust bonus, safer matching funds, and monetizes aspects of Sybil defense. The post was originally written as a follow up for this GreenPill episode exploring the Price of Forgery concept. Petr provides extensive research on how the concept works, and how it might be implemented at Gitcoin.
