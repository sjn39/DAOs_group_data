It is rushed, and most probably contains some mistakes, and definitely lots of things left unspecified. It is here: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/eth_state/blob/master/State_Rent_2.pdf Main differences from the version 1 (apart from the organisation of the document, which is now series of \u201cchange cards\u201d with dependencies between them):  Linear Cross-Contract Storage removed, since it is possible to emulate its functionality by contracts using CREATE2 opcode. Priority Queue for eviction removed, eviction would be based on \u201ctouching\u201d, under the presumption that miners would not be able to censor evictions (if they had motivation to do so). Calculation of the correct contract storage size (accounting) introduced before the rent, to avoid some edge cases, where rent could become negative. Lock-ups with a fixed price introduced, to prevent or limit dust griefing attacks on pre-existing contracts, and to reduce the need to rewrite most of contracts. Possibility to exempt important contracts from storage rent by burning ETH prior or after the introduction of rent Temporal replay protection is preferred over the variant with non-zero nonces Rent price is assumed to be fixed, floating rent can be introduced in later versions of the proposal  ",

By the way, there is a 3rd version of the proposal available here: State Fees (formerly State rent) pre-EIP proposal version 3     Zerim:   The proposal specifies recovery for a contract from a hash stump but doesn\u2019t give much detail on the recovery of an externally owned account. What state is restored?    externally owned accounts do not really have a lot of interesting data in their state: nonce and balance (which is 0 by definition at the time of eviction). Whenever someone sends some ETH to such evicted address, it comes back, with a different nonce (this is fixed in the 3rd version to prevent effects on CREATE opcode).     Zerim:   If the nonce of an externally owned account is restored (and if it isn\u2019t, then why not?), why is temporal replay protection attached to this proposal (I understand that timestamp based temporal replay protection has other benefits, but specifically asking in the context of this proposal).    Temporal replay protection is removed from the 3rd version of the proposal, because it opens the way for re-deploying contracts that have been self-destructed. ",
