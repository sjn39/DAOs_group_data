                    "content": "Say I have an ERC721 contract (contract A). I want to build another ERC721 (contract B) that can  Generate an ERC20 tokens (contract C) over time, like 1 token a day, for contract B\u2019s owners. Can let all owners of contract A to mint 1:1 token from their # of Contract A\u2019s tokens owned for free and charge non owners X ETH fee. Can assign X amount of contract C\u2019s tokens to claim for free for contract A\u2019s owners. Even better if the more rare contract A\u2019s token is, the more tokens owners can claim for Contract C. Enable contract C token to be swapped on Uniswap pairing with WETH and have its own logic for auto staking, tax penalty for swapping the tokens (Like Safemoon). Can be listed on Opensea.io   The goal here is to provide value for owners of Contract A being able to get Contract B tokens for free, get free and earn tokens of Contract C over time. Contract C\u2019s token can be traded on Uniswap as any other ERC20. The priorities here are quick implementation, less approval for low gas and low complexity as possible. Preferably some off-the-shelf contract to base on. What would be the optimal solution for this use case. I\u2019d love to discuss about pros and cons of using ERC1155, ERC721 with an ERC20 child as property, ERC998, etc\u2026? Thanks ",
