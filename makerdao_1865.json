This post will effectively nullify MIP7c3-SP6, proposed on 2020-12-08 and ratified on 2021-01-30. The MIP7 process for onboarding Mandated Actors via domain teams was superceded by the Core Unit model and it is my position that the MIP7 model is now obsolete. I will continue to operate in my role as contributors and advisors to the Protocol Engineering Core Unit under Facilitator Derek Flossman. ",
