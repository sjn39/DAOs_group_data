Then we can use the ENS without special configure it in wallet. But for security,they can only use in the chain which using Proof-of-Authority.And the request should sent by the administrator of the chain. I think we can allocate a pre-build contract.It did\u2019t do anything in EVM but costs some ETH for gas to preventing attack.When we want to send a request to  identify a contract,we can send a transaction which  contains the address of the contract and its name to the pre-build contract.Then all nodes checks the permission of the sender of the transaction.If the check passed,then the node record the name of the contract. What do you think? ",
