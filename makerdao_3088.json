                    "content": "Following the work on MakerDAO accounting and implications, here is an application to yield farming. In accounting, the asset side is what you own and the liability side is how you finance that. The power of Maker is that it can add DAI to its liability and DAI has value (everyone can create coins but few can make them valuable). Initially, Aave has some ETH on it (Aave issue aETH when you deposit ETH). This was done by a third party. On MakerDAO we print some DAI. Increasing both asset and liability by a coin you control is a free operation.  On the second step, we lend DAI on Aave, we get aDAI tokens.  On the third step, we borrow ETH from Aave using our DAI collateral. We now have ETH as asset but have to repay them somehow which is a loan materialized by the dETH part. While we still have aDAI on the asset side, most of it is blocked as collateral (not sure on the details but it doesn\u2019t change the big picture).  image828\u00d7384 7.45 KB  For the final step, we add both the ETH and some new DAI to mint ETH/DAI LP tokens (equity of the pool).  image751\u00d7384 10.3 KB  Now the cool thing is that ETH price has no impact on MakerDAO solvency. If ETH value drop, the dETH part will drop of the same amount. Both aDAI and the Uniswap LP accrue fees which are revenues for Maker (on the liability side, only dETH accrue interest, but those are lower than the aDAI ones). The only issue is that if ETH price change, so does the quantity of ETH inside the Uniswap LP. So we need to keep the quantity exposure of ETH on the asset and liability side the same (more or less). We also need to make sure there is enough DAI as collateral (not too hard to put x10 more). Quite sure it\u2019s not impossible to solve. There will be a little bit of deviation (as the rebalancing will be discrete and not continuous), but most likely not much. An alternative is to lend the ETH on Alpha Homora (but the yield is lower and protocol risk higher). Therefore, the only main risk is protocol risk (Aave/Compound and Uniswap). I consider it low (as we will have vaults for Uniswap at 1% SF and Compound). While this is safe and lucrative, it works from an accounting perspective but how to implement that in a smart contract is an open question. Quite sure a $10M investment in both smart contracts will not change the economics too much and we can expect a 20% yield, i.e. $2M per year for almost no risk and no increase needed of the surplus buffer. What we need to aim for is to have matched books in terms of risk on the assets and liabilities side. This is modern banking. Does that makes sense to you or is it too far from Maker roots? ",

Logically, we would just be diverting it from buying/burning MRK since we wouldn\u2019t have other assets on our balance sheet to put up for collateral on our own system. So from a MKR holder perspective, what\u2019s the incentive on giving up some of the buy/burn function that is at the root of the protocol? Obviously bringing in more income to MakerDAO is a huge advantage, but if you\u2019re a MRK whale why defer your buy/burn for 5 years (in the scenario described above)? Now, incrementally as time passes, the MKR that the platform is buying has potentially (hopefully) gone up in value leading to less pressure from the burn mechanics, and you have no assurances that the income steaming from this set up will be used to make more buy/burn happen. Personally, (as about the furthest thing from a MKR whale) I would be all for this. It creates income for us to utilize, adds more TVL to the DeFi space, and only adds exposure to platforms that we as a community have already decided to add exposure to this year. But I wonder how we could convince the big MKR holders to vote with us, as they would be deferring DAI for burning and adding risk to a system that is (in theory) already set up to pay them out handsomely. If I\u2019m way off base I apologize, but to me that would be the real hurdle of a proposal like this. ",

It doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cdiverted\u201d from any place, as Maker is the ultimate source of all Dai. In this case, Dai is minted and immediately used for yield farming, at which point it is backed by yield farming assets. The real concern is that the protocol is then on the hook for any losses in the underlying asset, instead of a random user. This is also the main issue people have with printing Dai to purchase ETH. A hack in the yield farm, for example, would have to be insured by the surplus buffer or MKR issuance. This is basically a proposal to increase the intrinsic leverage of the DAO (which I have no problem with, BTW). It\u2019s a risk tolerance question. ",

But even if we were able to get around that with a vote (again I think unwise) we would still have the issue of getting whale support. Not only would they be taking on this extra risk from the yield farming protocol, but by creating unbacked DAI they increase the likelihood of having to mint MRK to cover and draw-downs, rather than just relying on the increasing burn rate the protocol is trying to achieve by having more vault options.

Only Dai in the hands of users is a liability to the DAO, because users will have the option to, at some point, redeem it for $1 in collateral. Dai that is minted and kept by the DAO is not a liability, because it will never be redeemed. The DAO can mint 10 billion Dai and keep it for itself and cause no problems until it is transferred out of the protocol. More importantly, if the DAO mints Dai, and uses it to acquire a priced asset (such as by swapping for ETH, or by using it for yield farming), and by the time of global settlement it is available for redemption, it is backed Dai. You can think of it as a special vault type that only the Maker DAO can use, but the DAO is not constrained in the amount of capital it can apply to the strategy like a normal user is. The other major difference between this special vault type and a normal vault is that Maker uses the collateral in a standard vault as insurance for drawdowns in the strategy. When liquidation fails, the strategy is then insured by the surplus buffer, then finally by MKR issuance. If you think of this as a special vault type, it becomes apparent that a DAO yield farming vault is actually a good way to rapidly build the surplus buffer. ",

Companies reinvest capital, both in R&D to increase revenue in the future, as well as capital investments to generate yield. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the discussion. @prose11 In fact nothing here is new Protocol risk: My impression is that protocol risks are binary tail risks. If the protocol gets hacked, all is drained. If there is a bug that renders the contract broken, all is lost. We will provide Compound and Uniswap LP vault so the tail risk is exactly the same. But here the reward is ay higher. And you don\u2019t have to play with stability fees to track Aave/Uniswap yields. Unbacked DAI:  USDC-A vaults were close to being undercollateralized (or were already depending on your definition). It wasn\u2019t a big issue as most were fine by increasing the surplus buffer accordingly. Leaving a vault undercollateralized for a client is giving him free money and should be avoided But having a vault we own undercollateralized and the delta accounted somewhere is just an accounting/technical limitation. If you want, we can use some DAI from the surplus buffer to add a buffer to the vault so it is always overcollateralized. It\u2019s really taking money from your left pocket to put them in your right pocket. I think it\u2019s best for everyone (mainly DAI users) to leave all that in the surplus buffer. But we need to be transparent and show a provision if the aDAI/Uniswap LP vault is underwater. Just like we should have done for USDC-A vaults. Stablecoin vaults were almost 4M underwater at some point. Also, the PSM will leave use exactly without overcollateralization. Funny collateral:  SIXS/RWA-001 will have no value, so from the vault perspective, it would be unbacked DAIs (real ones). We just know that somewhere there is a piece of paper saying someone will give us some DAIs at some point. Here, I\u2019m quite sure @NikKunkel team can find the price. We (will) have oracles for each component so the missing piece is to aggregate it. Not saying it\u2019s easy, far from it. So at worst, we use the SIXS trick and get the value off-chain, at best we have a nice on-chain price feed. Impermanent losses:  Balancing the position will cost a bit of money, but with a 10M position and a ~10% yield, it\u2019s peanuts I guess. Once a day, once an hour? I don\u2019t know. \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have used the word yield farming in the title. What we are really discussing here is to lend our excess DAI on money markets (just like any retail bank does) and manage a trading book (just like any big bank does, but here using AMM). Those are basics bank functions. The big step here is to have an autonomous vault instead of waiting on the market for someone to use the vault. If this step is too big we can provide the strategy to Yearn, they make a Y vault, and we onboard this collateral with a CR 125% and SF 2-3%. It\u2019s like giving a third party our power of DAI minting for just a small fee \u2026 ",

The valuation of a share-like asset is the sum of all future dividends. Since our only mechanism for dividends is buy/burn currently it would have to translate into that action. Additionally while this proposal increases revenue, it also increases cost and risk. I think it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019d be getting out more than we\u2019d put in, and I think this conversation would hopefully convince MKR holders of the same. Thanks for the rundown @SebVentures, I think by presenting the risks/continuation of previous decisions like you did in that follow up post it becomes clear that this proposal would be a win for MKR holders big and small alike. As long as we proceed with a relatively low cap (the 10M from your scenario seems like a reasonable start to me) I would now be fairly optimistic we could push it through. Really great proposal and thanks for taking the time to break down potential objections. ",

The issue here is that we are not delta hedged USDC (lending DAI to borrow USDC would be costly). So it really depends on your vision on USDC. It\u2019s less interesting conceptually for me, but could work the same. Farming is transitory, money markets and AMM are here to stay. But it\u2019s a building block so possibilities are endless. My favorite use case will be for yield curve trading (as that takes a good amount of capital for small spreads). This might push DAI on the spot until big banks come to the space. Regarding fees, with a 10% yield, a $10M investment generates $2700 per day. That should cover enough rebalancing even with gas at 500 gwei. The rebalancing is mostly oracle work and 2 uniswap calls, you compute the exposure of ETH in the LP and the ETH exposure on the debt side, then convert some DAI to ETH and add to the pool or do the opposite.     prose11:  I would point out extra revenue does not necessarily lead to higher valuations.   We can forward excess capital from this smart vault to the surplus buffer so it is burned. Or we can have the vault loan to match the vault assets.

Consider no Dai had been minted by vault holders, Maker minted 1000 Dai and deposited it at Aave. Someone borrows Dai from Aave using other collateral, then during ES, the Dai borrower can\u2019t receive collateral for their lien. Because they can only redeem Dai for aDAI, the value of Dai is circular, and basically unbacked. To be considered backed, the minted Dai must flow back to Maker (e.g. \u201clooped borrow yield farming method\u201d), where it cannot be in another user\u2019s hands for redemption. Or it must be exchanged for some other liquidate asset such as ETH. I think this implies that as long as minted Dai remains in the UNI LP pool, it is backed. But when someone sells ETH for Dai, it flows to the user and then becomes unbacked. In other words, the protocol doesn\u2019t only have to worry about the ETH/dETH repayment, but also the minted Dai/Dai in LP  repayment. ",
