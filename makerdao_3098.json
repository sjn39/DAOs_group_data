                    "content": "Hi, I have a suggestion to create some more forum subcategories. The reason for adding more subcategories is basically to facilitate more community participation on the most important subjects. Some of these discussions might already be ongoing in the rocket chat but in imo a chat thread is really very unstructured and it is more or less impossible to get an overview of what has been discussed. So maybe this is also a suggestion to move more of the subject specific discussions (i.e. not the #general discussions) onto the forum. Apart from creating additional subcategories I think it would be beneficial to structure the discussion a bit in these subcategories with additional subcategories so that eventually the forum will get a tree like structure. In these subcategories it would be really nice if the community/foundation could establish a list of hurdles that needs to be overcome before a specific future feature can continue development/research. Obviously we should avoid turning this into some reporting burden. But some short descriptions only of the most important/interesting subjects where the community could contribute with knowledge (or maybe reach out to people they know are knowledgeable on a specific subject). At the moment it seems a bit difficult to get an overview of where it is the most beneficial to direct your time as a community member when you have an hour or two to spare  For example I have a couple of topics that I find interesting and important which could maybe translate into the following subcategories. Governance \u2192 Community engagement \u2192 Participation rewarding thread 1: Is rewarding participation even possible without introducing attack vectors? Governance \u2192 Automating SF/DSR changes thread 1: A reliable DAIUSD price oracle thread 2: Is automating changes even possible in MCD Oracles \u2192 Oracle incentives \u2192 Decentralized oracle market thread 1: Is it possible in a truly decentralized and secure manner thread 2: Can we use external oracles as feeds This is obviously just examples but hope that it illustrates where I am trying to get at. However discussions on community engagement seems pretty urgent imo. ",

I\u2019m not convinced categories are the right way to do this though. My software dev background is showing through here, but in general when organising stuff it\u2019s better to aim for composition rather than inheritance. Tags are the tool for this, and it resolves the problem of what to do when a particular topic impinges on multiple sub-categories. (As a crude example, what happens when we have a topic involving community engagement in the process of automating SF/DSR changes.) That said, I\u2019m not against some more \u2018sublevel 1\u2019 categories below governance and oracles. Both \u2018Engagement\u2019 and \u2018Incentives\u2019 might make sense under governance and oracles respectively. At the moment there\u2019s not a huge amount of tag moderation going on, but if people think this would be useful for discoverability, I can start tagging older topics as appropriate.     ginworkflow:  In these subcategories it would be really nice if the community/foundation could establish a list of hurdles that needs to be overcome before a specific future feature can continue development/research.   I really like this idea, but I\u2019d love it in the form of a pinned index topic rather than split across the forum. It would be wonderful to be able to go to one place and find out the current state of the various mentioned initiatives across governance. ",
