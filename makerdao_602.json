                    "content": " Moving the ESM Threshold Increase to Next Week Hi everyone, This week\u2019s spell will be going ahead for the polled core unit budget streams and transfers, however Protocol Engineering will be postponing the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) threshold increase to next week.  Summary of the change  As polled, the ESM threshold will be increasing from 75k to 100k MKR.   Rationale for the delay  The ESM change being implemented is a complete redeployment of the module (not just a parameter change) which will now allow Governance to modify the threshold without the need to redeploy a future module and all of its associated rely and deny authorizations. There are comprehensive code changes in the above to support the new functionality. It is necessary and desirable to have a week of burn-in on Goerli to ensure correct operation. The beginning of this week was focused on the urgent flap executive which demanded time away from this task.   Scope of changes involved in the ESM Update Following are the list of changes that make up this ESM executive to help give the community a sense of the changes, including:  Adding a wards structure for governance access Adding a governance configurable minimum MKR threshold for ES. min  Adding a governance configurable end address (previously immutable) Adding a one-way governance circuit-breaker to disarm the ESM Adding a variable live to indicate whether the ESM is active. Note that disarmament is permanent and is intended to safely render an ESM inert, therefore once disarmed, it must be replaced Changing the function to disable dependencies from deny to denyProxy  Adding event logging to denyProxy  Documentation updates  Changes are open-source and merged in the ESM repository.  FYI Cross-Team Coordination  Front end UI\u2019s will be able to reference this change in the on-chain changelog and in the changelog.makerdao.com site under the MCD_ESM key (Version 1.10.0).  ",

The change you reference allows us to modify the end contract with a future governance vote without having to replace the whole ESM.
