If I\u2019d like to permit to view or update the part of my profile, should the issuer be myself? I\u2019m thinking of ERC721-like profile system using delegate the ownership, not permitting to transfer. ERC721 has metadata attributes to add some off-chain data location. What\u2019s the difference between DID and using ERC721?  Thank you! Jinserk ",

Id like to try work together to perhaps refactor methods \u201crevoke\u201d \u201cisValid\u201d etc to use 1812.  Love to hear your thoughts. For example, my \u201cPermit\u201d Struct is pretty much identical struct Permit { \t\taddress issuer; \t\tuint256 start; \t\tuint256 end; \t}  ",
