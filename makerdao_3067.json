                    "content": "In order to gain a better understanding of the Maker ethos I figured I\u2019d pose a question and let everybody dunk on me. Gaining DAI Market Share Now Money Markets are driving rates in crypto and DAI needs to take advantage of the current environment. The recent popularity of LPs in crypto has place immense pressure on securing capital. This in turn has generated scarcity on more stable assets and in particular stablecoins. DeFi users are benefitting through this scarcity in the form of generous lending rates on various platforms. Meanwhile, the effects of this are being felt within the CeFi realm\u2026 In the leveraged trading market funding rates are becoming lopsided. The ability for traders to hold a position is becoming more and more expensive. That\u2019s attributed to the shortage of capital in the market. In effect trading volumes in CeFi will drop, token prices will become less volatile and overall market activity will cool off as well. As a trader that means holding stablecoins is the best avenue for gains in terms of risk/reward. What it also means is there aren\u2019t enough stablecoins in the market. (granted the options market needs to develop to help alleviate some of this, but that\u2019s another topic entirely\u2026) This is Maker\u2019s opportunity to jack up rates to where things are uncomfortable in the money market. But instead, Maker remains incremental in change. Which I thoroughly respect\u2026 But to push the needle on comfort levels for a moment\u2026 the opportunity to open up vaults in such a manner where DAI can supply the market with what it wants is here right now. The market wants stablecoins. If its done DAI as an opportunity to gain market share and become a defacto form of capital that\u2019s used on various platforms (ie - dYdX, CeFi?, etc). The Economics of Being Uncomfortable Now, a lot of readers might think this exposes DAI to incalculable risk. But does it? Once DAI is flooding the market, the peg can begin to drop to $1 or slightly less. Which signals Maker can crank up rates\u2026 the hike in rates will in short order result in more demand for DAI and bring the peg back to where it needs to be\u2026 $1. This means Maker can find equilibrium where enough DAI is in circulation to alleviate DAI\u2019s prices from going too high and rates are high enough to where the demand for DAI increases its value upwards to $1 if its price sags. Where this somewhat unrealistic equilibrium theoretically becomes out of whack is with market volatility along with other natural market activity do what they do\u2026 Because when prices stay stagnate or go up, this somewhat simple way of viewing things holds water. But when asset prices go down things seem to get out of whack\u2026 When prices go down, CDPs get paid or liquidated, the demand for DAI grows in order to pay off the debt (pushes value north of $1), DAI supply is reduced, MKR holders get rewarded\u2026 Yet the peg gets temporarily inflated. Which can be ok in the short-term. However, for those that don\u2019t believe its ok then there needs to be more DAI in supply to drop the rate down to $1. Which is where we normally turn to lower rates\u2026 but when asset prices are dropping, who wants to take out an ETH CDP? I personally want cash. That\u2019s why rate changes when asset prices are dropping is like watering a lawn in a rainstorm. Ineffective. What to do? I\u2019m not sure. But making DAI go brrrrr when asset prices drop won\u2019t help. This eventually results in DAI flooding the market and being devalued permanently. That\u2019s what the USD does. I\u2019d argue lower rate adjustments should only take place once DAI returns to par value. This would indicate the storm has passed\u2026 And any QE measures would be more noticeable. To sum this all up, I\u2019m essentially asking the community two things\u2026 Why not be more accommodative to the markets and supply it with DAI\u2026 And why not allow the peg to rise during economic downturns? OR if there is really a lot of opposition to a DAI value greater than $1 when asset prices drop, is there a way for CDP holders to insure against this? Thank you for taking the time to read my convoluted thought process. I\u2019ll admit, the idea behind this is in fact selfish because I\u2019d like figure out how Maker can take advantage of the current market environment to gain stablecoin market share. And in turn, raise rates to reward MKR token holders. Nonetheless, if DAI does in fact earn market share it\u2019ll translate to Maker success. Thank you kindly for your time, Ben Lilly ",

                    "content": "So a couple things off the bat I wanted to question/comment on. Firstly, there is approx. $0.5B in available debt ceiling that can be issued in DAI, so it doesn\u2019t seem to me like Maker is holding back the chance to get some stable coin action, it\u2019s just that many users feel their collateral should be generating interest as well, taking them to other platforms. We are entertaining the idea of creating deposit interest, but in the mean time plenty of people are still finding the economics compelling enough to issue DAI. Next up, the whole point of the Maker system is to have a governance token and a stable coin. Stable coins make sense for so many reasons in terms of finance, but also give users the chance to pay employees in a crypto that won\u2019t be worth less by the time you receive it. Could we let DAI float? Absolutely, but the whole point of the project is to create a real stable coin, not one that\u2019s based on backroom custodial arrangements like USDC. Users can take confidence that their DAI is worth $1 because it is overcollateralized and itself represents a debt someone needs to pay back. Maker will always value the DAI at $1 and try to keep exchange prices near that point. Perhaps this is incentive to create a new project? One where the token\u2019s value is based entirely on collateralization and market demand, not trying to maintain a peg? ",

                    "content": "Thank you for the reply! Agree the $1 peg explanation. Completely makes sense. In no way attempting to question the addressable need DAI fulfills. Regarding the float\u2026 in the scenario I describe I only discuss a float when asset prices as a whole are dropping. This leads to increased vault closures and demand for DAI in turn. This increase in demand would put pressure on higher DAI prices. Which is what we saw unfold in March where DAI commanded 7-8% premium at times. And if Maker values each DAI as $1, then when that peg breaks its a natural incentive for users to want to mint more of it. Which means there is no reason to drop interest rates to zero\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m not fully educated on why ETH rates were so low for so long? Was this a way to incentivize usage of the ecosystem? What are some of the reasons you believe $0.5B is not being utilized? Do you think its a natural barrier that exists in the market? A barrier where there\u2019s only a certain ratio of assets that tend to get deposited into Maker? If so, what\u2019s your opinion on why that\u2019s the case? B ",

                    "content": "These are some great questions! So one issue with floating the DAI in a drastic drop is that also has implications for vaults. Already during a sell off, we\u2019re at risk of mass liquidations. Adding the borrowing amount increasing in USD would put further pressure on vaults and lead to a more unstable environment where the DAI supply might actually shrink do to liquidations and pay offs. It would be even more problematic to keep the peg within the Maker ecosystem while it is floating elsewhere as users would pay more per DAI and then have it worth less with Maker, leading to further potential undercollaterized vaults. Not a fun scenario. A far as ETH rates, part of it is definitely incentive based (from a jumping off point, ETH makes a lot of sense as a main collateral given its necessity for DeFi transactions, but it is certainly overweight given the growth of Maker now), but additionally with ETH being so cheap to borrow and with other outlets offering a (small) deposit APY it is also a way to ensure users find good value on the Oasis platform. As for the $0.5B, I think a lot of it has to do with our debt ceilings (DC) being too large for assets without a lot of demand. We want to strike a fine balance where people can access liquidity with any collateral type we can safely put on the books. At the same time we don\u2019t want to keep any one token on our books to the point of being overexposed to a price drop. IMO, the $0.5B of excess DC is fine, but it seems to be in the wrong places right now. This week\u2019s vote should help improve that and as we are adding new collateral options and gauging user appetite for different collateral factors we will gradually start to approach our current DCs.
