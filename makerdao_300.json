We are still stuck a bit on whether to increase the AAVE D3M DC - your own comments @PaperImperium expressing concern with respect to multiple risks.    We also are in effect minting unbacked DAI to do this vs. using DAI from SB to do it. I think when we are looking at proposals we need to be mindful before we start something whether we fully intend to scale it to make it profitable to the protocol\u2026   I really want to make sure whatever we roll out has a ROI to cost to implement that is > 100% at the DC we intend to target.   Or that there is some return component that offsets the costs involved. For the above reasons I abstained because it is not clear to me we are going to easily get past the risk components here and I am loath to run headlong into another project that will have a cost that we are not going to scale to get a return.

This is a tool that we should use carefully, very carefully, but we should not be afraid of using in the right way. It is what makes us different from all other lending platforms (including Aave, Compound, \u2026) It\u2019s not unbacked DAI. It is backed by aDAI, which is a promise to be repaid by Aave.

How risky, that\u2019s for the Risk team(s) to assess. But it\u2019s not unbacked DAI.   Maker vaults and economics depend on a token deposited that has an oracle price such that the position is overcollateralized.    With the PSM we basically take on the idea that assets can price 1:1 and in fact in the protocol actually set this value to 1.  Should USDC, or aDAI or USDP for any reason trade significantly off 1 presents itself a significant protocol loss hazard and something we have to be very mindful of when adding more of these. USDP, USDC at this point is fully 100% liquid on our books (yes I know there behind the scenes is discussion about putting this to work) aDAI may not end up fully liquid for some reason, but if we believe AAVE mechanics the return on aDAI will go through the roof if it isn\u2019t liquid. Personally I think there is some use here, but this isn\u2019t without risk, particularly liquidity risk. ",
