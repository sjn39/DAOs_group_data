Currently anyone who just owns MKR benefits from a stable system, governed by the few, by the burning mechanism but it seems clear to me after a year, that that by itself is not enough incentive to get the majority of (small) MKR holders to participate in voting. So what\u2019s the idea, increase the amount of MKR needed to pay off the stability fee when a CDP get\u2019s closed by a little, like 1% or only burn 99% of the current fee and keep 1%) and instead of burning that 1% like the rest, immediately send it to a random address currently voting for the most recent governance poll  (nomatter what option they are voting for).   People will be incentivised to keep up with voting since the faster they are voting for it, the more chance they have to receive 1% MKR of a payed SF. (every payment of a SF would immediately reward a random current voter voting for the most recent governance poll)   Every extra amount of MKR matters to smaller holders so they should be extra motived to participate.   Reduces incentive to delegate your vote (which is a good thing IMO)   Yeah but whales will just spread their MKR over a 1000 addresses to increase their chance of getting extra MKR Technically they can, but who in their right mind would want to start voting from a 1000 different addresses?! Even assuming it would be possible to automate this in some way, they would still have to pay for gas for a 1000 voting transactions don\u2019t they (? actual question) and I don\u2019t think the amounts of potential MKR \u201cprofit\u201d I\u2019m talking about here makes it worth while to do this for anyone already owning more then 1000 MKR. (anyone holding +1000 MKR should already have enough financial incentive from a stable systems burn mechanism) There would obviously need to be  some conditions to reduce the benefit of such \u201cspreading\u201d behavior so I would suggest (just some ideas to start from):  only addresses voting with +1 MKR have a chance of receiving this \u201cvoting fee\u201d. if the amount of (1% of the fee) MKR to randomly reward exceeds x.xx MKR, it gets split up and rewarded over multiple random voters (according to a formula to be defined).  Combine this idea with @mrabino1\u2019s idea to have a weighted voting system and I think you will have a lot more smaller voters, who\u2019s vote also actually moves the needle, if only a little. . Can\u2019t wait to hear what loopholes I didn\u2019t think of you greedy bastards  ",

It\u2019s not paying people, it\u2019s adding a chance of receiving an extra reward for active participation and the more you participate, the more chance you have.

There are a couple of \u2018solutions\u2019 to the Sybil issue, but they all have pretty major tradeoffs:  Reward based on the staked/voted MKR (more MKR, higher rewards). Tradeoff is that you lose the incentive for smaller voters. Ensure that the gas cost of voting exceeds the reward. Tradeoff is that in reality this in no sort of reward at all, as the voting cost is now higher than the reward. Only reward above a fixed threshold. Tradeoff is that everyone below this threshold is disenfranchised, and it still doesn\u2019t prevent Sybil action by larger holders.

I\u2019m sorry, but I think this is just wrong. Sybil behaviour is always an issue. Even if it\u2019s not worth the trouble for large holders (big if), it will be worth the trouble for medium holders. If it is worth the trouble for anyone then at some point someone will develop a bot that automates the process which can then be used by large holders. Like, it\u2019s just axiomatically worth it. If: Chance of winning * reward > gas cost for entry, then it is worth it to Sybil attack*. But the reward is only a reward if the above is statement is true. It can\u2019t be both a non-proportional reward and be Sybil safe. The fix is to make the reward proportional based on the amount of MKR you voted with, but this makes the system even more plutocratic. * Any one time cost to setup a bot would be quickly overcome by the continuous future reward. Furthermore, you are essentially excluding any medium holder from using the Sybil mechanism based on the technical expertise to setup an automation solution (which means one would eventually be published to resolve this unfair imbalance, and then be usable by large holders too).

I recently laid out a framework and reasoning for incentivized voting, full post here: https://ethresear.ch/t/incentivized-voting-a-theory-on-greater-network-engagement/6457 In short these mechanisms can be evaluated using modern rational voter theory where voter utility can be expressed as: U = qB \u2212 C + T Where q = the probability voter is pivotal B = Benefits if ballot wins C = cost of voting T = extra benefit of voting The reason larger voters turn out is because they have a high probability of being pivotal which outweighs the costs ( C ). This is not the case for small voters which for the same vote will have a negative expected utility. In those cases incentives can bring the utility back to positive. The utility to the voter and the accuracy of the votes can be further enhanced by introducing voter credits, where the voter has the option to claim their fee and accumulate their votes for a future poll which has a high benefit to them allowing them to increase their probability of being pivotal in such votes and not voting merely to collect fees and distort the collective sound judgement.

This will make them stay active so they have a higher probability of being pivotal when there is a ballot of important consequences to them. To stay they are just being paid to move the mouse and click is oversimplified. The cost in terms of time and money in on-chain voting is significant for small holders. From acquiring MKR, to setting up the wallet for voting and then figuring out how to vote can be a significant investment of time and then the recurring gas costs of voting is a cost that impacts small holders more than large ones. incentivization probably would not even fully compensate them where it\u2019s profitable to just show and vote but rather help offset those costs. At the end of the day we don\u2019t expect our elected officials and corporate board members to do proper research and voting for free, but with on chain governance the expectation is that stakeholders show up week after week and pay for the privilege of voting? Again, I refer to the framework of modern voter theory to explore other ways to create positive utility value for voters. This also includes reduces costs through things like offchain vote aggregation which would eliminate gas fees for voters and not clog up Ethereum with everyone voting but rather just have anyone submit a merkle root of all the aggregated signatures and grieving period for anyone to submit a fraud proof.

Very interested in this! Thank you for sharing. That said, I think I can see some issues. No matter how many credits you gain as a smaller holder, there is always the chance that a larger holder has stored up more of these credits than you have. Does it really increase probability of being pivotal in future votes? The assumption seems to be that smaller voters will gain credits, and that larger voters won\u2019t? (Though I suppose it increases everyone\u2019s chance at being pivotal in comparison to those that aren\u2019t actively voting.) Your notes on engagement theory are interesting, and I agree that a small voting reward would probably help with engagement, which would hopefully lead to more active and informed participation. How exactly would you implement voting rewards in your proposed framework? Presumably in proportion to the amount of token (+voting credits?) used to vote. So in this case, a portion of stability fees divided between voters based on their stake? Have you given any thought to rewarding only voting credits, or does that nullify the incentives significantly? ",

                    "content": "The utility with voter credits should be higher for all stakeholders and part of the reason why is that different stakeholders have different preferences and knowledge and now they can incorporate intensity of preference and knowledge. A more indepth exploration is outlined here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531&download=yes The same paper also introduces and attempts to provide proofs for quadratic voting, which also increases the probability of a voter being pivotal, however at this time quadratic voting is not sybil resistant without strong identity which is an unsolved problem, while voter credits are sybil resistant. Funding a pool for each vote and allowing each voter to claim a proportional amount of the funds in the pool Each voter would be able to receive a payout according to: POOL_SIZE X AMOUNT_VOTED / TOTAL_AMOUNT_VOTED I don\u2019t have a strong opinion as to where the funds should come from (it could also come from a portion of MKR that the foundation has earmarked for network incentivization), but I think the compensation should be in MKR so the reward creates a feedback loop for participation that increases stakeholder stake in the network. I think rewarding based on voter credits cast instead of just showing up for each poll should from a rational behavior perspective be worth a bit less because of time value of money being received at a later date. However people don\u2019t generally discount things using a pure utility model, see prospect theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) so they may end up discounting it more severely, it also might have the perverse effect of incentivizing people to vote sooner so they finally receive some compensation for their credits.

If the goal is more people - I don\u2019t think we have an accurate means to measure \u2018people\u2019.   If the goal is more MKR voting.   Then I think that is measurable but I honestly am not sure this is the goal. The real issue here is the whole 1 MKR = 1 VOTE.   I liken this to 1USD =1VOTE.   The only system we get out of this is whales accumulating more votes because they have the financial ability to.    Trying to incentivize the people runs into the sybil or unique identity problems.    I\u2019m skeptical of credits honestly. I think there is a real perception out here that whales basically control everything.   If you were a MKR whale would you feel more or less threatened/secure if either another MKR whale showed up, or whether this was a group of people with 50K + MKR that voted in unison.  Honestly if another MKR power group showed up would everyone else feel more or less satisfied with respect to governance vote participation? Where I think the rubber hits the road here is who has sufficient votes to carry a vote (how many are required) vs. sufficient votes to potentially signal a ES.    Anything below this has less power than those who have more than this. Also I still have not seen any sort of data regarding governance votes historically so I honestly don\u2019t have a clue what has been going on voting wise vs. what is desired. When I was thinking about this I started looking up MKR holder distribution\u2026 I was thinking about the 100-500MKR crowd and that this group was the group to incentivize as they are large enough voting blocks to potentially make a difference in votes, and should be reasonably incentivized because they hold a fair amount of MKR etc. Until I see some measurable historical data, and see a presentation of a measurable goal I honestly don\u2019t see how moving forward on this is possible.

Apologies for resurrecting such an old topic, but I prefer building on previous discussions over introducing new threads, especially considering that I\u2019m really new to the ecosystem and don\u2019t feel ready yet to just start new posts as I like (for fear of increasing the noise-to-signal ratio)\u2026 Also especially considering the nature of the topic, and the real potential that this may be a naive suggestion, I\u2019d rather just get a \u2018temperature check\u2019 on it\u2026 Anyway, @MakerMan have you heard about Ergo\u2019s Storage Rent mechanism for\u2026 Well, I am reticent/loath to call it a punishment\u2026 But it\u2019s a mechanism for charging a fee to older, potentially abandoned wallets, in order (among other things) to recoup \u2018dust\u2019 and also funds from \u2018lost\u2019 wallets, etc, and return that ERG into the ecosystem\u2026 My (again, potentially naive) proposal would be that Maker consider something like this for wallets that don\u2019t vote\u2026 After a period of time (or x number of votes not participated in, etc) a small amount of MKR could be removed from the wallet and go somewhere where it will be useful to the protocol as a whole\u2026 I think the obvious hurdle in implementing this would be whether you can tracks funds across wallets\u2026 Otherwise, a simple transfer to a new wallet before the deadline for the fee to begin (or even once it has begun) would \u2018reset the clock\u2019\u2026 But I wonder: If someone is active enough to move wallets before the fee begins, couldn\u2019t they also just participate enough to avoid the fee as well\u2026? Also, this could be a way to attract more delegation instead of actual, individual voters\u2026 If funds are delegated then they\u2019d be immune to the fee, since their MKR is de-facto actively being used in governance (by the person they\u2019ve delegated to\u2026) I also wonder how this would impact the locking of MKR into DeFi protocols, etc\u2026 I think depending on the time-scale of the fees beginning vs. the average DeFi lock-up period, this might also disincentivize MKR holders from locking their MKR up for too long to earn interest/yield, since after a certain point it would then also start getting hit by these inactivity fees\u2026 FWIW: It seems to me that locking your MKR into DeFi (especially for longer periods) is antithetical to the Maker ecosystem, so the added bonus of disincentivizing it is a good thing, but I could be wrong\u2026?

How would Maker be able to track wallets? In addition you either introduce the possibility of simply transfering from one wallet to another to reset the timer or we\u2019d need some sort of system to track each MKR. Even if we managed to track them it would turn into a nightmare because it would make decentralize trade in the token almost impossible as you now would have to take into account how close each token is to \u201cexpire\u201d unless used for voting. Having tokens disapear from users wallets is also almost guaranteed to be a public relations nightmare. Therefore I think positive incentives to vote is a better way to go. For actors inclined to vote I think delegation already offers some real value. Delegation cuts down on the time investment to get informed voting. It allows you to increase your voting power by aligning with others that share similar views. It ensures consistent voting without worrying about deadlines, and it is less costly regarding fees. So the real nut to crack is how to positively incentivise voting in such a way that it increases governance participation. In my view using your tokens for voting must at least produce a yield similar to what you\u2019d get lending your MKR on other protocols. ",

I wholly agree with the problem of tracking wallets or even individual tokens; I would not actually propose that and, again, I think that if someone were willing to be active enough to open a new wallet every X months (or whatever), then they could just as easily delegate their vote and check-in on their delegation every X months instead\u2026  Having tokens disapear from users wallets is also almost guaranteed to be a public relations nightmare.  Implementing a mechanism like this would unavoidably be, to one degree or another, controversial\u2026 However, I personally think that A) We can never make decisions out of fear of how a vocal minority might respond, because there will always be someone out there ready and waiting to give you sh!t no matter what decisions you make / actions you take, and B) There\u2019s a solid case to be made that the MKR token as a tool for governance has always been and always will be the only way the MakerDAO can remain a truly \u2018decentralized and autonomous organization\u2019, and that holding MKR has always been and will always be first and foremost about the power of governance it bestows the holder and not about the speculative value it has (value as leverage/collateral within the larger DeFi community, beyond its actual market value) Of course, I\u2019m being way too optimistic here, but my point is that I\u2019d like to think that the majority (of people who even follow Maker or who would care about this) would see an \u2018inactivity fee\u2019 as a way to protect Maker and ensure its continued ability to be self-sovereign, etc, and not as some horrible evil perpetrated upon unsuspecting holders\u2026 Basically \u2013 and I recognize this is a bit of a hard-line on my part \u2013 but if you\u2019re holding MKR and you\u2019re not living up to the responsibility that comes with it, then you\u2019re doing it wrong\u2026 The \u2018put my money where my mouth is\u2019 example is that I\u2019ve really wanted to accumulate MKR over the past few years (I could\u2019ve bought at $250!!) but didn\u2019t, explicitly because I didn\u2019t feel it would be fair to hold it and not vote with it, and I knew that I didn\u2019t have the time or energy to expend getting involved with the whole governance process\u2026 And I\u2019m only finally holding some MKR now because I have some ability to participate, and especially because I now have the ability to delegate my vote to one or more delegates, which reduces the burden quite a bit (but does not eliminate it)\u2026  So the real nut to crack is how to positively incentivise voting in such a way that it increases governance participation. In my view using your tokens for voting must at least produce a yield similar to what you\u2019d get lending your MKR on other protocols.  I agree that a positive incentive is likely the way to go, and I\u2019m not actually advocating in favor of an inactivity fee necessarily\u2026 I simply find that when I\u2019m sitting in a conference room with my colleagues and we\u2019re working-out a problem, I am often the one who can propose something \u2018wild\u2019 that either itself turns into a solution or (more often than not) at least kicks people out of the one mode / train of thought they were on and gives them some new perspective on the issue at hand\u2026 Also, FWIW, I disagree that rewards for voting/delegating \u201cmust at least produce a yield similar to what you\u2019d get lending your MKR on other protocols\u201d\u2026 My Cardano wallet, for example, has been staked since their Proof-of-Stake system launched (before that, even, during their Incentivized Testnet), and has earned an average of \u201conly\u201d 4.5% in that time\u2026 And I am very happy with this considering that staking (on Cardano) is a risk-free venture (there is no \u2018slashing\u2019 mechanism, etc)\u2026 I do not and will not chase a few more points in DeFi lending when the risks go up exponentially\u2026 And I feel very much the same about Maker governance rewards\u2026 I\u2019m personally incentivized to do it with zero reward (beyond the fact that the core incentive is to ensure the continued existence and the general increase in value over time of my MKR)\u2026 However, I will say that some incentive (akin to Cardano\u2019s) would make all the difference in making the choice much easier, and I would\u2019ve made it much sooner as well\u2026 And I think anyone holding MKR and not lending it (at least) would, like me, be quite happy to get something (especially when it\u2019s risk-free, presuming it would be) for spending a little time here and there participating in governance (likely by delegating)\u2026 I mean, a little something compounded is way better than nothing\u2026 Ok, that\u2019s all\u2026 Thank you for reading, to anyone who made it this far\u2026 ",
