From collateral-specific parameters, all the way to system-wide parameters. You can filter the data by parameter name, collateral or by date, allowing to answer the following questions and more:  What were the protocol parameters at this date? What impact or changes did this executive vote have on the protocol? What were the historical values of this parameter for this collateral?  We provided 3 new endpoints:  parameter_list: list of all available parameters parameter_snapshot: the value of the parameter parameter_events: the change in value for the parameter  You can pair any of your datasets and analyses with a good glass wine the parameters dataset to understand the effect of spells on the protocol. We strive to make data accessible to as many people as possible so if you don\u2019t know how to work with the API don\u2019t worry, reach out to us and we\u2019ll find a way to help you.  Other additions to the API We\u2019ve improved the governance dataset and now we also provide a dedicated endpoint for spells. We\u2019ve included an item called \u201cimpact\u201d which lets you know how many protocol parameters it has impacted. We\u2019ve also created a new executives endpoint; while the original one allows you to get all events related to the executive, the new one acts as a summary of all available executives, including their human readable title!  A quick note about data accessibility We are constantly trying different ways to help people access data as easily as possible, so with that in mind, we are exposing the raw tables feeding our GUIs (Governance Tracker, Vaults Tracker) for anyone to download.
