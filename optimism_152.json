                    "content": "Proposal to Airdrop $OP to Ethereum Network Validators Authors: GLCstaked (Discord: GC23997#6415) Intent: Include Ethereum network validators in $OP token distribution. This proposal targets solo validators who made at least one deposit to the Beacon Chain. This proposal excludes LSD (liquid staking derivative) token holders and staking as a service customers. To bring value and longevity to Optimism by onboarding ecosystem-aligned actors who have proven their early dedication to Ethereum. These Beacon Chain depositors are likely to partake in governance and node operations on Layer 2, arguably more so than basic users of Optimism. This proposal sets a precedent to incentivize those actors who have been working to further decentralise the L1 validator set. Incentivizing Ethereum validators benefits both Ethereum the base layer and Optimism network, reaffirming Optimism\u2019s goal to fund public goods in the broader ecosystem, and we expect that other L2 protocols will follow this precedent. Recipients: total 10,182 Addresses from this list ETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses/Validator List.csv at main \u00b7 GLCNI/ETH-Solo-Validator-Addresses \u00b7 GitHub Tokens claimed on Optimism network, To the same address on L2. Airdrop Allocation: 3.2% of the remaining 14% future airdrop allocation OP: 601,295,421. Which is a Total OP: 137,438,953 of the Total OP Supply: 4,294,967,296 This leaves 10.8% of OP supply for future airdrops.  OP ALLOC775\u00d7379 87 KB  Token distribution: 137,438,953 OP to be distributed equally to all eligible addresses. Rewards on the basis on whether an eligible deposit was made and not number of validators, the list contains all unique addresses that made a valid deposit to the Beacon Chain, addresses belonging to centralised exchanges (such as Coinbase/Kraken), LSD services (such as Lido/Stakewise) and contracts have been removed. Data from https://ethsta.com/, more information can be found on the filter list. Previous discussions/links: Airdrop Ethereum Validators (Beacon Chain Contract Depositors) https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/udbwlm/beacon_chain_validators_should_be_included_in_l2/ Optimism Alignment: Digital democratic governance optimised to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralised ecosystem. The Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable. The Collective will consistently provide massive retroactive incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. Distribution is highly important, not only wide but also targeted to the right set of stakeholders. Rewarding ecosystem aligned participants will bring value to Optimism governance. Validators have locked ETH and operate nodes to secure Ethereum via proof-of-take consensus, this is the fundamental infrastructure layer for Ethereum. Once deposited to the beacon chain contract validators have committed a non-trivial amount of capital until the merge, they must be positioned for long term success of Ethereum. They must provide physical infrastructure or pay for it to keep your validator active on the Network, which incurs electricity costs, hardware costs, internet provider costs and time/effort for maintenance. Validators will have: Proven: aptitude to run node operations and service the network Proven: long term alignment with Ethereum, especially pre-merge Proven: \u2018proof of work\u2019 actual resources and effort is spent to secure the network, and this cannot be gamed. As such, validators should have a say in the development of L2 networks, and would be a set of participants that bring value to L2 and a strong foundation of network shareholders primed to run the decentralised node set of the L2. Benefits to Optimism & Ethereum: We believe this is not only value additive to Optimism, but mutually beneficial to both networks For Optimism Onboard a strong set of ecosystem aligned users, interested in long term sustainable models, Which participate in governance and public goods funding. Value to governance: this set consists of builders/devs & very dedicated early supporters, proven by commitment to early risk pre-merge, It would be valuable to have these as stakeholders in Optimism. Those responsible for the base networks security/infrastructure should have voice in the direction of layer 2. Strengthen the future node set of Optimism network: ensure a strong foundation of the Optimism community to run the nodes and decentralised sequencers when they are ready. Many validators have expressed interest to run nodes/sequencers on layer 2, and it will be trivial for existing validators to add to existing operations. L2 networks want to have a decentralised node set that is run by the community with many node operators, and not in the hands of a few institutions. For Ethereum Layer 2 is essential for Ethereum to reach mass adoption, Including these participants sends a strong signal of rewarding meaningful support that will have positive effects on L1 that will benefit the L2 layer by having a stronger foundation. Positive External Incentives: Increase Validator Decentralisation Centralisation of ETH staking is a growing concern for Ethereum, and proof of stake. Ethereum has prioritised decentralisation & sustainability, allowing end users to participate in network consensus. Optimism is also aligned with this goal; however, the conditions of the merge timeline has allowed centralised institutions to gain a large market share over individual stakers.  ETHSta Distro1396\u00d7783 100 KB  LIDO (stETH) accounts for 31.30% of deposits to the beacon chain. LSD holders benefit from liquidity without needing to lock ETH or run nodes, this allows additional yield to be earned in DeFi on top of the base staking yield. It is currently more profitable and easier to stake with a service like Lido than it is to run your own validator, all work and maintenance involved in running a validator/s is abstracted away and handled by a centralised institution, this has hindered unique validator growth harming the network\u2019s security/decentralisation. Coinbase accounts for 14.61% % Kraken 9.35% of Beacon chain deposits, by allowing users to stake their ETH through their exchange. This means a single entity is holding this ETH and staking across their own validators, not only is this damaging to network decentralisation, a single entity holding this much is a massive honeypot for hackers. We see a trend where individual stakers (\u2018others\u2019 in the chart above) are diminishing, centralised institutions are catching up as the incentives for solo validating simply struggle to compete with current LSD. Execution risk of the merge has some influence over this, but even post merge due to the ease of LSD allowing holders to gain exposure to yield, have liquidity and earn additional yield in DeFi. We are still likely to see favour in LSD, APY is simply not attractive enough for the majority of would be Stakers to lock up/join the exit que and have to maintain node infrastructure when similar results can be achieved via LSD. This proposal has the potential to turn the tide on the current problem of Ethereum\u2019s increasingly concerning centralisation. By creating external incentives to run solo validators, many more ETH holders will be willing to put the extra work in running their own validator for the additional incentives. increased \u2018implied\u2019 APY, this will take market share away from CEXs and LSDs. It is also likely that other L2s and projects will follow suit, This is in line with Optimism\u2019s vision for Public goods. A stronger Ethereum foundation is beneficial to the Optimism network as a layer 2 on Ethereum that relies on the trust assumptions/security of layer 1. We see a similar effect on Gitcoin Donations: Gitcoin participants have become increasingly included in project airdrops. resulting in increased ecosystem funding, though the motivations may be profit seeking it does not detract that this creates an environment where more public goods are funded. Likewise with governance, many who would have been apathetic to public goods and governance are much more likely to pay attention and contribute to these activities. Why the exclusion of LSD holders, and exchange depositors: Because this has been brought up in previous discussion, the following explains the main reasons  Difficulty: due to liquidity of these tokens it makes it easier to game as people can spread these to farm airdrops, add the extra challenges with liquidity pools and tokens held on exchanges. Incentives: Expanded in the previous section, reduces the effectiveness of this proposal to increase validator decentralisation.  I strongly encourage everyone to support this proposal. A stronger infrastructure layer will strengthen Ethereum\u2019s value and economic potential. There are solutions around the corner to run \u2018shared\u2019 validators with as little as 4 ETH, eg:OBOL network and SSV. It is essential for the long-term success of Ethereum that we do not allow the chain to be captured and monopolised by a few entities, external incentives such as this will have a positive effect on decentralisation. other info on LSD: https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd Acknowledgements: special thanks to @0xboodle, @superphiz, @kevkillerke for their feedback and support ",

I agree it\u2019s best fitted for airdrop #2 than anything else but not sure if we have a vote on that.

So far the Optimism Collective includes:  Optimism Users and users \u201cPriced out of Ethereum\u201d DAO Voters Multi-sig signers Gitcoin Grants Donators on L1 OP Token Buyers  Some are solo stakers for sure, meaning they may get a bit more tokens but I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. As previously said, solo stakers get \u201cpaid\u201d meaning we shouldn\u2019t see (at least I don\u2019t see) this reward like a financial compensation for their work/participation but instead like a way to give them more voting power (since they play an important role). I guess more people deserves (more) tokens in order to make their participation in the collective more meaningful but since I\u2019m not sure how much we can suggest I will abstain until we have some guidance on if and how we can help with the next airdrop.

So I dont see a point in this proposal from Optimism\u2019s point of view.   Explained under benefits to optimism   value to governance, considering the experience/expertise of these actors   ability to run nodes/sequencers for optimism in future   would create incentives that help strengthen L1 decentralisation, which benefits any L2 that inherits security from L1   this concerns \u2018airdrop\u2019 not public goods funding, airdrop #1 was around onboarding community to bring value to optimism, further airdrops should be the same, validators would be value add, considering the resources committed and ecosystem support. @Prometheus mentioned the various actors that make up the op collective, why not include those that run the L1 infrastructure? considering optimism would not exist without & inherits its security from, and is looking to decentralise its own infrastructure in the future.

There are 12,775 validators in the solo-validator category of which I believe the vast majority would be prime candidates to run OP infrastructure on its path to full decentralization. On the improvements #reviewed for false positives, filter list has been greatly improved #Coinbase accurately identified and is the main culprit accounting for 86% of the unique addresses depositing to beacon chain contract. This is due to the way they conduct deposits, with a fresh new address generated per deposit. #Most staking as a service/LSD providers deposit through a contract and are not included in the list by default More detail in the Repo ",
