I\u2019m using @SebVentures Dune Analytics dashboard for historical data and doing a projection from there on. I had a few questions to build out my model: P&L:  What are lending expenses? How are they paid (using DAI from Surplus Buffer? From Operating Reserves? If using MKR, then from where?) Similarly, how are Workforce expenses paid?  Balance Sheet: 3. What are trading assets on the balance sheet? Are these the assets held due to trades through the PSM? What factors would determine the growth rate of these assets? 4. What are Operating Reserves for? What determines the operating reserves kept? In what form are they kept on the balance sheet (in DAI, MKR?) Thank you! Paritosh ",

It comes from the Surplus Buffer. Workforce is paid from the Surplus Buffers. Trading assets are indeed the PSM (and some stablecoins vaults as they will be migrated to PSM at some point). We offered a bid/ask spread hence generating trading revenues. This is no longer the case. Trading Assets are more to be seen as a Liquidity Buffer? The size depends on the imbalance between DAI demand and DAI Supply, you can read more here. Operating Reserves are multisig controlled by MakerDAO but managed by CUs. CUs budget are moved from the Surplus Buffer to those multisig and under the management of the signers. they can return the excess cash if needed. It\u2019s in DAI.  ",

A couple more questions I missed asking:   I think the current reserves at ~$60mm are low (~1.4% of assets) to manage market dislocation events like we saw last year. I\u2019m assuming that the reserves will have to increase progressively to ~3.5% of assets over the next 5 years and that any gap would be filled by issuing additional MKR tokens. Do you think these are fair assumptions?   Is my understanding correct that currently MKR holders don\u2019t have direct claim to the DAI held in reserves (apart from benefiting from MKR being burnt when reserves are in excess) and one bet is that they\u2019ll have direct claims in the future to the reserves (proxy for equity)?

My assumption (based on the previous conversations I also saw on the forum) is that the stability reserve will have to increase in line with the total assets to protect the peg (including due to regulator mandates as DAI grows). I\u2019ve assumed total equity (including stability and other reserves) grows steadily to 3.5% of assets by Dec-2026. To fund this, we\u2019ll have to issue MKR in return for DAI. Please let me know if my assumptions don\u2019t make sense. ",

They do have a claim to the Surplus Buffer, MKR holder can set the limit to 0 and burn it all (or do some expenses). They can decide the level of Surplus Buffer they want to protect the solvency of the system. Even with only 1%, it can be argued that Maker is on the safe side of DeFi stablecoins. Frax is negative ~15%, Terra is circular. Fei and Angle are positive but with a strong currency mismatch (Fei is mostly ETH on the assets and  on its liability, Angle is  as asset and \u20ac as liability). It is my view that we should build the Surplus Buffer strongly, especially as it is difficult to catch up if we endure strong growth and low return over assets. I would doubt that the MKR community would issue MKR for that. The Surplus Buffer is there for tail risks and currently, we have plenty of tail risks that wouldn\u2019t be avoided even with a large Surplus Buffer. ",
