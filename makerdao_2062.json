                    "content": " Poll Notice: Confirmation of Trial DssKiln Deployment  Notice This post is to serve as notice of a forthcoming poll being collaboratively proposed by the Facilitators of the GovAlpha, Protocol Engineering, and Risk Core Units. The poll will go live on 2023-01-09 at 16:00 UTC.  Discussion MKR voters ratified MIP74: Permisionless Open Market Operations in the June Governance Cycle. A Signal Request for a trial deployment to burn 3 million DAI of MKR was successful and approved on-chain. At the time, an unsuccessful attempt was made to overturn the vote for the trial deployment. DssKiln is approaching the end of the audit process. The latest estimate from PE is that it will be ready for deployment within the next few weeks. The GovAlpha, Risk, and PE Facilitators have unanimously decided to submit a poll to confirm that voters still wish to pursue this trial deployment, given the following:  Time elapsed since initial approval. Changed market sentiment since the approval. Changing priorities within the DAO since approval (Endgame). Fall in MKR price. The initial controversy surrounding the vote.  This allows us to gauge voter sentiment prior to moving to an executive vote, which could prove problematic if voters no longer wish to proceed with the approved burn. This will be an IRV poll that will allow voters to select from the following options:  Burn 3 million DAI worth of MKR, as approved. Burn 2 million DAI worth of MKR. Burn 1 million DAI worth of MKR. Burn 0.5 million DAI worth of MKR. Do not burn any MKR. Abstain.   If any options for burning MKR are the IRV winner, we will proceed with deployment in an upcoming Executive Vote. If \u201cDo not burn any MKR\u201d is the IRV winner, the trial implementation will not proceed. We will proceed with the previously approved implementation if no option achieves a majority of votes. The \u201cdefault\u201d option for the poll will be \u201cBurn 3 million DAI worth of MKR, as approved\u201d.  This request to poll is in keeping with the Facilitator powers defined in MIP41 and MIP16. Depending on the outcome of this poll, a follow-up poll may be required to settle on values for:  The lot - the maximum quantity of tokens to be sold per hop. The hop - the minimum number of seconds that must pass before the lot can be sold. The yen - the ratio of spot price to the Uniswap TWAP price over the past scope - defaults to 100%. The scope - the time period of price data from the Uniswap TWAP against which yen will be measured - defaults to 1 hour.  ",
