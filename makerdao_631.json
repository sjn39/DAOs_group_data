Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegates\u2019 MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with for compensation calculations is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier. MIP4c3-SP24 passed in the September Governance Cycle. This has amended MIP61 to use a 120-day rolling window for calculation of delegation metrics.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2022-12-09.

The requirements are defined in MIP61. The listed delegates do not meet these requirements so do not qualify for compensation (hasu and gauntlet - participation and communication; monetsupply just communication). FWIW I think the current system is probably too punitive by looking at a Recognized Delegate\u2019s \u201clifetime\u201d performance for compensation. The idea behind this was to encourage consistency and long-term performance, but I think we\u2019ve possibly over-tuned things. At present, it can result in leaving Recognized Delegates with a large hole to climb out of if they miss a few votes near the start. Expect some changes to the process being proposed by GovAlpha and others in the near-ish future.     SelenaPotter:  I feel like they should be paid something if they attracted delegations   The issue with basing compensation purely on delegated MKR without qualifiers is that any MKR holder could spin up a delegate contract and farm DAI from the protocol - there needs to be some additional requirements in place to prevent this from happening.     SelenaPotter:  clearly active both in the forum   Forum activity is rewarded separately through sourcecred. Recognized Delegates are also eligible for off-chain incentives for making governance proposals. ",

Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegates\u2019 MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with for compensation calculations is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier. MIP4c3-SP24 passed in the September Governance Cycle. This has amended MIP61 to use a 120-day rolling window for calculation of delegation metrics.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2022-11-01.

Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates. For the indicated delegates, we have taken the date they announced their new contract addresses on the forum as day 1 of this 30-day period.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegate\u2019s MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2022-08-10.

PVL has not yet been delegated any MKR so does not qualify for compensation. Jason Yanowitz has not yet communicated any voting decisions, so does not technically have a communication metric on which to base compensation. However, they are still within the 7-day period for communicating voting decisions after a vote. Given they have only been active for 3 days, their entitlement for this month would have been 7 DAI. If they complete their communication within 7 days following poll closure, we will roll their 7 DAI into September\u2019s compensation. Overall Compensation for August 2022: 117,445 DAI.

Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates. For the indicated delegates, we have taken the date they announced their new contract addresses on the forum as day 1 of this 30-day period.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegate\u2019s MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2022-09-07.
