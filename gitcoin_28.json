                    "content": "I think there is so much potential in investing developer relations at Gitcoin. This is informed by my experience as an Software Developer who has heavily relied on Open Source packages through the years. The objective of this thread is to start a conversation. What should the developer relations practice at Gitcoin look like? Here are the projects that need developer relations I\u2019m aware of at GitcoinDAO 2022.  Proof of Personhood Passport Grants 2.0 (any other GitcoinDAO software products on the roadmap which need a thriving developer ecosystem) I\u2019d welcome corrections from any workstream leads on the above list. The above is just my best approximation of the products on the roadmap as they currently stand in the DAO.  I know that in Grants 1.0, our documentation was quite paltry - it was hard to find, we did not invest a lot in making sure it was updated, and there is generally not a very thriving developer ecosystem built around Gitcoin\u2019s APIs & open source code (though the gitcoin.co product does have plenty of active users, many of them are developers). We have an opportunity to reset this as we transition from company to DAO, from Grants 1.0 to Grants 2.0. So here is my prompt to you:  What does good documentation look like? How can we make developers first class citizens of Grants 2.0? How can we enable a thriving ecosystem built on top of GitcoinDAO\u2019s products?  As we all know from the Grants 2.0 post, \u201cOnce grants 2.0 is launched, we will have created an environment where the community can test different public goods funding mechanisms on top of a deeply liquid registry of grants.\u201d. What will that community look like? Where will we find them? How will they be enabled? How will they be incentivized? What kinds of tools will they build? What kinds of new innovation will be unleashed in mechanism design by this ecosystem. I\u2019d be curious if people in the community would be interested in putting forward a proposal to the DAO to formalize a developer relations practice at GitcoinDAO (which currently resides in multiple different groups at varying levels of coordination) One area I think there is possibly an opportunity is to form an area of practice around Developer Relations which spans across different proucts/workstreams.
