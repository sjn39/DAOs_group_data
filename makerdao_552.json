However, this would seem to encourage the creation of a team that is not really accountable to the DAO. By accountable, I\u2019m thinking about the suffering content production CU. I don\u2019t think anybody is really to blame, but it seems like there was a breakdown in communication of expectations that is being scrutinized and hammer out by delegates. I\u2019m skeptical that anybody else besides big delegates like @flipflopflapdelegate would have had enough clout to threaten to rug this CU. As painful as it must be, I\u2019m glad that CUs can, in practice, be rugged. In the future, let\u2019s hope that is it usually just a theoretical threat and that conflicts can usually be resolved before things get so heated. In order to make the task of understanding the DAO tractable, I think I\u2019d advocate for more core units like the Strategic Finance Core Unit. This is an introspective CU that basically makes the activities of the DAO easier to understand. In contrast, I think increasing delegate compensation high enough that delegates could hire their own team is probably the wrong direction. I\u2019d rather see investment that benefit all delegates rather than invest more in individual delegates. ",
