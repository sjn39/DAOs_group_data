                    "content": " Summary The goal of the public goods funding workstream is to help increase the interest in public goods within the web3, and to increase the funding for and the usage of quadratic funding based systems. Over the last 6 months, we have made significant progress on both fronts, and we are requesting 100k GTC in Q1 to forward this mission as explained below.  The initial workstream proposal was successfully passed on 7th August 2021 through a snapshot vote, and allocated 45k GTC to instantiate PGF. As a refresher, in Q3 we proposed 4 key activities:  Help set up processes to manage the GitcoinDAO treasury Create grassroots efforts to increase community empowerment and participation Build a team for moderating shared governance spaces Scale the operations for and usage of Gitcoin Grants  Our top level KPI continues to be to increase the GMV of Gitcoin Grants and related public goods funding mechanisms, both by scaling the right people into grants ops related roles, and by forming relevant strategic partnerships to further solidify Gitcoin as a credibly neutral public goods funding mechanism.  Our Journey so far The following aims to explain what the Public Goods Funding (PGF) workstream has achieved in the last 24 weeks (as of 13 December) while spending ~25k GTC of a Q3 budget (55% of the budget thus far), and opting out of applying for a Q4 budget until we were ready to scale. We are now ready to double down on our activities much in the same way that Moonshot Collective did in Q4 with their 100k GTC request, and are requesting a top up of 100k GTC to scale the work we\u2019re doing.  Q3-Q4 Summary Let\u2019s start by talking about the initial goals as set out in our original budget.  Manage the GitcoinDAO treasury   After building out an initial strategy PGF handed off further work to CrossDAO ops, an emerging cross-workstream executive body built to help scale core functions of the DAO Treasury management is now being led by Shreyas from PGF alongside Christine from FDD, with input from other stakeholders and contributors   Grassroots efforts to increase community empowerment and participation   PGF has put forward a number of initiatives to foster a community that cares about public goods, including the Public Library and Public Goods Are Good  Many of our key contributors over the last 3-6 months have come through this work (probably ~20 total contributors providing measurable value across the DAO)   Moderating shared governance spaces   Moderation was scaled up by PGF as part of our launch, when spam was overloading channels; while there\u2019s still work to do on moderation, looking at comparables by community size like Uniswap shows that we have achieved a huge improvement in signal / noise over a relatively short period CrossDAO ops is now helping to continue this initiative as part of \u201cDAO support\u201d as proposed, and passed, in this proposal    Getting community input on our grants rounds   Gitcoin Grants Round 12 (GR12) has been our largest yet, with over $3m in net-new funds raised for the matching pool, and 30% more contributions than GR11 Ongoing activities are in progress that are likely to raise $3-5m in additional funding prior to GR13 This is still a key PGF function and will continue to evolve as Holdings and the DAO merge   Continuing Activities and Proposed Budget In Q1, we are seeking to spin up and continue the following efforts for the public good:  Grassroots Community Efforts (20k GTC)  With the success of our existing programs, and some new ideas in waiting, we want to: 1. Continue to improve and grow the Public Library  Continue to have >20 attendees for >5 weeks Scale and standardize the onboarding process so we can keep quality high (Bhaumik has agreed to come on to help here) Grow the number of partnerships between the library and related communities (e.g. Crypto Culture and Society) Continue to invite on the most aligned thinkers on public goods like Griff Green (discussing token engineering public goods economies), Niran Babalola (on funding public goods), and Simona Pop (on designing for human thriving) Leverage our documented notes, recordings, and tweet summaries (sample 1, sample 2) to prepare detailed research on the state of public goods thinking in web3  2. Continue to expand the reach of Public Goods Are Good  These weekly Twitter Spaces were envisioned to help solidify Gitcoin and its parters key forces pushing forward Public Goods by interviewing folks who have presented in the library more formally, for a larger audience, following up each post with a summary (sample 1, session 2, session 3) Guests so far include Griff, Niran, Manu, and Aya. Other sessions with matching funders from ENS, Synthetix, NounsDAO, and more were aimed to coincide with Grants Round 12, holding with 10 total sessions taking place over 4 weeks to help drum up interest in Public Goods especially regarding the journeys of people behind these organizations.   Gitcoin Grants Operations (45k GTC)  As mentioned earlier, running grants ops through PGF is an evolution and formalization of the initial idea of \u201cgetting community input on our Grants rounds\u201d. This initiative has been led principally by many across leadership, and in Q4 we managed to get >$3M for our matching pools. We also started new Thematic rounds for organizations focused on Advocacy, Climate, and Longevity:  Climate Change - $250k - Funding projects combatting climate change Longevity - $65k - Funding open science & longevity research Advocacy - $900k - Funding projects that defend digital human rights and help improve crypto regulation  We have also continued supporting Ecosystem rounds with our partners:  Uniswap - $50k - Supporting open source in Uniswap\u2019s ecosystem led by Connor Polygon - $100k - Supporting open source in Polygon\u2019s ecosystem led by Michael/Chris Forefront - $25k - Supporting open source in Forefront\u2019s ecosystem led by Jihad ZKTech - $50k - Supporting open source in zk\u2019s ecosystem led by Michael Synthetix - $75k - Supporting open source in Synthetix\u2019s ecosystem led by Kyle/Annika Gitcoin Building Gitcoin - $25k - Funding projects building Gitcoin\u2019s ecosystem led by Connor Finally, we have ongoing efforts to build relationships with other organizations that can begin to support our public goods funding efforts on their own (e.g. NounsDAO, Momus Collective, PleasrDAO)   Community Partnerships  (35k GTC) The goal is to work with organisations through token swaps, partnerships, and by incubating new ideas directly under PGF. Notable token swap proposals:   DeveloperDAO proposal - issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 5% of Developer DAO when governance is live to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3  PrimeDAO proposal - grant Gitcoin $250K USD worth of PrimeDAO\u2019s $D2D governance token at a price of $0.50 per token for a total of 500K $D2D coins, equating to 0.5% of Prime DAO treasury to help ensure that Gitcoin and Prime can work together to build tooling for DAO2DAO coordination  Notable partnerships and incubations:  Gitcoin helped incubate and provide initial funding for Verses led by Jasmine Wang and hopes to continue public discourse around the kinds of values we want to see in web3 as it scales; several drops are in planning incuding with groups like Metagov and Fight for the Future. Gitcoin helped incubate and provide initial funding for 0xPARC alongside a number of other organizations to help further application level research (e.g. Dark Forest) Gitcoin partnered with Reboot to help run the a next iteration of its call for new kinds of public goods  Gitcoin has partnered with DreamDAO to help onboard the next generation of web3 creators  Efforts to Create a Public Goods Coalition  This initiative is currently nascent and was born out of an initial idea to create a public goods coalition, which any number of DAOs could join by pledging 1% of their treasury or an acceptable equivalent i.e. $5m. This work is currently underway and is helping to build the associated lore and narrative framing, an initial rough draft can be found here: Public Goods Coalition - HackMD  For the broader announcement, we want to \u201cgreen pill\u201d people into actively contributing to public goods, to achieve a \u201cMatrix-style\u201d awakening of the state of society and web3\u2019s role in fixing it. More details coming soon!  If you have any questions about this budget proposal, please comment below! Edit: At the request of some comments below, I have increased the partnerships budget by 10k GTC to further scale the number of collaborations we pursue in Q1. Any unspent funds will be accounted for in a write up similar to the above for Q2/Q3. ",

This budget request is definitely a prime example of how other workstreams should apply for budget, accountability for the win. A few notes:     ceresstation:  The following aims to explain what the Public Goods Funding (PGF) workstream has achieved in the last 24 weeks (as of 13 December) while spending ~25k GTC of a Q3 budget (55% of the budget thus far), and opting out of applying for a Q4 budget until we were ready to scale.   This is impressive, especially if you see the impact this workstream already has had. Ideally I hope we can come to a point where we can just link to a sheet per workstream on how funds were exactly allocated (FDD is setting a good example here), but I know this is being worked on under DAO Operations. The fact that you did not even spend the Q3 (!) budget just yet deserves loads of praise in any case.     ceresstation:  Community Partnerships (25k GTC) Led by Scott/Vishnu, the goal is to work with organisations through token swaps, partnerships, and by incubating new ideas directly under PGF.   On this: I would propose to actually increase this part of the budget, at least double it. PGF has already proven to be accountable with funds (see above), and I think it would be good to have some reserves to support other public goods initiatives through partnerships and sponsoring, this will become increasingly important, especially if the market would go down again: we need to be there to support community initiatives that support public goods.  Ps. Public Goods are Good. Thanks to everyone in the Public Goods Funding workstream, and especially you Scott, you are a force of nature and have been moving mountains. I hope the community sees this, the DAO wouldn\u2019t be here without you. ",

The one thing I think is missing, though, is an overall view of how this particular budget relates to the larger budget of the DAO as a whole. If I am to make a vote as a steward of the DAO entire, I feel like I need this context. This proposal asks to scale up its budget, which I\u2019m sure is justified, but does that come at the cost of other parts of the overall picture? Is this budget asking to increase the overall expenditures of the DAO as a whole, and are those types of increases part of the plan? What would happen if every workstream doubled its budget? Again, I\u2019m sure everyone recognizes that I support this group as much as anyone else. \u201cPublic Good\u201d is my mission as well. At least for me, though, I need to see this budget in a larger context. I\u2019ll vote for it, regardless\u2026 Sorry if I missed it in the proposal, perhaps someone will correct me if I have. ",
