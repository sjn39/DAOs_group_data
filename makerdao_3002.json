                    "content": "I\u2019ve created a repository called dss-gov-rewards which houses the contracts to enable paying out rewards to MKR locked in governance. Why? Maker security relies on binding MKR holders to the consequences of their votes. This assumption is broken for MKR that is borrowed on a lending platform. We have solved the most extreme version of this with flash loans, but the underlying problem remains. Fundamentally, Maker is not secure if there is more MKR available to borrow than there is locked in Chief/DssGov. The simplest and probably most robust way to solve this is to pay people to lock their MKR in chief and thus keep their MKR off the market. Implementation dss-gov-rewards is a lightly modified rewards contract from the UNI LP pool rewards. MKR IOU tokens can be deposited in, and you get rewards out. Both the staking and rewards tokens are arbitrary, so this can be used for rewards in either DAI or MKR depending on what governance wants to do. Additionally because this is a separate module from dss-gov, it can be deployed for the current Chief as well as DssGov. I\u2019ve also added DaiRewardsDistributor as an example of how rewards can be done via the keg module. The idea here is to siphon off some % of the MKR burn and redirect it to rewards. The nice thing about this is we can adjust that % to control for how much of a ratio we want of MKR on the market vs locked in governance. Alternatively the rewards can be made in MKR as well if the community desires. Another bonus of this module sitting completely outside governance is that we can upgrade it very easily. We simply shut off rewards to the existing contract and switch them to a new contract. IOU tokens are completely opt-in to whichever contract they want, so people will move over naturally. This may be useful in the case where DeFi liquidity pools start automatically depositing into rewards (similar to what Compound does with Dai and the DSR). Security This module is using code that has already been audited and tested in production, so it should be safe to use. Additionally, since it is sitting outside the core Maker system, and only interacts with the IOU tokens there is limited room for catastrophic bugs. Worst case scenario we can just turn off the reward stream and we burn a few days of revenue. Discussion Looking for feedback on the route governance wants to take with this. Do we want to distribute rewards in MKR or DAI? Should we divert some portion of the MKR burner into rewards (% of profit) or should we pull it as a fixed operating cost? What % of profit should be used? Should we target some ratio of MKR on the market vs locked in governance. Please note that I\u2019m expecting for historical reasons the Foundation cannot comment or be involved with this project. ",

The main reason is to secure the system against having too much MKR on the market. This is a classic prisoners dilemma game theory problem where individual defectors (MKR holders who loan their MKR) are rewarded with interest on their MKR. The only way to prevent this in my view is to give them a better offer. So yes taxes are unfortunate depending on your politics, but I don\u2019t see any other way to solve this. Keep in mind I suspect we may not need to go very high to beat the market. Aave offers 1.25% interest on MKR, so with 29M in fees / year we would only need to run the rewards at 20% of the burner to match that. ",

In a way it\u2019s good, but you also bring the risk to see more people voting just to get reward, without taking time before taking a decision. When you have fewer rewards, you have fewer votes. But at least those votes are made by involved members. ps: I have to admit that i don\u2019t know everything about Maker DAO and how you are planning to reward people.

                    "content": "The disadvantage of rewards in DAI (coming from collected fees) is that they will be negatively correlated with MKR price/Marketcap (in % terms). E.g. to match the current 1.2x% yield on AAVE, on current 180m USD of MKR locked inside voting contract, Maker would need to spend 2.2m DAI yearly, but this 2.2m DAI will be only 0.6% yield if the MKR price doubles. As you can see, the \u201cproblem\u201d is as MKR price will rise the rewards (in % terms) will decrease, but this doesn\u2019t apply to money market protocols like AAVE or Compound. So if/when the MKR price increases significantly we will be back where we were, the rewards will be negligible in comparsion to interest rate offered by money market protocols. This problem doesn\u2019t apply to rewards coming from MKR supply inflation, because as the MKR price rises (or decreases), the rewards do too (in $ terms). Both types of rewards have its pros and cons and in my opinion some % combination of both is superior to either alone. E.g. when MKR price is low: [80% burn, 20% DAI rewards], 0% MKR supply inflation/rewards, when MKR price is very high: [0% MKR burn (surplus buffer increased), 0% DAI rewards], 100% of rewards coming from MKR supply inflation (for example 1% supply inflation).

First, stated goals are:  Reduce borrowable MKR (to prevent malicious use) Encourage voting participation (raise threshold for malicious actions)  Imagine we create this rewards contract for staking governance Maker IOU token (call it GovMKR) to earn Dai. First, some MKR holders will prefer continue maximizing MKR value (as pure MKR burning does), so if they get Dai they\u2019ll want to reinvest it into MKR.  However, like other rewards \u201cfarming\u201d activities, that can be laborious and expensive at small scale.  Therefore we should expect to see something like a yMKR yearn vault which fixes that problem with scale, as it does for other rewards farming, and automates re-investing in MKR. Some MKR holders will do that to maximize rewards even though it means giving up voting rights! So either the vote is effectively delegated (e.g. to YFI holders) or, the yMKR vault might be designed to just not vote at all. In the former case, the original goal of making MKR unavailable to borrow (for system security) is potentially undermined.  Depending on how the vault is designed, it might still allow a malicious user to vote with all the pooled MKR.  In the later case, it has the effect of making voting impossible, which also leaves the system less secure, since at least some MKR holders might have voted. What if the staking contract rewards in MKR instead of DAI? This might be a bit better actually. Now, the same person who wants to continue maximizing their MKR value can just deposit to the voting contract and stake their GovMKR to increase their MKR balance. Since there\u2019s no need to harvest Dai and reinvest, there\u2019s no need for a yMKR vault. ",

However, there are a few mechanisms we can use to keep this number low.  It takes time and effort to build a contract which pools liquidity, and inserts that liquidity into MKR rewards. We make it very clear we do not want this, and present a credible threat that we will just redeploy the contract if the liquidity on these markets becomes too liquid or possibly start using a blacklist if that ends up being easier. It\u2019s a bit of a cat and mouse game, but I think we have the upper hand. MKR holders should be aware of the dangers of lending out their MKR. Rewards can help to reduce the chance of defection from any individual, but ultimately it\u2019s up to them.  In any case we need a tool to combat high APYs on lending markets. The lending rates are not super high right now (~1% on Aave), but imagine if that goes up to something like 5%+. I could see a situation where the trade offs of listing your MKR on the market is too high for the individual to resist with an \u201ceveryone else is doing it, so I might as well too\u201d mentality.

One comment that I would like to add is as follows: If someone has held onto and voted with their MKR for over a year, they may be able to claim long-term capital gains (tax-friendly) when selling at a later time. If this system (as I understand it) is implemented, then this user will either have to (a) trigger a taxable event to continue voting or (b) stop voting. If this user\u2019s tokens\u2019 value is high enough, and they believe it will continue to rise, I would suspect that they choose (b). It is unclear how many MKR voters are in this category, but if the number is relatively high (compared to the number of current voters), this could be detrimental to the voting system\u2019s strength. I do not think a decision should be made based on tax jurisdictions, but I think it should be considered. Edit: Additionally, if more migrations were required (such as DSChief v1.2 Migration) at a later time that caused the IOU token to be deposited and a new, upgraded one withdrawn (thus triggering a taxable event), then the user mentioned above is even more likely to chose option (b) above.

Dai is already above peg, so sending Dai as rewards to a staking contract where there probably won\u2019t be a high velocity of usage will lead to Dai sitting dormant and potentially lost over time, which keeps upward pressure on Dai price. Flaps put more Dai on the market immediately which helps the peg, so as long as less value is being issued to governance participants than is being burned in auction. Additionally, if you want to reward MKR holders for performing in the governance process, the best way to do that would be to increase their relative weight of voting power by issuing more MKR to them. Then it\u2019s up to them at that point whether they want to compound their voting weight or sell to something else. But if the assumption is that they\u2019re being rewarded for good governance, they should probably be given the opportunity to govern more. From a tokenomics perspective, staked MKR will probably stay staked and stay off the market for a while anyways. ",

Example: $10,000 MKR deposited on Aave $2,500 USDT debt drawn $2,500 USDT > ETH ETH goes up 100% in a year $2,500 debt paid off $2,500 profit I understand there is an interest rate on that debt, but ETH can go up a lot more than 100% and this is just a simple example. In this example, the user did not care about the 1% he was earning from depositing MKR on Aave. He only cared about the 25% APY he earned by using his debt for leverage. So if Maker were to offer 1.5-2% for depositing into the Gov contract, it may not draw in many people at all during a bull market. ",

It solves two chief issues:   Low voter participation in MakerDAO. Especially considering the ETH gas fees right now.   Unexciting tokenomics driving unexciting token price, which drives unexciting sentiment and unexciting token price. Even though MakerDAO is the undisputed king of Defi in terms of TVL, the \u201cunexcitement\u201d is causing the MKR token to have some of the lowest P/E ratios and TDV/TVL ratios in the sector (for example, MKR compared to AAVE, 34 vs >10000, 0.17 vs 0.69). This stems from a flawed tokenomics model, even if the core business is sound.   I also suspect long term that sentiment of a network/token will also drive usage of said network/token (in layman\u2019s terms \u201cwhales shilling their bags\u201d, whales including individuals and VCs). Hence even though, as mentioned, MakerDAO still has the highest TVL in Defi, dominance in terms of the percentage of TVL in defi captured by MakerDAO is idling near all time lows. If this continues the TVL crown may not stay with MakerDAO for much longer even if total Dai goes to new all time highs. MKR cannot continue to rest on its first-mover advantage laurels and continue using a tokenomics model that is quantifiably lagging new entrants, so I\u2019m glad this is under discussion. Nonetheless, I hope there is an update on getting this to an executive vote soon. ",

While acknowledging the objective is to encourage voting and maintain the hat, another method instead of causing the equivalent of a dividend would setting forth an options model. The option model being that based on how long your MKR is locked in the governance contract that you (or the delegated MKR) would accrue an option to acquire MKR at a discount. This discount would be controlled by governance. Further, the notion that you have locked your MKR also would start a weighted average on the MKR strike price.  (e.g. locking in early\u2026 and locking for a long-time is the objective). Then only when the option is exercised the protocol would \u201cmint\u201d new MKR \u2026 and my understanding of tax law would be that the discount received would be taxable (but it was deferred). Key points on the above is that it would require some decently complex coding (though compared to DSS it \u201cshould\u201d be easier) but it would further align interests of the DAO to reward voting\u2026 thoughts?
