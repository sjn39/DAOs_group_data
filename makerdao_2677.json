If @charlesstlouis agrees, I think we just don\u2019t put this through the formal governance cycle, mark it as Accepted with a note saying that it was voluntary and wasn\u2019t voted on and have @charlesstlouis as the MIP Editor just remove Cyrus from the MIPs. We should also do this with Rich Brown and Mariano. It\u2019s definitely still good to get a forum post / subproposal that confirms that someone is voluntarily offboarding though. ",
