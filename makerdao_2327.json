                    "content": "A question came up in the internal chat asking what, if any, the risk of a USDC stability fee of 0% posed to the system; the following is my response, posted here at the request of others. I think that this is well understood by those who expressed their concerns about adding USDC in March, but I want to share here for those who are participating in governance votes that are determining the collateral fees. The collateral stability fee is essentially an insurance policy against the risk of the protocol taking losses against a given collateral type. USDC is much riskier than it appears because it is centrally managed by a company that is subject to U.S. regulators. The USDC token has a blacklist mechanism that can be toggled if they are ordered to do so. The current regulatory climate for stablecoins does not look not promising, think of how Zuck got pulled in to testify over suggesting that Facebook create their own coin, and the Federal Reserve and congress have recently been making sweeping statements about their dislike of stablecoins. It is very likely that U.S. regulators could push on Coinbase/Circle to blacklist the Dai adapter to weaken MakerDAO. At that point, all of the USDC would be frozen in place and can\u2019t be transferred in or out, so we can\u2019t liquidate accounts and users can\u2019t withdraw collateral. The protocol would incur a total loss for the balance of USDC on-hand, which could be worth up to $20 million dollars. A USDC stability fee of 20% (the rate of the USDC fee when the collateral was deployed) is basically an insurance policy that the adapter won\u2019t be blacklisted within the next five years, at a 10% fee, 10 years. At 0%, the system is subsidizing all of the risk that USDC will be shut down in the future. I\u2019m personally not comfortable with that. We\u2019re still reeling from an $8 million loss a month and a half ago, I\u2019m not sure that the system can handle the PR backlash and fallout from $20 million in losses and a frozen adapter. ",

There is close to zero % likelihood (much lower than ETH flash crash) that the USDC custodians would be forced to black list the Maker adapter without giving people a warning and time to unwind their CDPs.  People who have open CDPs with USDC  have done nothing wrong right now and there is no plausible mechanism for the US govt to seize the funds of innocent US citizens without going through a long legal process that would give people time to unwind their positions. Furthermore, if a criminal was identified who had deposited USDC into a CDP, the USDC custodians could easily just freeze the depositing account rather than the whole adapter.  This would freeze the criminal funds without affecting innocent people. Finally, keep in mind, that even if there was a temporary freeze on the adapter, the collateral would still have the same value.  They would eventually work out a system whereby innocent users were able to close out their CDPs- but in the meantime there would be no reason to liquidate the frozen CDPs as their value would still be the same (the only scenario where it would be a problem is in a emergency shutdown).

The risk of immediate shutdown is not zero and it would be imprudent to factor it as such. We should talk about this other point though. The risk of another ETH flash crash is probably much more likely, and is very much in the back of many of our minds. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to leave headroom in this adapter to provide quick liquidity for auction keepers. We noticed on Black Thursday that many keepers had difficulty sourcing Dai, which is why the USDC adapter was included. The idea was that participants could move highly liquid USDC from an exchange to a vault, where they would be able to generate Dai to be used for an auction. When the auction is complete, the keeper can sell the discounted collateral on the market and close the USDC position. A high stability fee incentivizes the keeper to close their position quickly. This option is not available if the collateral adapter is at capacity due to attempts to manage the peg. The USDC adapter is currently at 60% of capacity, which is very risky if it means that keepers will not be able to source enough Dai in the event of another ETH collapse. USDC is a terrible tool for peg management. It may temporarily drop the price of Dai, but because there is no speculative value in holding USDC it creates immediate pressure to repurchase and repay the vault. It is at best a way to kick the can down the road when Dai is trading at a premium, and at worst, the overutilization of the collateral debt ceiling can create dangerous bottlenecks in the event of another precipitous decline in ETH. Governance should work to keep the adapter empty for the times when we really need that Dai. In my opinion, I think that the 20% stability fee that USDC launched at was too low by an order of magnitude. ",

When ETH is in a bear market and Dai is above the peg, the only collateral type that can restore the peg is something like USDC where you can mint Dai and sell it for peg arbitrage.  I have been doing this as much as possible and will buy back the Dai once the peg is reached at $1.   When the SF was about 4-6%, I estimated it would be a profitable arb as long as peg was reached in about 3 months.  Why would you take away this only reliable mechanism to restore the peg when Dai is trading above it?  Your solution of 20%SF would be a disaster right now and we could see Dai prices at $1.05-1.10, which could result in emergency shutdown.   Also- it makes not sense that you want MKR holders to take the relatively larger risk of an ETH flash crash with 0% SF on ETH, but you don\u2019t want them to take the much lower and more easily mitigated risk of government shutting down USDC.  Once we restore the peg and find some uncorrelated collateral types, then we can talk about removing USDC, but for now we need it to maintain price stability for Dai.  Sourcing liquidity for keepers is a secondary issue and if we need this again, we should raise the USDC ceiling. ",

To me 4% is in line with the Stability Fee of other assets, and the risk behind USDC is of a different nature compared to others assets you can use as collateral, which could make it either uncorrelated or inversely-correlated to other assets used in CDPs - which intuitively to me sounds good although I am still learning about how the system works. If I wanted to mint DAI now to take advantage of the 1.02 value, I would want to put much more DeFi asset (ETH, KNC, ZRX) than required collateral if I think those values with go down, given the assumption that the overpricing of DAI and a DeFi mini-bubble are correlated (the assumption that DAI would return to its pledge only when other assets such as ETH/KNC/ZRX get a price correction). In that scenario, the USDC is to me good way to mint DAI without effectively taking a position on DeFi tokens. ",

                    "content": "Is it time to consider whether events of the past several days (in particular) serve as adequate warning of regulatory actions potentially involving USDC that could materially harm MakerDAO? We note that a \u201cblacklisting\u201d of the PSM is not the worst case scenario and may in fact be less likely than a problem that impacts USDC\u2019s centralized issuer itself. This article by Mike Burgersburg provides a troubling summary and analysis of emerging headwinds. It challenges assumptions that Circle, Paxos, or any U.S. based firm can rely on the regulatory status and perceived halo of political favor widely attributed to them in the recent past. For a strong set of arguments as to why Circle and its peers might be facing significant pressure deserving of careful consideration by this community, we recommend a close read:    dirtybubblemedia.substack.com    Stablecoin Shadow Banks Explaining the coming regulatory crackdown on stablecoins.      There is compelling evidence that a government agency-wide and bi-partisan effort in the United States is underway to sever the lifeline of access to USD and fiat banking by the crypto ecosystem through a broad series of regulatory measures, policy changes and enforcement actions. Is there a conversation that needs to be refreshed in this community with a view to taking some actions? If we see a material and/or permanent disruption of the means by which key market participants (both asset owners, custodians and issuers of assets) handle USD-pegged crypto assets or convert them into fiat currency, what would be appropriate actions for MakerDAO to consider and execute today, next month, in 6 months? If the entire matrix of centralized stablecoin viability is dismantled, blacklisting specific wallets or asset pools will be entirely unnecessary to achieve regulatory aims. The scenario is not so far fetched as some might have assumed 6 months, or even 3 months ago. And as this thread started in May 2020 demonstrates, MakerDAO has built its current market position on a foundation of centralized U.S. entities and assets. We would hope this dependency points to a convincing reason why most people here should have concern for actively navigating U.S. law notwithstanding exciting plans that take no consideration of laws into account.
