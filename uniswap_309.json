With this in mind, the Uniswap governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader Uniswap ecosystem.\u2019\u2019 - from the blog post That being said, I\u2019m pretty sure the team has thought of this before implementing the minimum thresholds. There are very many suggestions/proposals that seem to not be approved by the majority of the community, as proven by the lack of support on certain suggestions. That\u2019s not an opinion or comment towards a specific proposal. It\u2019s a fact based on what I\u2019m seeing right now. I\u2019m not necessarily sure that\u2019s a bad thing, it\u2019s an interesting situation. I personally as a community member would vote no on a proposal to reduce this number. I strongly believe the most important proposals will find their support. ",

                    "content": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA256 Background In order to analyze this proposal a bit more seriously, we need a security framework for reasoning about quorum sizes. We propose the following de minimus threat model which aims to reason about quorum sizes as a function of the quantity of UNI needed for a set of negative actors to perform actions harmful to UNI holders and LPs. While there isn\u2019t an purely objective definition for what the set of negative actors looks like, I will focus on actors that I believe are generally agreed upon to be negative participants should they unilaterally form a cartel to pass proposals through governance. Gauntlet would very much appreciate feedback on whether you think this definition is too aggressive, however. Threat Model In order to quantify optimal quorum sizes, we first have to define a threat model that prescribes how much UNI colluding adversarial actors would need to accrete to perform a deleterious action. In the remainder of this post, we consider a deleterious action to be one that:  Reduces the amount of decentralization inherent to the protocol Reduces the potential future cash flows that UNI holders could (not will) receive from the transaction fees allocated by the protocol Interferes with the ability for liquidity provider and traders to achieve execution as defined in the smart contract (e.g. via a change that increases gas costs without a very strong reason for doing so)  Given that these are qualitative objectives, we will need to introduce simplifying assumptions to create a data-driven model. Assumptions We first make the following assumption about an adversary that necessarily satisfies the above criteria: A0. The set of deleterious adversaries is non-empty and at least includes the following three actors a. On-Chain Lending Pools (Compound [0], Aave [1], PowerPool) b. Competitive Automated Market Makers with Governance (e.g. SushiSwap) c. Centralized Exchanges The first category is nascent and quite small, so we will focus on analyzing the threat posed by exchanges. According to Nansen, we have the following top UNI holding exchanges: image1838\u00d7934 133 KB From these balances, it is quite clear that the main exchanges that we need to consider as threats to governance are Binance and Huobi. Even if every non-Uniswap UNI exchange colluded to try to achieve quorum, they would barely be able to do so. The high cost of coordination amongst competing adversaries behooves us to make the next model assumption: A1. Only exchanges with balances higher than Uniswap are likely to collude to reach quorum Now that we have restricted ourselves to analyzing exchanges with higher balances than Uniswap, it is natural to ask about quorum size relative to their total balance. Given that the two exchanges that meet this criteria are fiduciaries and strident competitors, we believe that it is reasonable to assume that they will not collude. A2. Competing centralized exchanges will not collude to take over Uniswap This assumption, which is the strongest one that we make within this threat model, is likely to be controversial as the cryptocurrency space has historically had collusion of this form (e.g. Bitcoin\u2019s New York Agreement). However, we believe that competing exchanges forming an anti-UNI holder cartel (to drive liquidity and volume back to centralized venues) will inevitably be an unstable alliance as the form of UNI manipulation chosen will likely only benefit the largest member of the cartel. In particular, we do not believe that they will be able to make progress on omnibus proposals that require multiple governance votes without running to a point where their cartel spontaneously breaks apart. Given these assumptions, we can define the safe quorum threshold to be the least upper bound on the most capitalized deleterious actor\u2019s UNI balance. This captures the minimum amount of UNI that a deleterious actor that satisfies assumptions A0-A2 would need to perform a governance action unilaterally. Estimation How do we estimate the safe quorum threshold? Given that exchange balances fluctuate daily, one simple upper bounded heuristic for the safe quorum threshold is the estimator (written inefficiently as a quadratic algorithm, but with an eye towards clarity using Python notation) safe_quorum_threshold_ub = max([max_balance[t] + abs(max_delta[tp])                                  for t in range(start_date, end_date)                                 for tp in range(start_date, end_date)])  where   balance[exchange, t] is an array of the balances at exchange exchange indexed by a date t  max_balance[t] = max(balance[exchange, t] for exchange in exchanges) delta[exchange, t] = max_balance[exchange, t] - max_balance[exchange, t-1]  max_delta[t] = max(delta[e, t] for e in exchanges).  This finds the max balance plus the maximum [in,out]flow that an exchange has in a single day. By using the maximum flow (regardless of direction) and the maximum balance, we\u2019re constructing a best unbiased estimate of how large the largest exchange could get if it a) had the maximum known exchange balance and b) the largest inflow day possible. Analysis Using the Nansen, we can first see that Binance has always been the maximum balance exchange, hovering around 25M UNI. image1840\u00d71040 141 KB Therefore, we center our analysis around Binance. In this Google Sheet, we use daily balance data from Nansen to compute a number of quantities related to the safe_quorum_threshold. If we exclude max_delta from the first day of UNI issuance (which is an outlier, as illustrated in the spreadsheet), we see that:  max(max_delta[t] for t in range(start_date, end_date)) = 1'212'017.65 max(max_balance[t] for t in range(start_date, end_date)) = 28'904'174.60  However, we note that Uniswap\u2019s market share in terms of UNI markets has increased over time, whereas Binance and Huobi have been decreasing in UNI holdings. As such, we think a weaker but still acceptable estimator for safe_quorum_threshold is: safe_quorum_threshold_ub2[exchange] = max([avg_balance[exchange] + abs(max_delta[t])                                            for t in range(start_date, end_date)])  Why do we think this is reasonable?  The first few days post UNI launch had exceptional volumes and they should be considered outliers The increase in Uniswap market share is extremely promising as the number of UNI held in Uniswap pools more than doubled from the minimum (3.4M) to the maximum (8M) whereas Binance and Huobi had far more anemic growth  Using this bound gives us a final number that we believe could be in a proposal: safe_quorum_threshold_ub2[\"binance\"] = 26'930'326.78 Thus, we believe that a quorum amount of roughly 27M UNI should suffice to prevent a unilateral deleterious act.

I do think you\u2019re right that they\u2019d probably do best at aggregating more balances via some incentive-like this. One thing I don\u2019t think they can do is compete on a UNI basis with UNI\u2019s incentives (e.g. deciding which pools get UNI, % of UNI inflation) \u2014 so they\u2019ll need to convince UNI lenders looking for yield to either  Accept BNB as a form of yield payment Provide some % of UNI/X trading fees to lenders  The former works, but is likely to cause a lot of friction as BNB is a standalone Tendermint chain (so the UX is not, well, farmer friendly) and the latter is likely to make market makers move away from Binance. So it might (but is not impossible!) be hard for them to incentivize users in an easy manner. That being said, having a cross-chain DEX like Serum does make the second choice more palatable and FTX in the future might be able to pull this off more easily. One other thing I wanted to add: In A1, we use UNI balances to rank exchanges and not volumes. Why? Ansatz: If a user generally uses exchange G and puts UNI on it, then they were willing to move liquidity from G to Uniswap, farm it, then bring it back to G Thesis: These \u2018flight risk to UNI\u2019 users are the ones who CEXs want to ensure don\u2019t leave, so exchanges with higher balances UNI balances will be more afraid of Uniswap\u2019s market share growth as they have more users who aren\u2019t sticky -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- iQIzBAEBCAAdFiEEEJAuhmVduSEVN8uPKIPJySxksQ8FAl+BzygACgkQKIPJySxk sQ/+fQ/+N4b3W5w7hCuM2B2i0YJs3RdNIGdQ2V8mWZ0VpBbwJCKfmCCLzyAHj88N NVZssJ1E5UItC9HsKdPpODwzhQBz8y8E8/A8yvHZLEJPL7YPtSR43BXWJI9ERyJM xCVD5s3QnvTL6WfrDpR5ALi3eyzNGm7FWgFeLcqqy7rSUTNrd6ZCQEouI01dIM9s bK11N5NVVmRhQHMtIqFJHRarQ1aEXnXc07+umnDtRkLMekZf6tcQjWMbHuO31oyg gmEJLIkyrzcYT043B/rfvB6b7iEgdVM7gw2T5RzSB6sauEjZ8cngXnNu5yjc5NLr TVquloXdn3Nn489rIETuLkIBgz7QF47doVmSx4hioWvn9xqVorhYZo0jYUDd76ZA d8wA5hVsTRbDLJsJO6JpMijLAIcwPuO5nQxsf+QFDed93t66NxK9GhVJ6wXzGhXw 5qLL+j0GMtKwBzqzSbTF4kTh7bUeKTN/s6UgeR1NZAZuU3n6Rnj3F1NP60kD/Cx7 UTCNkwkBhtW/XnX7h9sqrc0glKPQiKRvX6ty4QD2N5pFd62QwuRKU+5awh8N4VU7 49UrAvMfHAUNLVfbyO1ckicHfJH8FnL+2o5iUcBQF+2g5ifG/CZAO/xfz8QGBLIW wN9RqH6AcyIsZP+lg0OpfCA2Q1Au/6XGFJLW2mZKnkREciwRmPs= =21P2 -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ",

One additional consideration that needs to be taken into account is that cUNI currently has ~4.4M UNI available for borrowing\u2026 If a large UNI holder like Binance were to borrow this UNI just before submitting a proposal (potentially even via flash loan) and pay it back right after proposing, they would be able to exceed the proposed safe quorum threshold. (It does seem likely that this UNI would quickly be eaten up by borrowers or pulled by suppliers if the available amount became too large.) How about padding your proposed quorum threshold a bit to account for this possibility? Say, 3M to propose and 30M for quorum? ",

Also their entire \u201canalysis\u201d tries to argue for a 30m quorum based off the fact that binance might have 25m available currently? This is a pretty weird argument. shouldn\u2019t quorum be quite a bit higher than what we know a single entity (that isn\u2019t team or vc\u2019s) should have? why wasn\u2019t 40m pretty decent in the first place? EDIT: This whole proposal discussion revolves around reducing the amount of UNI\u2019s required to submit a proposal. it doesn\u2019t propose to reduce quorum, Gauntlet added that in there for seemingly no reason. You don\u2019t find this suspicious at all? I don\u2019t know much about Gauntlet and Dharma but considering they might have some other proposals they want to push though, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s farfetched to think that \u201cthey\u201d are trying to change the governance to suit their own interests\u2026 ",

Each proposal is individual and should be considered on its own merits with its own vote when the time comes. Yeah I do think it\u2019s a tad suspicious that 30M landed instantly on yes but at the same time where you there to see if it was 30M in 1 go or was it built up over multiple votes or was it 30M which was not fully owned by Dharma but somewhat delegated to Dharma (Dharma maybe owned less and the 30M they got was also through delegation).     uni0:  why wasn\u2019t 40m pretty decent in the first place?   To fault the team for a single figure is a bit harsh isn\u2019t it the team choose figures they thought were appropriate for Proposals and Quorum at the time. There have been many conversations on here about it both being too high, too low and just right this vote is giving people another figure and saying is this alright? I\u2019m sure the team was well aware at some point in time someone was going to challenge their figure and vote to change it, someone had to choose a starting figure and it was always undoubtedly going to be contested. In response to the Binance voting again no one knows whether Binance would work with or against the community interest one would hope they consider informing and asking the community before proposing something but again no proof behind whether they are for good or bad either way it\u2019s unlikely the community would ever be able to overthrow a centralised body (maybe this is where it was a mistake to ever let centralised exchanges list the token something that can\u2019t really be changed now unless possibly a proposal could be put through to forcer the teams hand to start contacting central exchanges to de-list the UNI token) EDIT: all in all we just have to hope these whales/centralised bodies with tons of UNI are working in the community and token holders interest far from that there isn\u2019t much we can really do as they hold the tokens and there\u2019s no way of removing them from them unless they choose to sell which would still put an immense sell pressure on the token. EDIT 2: as we speak I can see the votes for the proposal increasing suggesting it is more than Dharma for this proposal right now and backing up support for the proposal ",

I\u2019m not a big fan of the analysis made by tarum because as a starting point he considered Binance\u2019s wallet balance, which in reality can easily double if they start some liquidity farming, trading competitions on UNI pairs or 0-fee incentives. To me it seems more reasonable to analyse UNI\u2019s supply curve and release schedules when we talk about quorum threshold. Right now only 12% of UNI are circulating, but in 4 years we will reach 100%, so the inflation will be big and we can even consider to actually vote for a higher quorum limits in the near future. Anyway, I do agree that these must be 2 separate votings: first on limit to submit proposal, and later hopefully we can get many different proposals and analysis on quorum. ",

There\u2019s a lot of misinformation surfacing in the forums and media, and misinformation is bad for governance. So let me share these assertions:  Dharma itself does not get UNI from its proposal for retroactive distribution. It\u2019s the users of multiple wallets (Dharma, Argent, etc.) who will receive the UNI, for trading on Uniswap via meta-transactions. This is in alignment with the goals of the initial UNI distribution. Dharma is not a UNI \u201cbagholder\u201d, and there is no chance of Dharma \u201ccontrolling Uniswap\u201d. This is something that was incorrectly argued by blockchain media company Decrypt. Some investors, who are not invested in Dharma, have delegated to Dharma, and this is a vote of trust. If the Uniswap Governance parameters remain the way they are (40m UNI), it\u2019s unlikely that any decentralized UNI governance could happen this year. Either voter participation or share of delegation needs to increase significantly for it to be viable. Further discussion: I believe UNI community should prioritize proving that decentralized can governance work. The retroactive distribution proposal is fair and lower risk than the initial distribution, since we know there is a 1:1 user:address relationship. It\u2019s a great step.\".  ",

Even with deligation they\u2019re unlikely to ever hit the 40M quorum even if they somehow got ever Uni holder to delegate/vote without making this change. In saying that I can see both sides of this with the current proposal and putting the vote through as 2 seperate proposals I think once people realise this and come to their senses they will be kicking themselves for the way they voted imo but we will see. That\u2019s not to say there isnt another way, if anything I think this shows we need to all come together if anything and agree to something we all agree to whales and small holders before putting it to a vote to prevent the same thing from happening again. Either way I will respect the vote whatever way it goes and hopefully this will strengthen us all to unite more for the greater good of governance. EDIT: In saying that again removing 30M votes which has now been proven to be more than what is owned between Dharma, Gauntlet etc the current vote is still very much in favour with 656,919 For 643,922 Against I think if anything it\u2019s important to respect whichever side wins and not turn this forum into a battle field of one side vs the other and start to work together. Moral of the story is we\u2019re unlikely to hit the 40M Quorum to pass this at this point but we do need to see that this narrative of \u201coh well if Dharma\u2019s votes were taken off more people are against this\u201d because they\u2019re just not true.

If anything the fact that you want to LOWER this amount right off the bat before the 60 day first vesting period is over, shows to me at least, a power grab. If anything I thought the current proposal limit was too low as well as quorum.      This literally being the biggest AMM dex in ethereum history, it has been doing quite well without the extreme changes other defi instruments have been going through with governance. Additionally, with how easy it is to delegate votes here as opposed to other governance structures I've seen I actually see the original requirements quite low especially after the over 2 million uni tokens they are distributing a week currently. Again reading the (quite few) comments here when compared to the actual users of uniswap on a day to day basis (thousands) you cannot accurately state there is any sort of \"wide consensus\" with the uniswap community whatsoever.     If anything they should post about big votes like this on the front page like they do uniswap scrolling market cap. Then and only then would people even know this is going on alot of my friends thought voting wasn't even allowed till after the  60 day initial eth-stablecoin was over.  P.S.- sorry for my longwindedness but I really liked using uni, and unfortunately I don\u2019t see this not turning into a quick dictatorship with such low thresholds, so i voted against this proposal.

                    "content": "          So how are my favourite crypto-anarchists? :slight_smile: TLDR: <vote yes and don\u2019t reply that this post was too long> Looks like the voting system is working exactly as intended, which is also having the expected impact on the dominant narratives here. Camp #1: Crypto-anarchist ideologues tapping the \u201cdecentralized governance\u201d drum, and using a value-based justification that is focused around anti-establishment norms. I like these guys. They stick to their beliefs at least. Camp #2: Dharma and Gauntlet based conspiracy that chooses to vilify these entities with elaborate accusations of attempting to \u2018overthrow\u2019 Uniswap. Despite having no evidence, they have gathered support from other crypto-natives that enjoy fictionalizing their thoughts to fit their internal view of the world. When the only possible explanation you can come up with is absent of evidence, you have lost all objectivity. When you consider Cronje\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 vote and support from the Uniswap founder, you have to wonder how far this camp is willing to go with their moral campaign. Camp #3: There is a contingent here that fears Uniswap Governance may be rendered ineffective, due to the voting constraints that were prematurely designed into the contract without understanding the impact. The narrative here is focused on making \u2018governance\u2019 work, by whatever means necessary. Camp #4: The silent majority who frankly don\u2019t care. This is a well studied phenomenon in politics, and with anonymity, the problem may be worse for us because you can\u2019t even vote-signal here. There is no lawn to place your party\u2019s candidate sign. The conspiracy camp is the loudest because Kahneman (nobel prize in behavioural economics) taught us through his cognitive heuristics, that a negative narrative is 4x more impactful than the equivalent positive narrative. The fear stoking has a predictable chemical impact on the brain, and we fall prey to it because, well, we are human and risk-averse. However, the brittleness of the argument is apparent in the outcome of the vote thusfar, especially when you consider that a lot of small wallets are voting \u2018yes\u2019. The idealogues seem to be led by Hiturunk. The dedicated pursuit of a specific moral philosophy is commendable. However, to gain a stronger presence they need to make this ideology count with votes, and that is proving to be an insurmountable challenge for now. I personally don\u2019t agree with their viewpoint but i respect aspects of it. \u2018Plutocracies\u2019 are used euphemistically to represent their existential fear that big money will just come in and control everything. Well, we have created a governance structure that incentivizes that behaviour, but for now, we can\u2019t assume that plutocracy is evil until we understand the intentions of those wealthy players. Assuming that \u2018establishments\u2019 are all evil, which is central to anarchist belief systems, is naive and will always marginalize your opinion. Camp 3 is boring. All that chatter about governance structures is tedious, technical, and doesn\u2019t help me get emotionally engaged in the argument. Camp 4 is what will kill us unless things change quickly, and continue changing as this space evolves underneath us. The moment we seek balance, we become complacent, and we\u2019ll lose whatever edge we\u2019ve managed to establish in this market. Successfull endeavours survive because of their ability to roll with the punches, not find better gloves, a weaker partner, or bribing the ref. This is the essence of systems science and self-organized criticality (Bak). I\u2019m not suggesting we need to fabricate the interests and passions of this camp, but we definitely need to accomodate the silent uncaring apathetic element to our system. Do a poll to prove this. Send out a question to every UNI holder and ask them if they understand what governance means. Whatever governance structure we pick, it needs to \u2018nudge\u2019 the system in the direction we want to go. NOT establish an ideological end-state. Roadmaps that focus incessantly on the future at the expense of the present, FAIL miserably. This is why i am in Favour of this proposal, because at least it represents change. It represents movement. We have something to learn from it, and i\u2019m more interesting in learning than in making sure we don\u2019t get it wrong. ",

The fact is that this proposal changes nothing as per the initial idea of reducing the amount of UNIs required to submit the governance proposal. With the current threshold of 10M only 3 delegates can submit a proposal. With the new threshold of 3M votes it\u2019s much different - 5 delegates will be able to submit a proposal. Out of almost 90,000 token holders. So more decentralised, very win. The fact is that Dharma & co don\u2019t give a shit about community governance, they don\u2019t want 90K holders to speak, they want to push the dangerous lower quorum proposal, so they can grab the money from the table.

Did you know that science is full of theories until proven wrong or right? Heck life is full of assumptions and theories. You are using it in a very inflating way. What are you trying to achieve with these allegations? My feeling about it is, that you are trying to divide. By the way\u2026I am happy that the team did their homework with these initial settings. Personally, I  see no reason for any rush. My best guess is, that many people are here because they like the project, and they took part in it without any tokens. This is a new situation, and we will find a way to make more out of it \u2026 more than personal profit. I am mainly altruistic and somewhat emotionally attached to the project, not profit from a token. It seems you have a different motivation. Anyway, lowering the required amount of UNI for proposals might be good, but I see no reason to rush anything. ",
