                    "content": "Project Name: MakerDAO Author Name: @Facundo @JenSenhaji Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 L2 Recipient Address: TBD Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) You can see an overview of MakerDAO\u2019s metrics at @SebVentures\u2019s Dune here Highlights: Currently, Maker has +6 billion Dai in circulation with +$8 billion of total value locked as collateral across hundreds of thousands of loans. MakerDAO is #1 in TVL on Mainnet and DAI is the most used stablecoin in terms of on-chain velocity Since July 21\u2019, Dai is supported in the Optimism ecosystem through the Optimism official bridge. Dai is one of the most used stable-coins in Optimism with over ~$20M liquidity and it was the first stablecoin to reach 1M and 50M in TVL on Optimism. Dai is supported across almost all the dApps in the Optimism ecosystem. For example, users could lend Dai in Aave v3, swap in Uniswap/Curve and leverage LPs positions into Arrakis Finance, to mention some use-cases. USDC/DAI is the pair with the highest TVL across Uniswap and WETH/DAI has over ~$12M 7d volume, being this the 2\u00ba highest WETH pair with a stable-coin. In Aave v3, Dai is the most lended stable-coin behind USDC with ~$1.1M. Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): At the end of July/August, Maker is planning to launch a fast-withdrawals bridge for Dai to allow users to withdraw Dai near-instant and skip the 7 days lockup period. The Maker protocol is uniquely positioned to provide a solution to the 7 days period problem while preserving trustlessness and decentralization. The fast-withdrawal bridge will allow locking up L1 DAI to mint L2 DAI as well as allowing L2 DAI to be burned in exchange for near-instant access to L1 DAI. This will attract a constant flow of users and liquidity towards Optimism since users will have the possibility to constantly move Dai between L1 and L2 instantly. The average user will not want to wait a week to get their assets into L1. The Optimism Dai Bridge can serve as the go-to service for exiting L2 in a timely manner. Moreover and regarding Maker\u2019s Multichain Strategy, the Maker protocol is going to launch \u2018Maker Teleport\u2019 (previously Wormhole), a path for teletransporting Dai between supported Layer 2 and Ethereum. As the Layer 2 ecosystem evolves and DAI liquidity grows within these domains, it will become important for users to be able to move DAI between them in a trustless manner. This initiative to Teleport Dai across Layer 2 ecosystems, starting with Optimism and Arbitrum, will become an integral feature of the fungibility of Layer 2 Dai. The Optimism and MakerDAO communities have the same goal: to scale Ethereum. This is a game changer not only for Maker, but the Ethereum ecosystem at large as we can finally offer a fast, trustless, decentralized off-ramp for optimistic rollups. Moving forwards, the launch of MCD in Optimism is targeted to be released on Q4 2022. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? As a full DAO, any distribution would need to be approved by MKR holders, but the team making this proposal (Maker Growth Core Unit) will be recommending the following:  Once MCD is launched in Optimism (expected on Q4 2022), a great way to incentivize users to take a Dai loan will be to allocate OP rewards to Maker vaults. Incentivize LPs Dai pairs  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  MakerDAO is a tier 1 protocol battle-tested and users will want to take advantage of it as it represents a safe place to put their crypto holdings to take a Dai loan and use it across the Optimism ecosystem.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Low transaction fees on Optimism will attract users who are price sensitive to using Maker Vaults on L1, bringing more liquidity and users to Optimism. Maker has never relied on rewards for usage and has consistently been a top ranked protocol by TVL over the years.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  6 months.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  Up to discussion within the Maker community (DAO).  ",

There is already huge demand for minting DAI on L2s to save on gas costs, and by adding in an incentive to this action will bring a lot of usage to Optimism. ",

Accrued along with the DAI payback debt?   As we said and sorry for being repetitive, the distribution would need to go through a Maker governance vote, we as a Core Unit have no power to make that decission, but from Growth we\u2019ll propose the community to allocate OP per day by Dai emission rages starting from the dust (minimum Dai debt required), so for example: Users who take a minimum loan of $10-15k Dai will received an OP %, and we\u2019ll increase the reward % as the user take more debt. Ideally, the OP reward will increase as the dust increase too: *10-50k: %X OP *50-100k: $XX OP *100-150k: $XXX OP \u2026and so on Another interesting proposal would be to allocate OP to users who opens and maintains a vault for a certain length of time (e.g. 1 year), so the OP reward will be vested once the year already passed. But again, this is just a proposal from Growth, not MakerDAO as a whole. This would have to be approved by MKR holders.     Defi_LATAM_axlvaz:  The grants given by the governance fund are to encourage the use of the protocol and network.   Yes, It was just a suggestion to discuss within the community, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. But yes, I agree with you and as Jenn said, we can remove that part for sure. ",

                    "content": "Maker governance is really complex and requires many steps before any proposal being implemented, this means posting an off-chain signal request in the forum (this also takes time to reach an agreement) \u2192 then an on-chain governance poll (this normally takes between 3-7 days) \u2192 and finally the Executive Vote, which has a MKR threshold to pass and an expiration date, if the MKR threshold is reached before the expiration date then the Executive passes, if the opposite happens it doesn\u2019t. In this process, for example, the Protocol Engeering Core Unit will must have everything ready for the launch of MCD in Optimism and Risk Core Unit will have to evalute the risks parameters of the proposed distribution. So as you can see, reaching an agreement and implementing this proposal in Maker governance will take some time, this is why I\u2019m suggesting the OP governance vote on this and then we\u2019ll present it formally in our forum to debate about the final distribution. But just so you know and something that I didn\u2019t mention before, is that this proposal has been reviewed by the Mandated Actors (an actor representing each of the Core Units) of Maker before being published here. So, based on the expressed before I\u2019m thinking more like:  See the general feeling of OP governance and any feedback you give us and modify the proposal until it\u2019s ready OP governance votes whetever approves o rejected. If approved, we\u2019ll draft a proposal in Maker forum to discuss the OP distribution and which address to send the OP to*  *In case the OP governance don\u2019t trust Maker, we could propose to make the distribution from a multisig where the OP foundation is also a signer.

That being said having the distribution from a multisig where the OP foundation and a member of the optimism collective (maybe a top trusted delegate) are signers would be preferable. I fully support this idea as long as the MakerDAO uses the OP tokens only for incentivising MCD and DAI , and not use it for governance on OP. I think this can be ensured by using a multisig with the OP foundation and a optimism collective delegate as signers. Looking forward to mint Dai in optimism. ",

For both it is essential to promote the use and adoption of Optimism as the main L2 and they share the vision of scaling Ethereum since it provides a truly decetralized settlement layer. For Maker, it increases demand for Dai For Optimism, it increases the usability/liquidity in the network. In case the proposal in the Maker forum is not approved (highly unlikely imho) the funds would be returned to the Foundation.
