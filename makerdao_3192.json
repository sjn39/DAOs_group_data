                    "content": "Hello all. A few of you have seen me around before, but you\u2019ll probably note that I\u2019m not very active. I can tell you that I haven\u2019t been very interested in MakerDAO, and I don\u2019t have very many incentives to engage with the system or the community. I mean sure, there\u2019s SourceCred, and I could sit here all day lighting up the forums and potentially raking in some good Dai. But to be truthful, I don\u2019t want to. It seems as though it is soul-crushingly pointless. Nothing has really has changed since Black Thursday, we\u2019re still in a precarious situation rushing things through, I think without sufficiently considering the consequences of those actions. I mean, the Risk Team apparently thought it was OK to have more than half of our Dai backed by a single type of collateral\u2013correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I believe we moved to MCD precisely because that\u2019s a terrible idea for maintaining price stability and independent monetary policy. And yet we forged ahead and did it. Thankfully it seems to not have blown up in our faces from what I can tell, and we seem to be backing away from that cliff, but it very well could have gone south for us and that would likely have been an ES\u2013assuming the whales would let that happen. Not likely. As far as voting, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much point; if what we want to do doesn\u2019t align with the whales, then it doesn\u2019t happen. I mean, hell, we\u2019re having Vault Compensation Plan 3 being discussed. There shouldn\u2019t even have been a second one, and the fact that we\u2019re on number three still with no compensation given to victims of the Black Thursday event shows to me that the system is broken and no longer serves its users. The whales run the system, we just use it and pretend to govern it. To be clear, I don\u2019t have financial reason to be saying these things, as I was unaffected on Black Thursday. I\u2019m speaking from what I\u2019m seeing, and I\u2019m trying to give reasons on why I don\u2019t feel a desire to engage with the governance system at all. Does anyone else feel like they\u2019ve no reason to actually take an interest in governance? ",

Even if you don\u2019t have a lot of MKR, I think anyone can have a significant impact by sharing good ideas.  If you\u2019re fascinated by MakerDAO, you may find you have some of these. But if the inner workings and management of MakerDAO aren\u2019t things you find very interesting, maybe that is OK?

I am interested in governance, though often I feel as though I\u2019m not given a reason to since it seems kinda stressful and thankless for little to no tangible benefit. I\u2019ve shared a few ideas now and then, but I don\u2019t really take part in governance proper because: it\u2019s expensive; it requires significant time investment to make informed decisions, which is most certainly not worth it for a small holder; and it seems pointless, since a few whales can steamroll a vote and MKR minting to distribute the power a little does not seem to be in their interest at all, at least on the surface. I\u2019m now actually kind of curious to know what goings on you find interesting, @Spidomo. Perhaps highlighting some things could help add to the discussion? ",

USDC exposure is down to 25%. But back then, it was a priority to stabilize DAI to the promise of a  $1 peg. And you have to admit, so far it has been a great call by the Risk Team. Nobody is perfect. Besides, can we name another synthetic \u201cstablecoin\u201d that has kept a tight peg to the USD in the last 60 days?    If you want food for thought\u2013think USDT is the elephant in the entire crypto-room\u2026 just saying.

For some community folks, \u201craking in some good Dai\u201d can help them keep the lights on. We have folks here from Venzuela, to South Korea. Not everyone can afford to Yield Farm on Ethereum.

Personally I vote consistently based on my believe that we have an opportunity to make history. And yes, my Pleb vote does not make a difference with the outcome\u2013but  imagine if we had 10,000 low IQ Plebs like me voting every week\u2026 But I get your Drift. There are Hundreds of Thousands of MKR tokens out there, and the current HAT is only protected by 50K MKR. A bit comical, perhaps ironic-- MKR is a Governance Token, yet most don\u2019t bother to govern & protect. Imagine the Federal Reserve not protecting their Monetary Policy\u2026 what to do\u2026 \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it ironic, don\u2019t you think?

Well I\u2019m glad no one\u2019s flown into a rant about how rude I was being, because going back and reading my OP, I think I was angry; I apologize if that\u2019s how I came across. In any case, I think a small but measurable return on any  participation in the governance system would help engage more people\u2013it\u2019d certainly engage me. For example, if the act of voting were to earn you a small percentage on your MKR holdings each time you did it, whether the vote went your way or not; this could tie into delegation in an interesting way, but I imagine the mechanics of these things are best saved for a separate thread.  The point is, things like that which specifically reward participation in governance, seem to draw more participation simply by being there\u2013SourceCred is a good example of this.     flipflopflapdelegate:  USDC exposure is down to 25%. But back then, it was a priority to stabilize DAI to the promise of a $1 peg.   Yes, at the risk of blowing the whole system up; meanwhile there was no DSR, drastically reduced (at the very least) SF revenue. We maintained the peg, but we could\u2019ve died a couple times and we made almost no money. Though the market value of our surplus would have been all over the place, I would rather the peg have drifted than have an empty wallet; half of something is half, but half of nothing is nothing.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And you have to admit, so far it has been a great call . . .       ccc:  Thankfully it seems to not have blown up in our faces from what I can tell, and we seem to be backing away from that cliff, . . .   But yes, it has indeed turned out to be a good call; that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t very dangerous. It could just as easily have landed us in extinction. Any number of things could have gone wrong. DeFi was exploding and, in my experience at least, whenever a new industry explodes in popularity, the government jumps in and regulates it into oblivion. I\u2019ll use USDC at the height of its popularity in our vaults as an example here, but this could apply to any centralized stablecoin. Because (at the time) more than half of our collateral was USDC, we had effectively integrated at least the following entities into our protocol:  Circle The Securities Exchange Commission The Federal Reserve The U.S. Treasury  These entities, collectively, either directly or indirectly, control USDC. The greater the portion of our total collateral USDC makes, the more control these entities exert over our collateral. Now go and apply this to every centralized stablecoin we have in our vaults (with the appropriate institutions involved), and you\u2019ll likely begin to see that centralized stablecoins are really icky; this is unless you flat out don\u2019t care about what makes crypto, crypto. I, for one, certainly don\u2019t want the USFG (or any government, for that matter, no matter who\u2019s in charge of it) being able to tell me what I can and can\u2019t do with my money in any form; it\u2019s mine, and no one else\u2019s unless I give it to them when they ask, nicely. On a side note, I\u2019m starting to wonder if the idea of private property being private makes me old-fashioned.      flipflopflapdelegate:  . . . by the Risk Team.   Corrected.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I appreciate what they do. I\u2019m also not unaware of their fallible nature and wouldn\u2019t dream of holding it against them. But my understanding was that their job was to identify risks and avoid them, not take them.      flipflopflapdelegate:  For some community folks, \u201craking in some good Dai\u201d can help them keep the lights on. We have folks here from Venzuela, to South Korea. Not everyone can afford to Yield Farm on Ethereum. Hence, that little bit of DAI via SourceCred helps some of our community members.   I hope I wasn\u2019t interpreted as disparaging SourceCred in some way; I\u2019m actually very happy with the system and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve brought it in, it does seem to have helped the community, and it\u2019s helped me a little too, because I am also one of those people who can\u2019t afford to yield farm.  I love SourceCred and MakerDAO, and if I could, I would govern the DAO as my full-time job! But I don\u2019t because as far as I can see it\u2019s currently more profitable for me to work at my job. That\u2019s what I mean when I say I don\u2019t have enough incentive to govern (among the other reasons for not doing so that I outlined in the OP, such as whales). If you think that assessment is inaccurate I\u2019d love to hear it; I always appreciate a new revelation!      g_dip:  As a side note, I think the recent Core Unit framework from @juanjuan\u2019s DAO Primitives  post has a lot of people excited, as it outlines a clear path to being compensated while working for the DAO.       Spidomo:  Lately I\u2019ve been thinking about how MakerDAO tends to flap (purchase MKR and burn it) during times of system strength (likely higher MKR price), but flop (sell MKR for Dai) during times of system weakness (likely lower MKR price), and considering some ideas to help change that.   These are now things I look forward to. As an aside, this discussion has helped me pick a topic for my blog.  ",
