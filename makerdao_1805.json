You can see the inflow of ETH under Internal Transactions here. Your wallet initiated the transaction. If you did not initiate this transaction, you have given permission to someone else or a smart contract, or someone has obtained your private keys. In that instance it is likely your wallet is compromised and I would move everything out to a new wallet and practice better security moving forwards. ",

I feel like all I did was see the drop on Etherscan, then noticed the name of drop and then open their website aatu.site. 2nd - \u201cThis transaction exchanges DAI for ETH on 1inch. The ETH is still in your wallet\u201d  So I had $2616 in DAI AND 3.2796 ETH in my wallet before this event.  I now see the 3.2796 ETH but NOT the DAI. Are you saying that now my DAI is ETH (Changed on 1inch?) AND is still in my Wallet?   How do I track that down?   It\u2019s def NOT showing in my Metamask as I would have something like 5.2 ETH total right?   I\u2019m confused.   BIG TIP for you IF you can help me recover this $2616. On the link you sent, I see it going FROM 1inch router TO 0x448891c149a699264daa8b9b290d2b5983bf48cf - which is NOT my wallet addy. Please help if you can at all more.

If so, earlier today that address granted permission to an unverified contract to spend unlimited DAI.

Did you connect your wallet to the suspicious site and sign anything when you were looking into the airdropped token?
