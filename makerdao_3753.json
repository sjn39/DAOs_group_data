I\u2019ve dived deep into ALT cryptos few months ago (before that I was just playing around with BTC and ETH for a couple years) and Maker was one of my top alt picks. Not that I haven\u2019t made gains, but compared to other picks, MKR has remained weak and no one seems to be caring about it (which can be a good thing if you are going to buy). Do you think the public will pick up more on it eventually? I\u2019m planning on converting half my bag into something newer if I don\u2019t see much action soon\u2026 routerlogin ",

You have to look at MKR as an insurance guarantee for the protocol, as well as the most basic building block for decision making. Imagine we are a $10 billion plus protocol, the more we can raise the more interest and buying pressure there will be for MKR. ",
