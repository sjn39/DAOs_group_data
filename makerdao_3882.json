Still, one would have to imagine there are discerning actors on the platform and that - if they feel prices are better on Aave than Maker - they would just use Aave. The best arguments I see so far for using Maker (despite needing more collateral) are:  Maker allows for larger positions without moving rates (because rates are set by governance). Less liquidation penalty (although I would imagine this is fully or more than offset by the higher collateral required on Maker).  ",

Additionally, interest rates are not dependent on market utilization, which is unpredictable for everyone and larger users need to be very careful as they will definitely impact the rate  In my view, Aave and Compound are unique in that you can short sell, or earn interest on your assets by just supplying them.
