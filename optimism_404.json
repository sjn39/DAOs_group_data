I genuinely enjoy learning about all the tech, trying out new protocols, speculating on the future, and so on. The problem is that I\u2019ve had essentially zero interaction in real-life or online with anyone in this space. Living in the Greater Boston Area, I\u2019m surprised at the lack of events and other activity going on around here. As for online communities, conversations seem hard to come by if you\u2019re not a developer. I think it would be cool to have our own regional gatherings, whether it be for Ethereum in general or for our Optimism community. Obviously online gatherings are much easier. Let me know if you have any ideas outside of Twitter Spaces or your typical Discord server. Any decent on-chain online games maybe? I know I\u2019m far from the only one experiencing this, so feel free to speak up! ",
