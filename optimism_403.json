I am glad that you can participate using a translator, I\u2019m sure everyone can make an effort to include people with a language barrier making the collective more diverse and unbias. Please keep expressing yourself in this forum and I hope you help us with a future proposal for forming an international, intercultural OP working group. About your question: as far as I understand any project or person can be nominated if somehow they have provided public good to the Collective. I quote the 3 main categories:    Infrastructure + Dependencies: Software used to build or deploy the OP Stack; contributions to protocols or standards the OP Stack depends on run; experiments that support future development of the core OP Stack protocol  Tooling + Utilities: Work that helps builders create applications on Optimism mainnet, build on the OP Stack, interact with governance of the Collective, or use applications built on Optimism  Education: Work to spread awareness and knowledge of how Optimism works, whether technically or socially   ",

And even, for example, to write yourself for a nomination, will you need to write everything that you did in general in terms of supporting the project?  let\u2019s be optimistic about it just think how many people will think that (we were deceived) I wonder who is going to vote for me?) I think everyone will vote for themselves well, I wonder how it will all look) I see everything optimistically ",
