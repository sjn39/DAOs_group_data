                    "content": " tl;dr You can explore the initial proposal introducing the Steward Council here. This proposal seeks to select the members of the GD Steward Council, approve its mandate and tenure. We currently have 14 stewards elligible for a seat on the council. This proposal is split into the following sections:  Engagement score updates: How the engagement scores have evolved based on community conversations and input Formation: Who qualifies to be in the council & selection Mandate & term: What are the requirements for council members + GTC allocation   Engagement Score Updates This council looks to elevate the participation of the most engaged stewards as exemplified by the engagement scorecards and looking at stewards with a rating above 8/10 (*details on engagement scores below). The scores have evolved to take into account more granular engagement beyond voting mechanics and delegation power. The motivation behind this evolution is that engagement is manifold and contributors should be recognised for their work beyond on chain governance action points. We have also taken into account any drop off in engagement in the previous season (quarter) and will be working to make sure the cards are a real time reflection of engagement as this essential piece of DAO tooling evolves. The following are adjustment scores contributing to overall ranking per steward:  Workstream lead role +5  Workstream contributor role +3  Lack of meaningful contributions, not taking part in voting or discussion in the previous season -3   In future, to maintain a +8 rating, a steward will need to be active in a workstream or in DAO-wide discussions, a -1 deduction will be applied per 1 month of inactivity. As seasons kick in this quarter, this will be mkeasured/season.  Formation The current lineup of stewards with scores 8/10 and over is as follows:  @DisruptionJoe @Pop @krrisis @seedphrase @bobjiang @tjayrush @Sirlupinwatson @HelloShreyas @lefterisjp @linda griff * Fishbiscuit* kyle* austingriffith*  (*apologies here stewards, only 10 can be tagged in one post)    daostewards.xyz    The Steward Health Cards provides the most valuable metrics on engagement for... Stewards Health Cards      As part of the discussion on the initial proposal, it\u2019s important to understand who among these stewards feels like they have the bandwidth to take the council role on for its first season. The initial proposal was looking at a council formed of 10 stewards and the current lineup is at 14 - another point here is do we extend numbers or based on steward self-signalling re availability, do we stick to the original plan of 10. Please express your opinions on the makeup of this council and whether you strongly feel other stewards should be included.  Mandate & Term The first Stewards Council will be active from the time the proposal passes for a period of ~180 days, in line with the seasons cadence established as part of the proposal. One council should cover 2 seasons and there should be 2 councils/year. The rough 180 day cadence matches the quarterly cadence of the Gitcoin DAO calendar and offers a great opportunity to reflect, expand and amplify the mission of GD. Cadence as follows:  Season 13 - 2.1 to 4.30 (GR13 | 3.9-3.24) Season 14 - 5.1 to 7.30 (GR14 | 6.8-6.23) Season 15 - 8.1 to 10.30 (GR15 | 9.7-9.22) Season 16 - 11.1 to 1.31 (GR16 | 11.30-12.15) and ongoing - any changes for holidays or other interruptions would be voted on  A milestone report will be presented at the end of the 180 day mark, ensuring the model is deemed valuable by the community and any essential and valuable learnings are incorporated in the model. Steward council mandate:  Keeping a \u2018docket\u2019 of ongoing proposals / their current status Ensure proposals follow template(s) / creating any necessary adjustments to template(s) Perform an in-depth analysis of budget requests by workstreams. This includes:   workstream performance and delivery(from the milestone reports included in the proposals) funds left over from previous seasons and taking them into account for the season list of contributors to workstream value of ask   Consult on workstream performance/workstream leads\u2019 milestone progress - address any workstream issues that may occur within a season Participating in active discussion around proposals, timely voting Availability for Tally proposal creation and ratification once a proposal has passed Snapshot Participation in a council call that will be scheduled halfway between the monthly steward call (aka every two weeks) for better alignment & broader DAO strategy discussion.  This mandate will evolve to take into account any learnings from the first council activity as we evolve the structure and the model based on optimum balance.  First Forum Distribution The proposal is that a pool of GTC is allocated across the Stewards Council for the term. This is to cover gas costs incurred in voting and offer fair allocation for the group as long as they fulfil their functions outlined above. The funds can also be allocated to everyone voting as highlighted by some of the comments on the initial version of the council proposal. This action can be decided on by the council as one of their first joint proposals. A Snapshot proposal will be made separately around the allocation for the first council term. Based on the comments on the initial post, an overall agreement was option A. 5,000 GTC for the whole council for the whole mandate. We can potentially include all 3 options in the Snapshot for broader agreement. *A. 5,000 GTC B. 10,000 GTC C. 15,000 GTC *These options are here for the community to assess what a fair level of compensation might be in the context of the steward council and its mandate.

It would make more sense to me for the budget to be used to fund a squad with a designated owner of the outcome of getting all these things done. The council would then vote on which outcomes and who would own them. This seems like better use of the funds than simply rewarding council members. I do see the need to reimburse for gas fees used when voting though. I could see this group passing an outcome like \u201cAll voters who vote on 50% or more issues with over x amount delegated to them will receive reimbursements for their voting gas fees\u201d. This council would elect an outcome owner who would then create a budget for getting this done that the council would then pass. Open to ideas\u2026 starting the discussion before it moves forward!

If there are some stewards who do not have the bandwidth, then I think we can narrow down from there. The most important minimum to me regarding GTC allocation to council members is to make sure gas costs are covered so voting does not become cost-prohibitive to anyone. 5000 GTC sounds reasonable to me but I\u2019ll support higher if others feel that is not a fair level of compensation.

I read it as this amount would be given to the council for being active voters! In this case, I\u2019d say the 5k is a good start, but open to upping it to 10k. Maybe they get 5k for this quarter budget and 5k in reserves that they could dip into if they felt they had justifiable reasons for it. ",

Operationally, I think I could help work on the Notion pages so that Stewards don\u2019t have to dig through all the workstreams\u2019 pages to look for proposals or context either. This can also help serve a secretariat function. Council makeup I think having 10 for a start is a good number and having the rest of the stewards that fulfill the criteria kept in the loop on an ad hoc/voluntary basis such as through a regular update cadence. When it comes to renewal for the council this also gives us a larger group of people we could select from. Thank you! ",

                    "content": "    Pop:  The initial proposal was looking at a council formed of 10 stewards and the current lineup is at 14 - another point here is do we extend numbers or based on steward self-signalling re availability, do we stick to the original plan of 10.   I think it\u2019s ok to go for 14? But no strong opinions on this. Assuming that a number of stewards will decline the described mandate , I think it\u2019s a good idea to start with 14, hoping that we arrive at 10 who can/will actually commit. I assume the GTC distribution takes into account 10.     Pop:   Perform an in-depth analysis of budget requests by workstreams. This includes:    Reading this mandate it seems only one Steward has currently been performing these tasks for the current budget round, and this is @kyle, am I seeing this correct? I have done a budget analysis of 3/5 workstreams and it is questionable if it was in-depth enough. In your adjustment scores above - how do we evaluate if Stewards are actually taking up this mandate as you describe this and adjust their scores? How do we hold them accountable and who will make this calculation? Maybe this can be peer-reviewed (as a task of the council itself)? Don\u2019t want to make it too complicated but I think this is important.     Pop:  The following are adjustment scores contributing to overall ranking per steward:   Would it be useful here to add a big adjustment score here to evaluate stewards on this council?     Pop:  tewards with a rating above 8/10 (*details on engagement scores below).   I am missing the details\u2026 there is some detail in the original proposal but not here\u2026 Would it be possible to share the calculations for how you got to the 8+'s for transparency\u2019s sake? Reading the other comments now:     DisruptionJoe:  \u201cAll voters who vote on 50% or more issues with over x amount delegated to them will receive reimbursements for their voting gas fees\u201d.   I\u2019d definitely vote on reimbursing each and every steward who has voted and has a link to their transaction. Thinking of this, we\u2019ll probably have some admin work, I\u2019m not sure if you are planning to execute on follow up simona, if not or if we need more for other stewards\u2019 gas it might be a good idea to keep some financial reserves. So possibly you could propose 10K (on which we should also keep highly transparent accounting).     anneconnelly:  The scorecards use metrics that value quantity over quality. I would be careful about using them as cut-offs vs. information factors in a decision.   I think this is a valid point and also read your previous comment Anne in the original proposal\u2026 I think we should continue looking at how we could make the evaluation model better. Afaik the current model values quantity of engagement pretty high, the quality is such a subjective point that I\u2019m not sure if we can objectively evaluate this at this point. ",
