It may or may not be obvious, but it seems this comes in two stages:  Beacon chain does sufficiently well finalizing \u201cETH 1x data\u201d for a given amount of time (how much time? 3 mos? 6 mos?) Beacon chain\u2019s block finalizations are integrated somehow into consensus of ETH 1x chain (hard or soft fork? maybe in the mining software to reduce uncles? can we revert/reduce the effects if it doesn\u2019t work?)  I think it\u2019s important here to gradually incorporate this mechanism over time as it proves itself to work. We have to de-risk this combination enough in practice that it doesn\u2019t get abused when vulnerabilities are discovered that we didn\u2019t know about (\u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d) Also, is step 1. needed to process deposits?

In June 2018, this plan was abandoned in favor of Eth2. In December 2018, it was proposed to salvage the original finality gadget plans \u2013 Eth2 clients must be aware of recent Eth1 block hashes to decide on Eth1 to Eth2 validator deposits, but deciding on validator deposits may be interpreted as Casper votes, which may finalize the Eth1 chain. For this to work, Eth1 clients would have to change their fork-choice rule to monitor the beacon chain, perhaps as an Eth2 light client, so that they can honor the finalization of blocks. Feedback: I believe that an earlier plan was to replace PoW with full PoS, not just finality. Of course, finalization alone brings great value and should be considered alone. But perhaps it would be wise to also consider further steps to replace PoW with PoS. This would solve the ASIC miner centralization problem, and allow reducing block rewards significantly. ",

If you consider that a vote on a block is also a vote on all earlier blocks, then a random sample from a population which includes a 2/3rds honest majority (which Eth2 assumes) will \u201cagree\u201d on at least the genesis block with high probability.

To preempt the questions about funding, I would say that if we found a suitable leader (not necessarily an expert in beacon chain) initially, and perhaps some more people to help out, a decent funding would be provided. Other working groups would participate in work reviews (we will be regularly talking to each other and review each other\u2019s work, as it is necessary to come up with consistent roadmaps), and if a group becomes inactive, we should fold the group (with funding going away obviously), and allow a new group to form.

Shall it live forever in this role, and later Phases end up with their own testnets as the ETH 2.0 roadmap moves forward? Is this the first \u201crelease\u201d of the ETH 2.0 chain, that will be there forever and ever? By integrating things too closely too early, we might bind our hands to future upgrades, which is something I don\u2019t think we should do. I think we should identify the requirements and constraints we have, as well as the minimum goals we seek to achieve with this project. ",

My current understanding is that the bridge might only work uni-directionally, but there are benefits to allowing a bi-directional bridge.     lrettig:  further, the two chains have similar security guarantees   I\u2019m not sure how this follows, but I suppose in the hybrid case where both are securing each other, this might be true.     lrettig:  Depends how you define \u201cdifferent tokens\u201d\u2026 they should be fungible and function like a single logical token.   The crux of this being true depends on the bridge mechanism and issuance. I would say they are only \u201cfungible\u201d if 1 ETH = 1 bETH (sorry, but we need something to call the ETH 2.0 token). This probably means that there shouldn\u2019t be any issuance on the Beacon chain until we decide the mechanism can support hybrid operation, and then we split the issuance between mining rewards and validator rewards. But, if we do that, it means there is no economic incentive to become a validator on the beacon chain (there\u2019s probably social incentives). I think in practice, we have to have some economic incentive, but this should be artificially limited to our level of trust of the hybrid model. It\u2019s unfortunately much more complicated than \u201c1 ETH = 1 bETH\u201d. The closer we tie these tokens together, the more we have to legitimize our decision and ensure the issuance is moved from a legitimate source. If we create more issuance out of no where, that\u2019s a problem. The alternative is to just create a separate chain and supply of tokens, but have an in-protocol exchange mechanism that derives the price. This would be a much more fluid mechanism, and we wouldn\u2019t have to be held to \u201c1 ETH = 1 bETH\u201d. This probably has its own complications as well. Think of it as a continuous ICO model where all the ETH is refundable at any time (like a DAICO). ",

                    "content": "One question I do have is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a good understanding of what happens to the issuance if we do choose to do a reduction, specifically in relating to the incentivization of the ETH 2.0 Beacon chain. We have some great charts on the potential returns based on the number of ETH participating, but where does this ETH get it\u2019s \u201clegitimacy\u201d from? This is not clear to me based on my current knowledge of the design.  I would claim that the legitimacy of this Ether must come from the current 1.0 chain. The way I would propose to do this would be to route the appropriate amount of issuance that the Validators would earn on the ETH 2.0 chain to the smart contract bridge that processes deposits, basically increasing the pool (and therefore individual\u2019s proportional claims to that Ether) until the amount of rewards being generated from 1.0 issuance matches the expected returns generated by the 2.0 protocol. We can use this parameter to ratchet up the \u201cimportance\u201d of the validator functionality over time; basically, as we grow more and more confident in the proper functioning of the mechanism (both economically and securely), we can involve it more and more into the actual issuance of the 1.0 chain. This might also be along another parameter that controls that amount of issuance given to existing 1.0 PoW miners, giving us two knobs to fiddle with and dial in the \u201cright\u201d amount of issuance as validation progresses. The one thing I am not sure about with this approach is what this means for 2.0 protocol. Does it generate more 2.0 tokens than we have to cover it in the 1.0-2.0 bridge? Is there an economic disconnect there? I am not as familiar with the staking/rewards mechanism to know the answer to this question, but hopefully we can exert some measure of control over it to align it with what is occurring on the 1.0 chain.  This does lead me back to a previous question I asked (and I don\u2019t think we have a good response yet):     fubuloubu:  There\u2019s a fundamental question here of what the Beacon chain should do when we make this upgrade. Shall it live forever in this role, and later Phases end up with their own testnets as the ETH 2.0 roadmap moves forward? Is this the first \u201crelease\u201d of the ETH 2.0 chain, that will be there forever and eve   If the Beacon chain fulfills this role temporarily (until Phase 1 is released), how do we manage that upgrade process? Conversely, if the Beacon chain is intended to have this connection forever, how do we ensure the transition from 1.0 -> 2.0 at a later phase (either Phase 2 or Phase 3, based on my current understanding of the roadmap) is smooth, both in the operation of these chains, as well as the continued economic issuance that is occuring on both (since the \u201cissuance origin\u201d will need to switch from the 1.0 chain to the 2.0 chain at some point along the upgrade process). Hard questions! ",

                    "content": "Talking with @djrtwo this past week, the answer to my question is that indeed, when we first launch the Beacon Chain and connect it to the current Mainnet, that will permanently cement this upgrade into the history of both ETH 2.0/1.0. This means that this finality gadget (and corresponding bridge contract) is now on the critical path for what it means to do a release for Phase 0. Further Phases will build on top of this instead of releasing their own networks to move forward. At least, that is the intent. Okay, so what does that mean? I think it means that the easiest way to ensure that issuance stays consistent is to process the issuance reduction to miners and the issuance redirection to 2.0 Validators at the same time: at the genesis block of the Beacon Chain mainnet. If both do not occur together, then we have to answer the question of what the Beacon Chain\u2019s Ether is valued at without the underlying issuance changes in ETH 1.0 backing up the \u201cnew\u201d issuance in ETH 2.0. The ETH 1.0 protocol should therefore match 1-to-1 the supply schedule that has been defined for ETH 2.0, and track that in the balance of the bridge contract, even though it is uni-directional. This gives the underlying Beacon Chain ETH value that is tied 1-to-1 to the current mainnet. Accounting for burning ETH on the Beacon Chain would be more required to maintain this peg, so that might complicate the bridge mechanism a bit. The alternative is that if we do not do this, then there will always be a small gap in the issuance on both chains, and therefore the two Ethers are not considered 1-to-1 pegged. This doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Since Ether is also burned for a few different scenarios, perhaps as value gets ported over and starts to track issuance on both chains together, we can level set such that they eventually equalize. At the point of equalization, we can then say the upgrade is \u201ccomplete\u201d. Might be a weird mechanism to track in practice, but then we have a deadline that is driven by adoption and not artificially maintained by abandoning the current mainnet at date X. ",

Another option might to target a later fork for this protocol modification. Prior to that, we would try an \u201ceconomically incentivized\u201d testnet by leveraging the same bridge contract and protocol version we want for a mainnet release, and have a grant that rewards the Validators at regular intervals (in the exact same way as the protocol modification would). We would do this for a few months leading up to the final protocol change, where issuance is being redirected. This would allow us to \u201cscale up\u201d our risk before committing to the protocol modification, and prevent unleashing a torrent of issuance to a new, economically unproven mechanism. Something like 1%-5% of what the funds would be for a few months of this activity would be enough to see what sorts of behaviors arise. If there are bugs, we much rather see them with grants funds than the future of our chain\u2019s security issuance, where it would be much harder to revert back. This would probably be about 500-1000 Ether. I think about 1 YOLOs-worth of Ether would be enough for this. Deadline DevCon 2020?  Edit: If the Beacon chain testnet has the same problem as the Ropsten testnet (which is probably likely due to the lack of incentivization), then we\u2019re going to need this sort of progressive approach to assure ourselves we\u2019ve got the mechanism right.
