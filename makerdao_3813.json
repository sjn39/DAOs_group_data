                    "content": " Overview There has been significant debate around an under-recognized aspect of DROP token assets \u2013 namely that the Issuer of the token may, with two weeks\u2019 notice via an email, change terms in the Executive Summary of its issuance. This can include, but is not limited to, what metric is used to measure collateralization within the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that is the Issuer, the rate of return of DROP token holders who represent an equivalent seniority in the debt structure, size of junior tranche, and anything else stated in the Executive Summary for that DROP issuance. As is currently structured, the Issuer only has to send an email, and all parties are considered notified. After 14 days, the Issuer may then enact these changes. Given that:  This power to change terms is clearly stated in the DROP token subscription agreement under section 4.F This has already occurred within the first month of our only DROP asset collateral (New Silver),  The notice was not received by the DAO at large until June 10th, despite being sent on/around May 21st, There is demonstrated opportunity for the notice to become lost or delayed before the DAO at large is notified, thereby lessening time to react or \u2013 as was the case with New Silver \u2013 even be informed until after the changes had gone into effect, It is difficult for the DAO to discuss, vote on, and enact a response to any changes that it feels negatively impact the DAO\u2019s position in such a short window, Public debate about liquidation of a DROP asset will likely allow other DROP investors to front-run Maker, leaving the DAO to wait for even an unimpaired debt pool to mature before recovering principle, No offer to remove this power to unilaterally change terms was forthcoming in a lengthy call with Centrifuge and New Silver yesterday,  All DROP assets through Centrifuge share this power for Issuers to unilaterally change terms,  I propose that upon public acknowledgement of notice on this forum, notice provided on this forum, or implementation of changes \u2013 whichever occurs first \u2013 Maker automatically authorizes and compels a 3% (300 bps) raise in the Stability Fee for that DROP asset\u2019s vault. This could be avoided by the Issuer communicating early with the DAO, and getting a vote to override an automatic raising of Stability Fee. Should it be consistent with our governance process, this can be a simple on-chain poll, otherwise it would follow the standard track of poll and then executive. This action would be applicable each instance an Issuer utilizes their power to alter terms, and has no upper limit to the cumulative Stability Fee. Pros:  Maker is no longer at a disadvantage when terms are changed but no evaluation or response is able to be organized. This does not liquidate \u2013 and thereby end \u2013 the relationship of Maker and the Issuer of a given DROP token. This puts the burden upon the Issuer to communicate clearly, fairly, and early, rather than burdening individual Maker representatives with collecting and disseminating notice of change, particularly as the number of DROP vaults grows. Demonstrates to current and future Issuers that Maker is a serious source of financing that will protect its interests. Provides additional yield to compensate for the risk presented by Issuers unwilling/unable to secure a vote to override this provision.  Cons:  Risks alienating Issuers who wish to retain and utilize the power to change terms of their Issuance without approval from Maker. Issuers may prefer not to change terms that would be beneficial to the underlying debt pool in order to avoid the burden of gaining the approval of Maker.     Should Maker Automatically Raise Stability Fees by 3% (300 bps) When An Issuer Alters Terms Of Their Executive Summary?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The poll will run until July 3, 9:00 am EDT/13:00 UTC ; this will result in on-chain-polls assuming the outcome of the poll is affirmative ",

                    "content": "@PaperImperium a couple of points:  SR pools should show who the voters are You sit on the RWA Committee, yet didn\u2019t collaborate at all with the committee members to craft a proposal that would come from the Committee. You have the new proposal that RWF, Centrifuge and NS have discussed that was shared with the committee for comments. You seems to act like nothing is being done which is not a fair statement. The delay is moving to 21 days btw. And enforced by the Independent director. The change will have to wait that all DROP holder wanting to leave have left. All members from the RWA Committee could get the notice. I guess we will have a mandatory post as well. While it is complicated to decide as a community is such short notice, I guess that PPGs are here for that. I guess that everyone agree that being slow is shooting ourselves in the foot (the last change in rates for crypto vaults decided 3 weeks ago and yet not in effect). Are we in planning to be slower than TradFi? Your proposal add the fact that we can change the rules unilaterally (increasing the SF while we never discussed that earlier), the exact thing you don\u2019t like. Contrary to New SIlver that has a contract with its investors, we don\u2019t so we can do whatever we want. But we have a reputation. I would have fewer issues by triggering a liquidation gov poll by default (not that I think it would be great). I don\u2019t get how your proposal is implemented. Ideas are great, but execution is what matters. Discussion ideas takes time and removes us from improvement. You had also a concern about getting the CFG rewards. Seems reasonable and easy but took hours on our side to think about it and find a solution (tech and legal are usually and issue) Yet we know that it  will be solved (at least probably) when we will have a legal entity to hold the DROP tokens. I find it more scalable to let the AO changing stuff when needed. He is incentivized to have a discussion if this is significant. Having a complex governance process for all minor decision is not scalable. We own 2B of USDC yet we don\u2019t vote on every change they are making in their investments strategy (actually we couldn\u2019t as they are not transparent). I would highlight that MakerDAO is having the exact same right regarding the DAI holders. We unilaterally change stuff every weeks and never care to inform them or give them the right to do anything except leaving with a few days period.  I agree there were some failures, but the ability to change terms was mentioned before onboarding the asset. And I didn\u2019t see an actual discussion about the terms changed. There is a line, I will not cross and it\u2019s asking for more rights than other DROP investors (like an affirmative vote by Maker before changing). Fairness is one of my core values, one I think DeFi should have as well. In my view, the final solution to this problem is another core value of DeFI: transparency. If we can get all the underlying loan data public (ARV, LTV, \u2026), we could use them to have a permissionless smart contract that liquidates as soon as some constraints (code is without interpretation and public) are breached. It\u2019s the early days of RWA, what matters is keeping the same risk level of MakerDAO and progressing towards the future. I don\u2019t see how this item is adding significant risk. I\u2019m working on a post-mortem. ",

It shouldn\u2019t be on Maker to react to an Issuer. It\u2019s pretty absurd for a borrower to be able to have these powers. If they want Maker to participate in financing after changes, the burden should be on the Issuer, not the DAO.     SebVentures:  Your proposal add the fact that we can change the rules unilaterally (increasing the SF while we never discussed that earlier), the exact thing you don\u2019t like   We\u2019re the ones providing financing, and at a very low rate. We cannot signal to all borrowers that all it takes to pick our pocket is to send out an email and then wait for the DAO to be slow to liquidate. Note also that the option to liquidate is not a good one for us, due to the public debate that would signal to other DROP holders to exit before us.     SebVentures:  I don\u2019t get how your proposal is implemented.   Right now everything is manual for RWA \u2013 including oracles and liquidation orders. I fail to see how manually raising the Stability Fee would be any worse. It\u2019s certainly lower stakes, so if that\u2019s not good enough for changing the Stability Fee, then that\u2019s not good enough for the other moving parts.     SebVentures:  I would highlight that MakerDAO is having the exact same right regarding the DAI holders. We unilaterally change stuff every weeks and never care to inform them or give them the right to do anything except leaving with a few days period.

SebVentures:  There is a line, I will not cross and it\u2019s asking for more rights than other DROP investors (like an affirmative vote by Maker before changing)   Then we should be paid the same as DROP investors. I see a 50 bps difference between what NS DROP holders get and what we get. And that\u2019s after NS abruptly cut the returns to those holders by 100 bps, effective June 4th.  It can\u2019t be \u201csame rights as DROP holders\u201d and \u201clower returns than DROP holders.\u201d I fail to see what possible justification there is to allow an Issuer to unilaterally \u2013 and without input from Maker \u2013 change terms that affect the value of the DROP collateral. I can understand why the Issuer would want that power, but I can\u2019t understand why Maker would accept that without some way to counterbalance it. Remember, we\u2019re here to protect Maker, not the Issuers on the Centrifuge platform. Given that MakerDAO\u2019s acceptance of these terms is being widely touted both to potential investors on Tinlake and in their application to Aave, it is clear that we are the blue-chip, mature, experienced, smart-money protocol that is expected to be doing thorough due diligence. With our name being actively used to show the legitimacy of the New Silver pool and Centrifuge in general, we are have not simply a financial interest in these structures being balanced. We have a reputational interest in these deals not being structured in a potentially abusive manner \u2013 after all, MakerDAO\u2019s acceptance is being used in ways like this: \u201cWith our recent onboarding to MakerDAO we deem our initial approach validated and are looking to further expand RWA within DeFi while improving the setup continuously.\u201d If Maker cannot even change rates in response to changes in the underlying collateral, exactly what deal are we agreeing to when we onboard these collaterals?

What happens if AAVE, Compound via their Substrate Chain, or some new App. on a Layer 1/2 (Jet Protocol, Acala, etc.) offer Rates much lower than Maker? We have seen this happened with Governance Tokens like Balancer, Comp, etc., they just don\u2019t get any traction based on their home-base providing better incentives. And speaking of incentives, what incentives will the Maker Community provide RWA AOs when borrowing on-chain takes off?

My view is centrifuge needs more investment pools to survive and for diversifying their risk. For that they are happy to take an higher risk on their users. Users will come only for an higer rate than compound, that is also why they have started the token reward part. Instead of increasing the rate which won\u2019t really help and should not be technically possible. I think we should have a lower DC. We should spread the risk with their users and don\u2019t ending with 33% or more of one investment pool. I would consider a 10% max as a good start.

                    "content": "To the broader point about our reputation and our status as the blue chip defi protocol, especially as it relates to RWA, I really worry that we are ruining our reputation and watering down our brand with all these low-tier centrifuge deals, and as a result we are cutting ourself off from all of the legitimate, large-scale deals that would be possible to do in the future if we are just able to prove that we are able to do standard deals and follow best practice, and have the capital available. It\u2019s like we are in such a hurry to go full speed that we just drove straight into a ditch right off the bat, and will be stuck spending all of the governance bandwidth for the next many years, arguing and litigating about random issues that occured in these tiny, bad deals that we are shoveling in to the protocol right now. And of course we won\u2019t just be stuck, we\u2019ll have no credibility. Even if we did have governance bandwidth, we simply won\u2019t be able to engage with legitimate, large-scale counterparties if they see how out of touch we are with best practices and how many dumb disputes we are involved in. The root of the problem isn\u2019t one specific term or issue, it is the general arbitrary and thrown together nature of these structures that in the end don\u2019t protect maker at all, and are instead fully based on trust, and are basically unsecured with no real guarantees or collateral. The lack of any real, solid, and enforceable legal claim is the fundamental reason why things such as terms arbitrarily changing are even possible. It takes very little structured finance knowledge to know that these issues simply will not occur if we do things right instead of trying to take shortcuts, and use tried and tested structures that are already being used in the real world, like the trust company. To be brutally honest what is really happening here is that we have gone dunning-kruger and are trying to reinvent the wheel of structured finance for no real reason, and it has already blown up our face on the very first deal. Considering how important real world assets are for the future of the project, this is nothing less than a disaster that puts the future of the whole project at risk, because of how it can nuke our reputation. Reputation is extremely hard to build, and really easy to destroy. We even already have complete deal from 6S which is already being proposed with all legal documents and terms fully published and transparent (and they contain no possibility of the kind of shenanigans that it is now clear we should expect from each of the current centrifuge deals on a monthly basis), but it is being sidelined in favor of these tiny centrifuge deals that don\u2019t even have nearly the same level of documentation and legal work, and contain endless amounts of these gaping holes such as terms changing unilaterally, and of course the fact that there is not even real recourse through the DROP mechanism, and these flaws will just overload governance with brain damage as they inevitably blow up in various big or small ways. Btw, I\u2019m not arguing against centrifuge as a whole, just the specific bad, unsecured deals that are on the table right now. If you are an MKR holder and are looking at this problem from the perspective of what is best for the DAO, it really isn\u2019t hard to understand why we need to demand locked down, reliable and regulated trust company-based structures (or equivalent regulated and best practice approaches) from the deals we do, centrifuge included. There is just no benefit for the DAO to engage in this risky and time consuming experimentation when this is the time where we should be scaling and growing. ",

It will be tight.   Yet 7mo later we are still waiting on 6S to publish the enforceability opinions and for any legal review to be able to take place. If we are able to get a legal opinion on the feasibility by our own lawyers and the community decides this is an adequate way to onboard RWA to Maker we will be the first ones to adopt it. @SebVentures is working actively with SolarX on a similar setup and I fully support legal innovation within MakerDAO to improve Maker\u2019s position. The reality is, in November it was just around the corner and it still is just around the corner. I\u2019m personally convinced it was the right decision for us to move ahead with a simpler structure for now.  Maker finally onboarding the first RWA, New Silver, was welcomed by the community, led to publications in every major media outlets, a very positive market feedback (on the MKR price) and countless institutional MKR investors (A16z and the likes) reacting positively. These deals are small today because we never wanted to onboard $500M of assets in one step, it would simply be irresponsible of Maker to do so; we should learn along this process and improve it along the way. This is what we all are doing, appointing independent directors is the next step for New Silver (and will be implemented for all future collateral types we bring). This process is discussed in the RWA Committee and a solution is put forward to the community by that community & Centrifuge. Until then, this forum thread is an inferior solution as @SebVentures has pointed out in his well written response. ",

I was told Centrifuge was not interested in a conversation. In the call with NS and Centrifuge yesterday, several of us asked about this very unusual power of borrowers on your platform. We were told if we didn\u2019t like when an Issuer changed the terms, we can liquidate/redeem. If you expect Maker to onboard even more assets under this structure and plan on asking for a quadrupling of the debt ceiling for NS, you cannot expect us to delay trying to patch this hole on our own after it being a demonstrated non-priority for Centrifuge.

We do not. Secondly, Maker using its muscle to prevent Issuers from exercising abusive powers is not going to hurt TIN investors. The whole point of this signal is to prevent Issuers from using this power. We don\u2019t actually want the Issuers to use Section 4.F unless there\u2019s a really good reason \u2014 in which case they can come ask our opinion. As is, we have one and only one RWA, and the Issuer has already simultaneously changed the valuation metric of the collateral and come asking us for even more money and cut payments to DROP holders. I get why Centrifuge would come on the Maker forum to argue against using rate hikes to discourage bad behavior. But why is Maker\u2019s own head of Real World Finance on here saying that raising rates would be actual stealing? They want to change the terms? Fine.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to change these settings in a live poll without invalidating all of the votes so far.

Given how contentious the topic of RWA has been lately, I think it would be better to restart this signal in public-votes mode - however this will mean that everyone who has voted so far will need to vote again. I\u2019ll make this change shortly. Luckily there is still some time before this signal ends, and I\u2019ll pin it for a few days to make sure everyone sees it.     PaperImperium:  I propose that upon public acknowledgement of notice on this forum, notice provided on this forum, or implementation of changes \u2013 whichever occurs first \u2013 Maker automatically authorizes and compels a 3% (300 bps) raise in the Stability Fee for that DROP asset\u2019s vault.

If you mean that it should automatically go into an executive vote, that is possible, though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it due to the requirement to bundle unrelated changes into executive votes. I would suggest in this case that the RWF team submit an on-chain poll confirming MKR Holders desire to act in any given scenario once notice is received - if successful, this could then proceed to the weekly executive vote.

A key point of the discussion could accurately be summarized:  Cent: you get a notice. you can withdraw. Paper: but our only choices are accept or pull the plug Cent: yes. Paper: and if we choose pull the plug everyone will get out before us and we are the bag holder. Cent: um well.   Following that meeting @PaperImperium and I discussed the conundrum and Paper mentioned an automatic increase in stability fee as a compromise as to the NS-DROP that is already onboarded (if we cannot get unilateral change terms deleted or modified to provide that modifications require Centrifuge come to us and get affirmative approval (which IMO must happen as to Centrifuge deals that have not already started)).  I support that idea although perhaps not as draconian as 300 basis points.   But I voted no because this is not the time or manner to do this.  For one, the impression I got at the end of the call Friday was that part of the problem was Centrifuge didn\u2019t understand the significance of the issue from the DAO\u2019s end of it, and a further discussion with Lucas or others at Centrifuge was appropriate - i.e., I did and do not see the situation as we are at fixed loggerheads with Centrifuge that requires the DAO to take unilateral action.  Second, there had yet to be much discussion among RWF members or bouncing the idea off of RWA core, both of which should happen before having a signal request vote.   ",

FACT: Our only RWA borrower issued a notice to change terms on/about May 21 via email. FACT: The new terms went into effect June 4. FACT: The DAO was informed June 10. FACT: Four more deals of nearly identical structure have been pushed into a vote before the RWA committee issued a recommendation. FACT: The borrower who altered their terms in the first two months is asking us to quadruple their financing line. FACT: Exactly zero DAI have been spent by the RWF unit on a legal review of any of this structure. FACT: The liquidations of these assets is outsourced to Centrifuge, which is both untested in a real world situation, and does not offer Maker the backstop of a process that quickly and profitability settles bad debt. FACT: We are still awaiting the audits of the liquidation system on Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake platform, as requested by the PE unit. My opinion (not a fact): We need to find ways to leave Maker at less of a structural disadvantage in these deals ",

I feel like this issue has many of us a bit stuck in the weeds - there are things that RWA provide Maker that the other asset classes we are dealing with up to now do not provide - mainly the lack of correlation to crypto price fluctuations. For this the MKR community pays in Risk, which we can control by maintaining reasonable debt ceilings and improving the process. I\u2019m not sure why we need to take an abrupt and not very nuanced action to meet our end goals, which I think we can all agree include increasing communication between the Asset Originators and the Protocol, and bringing broader liquidity to the system.

Or, at let\u2019s focus on other FUD that actually plays a role in Maker \u2014 like we don\u2019t even care anymore that USDC makes up 55% of DAI \u2014 instead we think of ways on how to provide ammunition to folks who don\u2019t like Maker in Crypto Twitter/DeFi\u2014to possibly label Maker as a bait and switch lender, IMO(why I voted no to a 3% hike). Honestly, If we are going to be a Community vocal about FUD, I rather we focus on other crappy FUD from outside the community  \u2014 like this Ren FUD:    Ren Rug Pull    Ren Rug Pull The Ren team dumped 100 million dollars of Ren on their community.
