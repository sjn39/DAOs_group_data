                    "content": "We\u2019ve come through a period of course correction as a DAO, and have seen a few major decisions recently taken: GPC is splitting into Passport and Allo Protocol. And FDD and DAOOps will dissolve, and S17 will be their final seasons. While difficult, I see this as overall very positive. We\u2019re re-orienting the DAO around the products. Plans are already in place to move our support, fraud, and data analysis functions into the product teams. And as Kyle wrote up recently, all of this allows us to center our work around our most important things. These recent changes require additional work to be done to ensure operational continuity. Still, I\u2019m confident that we have the right structures to enable us to continue to operate and evolve the DAO.  Tension: where are we still likely to see work that falls through the cracks? I think we have two areas of coordination that remain unaddressed in our DAO.   We are missing bottom-up ideation and participation. Outside of joining a workstream, there aren\u2019t low-barrier onramps where our community can step in and contribute to shaping gitcoin. We have a tremendous opportunity with @ceresstation 's recent proposal to use the Grant Stack to invite our community to participate in a regular cadence of Gitcoin building Gitcoin rounds. These rounds can enable much of the work with no home in the current or future workstreams. This would be a massive win in terms of shifting the budgeting work away from stewards, workstream leads, and the \u2018insiders\u2019 into a public space that leverages our core product to do what it does best: elicit the will of the community to fund initiatives in a concave space.   From the other direction, we are missing the ability to execute on some narrower strategic areas, evidenced in our inability to move forward with revenue modeling, GTC utility, and similar deeply consequential but non-workstream specific tasks. I think these issues suffer from what Divya and Safron call \u201cShared Stagnation: Sacrificing progress for participation\u201d in their CIP Whitepaper. Gitcoin\u2019s current issue is that even if we employed the best in class \u201csense and respond\u201d governance techniques, we would have no individual who is accountable for getting this work done. As such, it languishes in any number of gov posts attempting to move this discussion forward. I believe we should reorient our approach and opt to have narrower accountability structures to solve this.    Proposal: address the work that we\u2019ve been missing along two tracks:   A broad bottoms up effort to source and fund the jobs the community wants done, and to use our amazing collective intelligence superpower of quadratic funding to make that happen.   A narrow, top-down accountability setting that finds leaders in the DAO to take on specific mandate to deliver on key strategic issues (i.e. revenue modeling, and GTC utility).   For point 1, please do read Scott\u2019s proposal here. I think this is nearly in the \u2018safe enough to try\u2019 territory. For point 2, my assumption is that the individuals leading these efforts would be sourced from the DAO Core team. We would expect these folks to post regular progress reports in the forum, to solicit involvement from experts inside and outside of our DAO, and to run these topics to ground in the form of proposals that are ratified via Snapshot vote. We\u2019ve had some precedent in the past for the top-down accountability with Kyle\u2019s treasury diversification efforts. I\u2019m of the opinion that the strategic work should follow a similar trajectory. Doing so would allow us to collectively remain focused on our most important things (Allo adoption and growth, and the Grant program), while still making progress on the topline strategic work that our existing team/responsibility structures have neglected. The shift here is one of process: are we ok to stop the leaderless, deliberative, and stagnant approach to these topics and move to assigning team members the mandate to lead the generation and ratification of these solutions? To the group: Does this resonate? What are the risks and trade-offs that you see? What safeguards would you want in place to make this safe enough to try? ",

In particular, I\u2019d love us to double down on @ceresstation\u2019s recent post. Such an articulate post, and I think would be awesome for us to move forward with it. Regarding the leadership piece, I couldn\u2019t of said it better. Sense and respond is all good and fun in theory and small orgs, but with multiple products with thousands of active users, we need decisive and accountable leadership that deliver results. In PGF, it\u2019s been exciting to see folks take on more ownership and hold themselves accountable, and I\u2019m optimistic this will spread throughout the DAO as we become new and improved in S17.

I see the issue as one of legitimacy and accountability. In the current deliberative format, any one person seeking to own a topic as consequential as strategy might be seen as illegitimate: who\u2019s given this person the authority to own this issue? The forums have not proven to be effective at building up consensus opinions, and CSDO hasn\u2019t been able to workshop it\u2019s way through these topics either.     kyle:  We already are getting heat about budgets being too large, and team sizes being too large, yet we find ourselves in a space where key folks are over burdened and under supported. I\u2019m interested in determining how to empower more folks to own outcomes instead of staying idle and looking for direction.   This is a great point, we might have leaders that are overloaded (I\u2019ve been there) but we also need to be building the next layer of accountability in our teams to free folks up to take this work on. If this is through internal promotion, or hiring in, we need to have the capacity for this work. I would propose that it is less about organization capacity and more about a consensual process to give individuals that empowered outcome ownership. This is IMO classic agent/principle stuff, and I have some thoughts on why we have more agentic behavior over principle behavior in the DAO. Without solving that incentive misalignment though, I believe there are enough energetic and mission-aligned folks that we could progress topics if they were freed up to move through the work decisively. Lastly, I think the bottom up approach could yield amazing results, and would love to see a number of research efforts on topics that just aren\u2019t getting attention. But for those to come through and be ratified as our core Business Strategy, Token Utility, etc. are a gamble, and we might still fall victim to the Shared Stagnation issues we have currently. ",

This might be too simplistic of an assessment.  As a observer of the leadership structure, I would suggest we have had a series of issues related to lack of focus/direction, poor signaling, lack of delegation, and the absence of realistic bench development. What to do with this? Simple:  CSDO delegates critical gaps to realistically capable developmental resources to do the work on a timeline.  If performance does not meet expectations, have a hard conversation.     kyle:  We already are getting heat about budgets being too large, and team sizes being too large, yet we find ourselves in a space where key folks are over burdened and under supported. I\u2019m interested in determining how to empower more folks to own outcomes instead of staying idle and looking for direction.   As with any downsizing \u201coverburdening\u201d gets worse as WSL and CSDO absorb work.  The primary expense-neutral options are to 1) stop work 2) build capacity in your teams 3) work longer hours.     kyle:  This is a bit of a rant, but the number of times people have come out and said \u201cwe don\u2019t have a strategy!\u201d but have done nothing to improve that situation is getting quite old   I am going to rant back.  Speaking for myself, in the last two weeks I have been paralyzed by fear.  Not fear for my job; I am retired, I work here because I want to.  But fear of wasting my time (ok and a bit of losing the job\u2026 Gitcoin is a great platform to work on solving DAO governance - my passon). Fear that my work:  does not matter / is not valued fear this work is not inline with other ideas somewhere else fear my work is going to be torpedoed at the 11th hour by some last moment dismissal  Yeah, I have been here before (in the old world) and I know how to manage.  I just need to write project plan, get stakeholder alignment, and move forward.     kevin.olsen:  The forums have not proven to be effective at building up consensus opinions, and CSDO hasn\u2019t been able to workshop it\u2019s way through these topics either.    Building consensus takes a lot more effort than posts on a forum I tend to think CSDO should be more delegatory vs. executional Consensus is the wrong orientation - we don\u2019t need consensus, we need the opportunity to provide meaningful input (aside from the forum).  MMM has done this exceptionably well lately.      kevin.olsen:  I would propose that it is less about organization capacity and more about a consensual process to give individuals that empowered outcome ownership.   No, lets be realistic, its about capacity too.  To focus on \u201cthe most important things\u201d, we have to make time for \u201cthe most important thing\u201d and that means more work on \u201cthe most important things\u201d. As the org shifts work around, we don\u2019t all magically end up with more time.  It actually takes more time and causes more work as we fumble around trying to figure out what gets absorbed and what goes away. Developing people and effective delegation takes real time and work and I think we have room to improve there.  All of this takes capacity, so if we are serious about success with this new work, we have to stop other work.     kevin.olsen:  Lastly, I think the bottom up approach could yield amazing results, and would love to see a number of research efforts on topics that just aren\u2019t getting attention.   Love the idea and I know it can work.  But damn. Speaking for myself, Gitcoin does does not feel like a \u201cstick your neck out\u201d environment atm.     kevin.olsen:  But for those to come through and be ratified as our core Business Strategy, Token Utility, etc. are a gamble, and we might still fall victim to the Shared Stagnation issues we have currently.   This is not the most fertile soil I have seen for \u201cbottoms up\u201d initiatives.  I suggest CDSO sucks it up and decides what is most important, and then makes realistic delegations (considering capacity and capability). ",

I agree with @shawn16400\u2019s comments that it is not only a question of empowerment, but also of capacity. Through a well-defined GCP process (combined with requests for proposals, within this process), it will be easier for CSDO to delegate these crucial - and very high-context - topics to teams, whether they are part-time contributors or specialists outside of our DAO. The combination of these two initiatives - and a clear delineation between both to indicate what process serves which outcomes and to avoid overlap and confusion- might help us break through the stagnation you described so well. Thanks for voicing this so well, a lot of this can further enrich the two processes which are being outlined, excited for what will come out of this! ",
