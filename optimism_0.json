Ooki Protocol (Ooki.com) is a protocol for margin trading, borrowing, lending and staking deployed on multiple blockchains. Ooki is a fully decentralized, DAO led project, governed by community vote for all major changes to the protocol. Ooki users can open margin trades with up to 15x leverage using a fully decentralized trading platform. Ooki users can lend out funds and earn interest on their capital, and also borrow funds against collateral. Ooki users can participate in platform governance through the OOKI DAO, and use their OOKI tokens to vote on proposals, submit new proposals, and participate in platform governance. We are excited to service the entire Optimism Ecosystem with secure and reliable DeFi leveraged margin trading, borrowing, and lending services for long tail tokens deployed on Optimism. Initially, after Ooki is deployed, margin trading/borrowing/lending pairs will include USDT, USDC, DAI, UST, FRAX, ETH, WBTC Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): In order to provide an optimal DeFi experience, sufficient liquidity is needed for traders to open new margin trading positions. On Ooki, anyone can lend out funds and earn interest. Initially, seed liquidity is necessary to provide liquidity to attract and incentivize new lenders, borrowers and traders to the application. Once sufficient liquidity is established, users open large margin trading positions, short or long, borrow funds with collateral, as well as lend out funds and earn interest. Ooki has a recently launched an innovative and unique dynamic interest mechanism to ensure borrowers and lenders receive optimal interest rates when opening new positions on Ooki. Ooki\u2019s approach to delivering optimal rates to lenders and borrowers uses a variable interest rate with a dynamically changing interest rate curve. The new dynamic interest rate system is preferable because it will allow liquidity pools to grow larger. Additionally, Ooki protocol gives developers and pro users the ability to use flash loans. Flash loans are an uncollateralized loan option designed for developers. Flash loans enable users to borrow instantly and easily with zero collateral obligations, provided that the liquidity is returned to the pool within one transaction block. Use-cases include arbitrage, collateral swapping, self-liquidation, and much more. How will the OP tokens be distributed? OP tokens will be distributed to users who lend out funds used by traders to open margin trading long/short positions. OP tokens will also be to traders and borrowers to incentivize activity. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? To facilitate the successful launch of Ooki on Optimism, Ooki is requesting a grant of 400k OP tokens which will be used to incentivize traders, borrowers, and lenders to open new margin trades, lend out funds, and borrow on Ooki\u2019s Optimism deployment. These funds will be utilized in order to Incentivize borrowing, trading, and lending activity on the OOKI Optimism deployment. Utilizing various incentive mechanisms, including borrowing incentives, and trading incentives. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? After incentives are removed, users will continue to use the product in order to earn interest, and engage in margin trading long short with up to 15x leverage. The liquidity incentives are used for initial liquidity to bootstrap platform usage. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if you have feedback. We\u2019d love to hear from you! Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The planned incentive period will be between 6-12 months. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Ooki tokens may be added pending approval of Ooki DAO. ",

Our goal is to design the system to optimize the activity and incentivize long term liquidity and active users not to promote artificial usage of the protocol. So we are open to any suggestions on how we can improve and align the incentives. Let me know if the below addresses the points you raised. Why users will stick around after incentives end?  Seed liquidity to kickstart platform.  The liquidity incentives are used for initial liquidity to bootstrap platform usage. Liquidity would remain on the platform after initial OP liquidity incentives are removed because liquidity providers will earn a return on lent capital from people borrowing and trading on the platform. The OP incentives are used in order to solve the Chicken/Egg problem of traders not borrowing because there is no liquidity, and Lenders not adding liquidity because there are no traders. Once initial liquidity is established and platform usage builds up over time, then the liquidity incentives are no longer needed to retain lender or traders.  Sticky Liquidity  In addition, the liquidity incentives will be structured in such a way as to incentivize sticky liquidity with a few strategies:  Linking Demand with Usage  Linking demand for liquidity with usage. Increasing incentives as needed to meet trading/borrowing demands. For example, lenders receive a subsidized APY when lending out assets to borrowers. The funds will vest and taper gradually over time so lenders do not have incentive to stop providing liquidity as soon as incentives end. Incentivized pools will be those that require that liquidity. If a pool already has sufficient liquidity to meet trading demand, then rewards won\u2019t be applied to the pool. Traders would receive a fee rebate based on trading activity/volume. We also plan to hold biweekly trading competitions to reward top traders based on a variety of criteria (volume, size, leverage, etc.) For borrowers we may not need to incentivize them. To prevent the abuse you mentioned we could place limits on borrow duration to qualify for rebate on borrowing interest. Vesting Liquidity incentives would vest over a period of time rather than being immediately liquid. This would also incentivize sticky liquidity together with the initiatives described above. As incentives could be introduced that would tie vesting of rewards with continued liquidity providing. Why not Match incentives. Similarly to Optimism, Ooki is also a DAO led organization and the team cannot decide unilaterally to match OP incentives with OOKI as it would need OOKI DAO approval. If the DAO approved matching the OP investment grant then it would certainly be something that would be possible. However, for the Ooki community to approve matching without knowing whether an OP grant is approved or how much would be approved the proposal would not have clarity on how much was being approved and could not be approved by the multisig without this information. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if you have feedback. ",

The OOKI DAO community is willing to match a reduced amount because the OOKI treasury can\u2019t afford to match 1 to 1. The grants are used to kickstart trading volume and incentivize sticky liquidity. See details above about how these rewards are structured to achieve this, not attracting mercenary users.  We would love to have your support for this grant and are willing to work with you to get your approval by adjusting grant parameters to address concerns. ",
