This is due to sanction lists at the state and interstate governmental level, as those sanctions apply at the whole state level and lower in a substantial way. Given the nature of the protocol being permissionless and trustless, the list has been established to ensure compliance with international requirements. We understand that this isn\u2019t great news for users in these countries, but an emphasis must be placed on ensuring operation of the app for the broadest base of users and without government intervention.
