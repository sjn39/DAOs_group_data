Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Discussion(s) on Improving Core Unit Budget Requests As the number of Core Units continues to expand and several in preparation for incubation, existing Core Units strive to scale. However, growth is usually accompanied by budget increases. Recently, there has been a community-wide assertion that our workforce spending may become unsustainable, potentially leaving the protocol in a precarious situation. January\u2019s expenses vs. budget can be found here.  1380\u00d7526 480 KB  Keep in mind that most FTEs are also receiving or will be receiving MKR through an approved vesting proposal.  This exponential growth in Core Unit expense comes unnoticed; several discussions have already been initiated on the Forum and public calls. Recognized Delegate, Doo Nam, calls for improving Core Unit budget examination and awareness. Doo-  \u2026we are seeing more and more requests for an increase in budget and new Core Unit onboarding applications with large budgets that I fear are overwhelming the Maker community. This is especially critical as the profit for the Maker protocol has been declining dramatically. Each budget modification request should be examined carefully, but in reality, it has been difficult\u2026  Members from SES and SF Core Units are working together to improve and implement a standardized budgeting process for Core Units. Aes-  We have outgrown MIP40 - while it served its initial purpose, it is much too broad and needs more structure so DAO members can more easily assess budget requests a. SF will be proposing a revised MIP40 The existing expense reporting is highly fragmented and not standardized, making it extremely challenging even for those who are full-time to assess how CUs are spending their budget a. SF is collaborating with SES to standardize this process and provide best practices, but it will require CU buy-in Lack of performance evaluations and accountability for CUs - this should be a part of any budget increase request a. SF is collaborating with SES and delegates to launch a qualitative and quantitative review process  Below is a chart provided by Aes that shows an up-to-date comparison of active budget proposals in RFC relative to their previous budget.  973\u00d7397 18.8 KB  Recognized delegate, MakerMan also voices his opinion to revise the current budget request MIP, MIP40. MakerMan-  Maker now has >20 CUs with more \u2018incubating\u2019 and over 1/2 of these after as little as six months, asking for expanded budgets with greater than 10% increases. This also includes MKR vesting. With revenue on the decline and expenses still rising dramatically, MakerDAO governance needs a better way to manage MakerDAO CU budgets (this includes DAI streaming and MKR vesting).  He also provides several suggestions to help improve governance ability with managing budgets. However, this is not all doom and gloom; many Core Units and Delegates agree with these opinions and are willing to help streamline the process to help improve future budget modifications.   This Week in Governance  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Weekly MIPs Update #78  1122\u00d7756 30 KB  RFC and FS Dates for reference and existing proposals can be seen on this new proposal tracker (WIP)! The Ratification Polls for March\u2019s Governance Cycle are now up. Go cast your vote! If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful. Things to Come:  The last day of modifications for proposals expecting to enter April\u2019s Governance Cycle is March 30, 2022! The next Formal Submission Window will be open from Monday, April 4th through Wednesday, 6th. To enter May\u2019s Governance Cycle, a proposal must be posted on the forum on April 6th at the latest.  Pre-MIP Discussions:  Auction-backed DAI IAM for Surplus Buffer Proposal Ideas on the Forum [Pre-MIP] Using Gyroscope to cut through Dai\u2019s Gordian knot: its USDC dependency An RWA style solution to replace the PSM   Executive Vote Mitigate Post-Shutdown Flash Loan Vulnerability Curve stETH-ETH Onboarding, Rate Limited Flapper, Immunefi Bug Bounty Payouts Both executive votes passed on March 9th and March 11th, respectively, and were executed on March 11th and March 14th with the following changes to the Maker protocol:  Mitigate Post-Shutdown Flash Loan Vulnerability This executive proposal passed and now mitigates the post-shutdown flash loan vulnerability in the Maker Protocol as described by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit here.   Giving a new module flash-killer authorization over the Flash Mint Module, such that anyone can permissionlessly use flash-killer to disable the Flash Mint Module in the event of Emergency Shutdown being triggered. The vulnerability is not exploitable until three days (currently) after Emergency Shutdown is triggered, meaning there is a 3-day window where any user can disable the Flash Mint Module using flash-killer before an exploit can take place.   The Protocol Engineering Core Unit considers this a temporary mitigation and recommends that the issue be solved more permanently in the future via the replacement of the Flash Mint Module. The source code for the flash-killer module can be found here. The flash-killer contract address is 0x07a4BaAEFA236A649880009B5a2B862097D9a1cD.  Onboarding CRVV1ETHSTETH-A As per this successful governance poll, the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vault type was onboarded with the following parameters:     Parameter(s) New     Initial Collateral    Stability Fee 3.5%   Liquidation Ratio 155%   Max Debt Ceiling 3MM DAI   Target Available Debt 3MM DAI   Ceiling Increase Cooldown 8 Hr   Debt Floor 25,000 DAI   Liquidation    Auction Price Function Stairstep Exponential Decrease   Price Change Multiplier 0.99   Price Change Interval 90 Seconds   Auction Price Multiplier 1.30   Liquidation Penalty 13%   Limits    Local Liquidation Limit 3MM DAI   Maximum Auction Drawdown 0.4   Maximum Auction Duration 140 Minutes   Breaker Price Tolerance 0.5   Incentives    Proportional Kick Incentive 0.1%   Flat Kick Incentive 300 DAI     Add Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions As per these successful governance polls 1, 2 a new rate limiter, detailed below, was added to the flapper contract.   Modify the Flapper-Contract by introducing a rate limit so the protocol can control the amount of simultaneously running flap-auctions. This is achieved by limiting the amount of DAI that can be simultaneously auctioned for MKR. Add a parameter, lid, which sets the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to surplus (flap) auctions at once. Set the lid parameter to 150,000 DAI.  Please note that this executive proposal does not include a  System Surplus Buffer, which will remain at the current value of 250 million DAI.  Immunefi Bug Bounty Payouts As part of the Immunefi Bug Bounty Program, a total of 2,750 was transferred as follows:   2,500 DAI was transferred to 0x3C32F2ca11D92a7093d1F237161C1fB692F6a8eA.  250 DAI was transferred to 0x2BC5fFc5De1a83a9e4cDDfA138bAEd516D70414b.

Active Signal Requests Promote \u201cMIP4c3-SP1: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount\u201d to on-chain poll Psychonaut submitted a very straightforward Signal Requesting. At issue: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount 6 Considerations (not pros and cons):  Increase the payout for critical severity web bugs from 5k-50k to a single amount of 50k. Reduce negotiation around the critical severity bounty amount. Increase incentive for whitehat hackers to pursue Critical potential severity web bugs.  Onboard D3M For Notional Finance Recognized Delegate GFX Labs is signaling to onboard a D3M (DAI Direct Deposit Module) for Notional Finance\u2019s 3-month-maturity DAI lending pool 1, with an initial debt ceiling of 10 million DAI (unless recommended otherwise by Risk Core Unit).    [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance   Pros:  Increased revenues. As of writing, the 3-month rate on Notional is north of 7%, on a base of around 85m DAI. For example, even a trial 10m DAI DC would firmly put a Notional D3M in the top 10 ilks by revenue. (10m DAI is currently estimated to suppress rates only to 6% as of writing)   For reference, estimated yearly revenue from other top ilks are below:   Increased control over the front end of the yield curve. Strategically, Maker\u2019s use of D3Ms across multiple lending venues will exert control over more of the total market, dampening effects of fragmented liquidity for DAI, as well as volatility during market downturns. Being fairly insensitive to gas costs, Maker\u2019s D3M for Aave has allowed for steady DAI rates even in the face of intense volatility. That stabilization can also be applied to the very shortest portion of the yield curve. Diversification of counterparties. Maker currently faces existential risk from various counterparties: Circle, Lido, Bitgo, Paxos, and occasionally Aave. By growing DAI supply and increasing the rate by which the Surplus Buffer grows, a program of diverse D3Ms advances the goal of reducing excess reliance on individual counterparties. Familiar credit risks and technological risks. The risks represented by exposure to Notional\u2019s overcollateralized lending platform (listed under Cons) are risks that Maker has deep expertise in evaluating and monitoring through Collateral Engineering Services, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Units. Reduced reliance upon stablecoin collateral. As of writing, the DAI supply is 68% backed by stable collateral, the bulk of which is 5,300,000,000 USDC and nearly 500,000,000 USDP. D3Ms can scale quickly and are limited only by the depth of their deployed markets, allowing them to grow as demand for DAI on the lending platform grows. Not only does this increase DAI supply, but it should also lower the demand for the PSMs, as there are alternative methods of obtaining DAI.   Cons:  Smart contract risk. There is always smart contract risk with any protocol-to-protocol interaction. Steps to mitigate this for Notional include an audit by ABDK, a $1,000,000 bug bounty program on Immunefi, analysis via Code4rena, formal verification via Certora, and a pending diligence report by Consensys. Multisig risk. Notional\u2019s governance mechanisms are still in the early stages of decentralizing. At the moment, key portions of the protocol are governed by a 3 of 5 multisig. No firm timeline is set, but the multi-sig\u2019s admin powers are intended to be phased out over time. A possible mitigant of risk to Maker is that one of its delegates (GFX Labs) is one of the signatories, and all signatories are fully doxxed 1. Note that other underlying collaterals already in Maker\u2019s portfolio also include governances with multisigs, so this is not a novel form of risk. Illiquidity risk. If the amount of DAI in the liquidity pool drops due to LPs withdrawing their capital, there may be insufficient liquidity for Maker to withdraw 100% of its capital prior to maturity. It should be noted that Maker will always be able to withdraw its capital upon maturity regardless of the liquidity in the pool. This illiquidity risk only refers to withdrawals prior to maturity. A gradual scaling of maximum exposure can keep in mind to mitigate this. Capital loss risk. If liquidations do not perform properly, capital loss is a risk. Notional has built a robust liquidation infrastructure 1 and currently utilizes conservative parameters. Being an overcollateralized lending platform, the risk of bad debt stemming from default is, in principle, low. While probably unnecessary for Maker, there is also coverage available for Notional under Nexus Mutual. Oracle risk. Notional utilizes Chainlink oracles for the four listed assets. Maker is already exposed to Chainlink oracles via Aave and (soon) Compound.    Onboard PAXG Another Signal Request for new collateral onboarding was posted by the Strategic Finance Core unit, this time for onboarding PAXG (PAX Gold).    [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG   Pros  Gold might be an important building block for DeFi. When we onboarded WBTC, it was small and unproven in DeFi; since then, it has been an important piece, in part thanks to MakerDAO. The same thing can happen with PAXG. DeFi can provide yield for gold and attract TradFi people This onboarding might increase our relationship with Paxos. US Dollar dominance is under attack (especially after the weaponization of the dollar), and strong inflation is on the menu. Both are good for gold.  Cons  Gold can fall into oblivion soon. The current rates increase are bad for gold. PAXG is centralized by Paxos Demand can be lacking, and we would incur a loss and a defocus (Oracle costs)      Community Deep Dai-ve  Tweet of the Week      twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  \ud83d\udcc6 This is the first #MakerUpDaits!

It is not generally transferable; it can only be minted into or transferred between voting or delegate contracts. This allows for full participation within governance while ensuring that staked MKR cannot be traded on liquid markets.   1248\u00d7654 36.5 KB   1248\u00d71102 50.7 KB   1248\u00d7648 41 KB  Initial example parameters are provided, and the proposal is open to the public for further discussion.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here.   Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  ETHDenver Preparation ETHDenver is here! Many Core Units, delegates, and community members will be attending. @gov-comms-core-unit is working in collaboration with various MakerDAO folks on a shared document to track events, talks, people, and other resources. So far, we believe members from the Protocol Engineering, Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling, Growth, Collateral Engineering Services, and GovAlpha teams will be in attendance!  DAI Total Supply Hits 10B; Meme Challenge! We did it: The Dai total supply has surpassed 10 billion! For this special occasion, @makerburn has announced an opportunity to win an exclusive one-of-a-kind NFT commemorating the 10B DAI Makerburn moment. Throughout the next two weeks, everyone is invited to submit their best meme to accompany this glorious moment, and multiple entries per user are allowed (but no spamming!). The meme with the most likes will claim victory and ownership of the exclusive NFT. Good luck! The competition will close on 2022-02-22T16:00:00Z   This Week in Governance  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Weekly MIPs Update #74  Ratification Polls open today! Request for Comments and final submission dates for reference and existing proposals can be viewed on our new proposal tracker (WIP)! Ratification Polls for the February Governance Cycle are now up: Go make your voice heard! If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, this manual might be useful.  Executive Vote There will be no executive votes until February 25th, 2022, due to ETHDenver. GovAlpha will be running non-executive polls, as usual. There should be plenty of items to bundle together when executive proposals resume on February 25th. Reach out to GovAlpha for any inquiries or concerns.

Active Signal Requests MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp Signal Request Ends February 18th The Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier poll passed, which led to compensation calculation changes for December. However, one delegate, @MakerMan, received no compensation for November and would have received 8,245 DAI if the new compensation model had been in place. In response to this event, @prose11 has submitted a signal request asking the community whether the protocol should pay MakerMan the 8,245 DAI for his Recognized Delegate duties in November, calculated based on the December formula change. Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot Signal Request Ends February 25th The Ambassador Program, which provides non-English-speaking communities with resources and educational materials, had its funding disrupted by the offboarding of MKT-001. @Kat took the initiative to spearhead the Program without the attachment of a Core Unit and is seeking 25,000 DAI to complete the pilot and associated projects over the next three months. She is asking the community whether MakerDAO should fund the Ambassador Pilot Program. Allocate 20M to protocol owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP Signal Request Ends March 3rd In response to a recent discussion, @psychonaut believes the simplest method for improving MKR liquidity is to add protocol-owned Dai/MKR LP shares to UniV2. He asks the community whether Maker should allocate 20M to a protocol-owned UniV2 MKR/Dai LP and presents his argument that the pros outweigh the cons:  Pros:  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g., Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc.) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set up and forget about it)  Cons:  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise lots of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is practically opposite to flop auctions    Bring back the MKR burn Part II Signal Request Ends March 4th @ultraschuppi states that the recent executive vote to temporarily disable Surplus Auctions and MKR burn had intentions to return to the original lerp mechanic. However, an on-chain poll added the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module. In response, Schuppi asks the community whether the protocol should return to the previous partial burning configuration as agreed in November, but with the following conditions:  The Rate Limiter has been installed on mainnet; this will take a couple of weeks. An initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set.
