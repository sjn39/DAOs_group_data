With this answer:  If you are using an Ethereum client that is not updated to the latest version (listed above), your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the upgrade occurs. You will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ether or operate on the post-upgrade Ethereum network.  Could be expanded to explain how to recover from this situation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard (someone can correct me). I think they just have to upgrade even if they missed the fork, so perhaps a sentence something like:  If you do get stuck on the incompatible chain, you can simply upgrade your client and it will catch back up to the correct chain eventually.  A little mini EIP. ",
