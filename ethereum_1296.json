Just for shits and giggles I did that with an empty wallet, and now it\u2019s showing a balance of 50k USD in something called \u201cVALUE\u201d. I looked it up and from what I can tell there\u2019s a real crypto called \u201cvalue liquidity\u201d. But I think this is actually some worthless Ethereum based custom coin that\u2019s just glitching the wallet into displaying the price for the actual crypto called value. When I check my address on an ETH explorer it\u2019s showing 0 balance and no transactions. But Atomic wallet still thinks I\u2019m holding 50k. Anyways, This is for sure a scam, But What\u2019s the angle here? How do the scammers get money from this? And how are they able to abuse a legit wallet into displaying a fake balance?  1374\u00d7912 41.3 KB  ",
