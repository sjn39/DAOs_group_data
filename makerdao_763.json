As per the MIP-6 application submitted on the MakerDAO forum in October 2021, the group seeks to originate senior debt exposures from non-bank lenders collateralized primarily by real estate, equipment, vehicles, and receivables. Monetalis intends to position itself within an ESG mandate, sourcing both green and \u201cgreening\u201d collateral. The business\u2019 initial operations will be venture funded by a number of investors, some of whom are large MKR token holders.  735\u00d7389 169 KB   Proposed Structure & Economics Monetalis has requested a MakerDAO vault with an initial debt ceiling of 400MM DAI . The initial MIP-6 application provisions for two tiers of compensation to MakerDAO:  Principal + Interest (Stability Fee) A 50% share of profits net of Monetalis\u2019 operating fee (.5%) and portfolio operating costs (legal, administrative, audit, accounting, etc)  In addressing alignment, Messrs Pedersen and Marinelli intend to pledge \u201c100% of the founder\u2019s shares in Monetalis, valued as of the most recent fund-raise\u201d. Monetalis would originate revolving credit facilities, block discount facilities, and forward flow facilities with a maximum duration of 36 months. Monetalis would fund up to 85% of end-borrower loan receivables. It targets a gross yield of the stability fee + 2% net of losses. As per the initial MIP-6, the group put forth a maximum exposure by collateral type of:  60% property, 40% clean transport assets, 10% equipment, 15% soft assert, 15% other  If the vault were approved, the group would seek an upsize in order to meet its goal of 1 Billion GBP in cumulative originations within the first year.  Risk Assessment Methodology The RWF core unit assessed the Monetalis Proposal (\u201cProposal\u201d) and focused on three key risks: Facility Risk, Maker Reputation Risk and DAI Stability Risk . Facility Risk is the risk that Monetalis underperforms and Maker incurs a significant loss on its facility. Maker Reputation Risk is the risk that counterparties do not want to do business with Maker due to negative publicity or concerns regarding Maker\u2019s investment activities, Maker\u2019s governance processes or overall DAI stability. DAI Stability Risk is the risk that the market views the collateral backing the DAI as risky due to significant weaknesses in its asset managers, assets and/or investment structures. These three risk categories combine to inform the risk to MKR token holders, who A) will backstop protocol losses in the case that there are any or B) benefit from sustainable and responsible scaling of DAI. In assessing the Facility Risk in the Proposal, the RWF core unit reviewed the asset manager (Monetalis), the assets targeted, and the Proposal structure following the Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions. In this process RWF also viewed the Proposal through several key standards: the Investment Grade Standard, the market transaction comparison, and the Arms Length Transaction standard. The results of this analysis provided key guidance on potential DAI Stability Risk present in the Proposal. Investment Grade risk is defined as being highly likely to repay the loan with timely interest and principal. Historically Investment Grade debt has averaged less than 1% default annually. Market comparisons focus on the key risks, lender protections and expected returns of the Proposal as compared to similar market transactions. An Arm\u2019s Length Transaction is where parties agree to do business, acting independently and in their own interests. RWF reviewed the Proposal, asking would this be funded in the real world? And if it would not be funded at the current terms, what terms could the Proposal be funded at?  Facility Risk Assessment As noted above, RWF assessed Facility Risk in the Proposal, covering Manager Risk, Asset Risk and Structural Risk. Significant deficiencies in any of these three areas would cause a senior loan in the structure to be non-Investment Grade.  Facility Risk Assessment: Manager The RWF assessment discovered several significant weaknesses in the Monetalis platform.  Monetalis\u2019 principals lack experience as credit fund managers as compared to their competitors. Neither one appears to have experience as a private credit investor in asset finance nor any track record in the field. Table One below shows that the senior investment managers at Monetalis\u2019 competitors average over fifteen years in private credit investing. RWF research has also indicated that first time credit fund managers usually cannot raise investment capital without significant experience in the field with a credible track record.  Table 1  913\u00d7234 88.2 KB   Monetalis is a startup asset manager that has not originated any assets to date. As such they will need to build out and scale their platform quickly and hire personnel across all key functions, including sourcing, underwriting, portfolio management, compliance, reporting, audit and finance/accounting. This creates scaling risk for a Facility as Monetalis may struggle to consistently source, underwrite and manage their investments given their aggressive growth goals. Monetalis is not profitable yet and is thinly capitalized, likely requiring additional equity funding before reaching profitability. Funding uncertainty could impact Monetalis\u2019 ability to underwrite or manage its investments. Monetalis has an unproven business model with low expected unit economics/returns. Maker would earn approximately a 2.5% stability fee if all of Monetalis\u2019 assumptions are accurate, including no losses on their investments. As discussed later, this is a relatively low return given the significant risks in the Proposal.  Table 2   Facility Risk Assessment: Asset RWF believes that there are several notable risks in Monetalis\u2019 asset selection strategy.  Monetalis is a new entrant in a competitive, relationship-based UK, SME lending market with larger, better established players, including banks. RWF discussions with active UK SME lenders has also indicated Green financing is particularly competitive, relationship driven and accessible primarily to lenders who have consistently originated vanilla non-green deals. Given that Monetalis is an unproven, new entrant, it may have to overpay and/or risk up to win green financing volume in line with its growth targets. Monetalis is also focused on financing relatively small lending platforms (\u00a315MM-30MM deals). These deals can generally not be structured to investment grade standards due to deficiencies in key areas such as management, underwriting, servicing, sourcing, technology, compliance, and liquidity. Thus, Monetalis would likely need to add significant credit enhancement under the Maker Facility to make it an investment grade.   Facility Risk Assessment: Structure RWF assessed the facility risk in the Proposal and discovered several significant risks.  Monetalis is not providing a facility-wide credit enhancement for the Facility, creating the risk that a loss in any investment would cause a loss in the Facility. Given that Maker does not have an existing portfolio, the Facility would face higher credit risk during the ramp-up due to large concentrations in a few investments, even if there were facility-wide credit enhancement. The Proposal has loose credit guidelines, allowing up to 60% real estate concentration and no limits on non-amortizing loans. Note that most commercial real estate loans do not amortize a significant portion of their principal over Monetalis\u2019 investment horizon. As such the Facility can be significantly exposed to refinancing risk in its real estate investments. The Proposal has not included a hedging strategy yet, which is essential given that Monetalis plans to borrow DAI but invest in pounds (\u00a3). It is likely that hedging will require additional capital and lower the yield on the Monetalis investment portfolio. Though the 400MM debt ceiling ask is quite large, it seems that Monetalis\u2019 principals will pledge only founders shares as alignment. No cash equity will be invested alongside MakerDAO\u2019s vault proceeds in the wholesale facilities.   Market Transaction Comparison RWF has spoken with experienced UK private credit managers and gleaned the key terms on which they are currently financing their asset-focused portfolios. In addition, RWF has been engaged by a multi-billion dollar US based private credit fund and gathered the same terms which are both compared to Monetalis below in Table 3 below. Note that the expected yields are based on January information. We also provide additional comparisons between experienced UK and US credit funds and Monetalis in Tables 4-6 following.  Though Monetalis offers a relatively higher expected yield, it provides no facility-wide credit support while both the UK and US credit funds provide significant credit enhancement, ranging from 15-20%, substantially reducing the risk to the proposed Facility. Both the UK and US credit funds also have existing portfolios and have 15% maximum borrower concentrations as compared to Monetalis that would likely take months before being able to build a diversified enough portfolio to meet its 10% limit.  Table 3      Monetalis UK Funds US Fund     Maker yield 2.5% 1.25% 2.0%   Facility Credit Enhancement 0% 15% 20%   Max borrower concentration 10% 15% 15%     The experienced UK credit funds and the US credit fund offer significantly lower risk across the range of risk categories, particularly in both Manager Risk and Structure Risk as depicted in Tables 4-6 below.  Table 4     Manager Risk Monetalis UK Funds US Fund     Inexperienced credit manager Y N N   Solid performance track record N Y Y   Startup /scaling risk Y N N   Not profitable Y N N   Unproven business Y N N    Table 5     Asset Risk Monetalis UK Funds US Fund     Competitive SME market Y Y Y   Existing lending relationships N Y Y   May need to risk up Y N N    Table 6     Structure Risk Monetalis UK Funds US Fund     Facility credit enhancement N Y Y   Lumpy exposure in ramp up Y N N   Loose credit guidelines Y N N   Currency hedging Y Y N     Investment Grade Standard A senior lending facility to the experienced UK credit funds and the US credit fund at the terms listed in Table 3 are arguably Investment Grade, given their solid business models noted in Tables 4-6. A senior facility to Monetalis, however, would not qualify as Investment Grade as it has many significant deficiencies in its business model as noted in the same tables: inexperienced private credit managers, not providing significant facility-wide credit enhancement, and start-up business with potentially substantial scaling risk. Overall these comparisons demonstrate that there is substantially higher Facility Risk in providing a senior Facility to Monetalis than to experienced UK and US private credit funds.  Arm\u2019s Length Transaction Standard RWA has had discussions with experienced UK credit funds on what is typically required for a credit manager to be able to raise a $400MM revolving senior loan facility for private credit assets. Managers are expected to be as follows: Have significant credit investing experience with a credit track record  Have an existing credit portfolio sufficient to utilize a substantial portion of the proposed facility Have an asset management platform already operating at scale covering key functions Provide significant facility-wide credit support Be profitable or have significant liquidity  Given that Monetalis does not currently meet these key requirements, market participants would likely view Maker funding Monetalis at the proposed terms as significantly off-market and not an Arm\u2019s Length Transaction where an Arm\u2019s Length Transaction is a transaction where parties agree to do business, acting independently and in their own interests Thus we also view the Monetalis as not investable in the real world , other than by family and friends.  Maker Reputation Risk RWF is building a strong pipeline of high quality asset investors such as SocGen, a 150 year old Atlantic regional bank, a big Asia-Pacific Commercial Bank, and a top ten multi-billion dollar US credit fund\u2026\u2026 We are also engaging in discussions with leading asset managers who have expressed interest in managing a MakerDAO bond liquidity fund, including Blackrock, PIMCO, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Firms of unprecedented caliber (for Maker)are definitely interested in doing business with the protocol but are also diligencing Maker currently and concerned about incurring some reputational risk by associating with DeFi.  908\u00d7183 71.7 KB  These firms need to see that Maker has robust credit investment and governance policies in place and that they work. Substantial public disagreement over key investment and governance policies at Maker would likely cause many of them to disengage with Maker. RWF, Growth, CES, SES, the delegates and other core units have worked hard to count the aforementioned institutions as prospective counterparties in the MakerDAO RWA pipeline.  As such the quality of the RWF pipeline has significantly increased over the prior year.  It is thus important to consider each RWA opportunity, including Monetalis, not just from a Value-at-Risk (VaR) perspective but also from a signaling perspective. Does onboarding Monetalis send a signal to blue-chip, institutional asset managers that the protocol does not make untenable compromises and instead operates under rigorous standards? We\u2019d argue that the opportunity to partner with strong, incumbent asset managers will dry up if the protocol continues to onboard unfit emerging managers and put hundreds of millions of DAI at risk.  DAI Stability Risk As noted already, DAI Stability Risk is the risk that the market views the collateral backing the DAI as risky due to significant weaknesses in its asset managers, assets and/or investment structures. Given that the Proposal is sizable ($400MM) and arguably both non-Investment Grade and not an Arm\u2019s Length Transaction, the RWF believes that the Proposal presents significant DAI Stability Risk to Maker which we detail below.  The market may question the stability of the DAI if Maker invests significant funds in risky, non-Investment Grade assets , including the $400MM Monetalis Proposal. The market may question the stability of the DAI if Maker invests significant funds in non-Arm\u2019s Length Transactions , including the $400MM Monetalis Proposal. The market may question the stability of the DAI due to conflicts of interest in Maker\u2019s governance decision process to fund Monetalis as the Monetalis venture is equity funded by investors who own significant MKR positions, creating a conflict of interest if they vote on Maker-Monetalis funding decision. One typical way to mitigate this key risk would be having any MKR holders financially backing Monetalis recuse themselves from all Maker-Monetalis governance actions   Conclusion The RWF core unit recommends that Maker not onboard the Monetalis collateral as it presents significant, off-market risks to Maker in three key dimensions: Facility Risk, Maker Reputation Risk and DAI Stability Risk.

                    "content": " Monetalis - Independent Overview Luca Prosperi, Director of Inneres Auge LTD. Perspective Facilitator of the Lending Oversight Core Unit  Summary Conclusions Monetalis has provided a detailed and professional MIP6 application that sets a good standard for the real-world industry willing to access the MakerDAO ecosystem. However, in the current proposal, my professional view is that there are not adequate risk mitigating factors to provide comfort to MakerDAO, as a senior lender, over a $400m vault facility. Based on those concerns, I am not in a position to provide MKR holders positive feedback on the application. Such concerns refer to:  Start-up venture with unproven ability to deploy successfully in a highly competitive market Insufficient visibility on asset-level risks given the immature pipeline and the expected concentration levels High facility-level risk without enough credit enhancement mechanism to provide comfort to MakerDAO as senior lender, at the described terms Unproven sustainability (both structurally and financially) typical of a pure start-up rather than a seasoned senior lender Inadequate credit experience and mid-to-back office support of the management team Involvement of related parties with significant financial and political footprint within the DAO - requiring enhanced rather than streamlined due diligence  I highlight below risk mitigating factors that might make the Monetalis application palatable for an independent recommendation:  Wait for Monetalis to reach a more advanced stage of development and some track record in the market - through the advertised vehicle Raise significant junior capital at the facility level from either the company or specialised mezz credit investors, to cover 30-50% of the facility-level capital stack Raise senior capital from established entities in the market (i.e. banks, credit funds, special sits funds) to be pari passu with MakerDAO Significantly reduce debt quantum by a factor of 80-90%  At the indicated quantum, I believe that granting the required approvals constitutes an existential risk for MakerDAO. However, in the case the DAO will decide to proceed by granting the required approval to Monetalis, I believe the oversight of the exposure will require intense interactions with the RWF CU. More specifically, I believe that 1-2 FTEs should be staffed specifically to oversee Monetalis (1 credit analyst shadow-rating their credit process and underwriting methodology of new originator, 0.5 senior manager to monitor portfolio behaviour, 0.5 senior legal support overseeing underlying lending agreements) for the first 12-24 months of operations. Such costs should be taken into consideration as part of the underwriting process. Last but not least, after having overseen and reviewed the analysis performed by the Real-World Finance Core Unit, I confirm how such a process has followed the highest standards yet ever seen within the DAO. Although no legal or structural review has yet been completed, being the credit profile dramatically unsatisfactory, the team has openly engaged with the counterparty, provided feedback, as well as the ability to amend the flaws identified - ability that, as of today, hasn\u2019t been used by Monetalis. For the avoidance of the doubt, unless directly brought into the conversation, the forming Lending Oversight team I represent doesn\u2019t intend to engage into a post-to-post debate on the merit of its recommendation. The Lending Oversight team is open, however, to reach external professional counterparties who would provide an additional opinion if needed. In the case the current proposal will be materially improved on the points identified below, Lending Oversight commits to provide his updated opinion on it.  Risk Overview Monetalis has provided a thorough application to the DAO, encompassing most crucial aspects of the strategy, competitive landscape, legal and technological set up, as well as risk management. Although the application goes in the direction of the work MakerDAO has started within real-world finance, as an independent professional I believe the application doesn\u2019t have the requirements for approval in its current form, requirements described by the published Investment Criteria. Below, I will try to provide a summary of the most crucial gaps.  Key Risks (1) Ability to Deploy Successfully Completely Unproven:  Monetalis has an origination pipeline of c. \u00a3100m/ month (originally skewed towards refi of existing portfolios) and ambitions to grow cumulative origination to \u00a31b in the span of 1 year - the UK market is one of the most competitive global markets and I believe it would be a challenge for anybody to deploy with prudence such amount as existing originators may prefer recognized vs start-up lenders. This may result in a poorer origination quality Monetalis aims at achieving such origination levels through interacting with 17 originators, operating in various asset classes - negotiating 17 lending agreements, reviewing 17 risk models, onboarding 17 data packs, monitoring 17 management teams, etc., this requires a deep team with several years of experience and the tools to actively monitor and manage - even if some or many of those activities will be outsourced to an external party For comparison, comparable platforms in the European landscape employ 50-100 dedicated professionals, and take between 3 to 6 months to onboard a non-bank lender; a typical indirect credit provider that originates c. \u00a3500m/ year has between 5 and 10 years, and is fully regulated  (2) Asset-Level Risk Profile Inconsistent With Expected Returns:  Real estate remains the dominant asset class for Monetalis, with 57% current projected risk concentration and a max cap of 60% - it is my professional opinion that a non-specialist team like Monetalis will struggle to originate investment grade level of credits in a competitive market such as the UK At the onset of MakerDAO\u2019s real-world deployment, committing at least $400m into a single, macro-economically challenged (Brexit risk still TBD), crowded and extremely banked market might be excessive Most of the initial deployment (87%) would refinance existing books, while this provides better visibility of the existing risks, a detailed analysis of the data tape (both from Monetalis and from independent risk analysts) hasn\u2019t been provided - specifically, the refi of several lenders would put Monetalis in breach of concentration risk from the beginning of its history and that, although expected from a start-up fund, would require additional prudence Only <40%, at the onset, is expected to be categorised as \u2018green\u2019 investment - although this shouldn\u2019t constitute a deal blocker given the still significant level of sustainable investments in the book and Monetalis\u2019 long-term ambition, the effective performance needs to be highlighted  (3) Facility-Level Risk Profile Not Mitigated:  With a request for $400m at Maker\u2019s facility/ vault level, the debt quantum puts Monetalis in competition with other seasoned, experienced, senior credit managers rather than start-up ventures - Monetalis expects to deploy such amount in the span of 6 months and to be back with a request for a line extension after this If we consider Monetalis an independent investment manager with the mandate to build and maintain a diversified credit portfolio, and Maker its limited partner, Monetalis\u2019 proposed terms appear extremely expensive - a 50% performance fee over profits in excess of the agreed stability fee, with full catch-up, seems expensive even as a venture capital investor and definitely off market when compared with senior lenders, on the one hand, or pass-through structures, on the other Insufficient junior capital at the facility level able to absorb unexpected losses in each bankruptcy-remote underlying facility - neither Monetalis nor any junior capital investor are expected to provide significant junior cushioning, at the facility level, to absorb unexpected losses in each single underlying credit asset It has been suggested that the interest payment could happen in kind or in some kind of accrual form within the facility itself - as a senior lender, we would expect the interest to be paid, in DAI form, within the vault, on a regular basis Cost of hedging between GBP/ USD/ DAI, which is expected to reduce fully or partially Maker\u2019s returns, hasn\u2019t been sufficiently investigated in the proposal  (4) Team and Financial Sustainability Deeply Insufficient:  Monetalis is a start-up company. As of today, the team has fully engaged only with two key figures in the organisation (its CEO/ Founder and its CLO) and the org chart shared with us seems extremely immature, lacking some fundamental professional figures and the team-depth to deploy its vision. Neither the CEO (with a successful history of equity/ venture investments rather than senior credit) nor the CLO (with a successful track record as a tech/ data analyst rather than credit risk manager) of the company seem to have had enough relevant experience in originating, structuring, and servicing assets in the proposed credit classes Recovery and servicing of bad loans still completely unproven, without existing relationship with NPL market operators Corporate entity seems thinly capitalised, and it\u2019s a growing concern depending on future profits rather than existing financial resources   The conclusions and recommendations outlined in this document do not include any opinion on the legal nature of the underlying agreements, need to be considered only for internal purposes, and are governed by the non-disclosure agreements in place between Inneres Auge LTD and other parties.

                    "content": " Dear RWF CU and Lending Oversight CU, Thank you very much for your Risk Evaluation and Independent Overview. We appreciate all the time and effort you have spent reviewing our proposal and your advice.  Dear Maker Community, Over the past month, we have reflected on the now published Reviews, and we have seen our operations mature in a number of dimensions. As a result hereof, we are now at a stage where we feel comfortable about releasing a new MIP that, we believe, will fit better with Maker\u2019s emerging RWA, Arranging & Clean Money aspirations. Over the coming few weeks we will continue to add material to this MIP. We will under this MIP also try to address the risks identified in above Reviews - with a focus on presenting facts and external reviews. We remain firmly committed to working with the Maker protocol to professionalise and grow RWA operations and operationalize the Clean Money vision and the Arranger role.  Potential Misunderstanding ? We will be making no further commentaries to these Reviews under this thread, expect for this one aspect of the overall Reviews, we\u2019d like to address immediately: Recently we discovered that the reviewing team has a dramatically different view from ours on how funders/companies in our industry segment, in practice, operates. Let me explain: Under MIP65: Project Clydesdal you will find the following exchange between Luca and myself:    MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution   Alternative credit origination, especially, is very time consuming even for a mere aggregator of existing platforms. Differently to what happens for listed securities, platform-originated credit is less standardised, presents spurious data, is very idiosyncratic when it comes to credit policies and quality of execution, and even being an aggregator of existing platforms requires a lot of work and man power. As a benchmark, large alternative credit originating platforms in Europe (I can provide examples if asked) that originate 500m of new loans per year are i) regulated by ECB/ local central banks, ii) have staff ranging between 50 and 100 people, iii) have spent several 10s of MM on proprietary tech platforms, iv) have at least 5 years of history - onboarding an originator typically requires 6 months of work, even before scaling deployment.      MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution   Agreed. This is why, as you know from our MIP6 on Monetalis, we are doing senior secured wholesale lending to non-bank lenders focused on unregulated SME lending - and stay far away from platform-originated credit and pure credit origination in general - platform-originated credit has proven reasonably hopeless to manage - many wholesale lenders got in trouble trying to work with these platforms when they were particularly \u201cin vogue\u201d - and pure origination businesses can take a lot of time to scale, require a lot of risky investments, and often doesn\u2019t actually become as successful as one might have hoped. A pure originator business of the kind I think you are alluding to would, usually, have a revenue model focused primarily on origination fees and some equity lending capital exposure margin. Wholesale lenders, like Monetalis, are more akin to an investment manager with revenue solely from % of AuM fees plus profit-share. With Monetalis we\u2019d grow, over 8 to 12 months, to work with a total of around 10 or so lenders to deploy USD 400M - and we\u2019d need about 10 to 15 people over time, to run efficiently and safely the whole operation - a bit larger team than what is market norm, but we want be sure we are equipped to scale further and appropriately support Green Economy underwriting. If wholesale lending required many more people, nobody would be doing this business today in the UK - the maths simply wouldn\u2019t stack up: 1% mgmt fee @ 400M = 4M USD is not going to hire a lot of people and pay for much operations and necessary, substantive, services required (legal, structures, audits, accounting, banking, IT etc). Yes, there is also a profit-sharing component, but that is rarely considered to add much in any cost base evaluation - as it is largely variable. With 10 to 15 employees, this is not the best AuM/person situation - I am not too happy about it I\u2019ll admit. In estimation, by our insider sources, Conister Bank has about 5 people running a growing non-bank SME wholesale lending book of GBP500M+ and Hampshire Trust Bank has a similar GBP200M+ book growing with even fewer staff. Obviously they use their general bank infrastructure for a few things and so you could allocate a few more FTE to their operations, but not many. Anyhow, we accept starting a bit over-staffed compared to industry to ensure we can scale with Maker. As we have so many senior staff with 15y/20y+ experience in industry who knows exactly what is ineffecient in todays wholesale lending processes, we built our own IT helping us to be more efficient (as many of these wholesale lenders are still reasonably paper-based in their processes) and we may invest a bit more in that over this year, but that is only say 500K or a bit more - it is just a wholesale lending onboarding, admin, monitoring and reporting system on AWS. In terms of onboarding lenders, I\u2019d say from first intro meeting to signing facility letter and first dollar out in senior secure loan we are talking about 3 months. Luckily we have a sizable pipeline and several of them are at various stage into this 3 months process so deployment can start very fast.      MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution   Here I disagree. Complexity, resources required, time required, tech required, don\u2019t change. A non-bank lender is a platform. I believe, based on my deep experience in the space, that onboarding and working with 10 non-bank lenders would require years to set up a proper onboarding, shadow rating / monitoring team, data polishing team / track record. I can qualify my statements, and will ask top mezzanine/ credit investors in the UK to support my concerns with official opinions. I believe a comparison with Banks doesn\u2019t stack well as they rely on several internal resources. I have worked closely, in my career in the UK, with professionals from Blackstone, KKR, Apollo, Ares, HIG, Metric, CrossLend, Banco BNI, Varengold - I will be happy to engage to show how difficult it is to do this at scale. Specifically, I would feel much more comfortable to have this type of institution providing mezzanine financing ahead of the Maker facility as it would give a lot of strength to your beliefs   You will see this view is also repeated here specifically in the Independent Overview     luca_pro:  For comparison, comparable platforms in the European landscape employ 50-100 dedicated professionals, and take between 3 to 6 months to onboard a non-bank lender; a typical indirect credit provider that originates c. \u00a3500m/ year has between 5 and 10 years, and is fully regulated   As you can see, that is a material gap in opinions. Something is clearly amiss! One explanation could be, of course, that Monetalis is just entirely wrong about how our industry works. Another explanation could be that the reviewing team might, unintentionally, have been looking at a slightly different private credit segment than the one directly related to our business? And if so, would such an incongruence carry over to other aspects of the review - particularly the industry benchmarking parts? To get to some solid ground on this, in the spirit of scientific governance, I shared the above exchange with persons who have had long careers in our industry and asked them to state their views and experiences - I present their statements here below. To see what pattern would appear. In aggregate this set of persons represent 100+ years of senior management experiences in, and involvement with, the specific UK non-bank SME wholesale lending segment and industry we operate in. We rather feel this supports our view on the common operating model for the industry, but ultimately we leave it to the Community to judge for yourself.  STATEMENTS FROM INDUSTRY \u2013  GEORGE S. ASHWORTH BACKGROUND: I have worked in this industry for over 40 years, of which over 20 in board level roles. My most recent relevant roles have been:  Managing Director of Santander Asset Finance plc, Managing Director of ABN AMRO Leasing UK Ltd, Managing Director of Aldermore Bank Asset Finance, Operations Director of Lombard / Royal Bank of Scotland.  I have served as:  Chairman of Asset Finance Board (UK Finance & Leasing Association) Board Member of Leaseurope in Brussels Chair the Aberystwyth University (AU) Risk & Assurance Committee and Chair of AU Investments Committee.  STATEMENT: I believe that the Monetalis proposition is just what certain segments of the non- bank SME lending market is crying out for. There are product segments within the non - bank SME lending space that are constrained in their growth. This is not because of any lack of demand on the part of market participants. The market is determined by the risk capacity of the lenders engaged within it and the liquidity they are prepared to commit to it. Having been involved with this market for the entire length of my professional career, I respectfully suggest that Alan Pedersen is correct with regards to the following points:   Over the next 8 to 12 months the business should be able to establish lending relationships with c. 10 non \u2013 bank lenders with a view to deploying $400m of liquidity;   Monetalis will only need about 10 to 15 people over time, to run the whole operation efficiently and safely as well as manage growth. This is because:  The deals are generally big - ticket value of the transactions involved; In-house legal resource is good, but not essential key factor for success as the team can rely on reputable and experienced external firms; The team\u2019s ability to operationally oversee the portfolio and to ensure that Credit Policy is maintained is a function of technology, experience and clear processes; The core team will also typically rely on external auditors for quarterly on-site due diligence.    Based on these factors, a core team of experienced individuals should be able to build and manage a portfolio of $400m quite comfortably. Further, as Mr Pedersen acknowledges Monetalis is initially a little over-staffed compared to industry norms,  but this is \u201cto ensure Monetalis can scale with Maker\u201d;   Allan Pedersen is correct when he refers to a timescale of c. 3 months for the on-boarding of client lenders.   \u2013  TARUN MISTRY BACKGROUND: I have focused on the leasing and specialty lending sector for 30 years.  As a Chartered Accountant I worked in the industry as Finance Director for various lending businesses across the credit spectrum and at various stages of their business cycle. I was asked to join Grant Thornton in 2003 to establish a specialist advisory practice in this sector.  Under my leadership, as Partner, this team ultimately became a multi-disciplinary leading advisor practice which was focused on creditor advisory work in distressed environments and then ultimately developed into a practice that provided a full range of Transactional Advisory Services (Due Diligence, M&A, Fundraising as well as Strategic Advisory Services).  Included within his client base were Lenders, Intermediaries, Debt Providers and Equity Investors. In 2018 I established his own Advisory Practice, TMA, to more directly support the industry deliver value.  This practice has advised on c.\u00a36bn of debt and equity transactions since launch. I was also a founding director of the Leasing Foundation and a Patron of the Asset Finance Professionals Association.  I am a Freeman of the City of London through the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales and have been recognized by peers as one of the 50 most influential people in the motor finance and leasing sectors. TMA clients - include a variety of stakeholders including:  Speciality lenders Private Equity houses Wholesale/Structured Finance Debt providers (including various Banks, Credit Funds and Investment banks) Organisations (including public sector) that are seeking sector advisory services  STATEMENT: My knowledge of the structure of Wholesale/Structured Finance: 1/Teams:  Of the Wholesale/Structured Finance teams we deal with, their focus is on lending to Speciality Finance providers. These individual lending facilities put to Speciality Finance Providers are of c.\u00a310-\u00a3150m in size. They are typically composed of a limited number of qualified and experienced individuals including:  Team leader Relationship Directors responsible for origination and client management Portfolio Directors responsible for managing existing relationships and monitoring of compliance with contractual terms Junior resource focused on analysing opportunities e.g. portfolio analysis, forecast reviews and preparation of credit papers Typically these teams will then use external advisors for legal documentation, financial/operational/regulatory due diligence and monitoring. There is generally no specific credit underwriting individuals with delegated authority as the facilities they offer are of a material level which generally requires central credit approval at a level of a Credit Committee.   Therefore, these teams tend to be relatively small.  For example the Paragon Bank team which manages a portfolio of a few hundred million pounds is composed of c.4 individuals I understand that the Shawbrook Bank and Nat West teams are also composed of relatively small teams of a similar ratio to Paragon Bank. Both have larger portfolios. As such, as an independent non-bank affiliated wholesale funder, Monetalis will be well staffed with c.10 to 15 individuals on their team.  2/ IT systems I understand that these teams do not have bespoke IT systems for managing their client portfolios, instead rely on the central banking systems with appropriate bespoke reporting. For non-bank affiliated wholesale funders, the IT infrastructure usually comprises of a simple combination of standard accounting package and excel spreadsheets. Large banking systems are not required when operating outside of banking constructs. 3/ Documentation: These Wholesale/Structured Finance facilities are documented by specialist lawyers which include detailed wording on:  Eligibility of receivables Financial covenants Operational covenants Borrower base covenants Reporting requirements Monitoring requirements Termination rights  4/ Timescale for onboarding of new clients \u2013 typically this is driven by a process involving:  Initial meetings to discuss requirements and generally build a relationship Detailed discussions generally commence when there is a clear requirement for new funding which could involve a refinance or a new facility or a membership to a \u201cclub\u201d Initial credit sighting approval Initial diligence by the Wholesale/Structured Finance team followed by agreement of heads of terms incorporating the commercial aspects of the ultimate facility Credit approval subject to due diligence External due diligence \u2013 Legal, Financial, Operational, Regulatory Facility documentation Completion  The above process from Initial credit sighting can be completed relatively quickly if required and I would suggest as quickly as a 3 months but can take longer for complex transactions where there is intense negotiation \u2013  ATHOL ABRAHAMS BACKGROUND I am a financial services professional with over 25 years experience in the industry. I have been involved in 2 bank builds, in Risk Senior Management, and I have also been involved in preparing a firm for an LSE AIM listing in the development finance space. I have been a Senior Manager at ING, which included block and wholesale facilities. As a former Group Head and incumbent Bank CRO, I have been involved in negotiating wholesale funding activities, pre mobilisation. I also perform audits for funders, on lenders portfolios, and have recently advised on two due diligence exercises for portfolio acquisitions for funders, of lenders portfolios. My client list includes among others: Goldman Sachs, Shawbrook bank. Quilam Capital, Pollen Street Capital. I was the Chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association Risk Group for a number of years, and provide advisory to a wide range of financial services business and have a deep sector knowledge in asset finance, bridging, development finance, crowdfunding, block discounting, retail and wholesale banking. STATEMENT 1/ Team size:  My experience of working with these teams tends to be for portfolios of up to \u00a32b. In my experience, these teams typically comprise a small number of risk and operations professionals managing the funding portfolios. At ING, we had a team of 6-7, managing a portfolio of \u00a32b including a full time auditor. The teams we knew when we received wholesale funding in other businesses, from the likes of BLME, Aldermore and Shawbrook were small.  2/ Operations:  In my experience, standard facilities took around 3 months to finalise, based on a vanilla \u00a325m facility. Regular quarterly audits, once a facility is originated, typically took 2-3 days per lender, in addition to monthly back office due diligence carried out by the core team.  \u2013  MAX CHMYSHUK BACKGROUND: For the first 12 years of my career, I worked as a structured credit and derivatives banker in large financial institutions (Citigroup, ING, Gazprombank, Dresdner Kleinwort) where I primarily covered large financial institutions focusing on funding liquid and illiquid asset portfolios, securitisations, international SPV structures, regulatory solutions, derivatives. Since 2013 I have been actively involved in the emerging digital lending and broader fintech industry. Between 2013 and 2017 I was a founder and co-CEO of Fleximize  - a prominent online lending platform with own balance sheet, which deployed close to \u00a3200 million to British SMEs, grew to 50+ staff, and won numerous awards in the process. Upon exiting Fleximize in 2017, I ran a boutique consultancy business Angular Capital working with lending start-ups and scale-ups across consumer & SME lending, car leasing, property-backed lending, etc. Assignments ranged from fundraising to strategic and operational consultancy and implementing technology solutions. STATEMENT I believe there might be a misunderstanding here with regard to the role Monetalis team looks to play in the credit origination and underwriting process. Most wholesale lenders take a portfolio analysis approach when providing senior credit facilities to lenders and tend to focus on the following aspects when making a decision:  Quality and capability of the team in the Originator\u2019s/Lender\u2019s business; Ability to originate required volumes in a cost-effective manner; Robustness of the credit underwriting policy/process and how closely it is followed; Historical performance of the portfolio, which is the proverbial \u201cproof in the pudding\u201d for the quality of the team, origination, underwriting, etc.  This type of work requires a small team of specialists who focus on one-two specific originators at the time, and once the capital is deployed, move into monitoring role rather than taking active part in day-to-day loan book management.  This team is normally further supported by a top law firm for documentation and legal due diligence, a firm of accountants who provide initial financial and portfolio due diligence as well as ongoing audit. Team size for such wholesale lending operation is often 5-6 people and includes 2 financial modellers, 1-2 structurers, and senior portfolio managers who also act as relationship managers with partner originators/lenders.  In my role as a co-CEO of Fleximize, and later advising alternative lenders, I worked with many such teams in banks and funds and can confirm that this set-up is common. I understand that Monetalis chose this model for capital deployment as well. \u2013  HYWEL PREWETT, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MONETALIS BACKGROUND: I have worked in this industry for over 15 years. My current and most recent roles include  Head of Block Discounting at Hampshire Trust Bank where I have grown and managed a portfolio of over \u00a3150M I worked at Aldermore Bank as Head of Block discounting where I created, from zero, and managed, a portfolio of \u00a3230M Both of the above exclude figures associated with Forward Flow and Bridge Finance deals where markets are significantly larger. I\u2019ve worked alongside every major bank, challenger bank and independent lender in this space. My portfolios have c50+ live clients ranging from successful brokers with ancillary portfolios to large scale PE & privately owned lenders in the UK.  STATEMENT: Market knowledge 1/ Team size:  The wholesale lenders I work with, including banks, have teams of 3 to 5 people max to grow and manage portfolios of up to \u00a3400m In terms of Wholesale lending (including block, RCF etc) as an example, we ran a \u00a3400m portfolio at Aldermore with 5 staff. As it is common in the UK wholesale industry, we relied in external auditors to perform quarterly DDs on lenders in our portfolio  2/ Technology:  These facilities and underlying financial products are very well known in the market. We did not require any custom technology platform to onboard and manage our portfolios. It was predominantly done in Excel and through well established processes.  3/ Operations:  Both RCFs and BD facilities will operate under a detailed facility agreement, outlining credit criteria, covenants and concentration risks. Once agreed, lenders will simply be left to operate under these agreements. No shadow credit underwriting is required. Monthly monitoring and quarterly DDs are used to ensure compliance to the respective facility agreements is maintained. In context of my career, to further this statement, this is how this market has always operated & I have had \u00a3nil default to my name in 16 years In case of breaches funding can be stopped immediately and facilities can be placed into run off I would also add that post covid we had no arrears, default, or security deficiencies. This is a true test of the robust nature of our senior facilities.  4/ Timelines: The average cycle in my area is 6 to 8 weeks as the majority of our lenders are well versed at dealing with wholesale providers and have therefore built infrastructure and staff to assist with the reporting requirements of wholesale lenders. It\u2019s therefore a seamless process on both ends of the equation. 5/ Funds mentioned: Obviously I cannot comment on the strategy and investment criteria of other funders, but from what I know from the market:  One of the funders mentioned has an equity stake in a lender operating in this market. However, outside of this, their investments generally sit in areas not entirely relevant to this market Another one of the funders mentioned has some lending capabilities with a different lender operating in the secured and unsecured SME space, but their lending capabilities are limited  I am not quite sure why these funds would be included in a post about the market and structure Monetalis has proposed, i.e. Wholesale non-bank lender funding. These funders operate in very different ways (more on the equity/junior debt side), price points and very different asset classes. \u2013  ALESSIO MARINELLI, CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER MONETALIS BACKGROUND:  I have worked as CEO and other executive positions in this market for the last 10 years across UK, Asia and Australia I was one of the first FinTech to be accredited by the UK Government to be a CBILS (Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme) lender and raised funding in the form of a \u00a3100m revolving credit facility I have worked closely with most Snr and Jnr funders in this market. At one point I had 6 concurrent institutional wholesale funders in my portfolio I am a 2022 candidate for a PhD in Machine Learning Credit Models for SMEs I have worked in Financial Services with Accenture, Deloitte and KPMG across UK and Asia for over ten years My last position in KPMG was Head of the Data Analytics practice for HK and China As well as having operated at CEO level, I am well versed in Credit Technology. I have now designed, built and implemented four end to end lending platforms that revolve around proprietary credit technology. One of these was adopted by a large Asian bank for the on-boarding of their SME clients  STATEMENT: 1/Team size:  In none of my dealings with any of the funders I have worked with, I have not come across teams that are bigger than 4-5 people The teams are worked with are teams of subject matter experts that can:  size an opportunity credit assess a lender formulate appropriate covenants, conditions precedent, concentration risk thresholds manage the onboarding of a lender manage the resulting portfolio.   These teams are well versed in Financial modelling and Excel, which is how most of the monitoring is done. Although, unlike most wholesale lenders, Monetalis has in fact built a sophisticated platform for this. These teams are also typically supported by:  Experienced law firms for the formulation and issuance of appropriate agreements Independent external auditors to carry out on-site audits of the lenders in a portfolio. The DDs are designed to ensure the lender is adhering to the strict facility agreement provided by the wholesale funder.    2/Technology:  All of the funders I have worked with managed their portfolio with Excel. Only more recently some of them started making use of Open Banking APIs to monitor the collections account  3/Timelines:  When a lender is established and is supported by a suitable corporate structure, agreeing new facilities in the form of Block Discounts and Revolving Credit Facilities is relatively simple. This is because these products are well known in the market and are supported by tried and tested documentation. In Q4-2019 My lender was on-boarded for four different facilities by four different institutional funders  \u2013 ",

For what concerns me, as a potential future facilitator of a Lending Oversight Core Unit, I want to stress that, yet again:  The process followed by @williamr RWF CU has been professional and unbiased towards all counterparties, both as advisors for a potential future MIP applicant (as in the case of Oasis Pro Market)  and as risk/ commercial consultants for those counterparts that have already gone through a SIGNAL or MIP process (as in the case of Monetalis) The second review provided by myself has been independent, and not biased by any other entanglement; I do not have neither professional nor financial relationships with any perspective counterparty - that does not mean I do not have a qualified opinion on the institutional capabilities of one against the other as this is part of the Lending Oversight mission The Lending Oversight group doesn\u2019t want to act as a bottleneck, and its opinion can be taken into consideration or ignored by MKR holders - counterparts also maintain the freedom to incorporate the feedback provided or ignore them if they consider them not relevant  For what concerns Allan\u2019s comments, I have mentioned that Lending Oversight doesn\u2019t intend to engage on point-to-point debate, unless new information is provided, or an error on Lending Oversight\u2019s side has to be acknowledged. All the points highlighted here have been duly considered - and are aligned almost fully with the first opinion provided by @Eumenes in his review. Given that no new relevant information has been provided, I do not believe there is a need for further clarifications. Regards, Luca ",

                    "content": "Two overall points on this thread: (1) Core Units perform an important function as dedicated experts in their respective field. As with many other organizational designs, MKR holders, including myself, rely on Core Units to conduct impartial analysis and review of certain topics, through power delegated to them by the community, due to their experience and deep level of understanding in particularly nuanced subjects. Although Core Units only provide recommendations contingent upon final voting by community members, I find these recommendations invaluable and think it\u2019s important to include them as a highly relevant part of a structured governance process. (2) An essential element of Core Units is their relative independence, something that is highlighted through their lack of conflicting interests when actively evaluating a proposal. If this principle cannot be upheld due to financial or other interests in an ongoing proposal, those Core Unit members should abstain from participating in that process. Core Unit members should not, and to our knowledge do not, have a financial stake in any entity going through the MakerDAO governance process. As a result of these standards, Core Unit members are uniquely suited to provide impartial, unbiased advisory opinions that are based on objective analysis. I believe this independence is critical to the long-term success of decentralized protocols, and an important feature of the Core Units. ",
