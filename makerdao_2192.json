This is their first interaction with Maker and will serve as a trial of what they could do in the future with it.   SG Forge  Societe Generale-Forge (SG-Forge), a subsidiary of a French multinational investment bank, has settled 7 million DAI generated from the Maker Protocol. The well know deal with SG-Forge for refinancing up to \u20ac40 worth of digitally covered bonds on its balance sheet, already took place, being the first transaction of its kind, a DeFi lending protocol was used to refinance security tokens issued by a traditional bank. As the deal has fully completed its initial goal shown on the MIP6 Application, SG-Forge also launched a PR on their website, explaining the deal to their users, meaning DeFi and MakerDAO reaching a whole new ecosystem of users. Read more here.   DSR comeback  Back in December, the Dai Savings Rate went from 0.1% to 1%. Since it was approved here on an executive vote, over 34 million DAI were supplied to the DSR contract. The comeback of one of MakerDAO\u2019s star products opened an old path toward partnerships with many DeFi protocols and re-opened the interest of DAOs (like Olympus DAO) and treasuries to use one of DeFi\u2019s securest yields. To increase DSR visibility, we explained how it works in this Twitter thread and the different ways to integrate it. Currently, we are in the process of integrating it into Compound and other DeFi protocols.    General updates   Business development    OKX - DAI integration: DAI was integrated into OKX Web 3.0 wallet.  Nowpayments: a crypto payment gateway. Published a Twitter thread + blog post on ten reasons you should accept payments with DAI. Thanks to their plugin integration any online store can now enable payments in crypto and accept DAI. Their partners like Travala, NGOs, and others are over 2k B2B commerce. More info here.  Coinstore: Indonesian exchange that already supports MKR, and now DAI.

In this social experiment, each project was meant to tweet from each other\u2019s accounts, reaching every user from every different dApp. This campaign showed how powerful can be the reach of every protocol if we all work together toward decentralization.    twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  Web3 is powered by composability and interoperability.   Our industry wins when we play to these values.  We\u2019re proud to be one of the 30+ protocols or orgs that took part in today\u2019s experiment in social coordination.  Decentralized, united, we win.  \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b https://t.co/ovsN1bjSEj   7:18 PM - 6 Feb 2023           140                23            During the campaign we gather over 250k impressions on all the tweets, with over 6k engagements, meaning over a 3% engagement rate, a very good and exciting numbers just for the MakerDAO account.
