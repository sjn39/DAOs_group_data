Proposal Have the top 3 integrators rewarded, that create a lot of volume on uniswap pools Have the top 3 referrals rewared, that generate new users on uniswap Have the top 3 innovators rewarded, that generate working prototypes / bridges to other protocols / bug fixes. The first two can be decided after some metric, automated calculations. The last one can be decided by community voting. Do this every Quarter of a Year. Dont give too big incentives, but big enough that innovators etc. are happily rewarded. This is a incentive mix, to step into the future and have the community and the protocol flourish. ",
