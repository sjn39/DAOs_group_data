The Core Units involved in exploring this new collaboration are DUX, GovAlpha, GovComms and SES.   While we\u2019re working out the details of the new initiative, bi-weekly planning meetings are replaced by async status updates. The calendar invitation has been removed from the community calendar.     Resilience Improvement Initiative - Status Update  The DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative As many of you know, @SES-Core-Unit started the DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative a couple of months ago against the backdrop of falling revenues for MakerDAO, when the bear market just started to show its teeth. It was focused on the prevailing feeling that MakerDAO is too divided to deal with the upcoming challenges and that it is lacking high-level direction. The goals of this initiative were defined as:   Improving MakerDAO\u2019s financial and operational resilience, making it more efficient and \u201crecession-proof\u201d   Experiment with Core Unit and Delegate coordination towards an emergent strategy and vision.   Ensuring that short-term changes fit within a long-term strategy.   These goals remain more relevant than ever to help MakerDAO deal with the recent challenges we are facing. In fact, many similar attempts were made to better define MakerDAO\u2019s governance structure and to push towards a shared vision and strategy: 1.

At the same time, we experienced a number of issues with the original format:   The timing of the kick-off coincided with an especially turbulent time for MakerDAO, where forceful short-term developments have overtaken sustained efforts of continuous improvement. A difficult environment for building long-term solutions when a lot of oxygen is sucked out of the room.   Meeting fatigue due to the increasing number of community calls has made it so that regular planning calls, even bi-weekly, are no longer the most useful tool to drive the initiative forward.   Sustained coordination and buy-in from multiple participants is required for a broad and long-term initiative like this to succeed. This is difficult to do with an initiative started by a single core unit.   In this status update, we explain the new direction that we\u2019re planning with this initiative.   Why combine forces with other core units? A continuous effort to improve the financial and operational resilience of MakerDAO requires coordination between several operational core units. As such, it makes sense to present a shared project to the community with a product focus rather than a format that emerges from the individual core unit\u2019s needs. The scope of the involved core units (DUX, GovAlpha, GovComms and SES) is generally concerned with the common theme of Decentralized Operations:   Organizing and improving the decentralized governance processes that drive MakerDAO operations.   Improving the signal of what MKR holders want to prioritize, and providing them with the tools to express which direction they support.   Developing mechanisms to build and maximize consensus about MakerDAO vision and strategy, combined with effective execution   Making information more accessible by reducing information overload and information costs   Providing the core units with a stable environment for planning and execution of value-added work   Improvement of community meetings and DAO coordination processes   Improving budgeting practices and individual core unit operations   In general, organizing work in a decentralized organization, from ideation to design to implementation     Work in Progress The work in progress can be consulted on the dedicated webpage of the original DAO Resilience Initiative. This work includes:   A vision alignment questionnaire to help delegates express their platform in a clear and standardized way.   A planned project with political sciences professor Andrew Hall to form a meaningful map of the \u201cpolitical spectrum\u201d of MakerDAO, by visualizing coalition clusters around vision, values, and strategy.   A register for identified MakerDAO challenges and high-level solutions, largely sourced from the relevant forum threads on these topics.   Connection with the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard SES recently introduced a Core Unit Budget Tool and previewed a future Ecosystem Performance Dashboard. These applications make it easier for core units to submit their monthly budget reports, and vastly improve budget transparency for stakeholders. Improving financial transparency, however, is only the start. In the future, the dashboard will bring the finances together with decentralized work: from Vision and Strategy on the highest level, down to the core unit roadmaps on the coordination and execution levels. As such, the work in progress on the Resilience Improvement Initiative is preparing the ground for these collaboration features by exploring these topics. Core Units who are interested to become early participants of the budget tool, can fill out this form or contact us on Discord.   Next Steps   @SES-Core-Unit will continue the work with DUX, GovAlpha and GovComms to explore the creation of a more comprehensive, cross-core unit roadmap.   The work in progress will be included in this roadmap where it makes sense. Through these work items we will continue to engage with the wider stakeholder group.   With these core units, we will determine an improved format to bring status updates to the community. Our preference will be to favor asynchronous updates as the primary communication medium.   As always, we value the community\u2019s feedback. Feel free to post questions or comments in this thread or reach out via our discord.
