I got a lot of shit for writing that tweet  I think that such tokens should be flagged in a database maybe much like the one you linked and wallets, dapps, portfolio trackers should show some kind of warning to the user. The biggest problem imo comes when transfer/transferFrom() does not work as expected. Many contracts assert that the transferred amount was fully transferred to the recipient. If at some point this breaks for a contract, like say the tether contract enables fees then all dapps using it would break. ",

                    "content": "There is an article posted today which covers this issue, specifically citing a recent paper on identifying poor implementations of ERC-20. There are also numerous misconceptions in the article about how governance of ERC standards work (which I will not yet speak to).    CoinDesk \u2013 25 Aug 20    Ethereum Tokens Worth $1B Vulnerable to 'Fake Deposit Attack' - CoinDesk A software bug that deposits fake balances into cryptocurrency exchange wallets has been detected in 7,772 ERC-20 tokens worth over $1 billion.      Quote from the paper DEPOSafe: Demystifying the Fake Deposit Vulnerability in Ethereum Smart Contracts (PDF):  we implement DEPOSafe, an automated tool to detect and verify (exploit) the fake deposit vulnerability in ERC-20 smart contracts. DEPOSafe incorporates several key techniques including symbolic execution based static analysis and behavior modeling based dynamic verification. By applying DEPOSafe to 176,000 ERC-20 smart contracts, we have identified over 7,000 vulnerable contracts that may suffer from two types of attacks.  This is @AlexeyAkhunov describing the vulnerability, which impacts how exchanges deal with tokens:  The attacks relies on a flawed code at the side of an exchange. Early versions of ERC-20 assumed that if transfer\u2019s precondition aren\u2019t satisfied, it should \u201cthrow\u201d (using assert). Then, the \u201cbool\u201d return value was added, meaning that the \u201cnew\u201d way of signalling that the transfer did not happen is to return false instead of throw So exchanges that assume that invalid transfer always throws, and invalid transfer does not, do not check the return value of \u201ctransfer\u201d function I think this \u201cattack\u201d is basically exploiting the confusing nature of slightly different versions of ERC-20 and their incompatibility with each other. ERC-20 should have never been changed like that, a new standard should have been created instead  ",
