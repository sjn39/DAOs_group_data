                    "content": "Hi Maker community. I\u2019m Ari Paul, CIO and co-founder of BlockTower.  I want to share BlockTower\u2019s involvement with MakerDAO and the \u201creal world lending\u201d space, our current vision for this ecosystem, and how we hope to work alongside you to build towards that vision. We\u2019ve been MKR token holders since March, 2020 and have been ramping up our public support over the last year as we\u2019ve spent more time and had growing excitement about the ecosystem.  Around June of last year I went \u201call-in\u201d mentally on what Maker is tackling.  Last summer I became convinced that \u201creal world lending\u201d A. had the potential for massive, sustainable, real growth and value creation, and B.  that this was a niche where BlockTower could be leaders and valuable long-term partners (unlike many other niches where we lack the technical expertise to partner deeply, like in ZK research for example.) \u201cReal world lending\u201d became a key focus for BlockTower a little over a year ago with this framing: I\u2019m not sure how this plays out over the next 5-10 years.  I don\u2019t know what the best investments will be, the winning business models, nor the smartest way for us to add value and participate in the \u2018stack.\u2019  What I want to bet on is this:  \u201creal world lending\u201d will create sustainable value over the next 5 years and real disruption over 10.  And if BlockTower can build industry leading expertise in key parts of the stack and establish ourselves as the most trusted partners for anyone building on this theme over the next decade, good things will happen for the industry and for us.\u201d  Everything that BlockTower is doing today is with an eye towards a decade out prize \u2013 the prize of helping build a cryptocurrency native monetary system that disrupts the existing tradfi system. We\u2019re not sure exactly which parts of the stack we\u2019ll be involved in over time, but for now, we\u2019re going where it seems we\u2019re needed and where we have competency for our \u201cactive\u201d efforts.  BlockTower as a firm is involved in this theme from many angles.  We make VC investments in projects tackling parts of the RWL stack, we have made $50m+ in loans through platforms like Maple, we buy tokens of liquid projects like Maker and Centrifuge.  But\u2026this wasn\u2019t enough.  In evaluating this sector last year and thinking through how we as an industry can bootstrap it to maturity, at least two \u201chard parts\u201d became clear: The \u201chard parts\u201d we hope to help with: A.\tPrincipal-agent problems in credit underwriting.  In brief \u2013 it\u2019s hard to assess credit investments \u2013 that\u2019s a specialized skillset that few people have.  \u201cDYOR\u201d doesn\u2019t work for credit; I have an MBA, am a CFA charterholder, and have spent 17 years now as a professional investor, and after spending 6 months trying to brush up on credit last year, I realized I have absolutely no business allocating credit on behalf of MakerDAO or anyone else.  I quickly brought on the experienced credit pro Kevin Miao whom many of you have gotten to know, and he\u2019s built out his team with other credit pros. At least during an initial bootstrapping phase, it\u2019s likely that \u201ctrusted intermediaries\u201d are critical to help get us from \u201c0 to 1.\u201d  Maybe in a few years, we\u2019ll have both technological and social infrastructure to fully distintermediate credit underwriters.  If so \u2013 great!  Our goal isn\u2019t to monetize rent seeking behavior \u2013 the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s to help bootstrap things quickly to the point that this maybe isn\u2019t necessary, or at least to a point where users have the choice.  And there\u2019s no incentive conflict there for us given our many \u201cbites at the apple\u201d in the form of token and equity ownership etc. B.\t Onboarding tradfi lenders.  At maturity, we all hope defi will be more trustworthy, more transparent, and better UX than tradfi finance.  But that\u2019s certainly not true for new platforms with experimental designs at launch.  Consider a typical pension or family office that invests in say, corporate debt.  Their team that allocates to corporate debt are experienced credit allocators.  These people are usually neither particularly entrepreneurial nor expert technologists.  Asking them to evaluate a new tech and game theory platform to entrust with their pensioners\u2019 life savings\u2026basically it\u2019s just not gonna happen.  As with, say, BTC adoption, it has to follow a path towards being trusted by \u201cnormies.\u201d  Before endowments and pensions were willing to own crypto directly, they first invested via intermediaries like Grayscale (via GBTC) or other types of regulated investment products. Only after companies like Coinbase and Fidelity achieved sufficient scale or brought pre-existing credibility (as well as various regulatory licensing), were most institutions comfortable with direct ownership.  And even today, very few institutions are comfortable holding their own keys.  It\u2019s either ownership via trusted intermediary or nothing, for now. During the bootstrapping phase, we hope we can add value by acting as that trusted conduit bringing capital to MakerDAO and into crypto more generally.  To make tradfi investors comfortable with on-chain investments, we spent the last year producing a 40-page document with detailed analysis of every legal, operational, and even tax implication that we and prospective investors can think of, for these investments.  Even digesting the content of those document are beyond the ambitions of most tradfi institutions today (not because they\u2019re unable, but because that amount of research just to explore a new platform is not what professional investors in tradfi are used to doing \u2013 it\u2019s not generally part of their jobs.)  We hope that the combination of our diligent work and brand will enable us to bring billions of dollars of new capital into this ecosystem to finance bringing billions of dollars of debt on-chain over the next 5 years. One of our investment vehicles is a substantial holder of MKR.  I can\u2019t legally commit to future actions of this vehicle, but our MKR holdings are public and I hope I have the opportunity to double down.  Our basket of \u201creal world lending\u201d investments will grow and evolve over time, but everything we hold today on that theme, we intend to hold for many years.  That\u2019s not a promise, it\u2019s just my honest intention.  I bought MKR long before we ever had the idea to partner with the DAO, because I was bullish on the community, the leadership, and the vision.  As we now have a substantial portion of BlockTower as a firm focused on partnering with MKR over the next decade, I\u2019m actively \u201csizing up\u201d the relationship, and I hope more token buys can follow over time as our balance sheet allows. Our credit team has worked tirelessly to preserve Maker\u2019s values while extending the community\u2019s impact. If you haven\u2019t already, please refer to their ongoing proposals (MIP6 and MIP90).  We\u2019re honored and excited to work alongside key members of the community in navigating frontiers in this regard. (see BlockTower\u2019s Spring Protector Cluster announcement here). We greatly appreciate the continued dialogue with the community, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me or our team with any matter of discussion.

In the interim, supporting liquidity on AMMs helps provide secondary returns that will be subject to the levels at which we concentrate liquidity and available fee tiers, see current 0.3% and 1% fee tier Uniswap v3 pool options. As for voting, we will be unable to vote our MKR tokens while holding a LP position on protocols like Uniswap, but will likely close our LP position as Maker Governance resumes in 2023 and the voting cycle resumes. \u2013 Disclaimers noted in the original post above ",
