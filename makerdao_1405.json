                    "content": "Disclaimer: This is my personal view and not representing all of other Hawks\u2019 views. 4 months ago, I made a post calling for a responsible budget and process, which was echoed by various posts before and after this post. Whether the market is in bull or not, many community members were alarmed by the rapid increase in budget spending, and urged the governance to reconsider such increases. Unfortunately, we were in minority voting, as evidenced by most budget increases passing eventually. As the bear market becomes more severe and the Maker protocol\u2019s income rapidly decreases, the community including many delegates are more willing to adjust budgets. Already several community members have made both informal and formal proposals to adjust budgets. Adjusting a budget is inherently difficult as it impacts contributors and initiatives. However, hawks arguing for cuts are not campaigning for such out of ignorance as some suggested. Resources are finite and without proper accountability, the protocol will not have enough resources to allocate to crucial initiatives. If the protocol runs out of treasury, MKR will need to be diluted and if that\u2019s not sufficient and the protocol bankrupts, there won\u2019t be a way to support the contributors. And many contributors at least will be able to move to different jobs as former Maker experience is highly sought after. But for MKR holders, after the protocol bankrupts, they will be holding tokens that are virtually worthless. I believe doves and hawks fundamentally agree on many points as both try to avoid the above situation and ensure the protocol is healthy and efficient. Therefore, while some might be more leaning in one way, I am confident that there are enough minds on both sides to make compromises and have civil discussions. ",
