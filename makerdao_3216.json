AS2 Message UML      Tokenization  Tokenization Procedure  Clearing, Settlement and Jurisdictional information  Corporate Policies and Procedures No Action Letter Request to CFTC   Business Assessment Additional links and documentation    Abstract We propose the financing of international customs shipments by leveraging EDI data messaging through AS2 and combined with a centralized clearing party (freightttrust and clearing) to provide reduced friction in enabling container shipments, tariffs, duties and other import/export excise taxes to be financed through the MakerDAO platform. We invite the MakerDAO community to improve on this proposal, both in helping decentralizing the parts that are currently centralized, and in leveraging additional markets that are possible: EDI messaging is found everywhere in the business world. Overview of implementation stack Key Concepts Two \u2018standards\u2019 that you may not be familiar with that are important in understanding are:  AS2 EDI Format  EDI: Electronic Data Interchange Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in either the American National Standards Committee (ANSI) X12 format or the UN Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (UN/EDIFACT) format; or other structured data formats.  The data is packaged using standard MIME structures.

It provides also for:   Authentication and data confidentiality: these are obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax  with S/MIME security body parts.   Authenticated acknowledgements: this makes use of multipart/signed Message Disposition Notification (MDN responses to the original HTTP message. (non repudiation)   What is AS2/AS2NG and why does it matter? Three examples of large, AS2/EDINT networks are:   Kleinschmidt   Blujay Solutions   Livingston International   Enabling access to legacy systems without having to change their current workflows is an important advantage in order to both scale out and onboard new users into the ecosystem. AS2 messages that can be transmitted over a network layer combined with the necessary on chain solutions in both managing and operating the creation of semi-fungible tokens, we can enable on-chain, non-repudiation based, asset creation of commodities that are shipped via trucking or maritime shippers and carriers. AS2NG is an improvement over the existing AS2 standard in that it provides for usage of modern Cryptographic primitives and modern authentication schemes. AS2NG Message format may be seen here: documentation AS2NG Messages EDI Schema format may be seen here: documentation EDI Schema v4 EDI Parsing and Trade Channel API specification can be accessed here: EDI Parser/Channel API AS2NG Protocol server may be located here: AS2ng github repo LibInterchange, a library of all the various EDI schemas and formats that exist, available AS2 Message UML 922\u00d71440 179 KB Tokenization Tokenization is handled through our  \u2018TrueNFT\u2019 application . This Tokenization framework is a basic implementation, other variants are under consideration. One variant we are also considering implementing a registry/database model, in which a merklized database, seen here, is used to provide updates, etc, and a registry token is minted and would have permissioned access to be able to interface for updates to the state. Tokenization Procedure Two types of currently implemented tokenization procedures exist within the AS2/Freight Trust platform:   Customs, Broker Agreement   Warehousing, Non Negotiable Warehouse Receipt   Our primary objective is the financing of tariff duties and imports/exports. CPB and Canadian customs integration is completed (October 2020).  All lent funds are secured by the underlying document, which is transmitted to customs through either Freight Trust or a 3rd party provider. The process of \u2018liquidation\u2019, what CBP calls removing the liability against imported cargo, can last up to 11 months and 29 days. That is to say that tariff\u2019s paid are really just a deposit: you may end up owing more than your calculated tariff depending on CBP\u2019s assessment. Clearing, Settlement and Jurisdictional information Clearing and Settlement procedures are outlined in our masster rulebook. Our rulebook is modeled after CFTC regulations pertaining to how Derivatives clearing organizations are structured. FreightTrust and Clearing may in some circumstances be the acting clearing agent, as it relates to transactions that necessitate the process of novation.  Note, trades are any such transaction between two parties as described in the rulebook.  Corporate Policies and Procedures   Incident Response Plan can be found here:corporate/irp]   Document Retention Policy   Customs Power of Attorney   No Action Letter Request to CFTC We requested a No Action Letter from the CFTC a few months ago, you can read it here. https://github.com/freight-trust/legal/blob/master/records/noactionletter.pdf So long as the underlying asset that is being tokenized is not traded, this does not fall under existing commodity or securities law. Business Assessment Useful: This API/service is useful from an end user\u2019s point of view as it enables there existing workflows to be utilized in enhancing both gross and net marginal profit on a per transaction basis. Usable: The API can quickly be used by a developer and provide easy-to-use functionality as it will (soon) offer both javascript/typescript and python functionality and integration. Existing API endpoints for the parser exist. Findable: Can the API documentation be found easily, and can developers start using it immediately? Accessible: The APIs provide functionality for end users who have technical constraints/limitations in consuming it as it is implemented as a middleware for legacy systems and modern frameworks/applications. Valuable: The  AS2NG and APIs contribute to the end user company\u2019s bottom line and improve customer satisfaction both by providing enhanced transparency, financial improvements and reduced operational cost of maintaining their own AS2 endpoint for communication.

A GitHub Repo we created for the Baseline community goes over it in detail Discussion and Comments We would like to engage with the community to see what use-cases could this be extended to, and obviously what the community thinks in this preliminary proposal. We understand that additional criteria need to be established for actually implementing different collateral (i.e. which subset of overall transactions would be acceptable to Risk). ",
