                    "content": "Hi Everyone! FYI this is a cross post from a post I made on reddit Has anyone had noticed strange behavior calling the ETH price oracle/feed? https://makerdao.com/en/feeds/ shows address 0x81FE72B5A8d1A857d176C3E7d5Bd2679A9B85763 as the oracle for ETH but when I call peek() I get 0x08c379a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 as my response. I checked some of the other oracles/feeds and they seem to be behaving as expected (i.e. peek() returns the current price pair). I was wondering if I\u2019m doing something dumb or wrong. Side question, is the medianizer no longer supported? It seems be returning 350 DAI/ETH or maybe I\u2019ve misunderstood what the medianizer does? Apologies if this is the wrong topic to post this question or if these are dumb questions but really appreciate any help. Thanks and best, Charles ",
