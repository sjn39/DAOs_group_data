                    "content": "This signal request is to gauge interest from the community in the development of a Dai flash mint module being added to the Maker system. Flash minting is similar to flash loans except the tokens are generated and destroyed in the same transaction rather then borrowed and repaid. The result is basically the same, but with the added benefit that flash mints can provide unlimited liquidity. For those unfamiliar with the concept. Flash mints allow anyone to mint as much Dai as they need with the one condition that they pay it all back with a fee at the end within the same transaction. This allows anyone to exploit arbitrage opportunities in the DeFi space without having to commit upfront capital.  Pros  Once we switch to the Dutch Auction system, auctions can be settled via flash mint which provides an added layer of emergency liquidity. Improves market efficiencies for Dai. Democratization of arbitrage - anyone can participate. Exploits requiring a large amount of capital will be found quicker which makes the DeFi space safer overall. Fees provide an income source for the protocol.   Cons  Development time to build the smart contracts.      Yes, I want to add a Dai flash mint module No, I don\u2019t want to add a Dai flash mint module Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until Tuesday August 11th. Next steps will be initiating a MIP13 process to be included in the September governance cycle. ",

I think it might make more sense to pursue this as a Declaration of Intent under MIP13 rather than as a governance poll. I wrote MIP13 with specifically these sorts of signal in mind, and I feel like it has a number of advantages over a weekly governance poll.  The Declaration of Intent process goes through the Monthly Governance Cycle, which gives it more weight and makes it harder to dismiss. The details of the Declaration are stored in github where they can\u2019t easily be modified, furthermore, a successful Declaration of Intent is appended to the list in MIP13. This makes it more durable and referable as an intention that Maker Governance supports and intends to implement. There is more room in a Declaration for detail and commentary on what Maker Governance wants and why than there is in a governance poll. It separates the Intention to do something from the reality of actual implementation.  Outside of the benefits for this specific poll, I\u2019d also like governance generally to get more comfortable reading, creating and discussing the MIP processes + sub-processes. Using the Declaration of Intent system would be a positive step towards this goal. ",
