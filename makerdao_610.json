Experimenting with mirror.xyz for publishing the Weekly Relay Content Metrics Improvements PDF-hosting of publications is moving away from google Internal Stakeholder Database Improvements Issue Discussion Call Feb 9th, agenda incoming ETHDenver offsite Mandate refresh Budget modification proposal   Administrative Update  Mandate Refresh We are running a bit late on it. The MKT-001 offboarding left us short-staffed, and so this week, we did not make too much progress on this proposal since our priority became continuity of service for our content publications. Mandate RFC submission target has moved to the end of next week. Feb 11th.  Contributor needs MKT-001 departure has left us needing contributors for our content projects.  If you are interested in contributing to Maker Relay, State of Dai, Forum at a Glance, and the Monthly Governance Reviews, please reach out to us in the #governance-communications-public chat. Likewise, please feel free to refer potential contributors.   Budget Expansion As our team has matured, so have our scope and resource needs. The resource needs have been accelerated by the MKT-001 offboarding. Expect:  Increase in part-time Contributor funding needs by 2x. Increase in full-time compensation needs, forecasting a potential new hire in Q3-Q4 and potential raises to existing employee salaries. Other house-keeping modifications, outlined in column L of our public budget sheet\u2019s Monthly Budget View.    ETHDenver Our team will be in Denver from February 16th - 20th. We are collaborating with GRO-001 and other CUs to create a shared tracker so all MakerDAO folks can sync on activities. Our trip overview document outlines our goals for the trip.  Responsibility Handoff Our team now uploads the weekly GnR call to the MakerDAO official YouTube channel and will service requests from other teams regarding video removal, modifications, etc\u2026  Program Updates  Stakeholder Content With the offboarding of MKT-001, a large source of contributions for our stakeholder content has departed. We are working on retaining some contributors while also hunting for new ones. All content publication posts now contain an online and downloadable PDF containing a table of contents, and require no login or Google access. Check out our Stakeholder Content Roadmap for Q1 2022 for publication-specific objectives.  Weekly Relay Published as usual.  State of Dai Published as usual.  Forum at a Glance Published, as usual. Forum at a Glance now contains greater detail for the descriptions of each post.  Monthly & Annual Governance Review January\u2019s issue will be coming out Friday, February 4th.  Monthly Core Unit Updates January\u2019s issue will be coming out Monday, February 7th. If you would like to have your Core Unit\u2019s updates in this publication, please, post it on the forums by EOD February 6th, or message @Artem_Gordon with a draft document or shortlist of updates.  Initiatives Tracking We made some progress on the Initatives, Leads, & Coordination Calls Tracker. Mainly some reformatting, addition of initiatives, and statuses about Coordination Calls.  Initiative Updates Our team piloted the first Initiative Updates segment on the Governance and Risk call this week. It ran a little long, so we are considering ways to improve its efficiency.  Stakeholder Alignment Calls In other news, this week, we coordinated the first Stakeholder Alignment call for the Security Initiative that covers;  We are in the process of setting up Q1-Q2 milestones and mapping out their associated work breakdowns.  837\u00d7472 22.4 KB   Public Calendars No major updates here. We will be doing our usual quality check to ensure the calendars are accurate for the upcoming month.

As we continue to improve this version, we are engaging with facilitators to work with us to verify team information.  Issue Discussion Calls As MakerDAO continues to grow, so does the need for developing and strengthening our governance policies. Recently, the offboarding of facilitators and core units has stirred a lot of discussion and debate. On February 9th at 5 PM UTC please join us with your ideas and thoughts as we explore the facilitator and core unit offboarding process. Stay tuned for the Agenda & Resources to be posted to the forum on Monday, the 31st.  Emergency Playbook As mentioned above, the first Security Initiative stakeholder alignment call was held for this week. A subproject of this initiative is the Emergency Playbook. We made minor improvements to the document and outlined the next steps to fulfill Milestone 2 - V1 completion of the playbook and its associated resources.  Press Relations Support We made a new press contact this week and pointed them to all the resources they needed for their story. With MKT-001 offboarded, our team is considering hiring a press relations person for better responsiveness and a potential press-release program.  Informal Poll      Should our team expand our scope to do press releases?  Yes No Other, see comment     0 voters      Communication Platform Stewardship We are searching for Reddit moderator candidates. Mario, the current mod, provided us with a shortlist of his top picks. We have not yet reached out to them. Our team is quite overloaded, so this has been in the backlog.
