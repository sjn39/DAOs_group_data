                    "content": "Following my post here, I\u2019m submitting a multsig wallet to be identified as ownership of MakerDAO. This wallet already received 40k DAI from the interim multisig. There is a legder spreadsheet here. Use of funds will be explained on the monthly Real-World Finance Core Unit report. Per MIP47c1:  Governance must be able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time.  You can check on the spending limit section here. The DSPauseProxy contract is allowed up to 1B DAI.  Signatory requirements providing no less than \u2154 of listed signatories to sign off on an action.  It\u2019s a 1 of 1 multisig so above 2/3.  All signers must be tagged on the forum and their willingness to be included in the Multi-Sig publicly confirmed.  @SebVentures , I confirm  A representative for the Multi-Sig must be designated as an official point of contact.  @SebVentures  There must be a clear and public explanation of the purpose and scope of the Multi-Sig.  Holding the funds of the Real-World Finance Core Unit to pay for expenses.  A clearly defined process for onboarding and offboarding signatories.  All Real-World Finance Core Unit Facilitators are onboarded as soon as they are ratified and signatory requirements upgraded to be the next natural number equals or above 2/3 of participants. Same for the offboarding. When the last facilitator is offboarded, Governance should take back the remaining funds.  A wallet address to be whitelisted.  0x9e1585d9CA64243CE43D42f7dD7333190F66Ca09 @charlesstlouis @Davidutro @blimpa if any of you can add it to MIP47c2, it would be awesome. Thanks. ",
