                    "content": " General Updates   KYC to work with institutions.   This week we had a second conversation with Circle. Thanks everyone for the discussion in the latest post. With all your questions/comments, we asked Circle for a second call to understand in more detail their requirements to open a Yield account with them. I think this is interesting, in case we want to invest in TradFi @PaperImperium   Circle requires an accredited investor as counterparty. It could be a trust, an individual, and it doesn\u2019t have to be incorporated in the US.   KYC for the company and also for the controlling partners in the company.   Circle is in conversations with other DAOs, but those DAOs have a Foundation or a central entity that manages the treasury.     We also talked with Galaxy. Big fans of Maker, and they would love to use Maker Vaults, but they need to KYC us if we want to work with them\u2026   MakerGrowth legal advisor will start working on this. We want to provide the Maker Community legal\u2019s PoV to understand the risks and the options we have if we\u2019re going to proceed with any of these.    PSM delay  Thank you everyone, for supporting the delay! Our team is talking with Paxos and also with Binance. Binance is willing to showcase Dai as one of the top 10 use cases for BUSD if we include them in the PSM. We are working on a post with all the updates from Paxos, Binance and Gemini regarding PSM.    Star of the week   Blockfi is live with Dai for trading and their BIA (Blockfi Interest Account) Dai holders can earn their introductory rate of 8.5% through July 30. (Awesome news @Jenn !)

Big fans of Maker, and they would love to use Maker Vaults, but they need to KYC us if we want to work with them\u2026   I am confused by this. Requiring KYC to receive funds from the DAO itself, sure, why not. Requiring KYC to use existing vaults: ?. I don\u2019t really understand. It seems like a non-problem with a bridge company/trust/whatever willing to open a vault. This adds no risk to Maker. I\u2019m probably missing something. ",
