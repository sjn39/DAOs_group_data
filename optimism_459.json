                    "content": "Project name: Complex Labs Author name and contact info (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project): Scott Mandel scott@complexlabs.co I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes L2 recipient address: 0x8cAf5388E94A50F002901588715a6897dcC92119 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: 10 Which sub-committee should review your proposal? (Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): Complex Labs has built infrastructure to easily manage and automate dynamic NFTs. Our dynamic NFTs change when triggered by real world events. Our software allows you to easily manage this process. Website: https://www.complexlabs.co/ Twitter: complex_labs Discord/Discourse/Community: ComplexLabs Other relevant links (including any demos): app.complexlabs.co Additional team member info (please link): https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdturner40/https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandotorres2 Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: https://flexa.network/https://coordinape.com/https://eco.com/https://opolis.co/ Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Prelaunch. We are in negotiations with a large entity to use our software to service 80M of their customers. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://www.ogprotocol.com/https://unique.network/ Is/will this project be open sourced?: In the Future Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 3/31/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: Like most protocols users adoption is the biggest problem. Our GTM strategy leverages account abstracted wallet technology, as well as a more Web2 native UI/UX to make it easier for non Web3 native users to onboard. We hope to onboard millions of new users in a frictionless manner. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Static NFTs are version one. We believe that version two is dynamic. A dynamic NFTs are alive, they allow the brand to tell a story, engage their audience and experiments in new ways. However, brands are not equipped or ready to manage this process. Our software makes it easy for brands to mint, manage and gamify their NFTs. These NFTs have applications in the world of gaming, identity, events and much more. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Our model is B2B2C. Complex Labs is building software for organizations to onboard their existing audience. Our software not only assists the client in onboarding their audience, but it also onboards their customers to our ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 249,999 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): TBD How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Dynamic NFTs require many integrations. We\u2019d like to build a DAO to incentivize the creation of these integrations, so that we my expedite our growth. By building more integrations it will scale the use cases available for Complex and it\u2019s software. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: 8 Weeks. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: 2-3 Weeks - DAO formation and DAO Entity creation (We already have 10 developers)4-6 Weeks - Governance established and proposal for integrations started. First 3 integrations completed. 7+ Weeks - Expected to complete 2-3 integrations a week, depending upon complexity and size of DAO. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: The recipients of grant funds and users are two different groups. The grant funds will be used to form a DAO, and reward developers for building integrations. By doing so, the integrations will enable more ways to onboard users to Complex Labs and Optimism. The vast majority of our users will be non Web3 native. Our onboarding process is Web2 native and abstracts away many of the complexities of Web3. We\u2019ll be using account abstracted wallet technology to gradually onboard the user into Web3. This includes education and perhaps verifiable credentials issued upon completion of courses to prove they are ready to interact in Web3. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): We are in negotiations with an entity to use our software. If successful our software would be used to onboard their existing clients, which are roughly 80M+ annually.
