Yes. This falls under the Optimism Tooling/Infrastructure Committee - [DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee  Project Overview Project description: Tally Ho is an open-source, community-owned alternative to MetaMask that\u2019s been under development since early 2021. This summer, we launched the first production release of the Tally Ho wallet and have been growing rapidly since. Tally Ho currently has 32,000 users (up from 5,000 in May) and our community launched a #defendWeb3 open letter in August that has garnered over 80,000 signatures. Project links:  Wallet: Tally Ho - Chrome Web Store  Website: https://tallyho.cash/  GitHub: GitHub - tallycash/extension: Tally Ho, the community owned and operated Web3 wallet.  Audits: https://tally.cash/security  Gitcoin: Tally Ho! - Open Source and Community Owned Wallet | Grants | Gitcoin  Twitter: https://twitter.com/TallyCash  Discord: https://chat.tally.cash/  Discourse: https://gov.tally.cash/   Additional team member info:  Alex Bazhenov (GitHub, Twitter) Vlad Todirut (Design) Jagoda Rybacka (GitHub) Greg Nagy (GitHub, Twitter) LJ (Twitter) Chloe Anderson (GitHub)  Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:  Thesis Casa MetaMask  Threshold / Keep / tBTC  Fold Rook  Relevant usage metrics:  Users: 32k+ (Chrome Web Store) All-time swaps volume: $8.6 million (Dune - 0.5% fee per swap \u2192 $43k Treasury) Community Pledge signatures: 80k+ signatures (https://tally.cash/web3pledge/)  Community Metrics  Gitcoin donations: $76k Discord: 62k+ (with weekly Community Calls reaching 1 - 4k attendees)  Competitors, peers, or similar projects: Our relevant competitors are the dominant, corporate-owned browser extension wallets MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet. Is/will this project be open sourced? Tally Ho is fully open source under GPLv3. GitHub here and software license here. Optimism native?: Ethereum native. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 9/12/22  Ecosystem Value Proposition What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? For Optimism to remain competitive and continue to attract and retain users, builders, and liquidity in the post-Merge world, it needs to stand out and onboard new Web3 users directly. That requires wallet UX on par with the best Solana and Polygon wallets, built and maintained by people that share Optimism\u2019s vision. Yet the reality is that today\u2019s Optimism wallet experience is lagging behind. Many wallets treat Optimism as \u201cjust another RPC endpoint.\u201d We know that\u2019s not the case: Optimism has its own needs, independent from the rest of the ecosystem, but today\u2019s wallet experience doesn\u2019t meet these needs. We need an Optimism-native wallet where gas works flawlessly, assets are automatically discovered, and OP NFTs are natively supported. New users should be introduced to Optimism-native projects by their wallet, and incentivized to make OP their new home. In addition to providing an Optimism-native user onboarding experience, we want to help solve the wallet monoculture problem, preventing a handful of private wallet companies from being able to censor the chain or expose users widely to risk. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? We\u2019ve focused on solving a number of these core issues. Today\u2019s Tally Ho experience means\u2026  No RPC config necessary to use Optimism Native Optimism NFT support on day one OP Swaps on day one The only wallet that appears to handle Optimism gas properly & consistently   Shared ahead of time with OP community for feedback (Early Access - Optimism is live in Tally Ho!) Optimism is our first L2, and heavily aligned with our vision for public goods on-chain  We plan to build on this foundation and use this opportunity to build the reference Optimism wallet UX and the reference L2 onboarding experience, linking our own growth to that of the Collective. Tally Ho is aggressively growing in the leadup to our DAO launch, and it\u2019s a once-in-a-project time with lots of excitement/froth to help drive users into OP. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? We believe a smooth wallet experience is vital to onboarding new users directly to Optimism and incentivizing them to explore the ecosystem\u2014from right inside the Tally Ho wallet. Growing together means we can drive new users to Optimism from other chains. A multi-EVM wallet means meeting users where they are, and bringing them into the Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.  Token Distribution Number of OP tokens requested: 400,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives?: While we don\u2019t have the authority to commit incentives in the name of an unlaunched DAO, we plan to submit a proposal after the DAO launch to match an OP allocation with our own incentives. Proposal for token distribution: We want to distribute OP incentives to bring new users to the Optimism ecosystem, and to continue to overperform on Optimism onboarding and user experience in the Tally Ho wallet. How will the OP tokens be distributed? We are not asking for any $OP to fund development! The Tally Ho development team is independently funded. All $OP will be used to bring users, developers, and liquidity onto Optimism:  25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to bridge funds onto Optimism with Tally Ho 25% $OP will go to growth campaigns across Tally Ho and Optimism with a primary focus on Optimism-native dApps and a secondary focus on time-tested, multi-network protocols ($1B TVL and up). To get an idea of what these campaigns will look like, check out our Optimission series, which has brought over 7k Tally Ho users to Optimism so far. 25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to swap on Optimism inside Tally Ho, increasing volume across the chain and liquidity in Optimism-native DEXs. 25% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for dApps to integrate Tally Ho on Optimism. This will happen over the first 10 weeks after the distribution, biweekly, where each allocation is split between teams that successfully integrate Tally Ho in a dApp with over 500 MAUs or $100k in TVL over that period.  No OP will go to paying the core development team or padding a DAO treasury, only to growing the OP ecosystem. OP will be treated with respect, and all recipients will receive instructions on governance participation. OP isn\u2019t another token to earn and dump, it\u2019s a user\u2019s voice in governing a vital community good, and it\u2019s critical the new community members understand that. Distributions mechanisms will be made Sybil-resistant according to past on-chain behavior. Our goal here isn\u2019t to initially attract new users to the space, but new users to Optimism\u2026 so we can use behavior on mainnet, Polygon, BSC, and other chains to prevent widespread Sybil manipulation. Finally, if this grant passes, the dev team will propose to the Tally Ho DAO that 50% of all DAO proceeds from in-wallet swaps on Optimism be used to buy $OP, on a continual basis. Pending DAO approval, this move would ensure ongoing alignment between the two communities. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Emission of funds will happen bi-weekly, across 6 months. Frequent releases will allow for experimentation in distribution and Sybil-prevention mechanisms, while the gradual emission will lower sell pressure over time. Across the initiatives and over 6 months, we\u2019d like to bring a minimum of 15k users to Optimism via Tally Ho. ",

I was very excited to see the release of Optimism Network, the ux is very smooth. I especially like the NFT viewer, this is a seamless feature that allows me to view any collection on any chain. I think this is noteworthy, other wallets and viewers make it difficult to identify some of my NFT\u2019s. Tally Ho simply \u201cswitches\u201d my viewer and loads all the NFT\u2019s (on that network) automatically.

You can add any address you want, view balances, NFTs, connect to dApps etc. The only thing you can\u2019t do is sign transactions, because you don\u2019t have the actual keys. So say you\u2019re in a place where you don\u2019t have access to your keys, or you don\u2019t want to import your keys, it still shows you what\u2019s going on in your wallet in the same UI you\u2019re used too.

                    "content": "There are two other proposals quite similar to this one:   [Review][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism \ud83c\udf08 Rainbow (already passed) [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Ambire Wallet  What all three have in common is that they mean to incentivize wallet users to use Optimism (with the given wallet) and perform some special actions like swapping tokens or holding OP for a specific period of time. However, all of them lack detailed plans on how they are supposed to distribute funds to the users. The Rainbow team mentioned that they are already working with some people from Optimism Foundation in order to come up with some incentive structure. I believe that all wallets should have the same incentives structure or at least that their incentive structures should not be competitive - it wouldn\u2019t make sense for Optimism to pay more for swapping tokens in one wallet than in another wallet (of course each wallet is free to additionally reward users for those actions apart from OP rewards). Moreover, Rainbow proposal introduces KPI milestone that needs to be achieved before releasing additional funds (only 30% of the requested amount is released upfront), I believe that the other proposals should also include similar KPI requirements. Given that I believe that a common incentive structure should be obtained before proceeding further with such proposals. Furthermore, both TallyHo and Ambire proposals include using ~25% of the allocated funds in order to incentivize dApp developers to integrate with their wallets. I believe this part of the proposal should be excluded to a separate one so that community would be able to decide if OP should directly fund this (as this benefits more the wallet itself and not OP ecosystem) and those grants if separated would be substantial by themselves (~100k OP). To be clear - I\u2019m not against OP funding this, just would like to see it separated from the grants to incentivize using Optimism with the given wallet (also to be able to compare those grants as apples to apples). Moreover, it might be worth considering making sure that OP is not rewarding the same wallet for using Optimism across different wallets. Right now it feels like overkill to me, but from OP perspective it\u2019s quite possible that a single user will farm OP rewards for the same Optimism activity in every wallet with an incentive structure (yet I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s necessarily bad). To summarise, what I propose would be to:  Separate wallet integration into separate proposals. Streamline the work on incentive structure between Rainbow, Tally Ho, and Ambire to have a common incentive schema between wallets (or at least make sure that common parts between wallets are not competitive). Wait before proceeding with any additional grants related to incentivizing using Optimism in wallets until the common incentive structure is obtained.  Of course, in order for this plan to work it would be necessary to effectively work on the common incentive structure, but each of the projects needs to figure it out before implementing anything anyway, so it seems like a good milestone whatsoever. I\u2019ve posted a similar comment in the other mentioned thread. ",

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2. About the project  Tally Ho is an open source wallet extension for desktop, introduced as an alternative to mainstream ones like Metamask and Coinbase Wallet. It\u2019s owned by the community in the sense that the project is in the process of creating a DAO for the continued development of its product. As of today the DAO is not ready and its last major update report was made in July this year. The wallet works like any other self-custodial wallet, it has features such as charging a 0.5% swap fee from its native application, directly to a multisig labeled treasury managed by 5 members involved in Tally Ho. External links:  Official Documentation Governance forum  Similar OP Governance proposals:   Infinity Wallet - 500K OP tokens (not passed)  Rainbow Wallet - 420K OP tokens (passed)  Candide Wallet - 190K OP tokens (passed)   3. About the following  The proposal was published on September 21 without any news to highlight.  4. About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): good. Tally Ho\u2019s spirit as a wallet that aims to be managed by the community is something worth seeing in line with the growth of Optimism, since in theory it is beneficial to have projects that share the same values nearby, and good for the average user.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. The experience regarding the use of tally Ho is quite similar to that of other desktop extensions without any novelty that makes it sufficiently attractive over the rest. Despite this being an advantage for users accustomed to Metamask, it is also difficult to find reasons to switch from one wallet to another. It\u2019s up to Tally Ho\u2019s product and marketing strategy to earn its place among regular Optimism users.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready. The wallet is ready to trade on Optimism, handle ERC20 tokens, NFTs and swaps. Also is open source.  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): standard. Subsidies for swaps and bridging are standard incentives and the team has made a commitment to its sybil-resistant OP token distribution implementation, but there is no clear plan yet. It must be taken into account that the application of subsidies in this way will attract more users and more revenue for the treasury in a correlated way. On the other hand, incentives for dApps and growth campaigns are left to the discretion of the team in their strategy with their DAO. One year expected.  Amount requested (high to low): mid-high. In terms of time lapse expected, is seems as a intensive incentive program, a reduction would have been desirable.   5. KPIs and impact tracking As usual, these type of proposals needs to track amount of users bridging and swapping inside the App, and properly doing a following about current status of integrations and opening the door to participation in terms of contributions.  6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Abstain In the same line of Ambire Wallet\u2019s proposal, our final recommendation comes from the fact, that as has been pointed out on the forum - there are many proposals approaching user incentivisation using OP rewards, but there is no common framework for user rewards structure across different projects. It would be unfair if the reward structure differed between projects, so we suggest delaying any further grants toward user incentivisation in wallets until such a framework is formed. After that, each wallet asking for a grant toward user incentivisation should follow this framework of rewards structure. Furthermore, we recommend separating the work for integrating the wallet with specific dapps into another proposal, so that this aspect can be voted separately. Once that\u2019s done we would be more inclined to suggest a yes. ",

Would it make sense if we used the same incentives they did, with the same KPIs? Or is there a reason that structure doesn\u2019t make sense for other wallets?     krzkaczor:  After that, each wallet asking for a grant toward user incentivisation should follow this framework of rewards structure.   If we believe Rainbow\u2019s incentive structure is ideal, perhaps we already have a framework\u2026 a pave the cow paths\" situation.     krzkaczor:  Furthermore, we recommend separating the work for integrating the wallet with specific dapps into another proposal, so that this aspect can be voted separately.   This was recommended against by a couple delegates we\u2019ve spoken to, but happy to make this change if it makes more sense to the committee! ",

I will be voting against the proposal at this point though I am a fan of Tally wallet. The reason is stated in the committee review.     krzkaczor:  The final recommendation comes from the fact, that as has been pointed out on the forum - there are many proposals approaching user incentivisation using OP rewards, but there is no common framework for user rewards structure across different projects. It would be unfair if the reward structure differed between projects, so we suggest delaying any further grants toward user incentivisation in wallets until such a framework is formed. After that, each wallet asking for a grant toward user incentivisation should follow this framework of rewards structure. Furthermore, we recommend separating the work for integrating the wallet with specific dapps into another proposal, so that this aspect can be voted separately. Once that\u2019s done we would be more inclined to suggest a yes.   I strongly urge them to reapply next round taking that feedback into account and would be glad to consider the amended proposal and with the user incentivisation framework figured out. ",

Over the past 30 days, Tally Ho has been the 7th largest 0x app on Optimism, with over $150k in volume, eclipsing Rainbow, a wallet that was recently voted more OP incentives. Since launch, Optimism has been our most popular network by transaction count. 0 OP will go toward development, which the team completed before our proposal. All incentives will go directly to users. Since this proposal, over 10k new users have installed Tally Ho\u2026 >30% growth. Since this proposal, another 60k+ people have signed the Web3 pledge\u2026 > 75% growth. So far, we\u2019ve brought over 7k Tally Ho users to Optimism, and we\u2019d love to keep growing together.  Happy to answer questions for anyone on the fence! ",

I see Tally as a legitimate alternative to Metamask and given this, their willingness to include and listen to community feedback could lead to an explosion of usage down the road, which in turn would be directed in large part to Optimism.
