                    "content": "Hello, this is my first post on this forum, but I have been reading for  while  I am known as \u201ciammeeoh\u201d on the MakerChat. I have not affiliation whatsoever with the Foundation. I am just a community member and a (very) small MKR holder. I was asked by a community member (LongForWisdom) to write down some of the comments I typed today in the chat, to improve readability, and there we go! I want to express general concerns about the status of the governance in the last few months. Specifically, about the Governance & Risk calls, and the roadmap to MCD. Point 1) The content/length ratio of the calls is, in my opinion, very low. In other words I have the feeling that often people deliberately \u201ctalk about nothing\u201d. This is far from an accusation or a negative feeling towards anybody. It\u2019s just how I see the episodes. For example, from the last call, the first 20 minutes (Rich and cyrus) can by summarised without any loss of information with the following two lines:  it was important to decide how to vote on the shortlist of 7 tokens, done on the forum with 3 options. we need a short list so we can focus on some specific tokens, because each token will require a lot of time. Vote should happen next week.  Point 2) At the same time, the participation seems very low: e.g., 21 people voted on the last poll on the forum, just a few people watch the youtube videos (accordingly with Youtube data), etc. Point 3) Having few people (but committed and well educated!) in the governance could actually be a good thing. Faster and better development. However, to the contrary, I have the impression that the discussion proceeds in an extremely slow way. For example, a blog post (https://blog.makerdao.com/multi-collateral-dai-collateral-types/) on the 27th of June announced a vote on some collateral, for discussion. This vote got delayed about two weeks for technical issues. Then there was a forum poll to decide how to properly phrase the questions Then the vote should finally happen next week. All of this for what will just be a way to discover interest and sentiment among MKR holders. I.e., the vote is not committal in any way. Did we really need almost 2 months to vote on this? Given that the (active/voting) community is extremely small, wouldn\u2019t a poll in the forum just do the job more quickly? Also there are some aspect I don\u2019t really understand. \u201cWe\u201d decided to spend time voting on how to properly phrase the questions, but the lot of 7 ERC20 tokens has been decided unilaterally by the Foundation. Point 4) Regarding progress towards MCD, and the selection of collateral. Cyrus clearly said that it will be a long and difficult process. I don\u2019t doubt that but:   what about contacting academics and people from economics/finance (PhD, postdocs, etc, surely interested in the project)   what about producing a template and asking directly to other Crypto project with large ICOs (e.g., BAT, Golem, CIVIC, DGD, among many others) to do their own scientific analysis in order to be added to MakerDAO? Why do everything \u201cin house\u201d?   Is it really necessary to spend months on this? As discussed in this forum, most people agree anyway on launching MCD with ETH as principal collateral and a few other ERC20 included with VERY-VERY-SAFE parameters. These parameters can always be adjusted with time and demand.   Without having any informations on the release date of MCD, is it really worth analysis a token like, e.g. BAT, in mid 2019 when at MCD release (for example late 2020) its ecosystem might have completely changed/disappeared/boomed?   Point 5) All in all, I have the feeling that in the last few months, after the peg-emergency solve, we have just \u201cbought time\u201d. It\u2019s like \u201cplaying the DAO\u201d when in fact the real action is elsewhere. Things that are critical and not discussed enough are, for instance:   Status of MCD: it\u2019s obviously important to understand if we should expect MCD for 2019, 2020 or 2021. The landscape is going to change.   MCD and KYC: how will MCD deal with KYC requirements, if any? We have no idea (as far as I could follow in discussions in chat and reddit)   Status of the Foundation and its partners: what is the involvement of the partners, like a16z ? Last year you devoted a few governance calls explaining \u201chow amazing\u201d this partnership is/was. What have they done for MakerDAO (not for the Foundation) so far? What do they thing? What do they like, don\u2019t like? When will they start to participate to the governance?   This is very important, more (IMHO) than the risk evaluation of a token like BAT having 1% of marketcap of ETH and (likely) higher risk profile. Similarly, will MCD use centralised stablecoins?: do we plan to include USDC or not, for example? What does CoinBase say about that?  Quoting: \u201cThe Foundation is dedicated to radical transparency. We want to give the community information as it comes. The problem is that there are a lot of moving pieces and because of that making predictions about release dates and other time-specific information is hard. We can do our best, but the expectations need to be set accordingly. We will soon be posting some dates about things that will need to happen pre-MCD launch, and it is important to understand that this information is subject to change: dates will be moved, things may be removed or added, etc.\u201d  where is the radical transparency? Point 6) To conclude, after the purple-pill drama a few months ago, those of us who accepted to stay around have implicitly accepted a more \u201cauthoritarian\u201d lead of MakerDAO via the MakerDao Foundation. So I am not complaining about this. But the narrative was that, by cutting a lot of side-activities and focusing on the key tasks, with a clear leadership (Rune), the development would accelerate and efficiency would increase. I frankly can\u2019t see that at the moment, and I still have no idea on when MCD could be delivered, nor I have any idea of how the institutional investors around it are moving/preparing. ",

We have no idea (as far as I could follow in discussions in chat and reddit)   I really hope the developers aren\u2019t foolish enough to try to make KYC a core part of the design.

I really have a hard time finding a way to put this friendly but \u2026 claiming to be committed to \u201cradical transparency\u201d, really?!   The last call really wasn\u2019t all that good but that was mainly due to the risk part IMO. I understand Rich has to try and find a balance between talking to new people and regulars which is really hard and I don\u2019t mind it. Vishesh and Chris also had interesting info. The risk part on the other-hand was just filler. I hope this is because we are on or close to a turning point in the whole project because we really don\u2019t need more calls like this. I can\u2019t even recall anymore how long this \u201crisk framework\u201d has been promised now. Expectation management towards the community in this regard is seriously lacking here. It becomes more confusing every week about what to actually expect from risk. Also it was the first time that I actually heard Cyrus say that there is essentially 1 risk team and it consists of only 3 people (Cyrus, Primoz, Vishesh). Why are there only 3 people working on this \u2014 crucial part of MCD \u2014 at this point? Where are these other \u201crisk teams\u201d supposed to come from and when? I see very little (marketing) activity in trying to get people in this space? But the thing that absolutely triggers me is using the term \u201cradical transparency\u201d. I appreciate the fact that there are a lot of complexities, technical, legal, even personal, \u2026 but since when is showing the tip of the iceberg, \u201cradical transparency\u201d? Announcing you will communicate dates, with a disclaimer that they will change is not \u201cradical transparency\u201d, it\u2019s a non-committing roadmap, nothing more, nothing less. \u201cRadical transparency\u201d has to go for everything or it\u2019s not and I don\u2019t think I need to convince anyone that there is very little transparency about a lot of things. There may be good reasons for that non-transparency but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you can\u2019t use this term. Do I think the foundation means well, yes \u2026 is it transparent, not even close. ",

One may think \u201cnone of this will matter once MCD is released, so why bother?\u201d, but I try to take the long view and I think that the Maker community (and as part of it the Foundation) having a history of not only being but appearing reliable, consistent, conservative in its claims and forthright will be immensely valuable.

                    "content": "@swakya You are right that Prestige is the N1 currency in the paper-writing industry, which is 99% academia, because it often leads to a good career. However in the the ICO world, many ICOs companies are actually struggling to \u201cprove\u201d their seriousness, and in fact need some kind of \u201cprestige\u201d or \u201cscientific credibility\u201d. For this reason they might be willing to invest some of their resources to pursue some scientific investigation (and often they have directly links with academics). The following article (published by the Brave company) is an example:   basicattentiontoken.org    token-econ.pdf 221.04 KB       It is definitely not a 100% \u201cpure truth\u201d article. But it contains some science, or at least some scientific claims. I am sure the big ICOs, if challenged in the appropriate way, would be more than happy to participate to some scientific investigation regarding their token. TLDR: Prestige is often the main currency in paper-publishing, yes. But ICOs companies have lots of money and need prestige, so might be quite helpful in providing some scientific work. ",

                    "content": "Alright, I\u2019ve got some time so I\u2019ll respond to points and add my thoughts here.     iammeeoh:  Point 1) The content/length ratio of the calls is, in my opinion, very low. In other words I have the feeling that often people deliberately \u201ctalk about nothing\u201d.   100% Agree that the signal/noise ration is low, and could be improved. That said, it\u2019s important to remember that there is also a very necessary social component to the governance calls. They are are a place where members of the community can feel free to ask questions and to engage with the prominent figures in the Foundation, this is usually \u2018noise\u2019 but I believe it is still valuable at driving engagement and participation.     iammeeoh:  Point 2) At the same time, the participation seems very low: e.g., 21 people voted on the last poll on the forum, just a few people watch the youtube videos (accordingly with Youtube data), etc.   Yep, participation is low across the board, both in calls and in polling on the forum and on-chain. This is something we all need to work to improve. I have some thoughts on this that I\u2019ll write up at some point.     iammeeoh:  Point 3) (General slow progress)   I agree, it was and is slow. There are two additional aspects that I found annoying, first that the foundation gave a date, and then failed to meet it. This happens all the time, and is fine. The problem is that there is no consistency. We don\u2019t get dates for MCD because no one wants to over-promise, fine. If the policy is \u2018don\u2019t give dates\u2019, then don\u2019t. But if that is your policy, you need to make damn sure you hit the few dates that you do share. The second is that despite the forum poll to properly frame the online poll, we didn\u2019t even manage to achieve any meaningful consensus. We had a plurality of 43%, which is rubbish because it potentially leaves a majority unsatisfied with the outcome. In my view this was time-wasted (the foundation is not explicitly to blame for this, as a community we should have made better use of the polling time) In my view efficiency of governance is always going to be the hardest challenge to overcome for any DAO.     iammeeoh:  (Point 4) Is it really necessary to spend months on this? As discussed in this forum, most people agree anyway on launching MCD with ETH as principal collateral and a few other ERC20 included with VERY-VERY-SAFE parameters. These parameters can always be adjusted with time and demand.   In my view, yes, this is worth it. We need a solid risk framework to apply to all collateral assets. While we could launch MCD with \u2018very safe\u2019 parameters, it rather defeats the point of launching it. The asset packages won\u2019t be attractive until we can properly define the risk parameters. I also think it\u2019s important to remember that collateral evaluations aren\u2019t holding up launch, that is the aim behind the prioritisation: to work on prioritised assets first, and launch with those that we have parameters for by the time the engineering work and security audits are complete for the smart-contracts.     iammeeoh:  Point 5) All in all, I have the feeling that in the last few months, after the peg-emergency solve, we have just \u201cbought time\u201d. It\u2019s like \u201cplaying the DAO\u201d when in fact the real action is elsewhere.   Yeah, I feel this too, and it is disheartening. We are \u2018playing the DAO\u2019 at this stage, the Foundation claims to be working towards gradual decentralization and personally I believe that they are doing this in good faith. As things stand I don\u2019t think we are at a point where the DAO can support the development or even day-to-day operations of the DSS.     iammeeoh:  where is the radical transparency?   Agree that this term is not applicable, at least up to this point.     iammeeoh:  Point 6) To conclude, after the purple-pill drama a few months ago, those of us who accepted to stay around have implicitly accepted a more \u201cauthoritarian\u201d lead of MakerDAO via the MakerDao Foundation. So I am not complaining about this. But the narrative was that, by cutting a lot of side-activities and focusing on the key tasks, with a clear leadership (Rune), the development would accelerate and efficiency would increase.   I\u2019m not sure that was really the narrative that was pushed? The Foundation was largely quiet on the entire matter. Without transparency it\u2019s difficult to see how efficiently the Foundation is working. It\u2019s safe to say that there is far more going into MCD than is readily apparent to us outside though.  The root of these issues comes down to a simple question: \u2018Is the Maker Foundation acting in good faith to develop the DSS and turn over control to the MakerDAO?\u2019 or even more simply: \u2018Can we trust the Foundation?\u2019 Currently, I believe the answer to those questions are yes. I\u2019ve seen nothing that convinces me that the Foundation has betrayed that trust, and so I\u2019m not overly concerned at a perceived lack of progress. That said, I will keep watching and judging, as will everyone else within MakerDAO. ",

                    "content": "Going deeper into governance participation, just thinking out loud, the whole financial incentive of governance is the mkr token appreciation, token appreciation is only usefull once sold if not it\u00b4s paper gains. What I\u00b4m trying to state is that perhaps the whole \u201ctoken appreciation\u201d metric to induce governance is simply not enough, people who invest or most of them have other tasks to worry about, work, family, etc, most of them are not \u201cfull crypto\u201d. If you allocate a part of your time to do responsible governance there must be a trade off that if it resumes in \u201ctoken appreciation\u201d perhaps it\u00b4s a little too intangible to some or at a glance of the low turnover most. Just thinking of the incentives to get further participation, time, research of people into the project, further down the line if it effectively becomes a DAO what will the incentives behind the non-foundation people to work for? Not lose their investment? If that\u00b4s the incentive what will their incentive be to keep the investment? This are all wild thoughts outloud from my office, would be great to hear counter arguments ",
