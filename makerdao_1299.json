Background Following our presentation on the latest G&R call, we dove deeper on our cash runway discussion from last week and put together various scenarios to calculate Maker\u2019s runway in the event of sustained unprofitability. After months of resilience, and despite still technically booking significant profits on the back of unfortunate liquidations, it is looking more and more likely that Maker will start running cash unprofitable months when measured purely on a recurring revenue basis, at our current burn rates. Hopefully the below pages will help the community narrow down closer to what that position really is and represents.  Slide1800\u00d7554 36.8 KB   Slide2800\u00d7554 97.7 KB   Slide3800\u00d7554 99.2 KB   Slide4800\u00d7554 101 KB   Slide5800\u00d7554 75.8 KB  On three scenarios of varying degrees of bearishness, we are calculating what the effective number of operating years would be available with three different levels of spending  Spending assumptions  On-chain actual cash movements CU reported expenses Maximum approved spend from budget process   On-chain actual cash movements These are real cash movements from the DAO to CU multisigs. However, often they capture various weeks or even months of working capital so they are subject to phasing considerations. In our monthly reports we rely on this figure for the sake of conservatism.  CU reported expenses Every month, most CUs report actual expenses by type. This is closer to an accrual view of expenses and creates a delta to on-chain transactions. However, it also depends on self-reporting from CUs.  Maximum approved spend from budgets This is the theoretical maximum that the DAO has authorized the CUs to spend. Our current run-rate is well under this figure, but is worth keeping in mind for conservatism when it comes to calculating runways.  Interest income from short-term bonds On top of this, interest income from our initiatives to invest in short-term bonds through Baillie Gifford and BlackRock will significantly extend our runway.  Signal Request Poll If this Signal Request is approved, the on-chain poll will feature ranked-choice options between several options. This Signal Request will run for one week rather than two given the urgency triggered by market conditions.     Signal Request Options Pro Con     A. Yes (MKR holders should take a view) Provides maximum level of discretion to MKR holders around use of cash and strategies to survive the bear-market MKR holders may not be updated with operational minutiae and might not be equipped to make the most informed decision   B. No (MKR holders should not take a view) Proactive engagement within the DAO is the best tool to select the target level of profitability to target MKR holders would be cut out from a crucial decision regarding the use of DAO funds    SR Start/End Date: 2022-06-23T17:00:00Z\u21922022-06-30T17:00:00Z The on-chain poll would be framed as follows: What target level of Recurring Net Protocol Income profitability (defined as rNPI / Recurring Revenues averaged over a preceding 3 calendar month period, excluding MKR vesting and liquidation income) should the DAO set in order to drive budget cuts?  Positive (> 5%) Break-even (\u00b15%) Negative (minimum 3 years of runway at any time) No change      On-Chain Options Pro Con     Positive (>5%) Would continue accumulating dai in the surplus buffer and increase the short-term book value per MKR token May force the DAO to make cuts in CUs with significant business continuity impact and reduce the ability of CUs to maximize the opportunity at the end of the bear   Break-even (\u00b15%) Would allow a small amount of flexibility to account for market fluctuations May occasionally have a negative impact on the surplus buffer in extended periods of narrow unprofitability   Negative (minimum 3 years of runway at any time) Allows a flexible framework for maintaining investment while still imposing a hard cutoff to control spending Increases the possibility of extended drawdowns on the surplus buffer        Should MKR Holders select a target level of rNPI profitability to guide budget cuts?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

And if their budget has spam/pork the facilitators can cut that first. Similar to what you are proposing here, the DAO/MKR token owners can decide the level of reduction each Core Unit should incur. It can be ask to cut budgets at levels of 10%, 20%, and 30% via an on-chain poll (TOL). This process will allow facilitators to evaluate the degree of the cut that can be sustained. And if CU cannot accept such percentage of cuts, they can make a push for earning higher revenues, similar to what the MetaDAOs (EndGame) will be able to accomplish in the near future. All-in-all the way to pull yourself out of a hole, is to create opportunities and sell your way out. ",

A couple of questions:   The SR assumes we are making \u201cbudget cuts.\u201d Is there a possibility this is not the case?   The SR is using rNPI over the past three months as a basis for \u201cbudget cuts.\u201d Is this the best number to use when considering these adjustments could have a significant impact on the ability/longevity for CUs to operate?   When you look at \u201cstart running cash unprofitable months,\u201d it appears there is a bias that is this not acceptable. Some times with budgets, there are \u201cvanity\u201d metrics to make something look good and I wonder if this is one of those areas? Do we care if we have a negative month(s) as long as our runway is solid?   We do have ongoing liquidation revenue. Is there a way to normalize this and add it to our expected income?   Can\u2019t we expect some income from short-term bonds? It seems like the model isn\u2019t accurate if we don\u2019t include this in the base case. The comments suggest \u201cwill significantly extend our runway.\u201d This is material for DAO revenues.   In the Signal Request Poll, it\u2019s a little confusing in the wording. So I am clear, this is an offchain poll that if it is YES, will move to an onchain poll based upon the framing listed. If the poll is NO, you are suggesting \u201cProactive engagement.\u201d I\u2019m not exactly sure what that means and don\u2019t see why MKR holders would be \u201ccut.\u201d As a suggestion, I would remove the Pro/Con section as it\u2019s an opinion and reads biased to me. For example, I don\u2019t agree that a Pro is this \u201cprovides maximum level of discretion.\u201d It\u2019s quite debatable. Btw, I\u2019m not asking to have that debate here\u2026just pointing out the difference in an opinion and factual based data.   Overall, the information in this SR seems to make assumptions based upon a super conservative look at our finances then attempts to apply a formula, based upon a point in time look at the DAO finances, in order to make \u201cbudget cuts.\u201d I hope the DAO can find a way not to use a sledge hammer to drive in a finishing nail with our budgeting exercise.

You could expand the negative option a little here by asking how long we would be willing to stay negative at higher monthly losses than a 3 year runway would call for.  You could also specify a surplus buffer level that you do not want to drop under and limit cuts based on expected timelines for new revenue.     monkey.irish:  When you look at \u201cstart running cash unprofitable months,\u201d it appears there is a bias that is this not acceptable.

Do we care if we have a negative month(s) as long as our runway is solid?   Just an opinion, but I think there is reason to bias toward profitability.  For MKR, the SB affects more than just runway.  It also affects risk.  Every month there is a loss heightens our risks and lowers the amount of capital we can put at risk in the future.  (I guess people who want to do a capital raise can jump in here and say we can always borrow more\u2026)  To be fair, having less collateral also lowers our risk but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re aiming for right?     monkey.irish:  We do have ongoing liquidation revenue. Is there a way to normalize this and add it to our expected income?   We\u2019ve gone from 3.4B DAI generated from non-stablecoins to under 1.3B in less than 2 months.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more liquidation revenue to be had so you can pretty much count that out.     monkey.irish:  Can\u2019t we expect some income from short-term bonds?

If Monetalis efforts work out and tens of millions of new recurring revenue are within grasp, it should certainly be considered.  I don\u2019t think anyone would mind running negative for a few months if we would be positive thereafter.  But I expect there are low-value items that could be cut without too much long term impact and it\u2019s not a bad thing to spend some time to focus on capital efficiency in the current environment.

Ultimately that is up to MKR holders and Delegates but given the extremely high discrepancy between approved budgets and actual spend, my sense is that budgets in aggregate should be reduced. If Core Units with large unspent budgets were unable to invest such funds during a bull market, pragmatically it seems unlikely that they will in a bear market. With that said, the DAO may decide to reallocate capital and some Core Unit budgets could be increased.     monkey.irish:  When you look at \u201cstart running cash unprofitable months,\u201d it appears there is a bias that is this not acceptable. Some times with budgets, there are \u201cvanity\u201d metrics to make something look good and I wonder if this is one of those areas? Do we care if we have a negative month(s) as long as our runway is solid?   The largest MKR holder has expressed his desire that the Maker protocol should be running profitably, today. There are certainly other large holders with opposing views and it will be up to the DAO collectively to make this decision.     monkey.irish:  We do have ongoing liquidation revenue. Is there a way to normalize this and add it to our expected income?   As @Traster_Tray alluded to, liquidation income is not something we feel the protocol can rely on especially with how far liquidatable collateral has fallen.     monkey.irish:  Can\u2019t we expect some income from short-term bonds? It seems like the model isn\u2019t accurate if we don\u2019t include this in the base case. The comments suggest \u201cwill significantly extend our runway.\u201d This is material for DAO revenues.   Assumptions for short-term bond income are included in the model, in the second to last slide titled, \u201cCash Burn after adjusting for BlackRock and Baillie Gifford\u201d     monkey.irish:  Overall, the information in this SR seems to make assumptions based upon a super conservative look at our finances then attempts to apply a formula, based upon a point in time look at the DAO finances, in order to make \u201cbudget cuts.\u201d I hope the DAO can find a way not to use a sledge hammer to drive in a finishing nail with our budgeting exercise.   This is a mischaracterization in my view - the cash flow analysis simply presents the existing run-rates and downside potential under continued collateral asset price pressure. As my colleague @SebVentures likes to say, \u201call models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d Such model was provided to illustrate to the community, directionally, what would happen to the Maker protocol\u2019s cash runway. It is by no means a forecast and does not intend to be. Every MKR holder and delegate can make their own assumptions and express their views on chain if they support operating the protocol based on such metrics. ",
