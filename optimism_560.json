Firstly;  we see in the first graph all supply will be available end of the 4 year. Also, airdrop will be end-up 2 year later.  image1920\u00d7914 47.1 KB  However, we see different supply model in this document It shows we will just reach %65 of main supply end of the 4 year. Airdrop won\u2019t be end-up 2 year later and it will continue more than 4 year. May I know the reason for this difference? ",

This is a link to the updated documentation:   Optimism Docs   OP Allocations Allocations at a glance Category Percentage Description --- --- --- Ecosystem Fund 25% The Ecosystem Fund is a proactive program meant to stimulate development in the Collective ec      Please note that above the graph, there is a note that says:  Note this graph is for illustration only, and actual circulating supply will depend on governance and the rate that OP is allocated across user airdrops, the Ecosystem Fund, and RetroPGF.  The spreadsheet document is a more recent estimation. The Optimism collective works through an iterative process, so adjustments will be made based on the results of each iteration. Anyway, it\u2019s a good observation and perhaps it would be good to update the graph, but on the other hand, the process is what it is and it provides transparency to see the evolution as it happens. I hope you keep contributing with your comments, we need more people involved in the community. Cheers! ",

The spreadsheet document goes along the simillar lines on \u201cGovFund\u201d, \u201cPartnerFund-SeedFund-Unallocated\u201d, \u201cRetroPGF\u201d, \u201cEarlyCoreContributors\u201d, \u201cSugarXaddies\u201d. However, there is a serious deflection on Airdrops. There will be lower than %50 percentage of total Airdrop in 4 year. If we make a direct proportion, it will take around 10 years for the Airdrop to be completely finished. IMO, this situation will make longer time fake usage rate and wrong network datas. In addition, this degree of deflection from the first graph may damage the reliability. Morever, Optimism started at 5% of total supply and people invest token which %95 lack of total supply Token. In this time, Optimism do successful things but only %5-7 of circuliting supply is far to take investors. When you add just at least %5 one more time, inflation will be %100 and price will get effect. Therefore, with low circulating supply and adding more supply will be so big problem in the future. I advice to discuss Monetary Policy more and make it improve. I will be happy to attend it too because i have been researching Monetary Policy on crypto coins during years. ",

Really appreciate everyone for trying out Optimism Agora Beta with the first test proposal and giving us such helpful feedback.  We\u2019ve been reading all the posts, comments, and messages on Discord/Twitter/Discourse, and really appreciate the thoughtful responses. Special thank you to @lavande, @diligit, @TanBinh and the other mods for helping us triage, loop into convos and surface great feedback.  The feedback has been invaluable as we work to\u2026     Did you notice there is also a bit of a monopoly on the way that the tokens are being delegated as well ??? It is highly unfair in which the airdrop #2 was sent out without having a proper dashboard for discovery of new delegates\u2026 What is a bigger concern to you ? When or how many of the tokens get sent out? Or who ends up in power due to a broken system? This is not looking good for the Optimism governance. It seems that private investment firms have moved into the ecosystem in the form of decentralized enterprises and are currently claiming their stake in decisions being made through Optimism governance. Controlling the monetary policies that you speak about and leaving the tokens house community or other delegates powerless when it comes to decisions or grant approval. Ignoring the concerns of new members who don\u2019t have any voting rights due to a rigged system of token delegation! ",
