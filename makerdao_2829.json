                    "content": "I don\u2019t see value increasing the premium further. More likely, most of the Vaults in USDC right now are abandoned. And new ones will be abandoned as well (6% or 4% will not change this fact). When the PEG is over 1.01 (which it is sometimes), with leverage anybody could get extra $$$, and the RP will not change that fact, USDC will be used anyway. Greater RP will simply increase the probability to have uncollateralized DAI (therefore I vote in fact to reduce the RP). Would be great if a solution for this issue (which is a very important one!) is studied. I recommend to check the proposal made by @monet-supply :    [Discussion] Increasing Surplus Buffer   Once some stablecoin vaults start to get near to 100% collateral ratio, reduce the debt ceiling and stability fee for that vault type to 0. At the same time, create a Stablecoin-B vault type with 101% collateral ratio, same 4% stability fee etc. This could allow Maker to continue earning money from new stablecoin vault users without pushing existing stablecoin vaults into under-collateralized positions.   If something like that is placed in the system, then increasing the RP would make sense. Till then, it creates more risks IMHO (under-collateralized DAI) ",

Greater RP will simply increase the probability to have uncollateralized DA  Not if the other stablecoins are at 4%, that won\u2019t have any impact except increasing other stablecoin. Basically the question here is : do we prefer a : 400M usdc 40 tusd 40 pax b : 200M usdc 140 tusd 140 pax Edit : ok got your point, that won\u2019t change the issue. May be changing the TUSD and PAX  to 100.9% tho ",
