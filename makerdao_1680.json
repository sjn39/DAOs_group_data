                    "content": "On the advice of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit, the executive vote planned for 2022-09-07 will limit the increase in the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling to 20 million DAI, instead of the 50 million DAI initially recommended by the MakerDAO Open Market Committee proposal, and approved on-chain by MKR voters. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit have provided the following explanation:  The protocol engineering team recommends limiting the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A max debt ceiling to 20mm DAI, instead of the original PPG suggested amount of 50mm DAI. We believe that given the relative complexity of the underlying crop-join module, a steadier debt ceiling increase is more reasonable.  This approach has also been approved by Risk CU facilitator (@Primoz) in Discord. GovAlpha is satisfied that this change to executive contents falls under the mandate of the PE team\u2019s facilitator, as defined in MIP41c2 and MIP16c1. Given that governance has already approved a value for a line of up to 50 million DAI, this can be included in a later executive vote once the relevant CU facilitators are happy to do so.  cc: @Protocol-Engineering @Risk-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates ",
