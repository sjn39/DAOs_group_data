Currently there is 311,000 DAI from KNC and 11,000 DAI from ZRX, far below their 5 million DAI debt ceilings. Governance has shown a willingness to subsidize risk from certain collateral assets (ETH and BAT both at 0% risk premium). Extending this with incremental changes to the ZRX and KNC risk premia may lead to additional DAI generation and help the peg. The risk team prepared initial assessments which recommended the current parameters for each asset of 5 million DAI debt ceiling, 175% liquidation ratio, and 4% risk premium: ZRX Risk Assessment KNC Risk Assessment  Adjusting the ZRX Risk Premium     Greater than 4% 4% (current value) 3.75% 3.5% 3% 2% 1% 0%     0 voters      Adjust the KNC Risk Premium     Greater than 4% 4% (current value) 3.75% 3.5% 3% 2% 1% 0%     0 voters     Polls will run for ~2 weeks from July 11 to July 25.

There seems to be some appetite for KNC leverage and especially given the protocols current revenue situation it seems wise to bring in revenue where we can get it. Probably too late to get people to change their votes but would love to see some experimentation made to the KNC RP to see how it ultimately ends up affecting the amount of DAI borrowed. ",
