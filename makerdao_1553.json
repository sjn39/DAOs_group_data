Features versus Bureaucracy  DAO1700\u00d7622 99.8 KB  To ensure we create a vibrating ecosystem that provides value to the Protocol instead of an army of bureaucratic middle-managers.  3. Identifying (and funding) Value  It is challenging for MKR holders to steer the ship through the currently available governance tools.  Expectations versus Reality  Expectations  MKR holders directing the work - expectations2028\u00d7964 166 KB   Reality  Tools for Governing2182\u00d71168 306 KB   The Current State of Work Coordination  reality - blackbox2026\u00d71088 236 KB  Currently, MKR holders:  must accept/reject the whole deal unable to provide any direction find themselves discussing people instead of work  For example: if any given Core Unit carries a critical function for the Protocol, MKR holders have few resources to provide any direction on the rest of the work, even if it represents 95% of the requested budget.  Bull Market Example  Bull2164\u00d71158 246 KB  MIP39s provide a mission/vision for the team. Governance can fund a lot of teams without being able to offer any input on the work that is promised (or performed).  Bear Market Example  Bear2176\u00d71154 152 KB  The all-or-nothing deals do not provide room to set a direction. Unwanted projects go funded while new projects do not get passed for fear of budget bloat.  The Current Conversation?  mkr vs cus2154\u00d71172 147 KB  This leads to a toxic conversation that is not focused on bringing value to the Protocol. Instead, conversations happen superficially, and little progress is made.  MKR holders directly choose what they want to be built!  funding work1402\u00d7916 117 KB  Projects get proposed by Core Units, and they get ranked and funded, respectively.  Addressing the Shortcomings of the Current Governance Tools  Core Unit is all-in or all-out (even after KPIs)  Separate the ability to cut capital, work, and workforce appropriately.   Core Units are a black box  Some work (like maintenance) should be transferable between teams, other work (like marketing) should allow for creative innovations and failures, but failures should still deliver value (don\u2019t make the same mistake twice)   Operations entangled with advancement  Budgets are provided based on CU\u2019s operations, which are tied to a mandate, not a vision. The link is implied and broken. Need to divide, so different funding methods produce different outcomes (operations vs. advancement)   Implementation  Step 0: Core Units to Projectify their Activities In this example, Core Unit X has proposed three projects independently and one with Core Unit Y.  4 projects1372\u00d7724 114 KB  In practice, this is a list of the activities performed by each Core Unit plus a list of activities they could achieve that Governance might find of value for the Protocol. Any Core Unit already working with OKRs or KPIs should not have a hard time performing this activity.  Step 1: Governance to Define Budget(s)  budget definition1238\u00d7580 325 KB  Governance can define one or more budgets with different parameters or permissions.  Examples  Protocol Operations Budget This budget is set at X Dai since that is what covers all the projects deemed indispensable to keep the lights on. As it is critical for the functioning of the Protocol, it can mint and sell MKR for Dai to cover expenses.  Marketing Moonshots Budget This budget is set at 10% of the second 100M of the Surplus Buffer (if the SB is at 150M, this budget will be 5M (10% * 50M).  Step 2: Rank-vote In this example, only one (general) budget is being used, set at 500 Dai. The first two projects fall within the budget limits and are thus funded. The rest remain unfunded, as they are not deemed necessary enough by MKR holders.   Step 3: Profit!  Main Advantages of Project-Based Budgeting  MKR holders to choose directly the projects that will forward their vision of the DAO Uncover all the non-value added Discover \u201cadmin\u201d tasks that can be optimized at different levels of the DAO Allow for a fairer competition   Still to Define  Periods There is a tradeoff between flexibility and stability for Core Units  Voting Budget length Freeze periods   Project Definition  When is a project too specific? When is it too broad? Budget Limit? Time Limit? Scope Limit? Milestones   Reporting, dashboards, and measurements This includes the already proposed KPIs, plus the existing and needed tools to evaluate the health and success of each project.  Bonuses  Retainers: could be a specific project Retention: use a mechanism similar to GovAlpha\u2019s MKR compensation to retain retroactively Performance: we could draw inspiration from Growth, as it is already using performance bonuses Automation: anyone automating a task could get a bonus based on the savings brought to the Protocol Other benefits   Governance Mechanisms  Any mechanisms (such as exceptions) to cover for unexpected situations.   The High-level Roadmap  An actionable summary1974\u00d71110 184 KB   Next (Short-Term) Steps  [X] SES Update Call (click for video)  [x] Include early feedback [ ] Present overview in the G&R call [ ] Hold a special feedback session in the SES Office Hours [ ] Integrate Feedback [ ] Decide on a Signal Request / MIP13 (pending conversation with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit) [ ] Establish the roadmap for the execution   FAQ Does this mean everyone becomes a dispensable contractor working on contract basis? Several mechanisms still ensure talent is attracted, kept, and rewarded. Project-Based Budgeting ensures that the talent works on things the DAO wants.  Won\u2019t this destroy MakerDAO contributors retention? It shouldn\u2019t. We can pay retainers through a project and understand the costs of running the DAO, including retention costs.  How does this work with MKR bonuses?  MKR bonuses could be part of the retainer projects (and use the current settings) or be retrospectively calculated (as GovAlpha is doing now with hourly contributors).  Does this replace MIP40s? Unless we find a reason to keep MIP40s, projects should replace them.  What if a critical project gets defunded? Critical projects should be atomic enough and be marked as such for Governance to review and consider. It is not to MKR holders\u2019 benefit to defund essential projects.  How many projects would there be? Would this create additional overhead? Projects should be atomic enough to be picked independently but broad enough so that it\u2019s not \u201cjust a task.\u201d While evaluating these might create some additional overhead in the beginning (at least until we make the right tools to manage it), this is what Governance is already doing without readily available information.  How are delegates supposed to evaluate a lid of N projects? We need to develop the templates for submitting projects to Governance. These will be key in helping the delegates deal with a lot of information and make them comparable. Recent MIP40 amendments have introduced new requirements to get budgets approved. We will work with Core Units and MKR holders to improve the signal-to-noise ratio so that MKR holders enhance their understanding of the work and their subsequent investments.  Does this require new smart contracts/software? No. Only if we decide to code a somewhat more complex logic into the DAI streams  Does this remove CUs' financial buffers? There are two types of buffers:  Temporal buffer It attempts to provide some stability to the Core Unit for planning resources.  Rainy Day buffer It provides security to the Core Unit in case of budget miscalculation (forecasting) or unexpected expenses. Both can be taken into consideration through a Project.  Is this compatible with the future plans for Maker being discussed (e.g.: The End Game Plan)? Yes. We draw a lot of elements of the current conversations within Maker to come up with this. We believe this would be a great stepping stone to achieving that state. We believe this is not an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach to DAO improvements. Even if Endgame or another alternative plan does not formally pass, the DAO will still benefit from this work.  How do we prevent Project-based allocations from being a race to the bottom (where cost is prioritized over quality)? MKR holders will use several criteria to evaluate a project, not just price. There are many possible solutions to creating a model that allows more experienced teams or teams with more history and operational success within Maker to receive a higher budget for execution. Today, MKR holders do not have any options when allocating work to teams, and this model takes the first steps to change that paradigm.  Is this approach ultimately because MKR Holders cannot create a coherent vision?  The tools available for MKR holders to align and create a coherent vision is weak. MIP13 is a pre-Core Unit tool that turns forum discussions into consensus and documents them accordingly. Incentives and funding to accomplish work against consensus are almost non-existent. MIP55 is more fine-tuned for this type of engagement on a short-term basis. A project-based approach attempts to solve this gap in MKR holder tools by improving one of the most potent tools available by aligning capital to the work instead of the workforce.  In a way, RWF is somewhat structured around Project-based capital allocation.   RWF can decide to prioritize their work separately from motivators from the MKR holders under today\u2019s current model. Additionally, discussions about this work revolve deeply around the teams doing the work and the potential basis (existent or perceived). We believe with this project-based model, not only will MKR holders retain more control over how work is incentivized and how prioritized, but conversations around the work will also be more directly related to the work itself (and not the ancillary details on the workforce). Another goal of project-based capital allocation is addressing the noise around the forums and attempting to re-focus conversations to explore objective information.   Who can suggest a project?  A project is actionable. It can be submitted by anyone permissionlessly with milestones and its corresponding budget. We will introduce a different item for vision crafting to propose the work being done. This will be akin to an RFP, and projects will be an answer to the RFP.   How would the DAO handle a project that sees multiple Core Units or Contributors wanting (or are needed) to contribute? Cross-Core Unit collaboration would be structured in a more robust and mature implementation. Scope and budget between two Core Units would be better defined and reduce some of the friction the DAO sees today in collaboration. Project-Based Budgeting also incentivizes greater transparency (and reporting) between working groups and the DAO.   Have you considered integrating quadratic funding mechanisms in your proposal? Short answer: No. Long Answer: We are not looking at changing how MKR holders vote (yet) and want to focus on correcting how budgets are allocated (assigning capital to work instead of the workforce as it is today).

                    "content": "Thank you for this @Juan, this proposal is extremely powerful and has ramified implications on Maker\u2019s governance. It is evident to most people these days that the current set up of Maker governance makes it impossible for the protocol to have constructive conversations around adding value:  Involvement of a large and diverse pool of MKR holders is not sufficient for a one-token-one-vote / simple majority system Delegates not necessarily incentivised to have conversations on value (who evaluates the delegates?) and as a consequence often fight for air time rather than impact The information gap is real between outsiders (community members) and insiders (CU members) making the conversation unproductive Existence of conflicting and entangled interests is real  Many things to like:  Approach to projectify CU activities is extremely powerful, providing a direct link between value spent (budget) and value delivered; this might make more difficult the retention of talent in DeFi, but I guess that well-intended and smart contributors shouldn\u2019t be worried of pitching their project one at the time, a bit like management consulting Idea of defining a budget ex ante for activities, with money that can be spent on project, is compelling This makes it easier for groups belonging to different CUs to collaborate on a specific activity, avoiding problems of task forces or unofficial groups Rank vote works very well when you have to pick which non-essential projects to work on  Many things still open:  How to define what is core (operations budget) vs. what is non-core will be a heavy fight, splitting open many CUs with large budgets - this won\u2019t be easy to implement and will require large and essential MKR backing Linked to previous point: not easy to projectify every activity, hence we should avoid that the essential operations keep growing becoming pretty much a replica of the current CU set-up The construct above doesn\u2019t solve for the need to improve quality and stability of the delegation program - the most recent @GovAlpha-Core-Unit proposals go in this direction but do not solve for all delegation flaws in full (but the is material for another thread)  It is clear that complexity and costs are going out of control at MakerDAO, with little value driven and an organisation that is becoming a bureaucracy folded onto itself. An activity-based budgeting would be a great change. Progressive implementation won\u2019t be easy but we could do it by reducing annual budgets of CU and incentivise them to transition to this type of funding request. In some way, Nouns DAO (nouns.wtf) has already some sort of project-based budgeting, with the DAO financing specific projects rather than CU, and it has been working pretty well. Obviously this doesn\u2019t go in synch with Rune\u2019s MetaDAO proposal, but given that we do not have better clarity of where this is going (and instead you seem to have it) I will abstain to comment. Thanks again, this is truly awesome, Luca ",

We thought about frontends (voting portal, UIs, documentation portals, discourse, etc.), oracles (not new developments), and spell-writing, and checking that those services are functioning after upgrades, reverting to a previous version if they aren\u2019t, etc.  Protocol Development: this is where we pay teams to develop features for the Protocol. The cleanest example is probably @Deco-Core-Unit. Other Core Units are doing work for multiple \u201cbudgets\u201d nowadays.  DAO Operations: keep the DAO running: moderating forum & Discord, MIP Editors?  DAO Development: any type of work that pushes the DAO (not the Protocol) forward. SES\u2019 Ecosystem Performance Dashboard & API is a good example of something that would fall into this category. Same with Maker Academy, other types of documentation or even the development of the MIPs Portal.  Marketing Moonshots: I\u2019m guessing @MarianoDP or @Nadia would love this.      luca_pro:  Linked to previous point: not easy to projectify every activity, hence we should avoid that the essential operations keep growing becoming pretty much a replica of the current CU set-up   Yes! We will need to grow used to a project being called \u201cOngoing Moderation in the forums and Discord\u201d, to be able to accommodate value-adding tasks that are harder to projectify.     luca_pro:  The construct above doesn\u2019t solve for the need to improve quality and stability of the delegation program - the most recent @GovAlpha-Core-Unit proposals go in this direction but do not solve for all delegation flaws in full (but the is material for another thread)   Agreed. This modular framework can connect to current and future versions of different voting mechanisms.     luca_pro:  Obviously this doesn\u2019t go in synch with Rune\u2019s MetaDAO proposal, but given that we do not have better clarity of where this is going (and instead you seem to have it) I will abstain to comment.   See:     juan:  Is this compatible with the future plans for Maker being discussed (e.g.: The End Game Plan)? Yes. We draw a lot of elements of the current conversations within Maker to come up with this. We believe this would be a great stepping stone to achieving that state. We believe this is not an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach to DAO improvements. Even if Endgame or another alternative plan does not formally pass, the DAO will still benefit from this work.   ",

In fact, it seems like a big benefit of moving of this proposal is in having an interface for plugging in different frameworks or approaches to priortization. The comment on how RWF is prioritized rings true, and seems to be true as well of new collateral onboardings - maybe even of all work within the DAO? Given the lack of a fit-for-purpose solution now, if this was to go live tomorrow, am I right in saying the only possible prioritization mechanism would rely on purely voter preferences and informal debate/conversation? If so, is there a view on being able to define or identify a better default prioritzation mechanism? In the spirit of this proposal trying to have a lower signal-to-noise ratio, it feels like prioritization process is the most noisy area. Sharing ideas out-loud: The voter committee calls seem like a useful format for this discussion, although they\u2019d probably need to be more formalized. And while the discussion should be open, along the line of reducing clutter and streamlining conversation, it would seem useful to have the discussion weighted towards participants who have some MKR locked in the voting contract. Not weighted by size, but so that an active voter can have prioritized voice compared to an outside party. Pure spitballing here for the sake of spurring discussion that feels necessary to this proposal. Really good proposal, the general discussion this engenders in how the DAO\u2019s work lifecycle should or could look is really brilliant. ",

Great cross-team quarterly resource availability planning (to a weekly granularity level) A good prioritization methodology. Empower the teams to assess how much capacity goes into \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d which barely gets challenged vs. Capacity for incremental revenue projects. a negotiation phase: when there is not enough capacity, the team either hires capacity for the project, or de-scope features to deliver the project within the capacity available. What to de-scope is a negotiation with stake holders.  The above is my experience when executing this approach in a normal company. Maybe there are other ways to make it work. Even though I like the idea, in practice i struggle to see how it would work in Maker. We clearly would need to change our culture towards planning and executing a lot if we want this approach. I do see two specific challenges that maybe SES can bring some light on:   many of the projects CUs execute are \u201cnever done before\u201d i.e. launching a trustless bridge, mcd to L2, onboarding new RWA types, executing Brand campaigns without a clear business vision, etc.  Question: how can CUs estimate the effort for these and come up with a decent project cost? Wouldn\u2019t it generate more budget discussions as the discussion would be more granular vs. Current CU broader scope budgets? I awknowledge discussion would be more project specific vs. People specific, but i imagine 50 projects vs. 20ish CU yearly budget discussions. Question2: who would pitch projects?   the work force would be more elastic depending on projects pitched and prioritized: in regular tech jobs there are many shops specialized on verticals that you can get resources from, in DEFI, devs are scarce, plus onboarding them into the protocol takes time. Question: how do you see this playing out in reality?   Last thoughts: shouldn\u2019t a first step be that this same project base structure be used to prioritize current resources, share a cross team planning and draw the line on what projects are not being executed due to capacity constrains and estimate opportunity cost of these vs. wip projects so a new reprioritization is done when needed? Thanks for the proposal and the feedbacks! Things like this make us move forward. ",

                    "content": "This is a great proposal, thanks for putting this together! There are some challenges MakerDAO is facing that I don\u2019t think are addressed with this solution alone sadly. Currently, we\u2019re facing important issues related to alignment between several projects (which could become even more pronounced if a project-based approach is implemented), I\u2019ll be focused mainly on Software-related projects since it is the area I\u2019ve worked in mostly within the DAO, some of these are:  UI/UX Alignment (frontend projects) DevSecOps - Infrastructure Alignment Coding Practices / Code Accessibility and Technical documentation in the projects Quality Assurance and Reliability of the projects  Are these issues important enough? Indeed, the usability of any existing software (especially user-facing) depends on its UI/UX, and alignment between several projects guarantees that the same users feel they are always \u201cinside\u201d the same ecosystem, being more motivated to use the tools created by the working teams (increasing participation, understanding and adoption of MakerDAO). Equally, code practices and accessibility are essential for a DAO, we should ensure that future developers can continue the tasks others started, without breaking what\u2019s done and keeping the Security and Reliability of the projects: this can be accomplished only through good coding practices and an established quality assurance process within those projects which makes its code more resilience to changes (ie. a proper test suite should be created per project). Why a project-based organization only doesn\u2019t solve these issues? Because projects are siloed \u201cteam containers\u201d when it comes to IT projects, projects don\u2019t make good use of the expertise within an organization in a given problem, and with it, it can easily become extremely expansive. Contributors are not motivated or have a clear structure that will make them cooperate between several projects in such organizations, driving the aformementioned disalignment. Some of the FAQ in the post doesn\u2019t address some of the issues introduced in project-based organizations, like these mentioned above, for instance:     juan:  Won\u2019t this destroy MakerDAO contributors retention? It shouldn\u2019t. We can pay retainers through a project and understand the costs of running the DAO, including retention costs.   The answer given to this doesn\u2019t address the core issue, projects can be closed, and address retention within the projects, is to probably make them very expansive. IMO, retention shouldn\u2019t be handled within projects themselves because they will not be that different than the current CU then, this is like assigning \u201cover budgets\u201d to projects for the people to be sure that if the project closes, they\u2019ll have enough time to find another project within the DAO (or a different place), which at the end, just make retentions very expansive, but it doesn\u2019t really reduce the implications of things like closing a project. Contributors need a place to call \u201cHome\u201d, and that one isn\u2019t projects, CU are better suited for this.     juan:  Does this mean everyone becomes a dispensable contractor working on contract basis? Several mechanisms still ensure talent is attracted, kept, and rewarded. Project-Based Budgeting ensures that the talent works on things the DAO wants.   I\u2019m sure we can create these mechanisms, but I\u2019m not sure that Project-Based Budgeting would be the answer,  they\u2019re probably within the CU-realm and not the Project-budget proposal.     juan:  Does this replace MIP40s? Unless we find a reason to keep MIP40s, projects should replace them.   IMO MIP40s shouldn\u2019t be replaced, because to handle alignment, quality and retention, we\u2019re probably going to need it! These are not new issues, and they\u2019re very common in any existing organization, and sadly these issues can become very pronounced within project-based organization structures. For a very long time companies have been using Matrix organization structures to tackle these problems, where you can keep all the benefits of project-based organization, but also those of functional-based organizations. How could this paradigm be applied to a DAO? Luckily, we have created mechanisms to create Core Units, which could be easily considered \u201cfunctional teams\u201d if they\u2019re organized accordingly. An example of such a structure would be the following:  image3324\u00d71564 93.4 KB  This would permit an easier alignment on the aforementioned issues (and others) within the different projects, it will propitiate greater communication within the DAO and its team, it will increase the morale and keep retention higher (since retention would be a CU task, not a Project thing). Such structure doesn\u2019t come without a cost, it is much more complex, and it could in fact increase governance overload (it is just introducing the project\u2019s \u201cdimension\u201d to the current CU structure). We should definitely weigh this against a projects-based approach, but as mentioned above, project-based IMO will damage (severely) retention and alignment in different areas. ",

We\u2019ll have projects like: \u201cHandle the system administration and technical support needs\u201d, which is not different from one of the current CU missions. Within the budget for the project, there will be a Contingency Buffer, which could be used for any unexpected situation. Suddenly the \u201cproject manager\u201d decides they need to construct a new monitoring dashboard, using this budget for it, falling into the same issue we have today (no control by Maker holders over this specific initiative, which should have been a project by itself). Projects should have specific outcomes which should be easily measured (ie. milestones accomplished or not), and deliverables (Code, Design, Documentation) together with its Human Resources Plan; and they should last enough to make sense taking them up to a vote. Can we provide deliverables in the project budget created for \u201cTechnical Support\u201d? The short answer is No because you don\u2019t know at priory what you\u2019ll be providing support for, therefore such tasks don\u2019t fit within Project Budgets (cause they\u2019ll fall into the same issue we have today again). We could argue that the budget for technical support should be included in the projects, but the problem is that this doesn\u2019t guarantee to accomplish the retention of talent objectives. Again using \u201cTechnical Support\u201d, we could include a budget for \u201cpossible\u201d technical issues that could arise within a project, but what if this is only 2h per week? How could we keep that person interested in working with us, since the only we have to offer him is 2h per week on a specific project? A CU with a \u201ctalent pool\u201d would be more appropriate for this, and there could be members taking care of that support constantly through different projects. Therefore, projects are too broad when they don\u2019t have a clear roadmap and deliverables, and too specific if the amount of work is not more than 1 month of work (example time), then \u201csomebody from the maintenance CU\u201d would be a better fit to perform that task, and we don\u2019t need to have Maker holders voting in \u201cprojects\u201d which are for adding a small feature to a frontend UI which will take 1 week to do.

We should introduce new processes, which add specific structures to define projects and their budget, as those shared in the post, but we shouldn\u2019t limit the budget only to this. We should keep a structure that permits us to deal better with HR-related tasks like HR planning, Recruitment and Selection, Compensation and Benefits, and many others; also one which permits us to apply good development practices to what we do, have a common vision for the DAO when it comes to engineering topics (I\u2019m referring to functional areas like Design, Coding, DevOps, QA). The budget given to the projects should probably flow toward the CU to compensate the major of its expenses (salary), but there are expenses that shouldn\u2019t be project-related (and should be funded as well), Facilitators, Key Engineers, Recruiters, Accounting, dealing with 3rd parties (contracting, having a Legal Representation to be able to do so).

                    "content": "As I see it, one of the problems with project-based budgeting is, that you get what you measure. Performance management leads to perverse effects. One of these effects might be that a CU risk being \u201cforced\u201d to complete its work on a project because this project is what the funds were allocated for - no matter if the CU during the process realizes the project will not create the value that was initially expected. Another effect is that innovation through harder experiments might be de-prioritized by CUs as they just keep on cherry-picking by proposing to solve bread and butter projects. Another thing is that project-based budgeting is probably most sufficient for large projects running over a long period and with some opportunities for flexibility. For contributors solving many smaller tasks, it might be harder to use with success. An alternative to Project-Based Budgeting could be a higher degree of transparency on what the CUs/contributors are working on. At the moment I see it as a huge black box once funds are allocated. This black box could be removed by frequent reporting on what the time and money have been spent on. The auditing could be done by a panel of stakeholders the work is supposed to create value for. This would also create a forced feedback loop making sure the builders talk to their users. ",

                    "content": "Hello @juan , I really enjoy the thinking behind the post. I am super happy that DAO HR processes are developing different sets of approaches to best manage a permissionless work environment. While reading it, I had lots of flashbacks regarding the discussion while we were developing Inverter. Inverter is a project-based funding operations platform that aims to increase accountability and transparency while reducing administrative effort. The mechanism of Inverter embraces a very similar approach that this proposal suggests for fund management. Inverter embraces milestone-based funding streaming for projects. Such that, workstream management happens through project proposals that have clear expectations and commitments. While creating a proposal, the working team has to set milestones and deliverables. Each milestone will have a budget and duration. The next milestone budget amount will only start streaming to the working team once they have completed the current milestone duration and have provided the Proof of Completion documents for the committed deliverables. So, the DAO will focus more on paying \u201c\u2026 for value, not for the workforce\u201d One of the novel solutions that Inverter brought here is that the \u201capproval\u201d process of the proof of work document is based on an optimistic approach. Unless there is a disagreement with the document, the document will be redeemed as satisfactory. However, if the community is not satisfied with the provided proof of completion document, they can interrupt streaming and withdraw their funds anytime. This allows a built-in accountability mechanism that does not require many approvals on each milestone which involves lots of bureaucratic work but still protects funders from under-delivery of work. One may be concerned that in DAO daily work activities, it is hard to perfectly define milestones with objective outcomes, or there may be under deliveries due to external reasons, etc. However, the idea behind providing proof of deliverable completion documents is to maintain the consent of your funder, not complete all the promises without any compromise. For example, the writing guild may promise to provide 3 articles this month but publish 2. However, if the community believes that those 2 articles were very good and satisfied with their performance. All they need to do is not withdraw their funds, which signals that they are satisfied with the provided work. Also, inside Inverter, communities can provide feedback on proof of deliverable reports. This may be a suggestion for future reports or a request for a new report, or any sort of feedback. That way, working teams will have constant pulse checks. That way, as you said, the community will evaluate the health and success of each project continuously and maintain value alignment. I believe one of the most important value add that Inverter can provide Maker DAO is the organization dashboard that it provides. Inverter provides an organizational dashboard that funding programs can see and get notified about their funded proposal  Who is already funding this proposal Who is contributing to this proposal Public discussions about the proposal in community forums The proposal\u2019s target funding goal Established Milestones and Deliverables Proof of Deliverable Completion reports Feedbacks on Proof of Deliverable Completion reports from funder  Being able to navigate this important information for many proposals would help Maker DAO to have a more transparent and easy time managing its funding activities. I believe the dashboard will help this proposal\u2019s aspiration to manage \u201cthe already proposed KPIs, plus the existing and needed tools to evaluate the health and success of each project.\u201d in a transparent and easy way. I am looking forward to hearing your opinion. I believe there is a very interesting value alignment there. I would love to invite the Maker community to be one of the early testers of the product in our close beta launch. We would love to have a user interview with the Maker DAO community to improve our product based on your needs !!

In light of the recent developments, there seems to be a bit of controversy surrounding Strategic Finance\u2019s involvement in Lido Finance through their partnership as Steakhouse Financial. Specifically, members of the community (myself included) believe that there is somewhat of a conflict of interests \u2013 not simply as a contributor to another DAO but conducting business decisions between DAO\u2019s as voiced by @CodeKnight. To clarify, we are not against members of SF contributing and aiding other organizations in the space as:  There is no no explicit parameter that states CU members cannot contribute at other DAOs Delegates and CU contributors are often part of other DAOs in some capacity or another. Although specific delegate TEAMS may be different between different protocols for some delegates, their parent organization is the same. Given the volatility of this space, income security is crucial for heavy contributors \u2013 I do not fault them for seeking other ways to benefit this space. There\u2019s nothing stopping contributors from creating an anon alt in secrecy. I appreciate their transparency even if it wasn\u2019t as vocal as I\u2019d have liked.  Despite this, there are a few points raised by the community that I can\u2019t ignore:  Although CU members are contributors, their compensation mirrors that of their equivalents in TradFi. @iammeeoh is not out of the ballpark in calling these salaries. Individual responsibility (as is the case for the members of SF in question) over multiple projects will, without a doubt, spread the abilities of contributors thin. Given that the Lido proposal mapped out a base salary per FTE of $184,000/year, it\u2019s not farfetched to say that the time commitment will be substantial. This sets a precedent for contributors also working at other protocols in a full-time capacity, taking time away from their contributions at Maker despite their compensation remaining similar.  As such, I\u2019d like to revisit @Juan\u2019s post about project-based budgeting as it provides clarity over the goals of the DAO as well as what exactly CUs and contributors should be working towards. While coming up with clear goals and KPIs will require more discussion, I believe that this system needs to be explored more so by the community. I\u2019d like to point out a recent proposal on Compound (#122) where Maker Risk was compensated for their assistance. While not exactly project-based budgeting, it\u2019s in the same vein as what I think should be explored although I may be wrong. Wondering what the community thinks. ",
