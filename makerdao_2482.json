The recent pressure caused by COMP farmers using Dai as their asset of choice has accelerated the need to address this issue more formally.  As of today, the community is moving forward with the response of increasing the USDC debt ceiling, which is important because it means that Maker Governance is showing a willingness to defend the peg, ultimately hel\u2026      I think PSM is a good fix for some of Dai problems but I think that implementing PSM alone has 2 major problems tens or hundreds of millions of centralized stablecoins (for example usdc) locked in PSM represent 1- a risk to Maker 2- a missed opportunity what are the risks? the most important risks that I can think of: 1- usdc locked in PSM can be blacklisted (for whatever reason) 2- usdc can depeg and lose all or part of its value what is the missed opportunity? having tens or hundreds of millions of usdc locked in PSM means that the DAI minted using these assets  is not generating income to Maker protocol except small spread fees My suggestion to improve PSM I think we should simply lend most of the locked usdc and we should set the lending value for each centralized stable coin to 1$\u2026 this means if usdc depeged and lost some or all of its value then usdc holders will take the loss not Maker. for example If I borrowed 10k usdc from PSM and USDC depeged down to zero $ (for whatever reason) then I will still have to pay back 10k dollars back to PSM to free my collateral using another type of assets (may be DAI?) this suggestion will remove most of the risks like blacklisting and depeging of usdc also will generate new stream of income of Maker holders ",

I don\u2019t think borrowing usdc from PSM will be riskier for borrowers than borrowing it from other platforms like Aave or compound\u2026 anyway if borrowers perceived it as a riskier loan then I guess this will be reflected in willing to pay lower fees in comparison to taking loans from Aave or compound, and this is ok since borrowers are not only paying Maker fees but also lowering Maker risks.  What happens in the event that the PSM is not generating enough USDC loans and yet it is still accumulating a lot of USDC giving MakerDao that exposure you mentioned?  since we can offer lower rates to borrowers than Compound or Aave we will have an advantage in attracting borrowers\u2026 anyway if we failed to attract borrowers for whatever reason then we will have to manage the risks using ceilings and diversification as we are planning to do with current PSM proposal ",

Only issue I see is the technical challenge of implementing new Vaults to lend USDC for instance.   Why don\u2019t we just:  Once we have embarked, 1m USDC (from the PSM) take 1m DAI from the SB (surplus buffer), when available. put 1m DAI + 1m USDC (2m USD of value) on LP on Uniswap (or Curve or whatever).  This way we obtain the following results:  We increase DAI liquidity in markets. We get fees on the LP pair DAI/USDC  Most importantly, we get rid of USDC and we instead get in our hands LP tokens. This means that, central authorities can only blacklist the USDC in the Uniswap contract (which affects everybody) not MakerDAO\u2019s LP tokens!  Note 1: this simple solution does not protect us from USDC going to 0. But it protect us from central authorities attacking MakerDAO by blacklisting its USDC. Which I think is, by far, the greater of the two risks. Note 2: there is a bottleneck here, step (2). We are limited by the amount of money available in the SB. Other alternatives can be considered though, but for the moment I leave it there. ",

Regarding LP usdc/dai uniswap can activate fees on the withdrawal I think the amount is exponential on the amount. Only way to go over it is to fork it. That can be done with MIPs 31. MIP 31 simplify the deposit also it can be directly plug to keg by sending money into it. Also fees are parametrable. Edit change MIPs number. ",

Using MIP31 only for MKR/DAI just add the flashloan piss of code from MIP25. Looks very easy to do. Side note I removed the flashloan inbuilt from uniswap as we don\u2019t want it for MKR. ",

We might want only Maker to use it in order to better control our exposure between USDC-DAI-LP and cUSDC (MIP32/35) for instance. Not sure. ",

                    "content": "Sorry I meant MIP36. 32 and 35 are very similar only difference is the farming on 35. 36 lend dai violently, like a push force, without taking care of the exchange, very powerful. But the idea is to push down the price. That is for second lending market. I think there is different use cases for 36. For example is we have some of it and dai is at .99 we can withdraw to push up the peg too. Or if someone from RWA want to pay back 400M in one go we can easily absorbe it with MIP36 without having the dai hitting the PSM. I am not sure if that makes sense, but we can sort of coordinate it by governance. ",
