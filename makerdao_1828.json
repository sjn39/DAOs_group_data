                    "content": " Summary  MakerDAO is currently in loss making situation of 35M DAI/year  We need the short-term bond yield even more than when proposed.   MakerDAO should have most of its balance sheet earning at least the risk-free yield.  Currently it\u2019s almost 0%.   The proposal suggests shortening duration to allow easier/safer/faster scaling We need more generic investment platform like MIP65 (at least 3 diversified) If we can get 4B DAI to yield at least SOFR, this would translate into 120M annual revenues.   MakerDAO profitability situation As a context of our investment strategy, I will start by restating our profitability situation. MakerBurn provides a profitability estimate that is widely used. Nevertheless, the default parameter for Liquidation income is to use the last 12 months. It is unlikely that it is a good assumption as we can\u2019t get liquidation income from vault that we already liquidated and we don\u2019t have many vaults left anymore (exposure ~1B).  1132\u00d7772 43.6 KB  Therefore, we should note that MakerDAO operates from a significant loss-making position.  Shortening duration risk As highlighted in the MakerDAO ALM forecast, getting back to profitability should be a key priority before it is too late. We still have little of a Surplus Buffer to take risk.  The key learning is that we need to get back to profitability with the current Surplus Buffer to increase it, invest more and grow faster. If we can\u2019t get back to profitability with the current Surplus Buffer we will get stuck  Luckily for us, short-term rates have kept rising, so we can generate more income without taking much risk. The original Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds was done in a different context where our ability to generate income revenues after structural cost of the investment structure was more challenging. Since then, SOFR rate has been rising dramatically, while the credit risk yield (using A-rated spread) didn\u2019t moved as much. Adding 100bps when yields are close to 0bps is a great operational leverage, less so when risk-free is already above 300bps.  1158\u00d7352 17.4 KB   1156\u00d7352 22.8 KB  On the duration risk, there is quite some uncertainty going forward and we don\u2019t need the term premium for now. Therefore, we might consider targeting a shorter duration (< 1 year), avoid credit risk and scale more aggressively. Note that this discussion is based on a DSR close to 0bps. I recognize we will have to increase DSR to increase DAI circulating (or just to respond to competition). This will change the conclusion. But we need a fully allocated balance sheet first anyway.  Balance sheet allocation We have a strong pipeline of proposals and prospects to deal with. Public proposals are in the chart below.  1466\u00d7754 107 KB  On the ALM Target, it is coming from Modeling DAI Maturity.    dune.com    Dune Blockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community. Explore and share data from Ethereum, xDai, Polygon, Optimism, BSC and Solana for free.       963\u00d7354 27.6 KB   Liquidity Layer 1 - PSMs Should contain at all time 1.2B DAI (assuming 6B DAI outstanding) and should be intrablock liquidity (i.e. PSMs). This would take care of our 1-block and 1-day liquidity needs which are currently estimated at 1.2B DAI. With time we should be able to get SOFR on this part of the balance sheet but it will take time. The Gemini partnership is a step in this direction.  Liquidity Layer 2 - Algorithmic liquidity We also have a big bucket of liquidity needed between 1-week and 1-month (~800M DAI). For this one, we are exploring algorithmic ways to invest, i.e. those investments would be unwinded automatically without MakerDAO governance involvement. For instance, MIP81, if the USDC could be wrapped in another smart contract, would be a great option. An independent ALM smart contract would allocate from MIP81 to the USDC PSM when liquidity would be thin and the opposite when liquidity is overflowing.  774\u00d7232 5.23 KB  The same could probably be made for our current crypto-backed loans exposure (ETH-A, \u2026). We don\u2019t have such solutions yet, which means the layer 2 liquidity needs would currently be added to layer 1 and the investment option to the investment layer (next section). Challenges are on the smart contract, legal and financial level. We are exploring some options. I think plenty will appear to get close to the SOFR rate for this bucket within a year.  Investment Layer - Investment bucket This bucket is the most geared towards yield generation and less towards meeting our short-term liquidity needs. As discussed previously, we have plenty of capital (most) that is not getting SOFR rate even while we don\u2019t have strong liquidity needs. Therefore the focus should be on moving those lazy DAIs to SOFR-generating DAIs. We should develop a diversified base of platforms to get at least the SOFR rate. A platform would be an independent set of legal structures (e.g. the BVI trust for MIP65, the Cayman RWA Foundation for HVBank) and operators (custodian, crypto-broker, arranger/reporting agent). I would target 3 of such platforms but happy to have the view of the community of that. Diversification would not be here to solve complete failure (as exposure would be too big anyway) but would provide time to find a solution if any issue should arise without locking too much liquidity. Currently we have MIP65 which is still in the pilot phase. It was a long process but will unlock access to yield. A priority should be given to deploy generic platforms. For exploratory reasons, some investments would be outside this scope (SOFR like). Those are private credit/RWA styles or to deploy corporate bonds capabilities. Experience we are getting there will be valuable going forward. We also might have an ETH exposure for strategic reasons.  Community feedback Community discussion, especially @Recognized-Delegates , is more than welcome. I tried to start the discussion in the last delegates office hours but I hope having this summary post as basis will help structure a discussion. I\u2019m sure we can find other ways to move forward. The aim is to provide better feedbacks on \u201cwhat community wants\u201d  to potential proposals. ",

Its good practice to shorten the duration given money market rates (<1year) are forecasted to rise, flattening the yield curve or even inverting it.

As you point out, the main objective is to convert non-yield generating assets into yield-generating assets and  return to profitability, so the maturity is a priority but second to deployment. ",

While there has been a lot of focus on the potential ones via legislation or failure via the PSM, we have slowly been draining our surplus buffer. This is metaphorically like worrying about getting shot while you are slowly starving to death. Something I also expressed concern about during recent polls and one of the reasons I\u2019ve been advocating reducing expenses for some time. As we currently aim to avoid raising any stability fees given market conditions and the current sentiment in DeFi we are unlikely to make meaningful gains in revenue from crypto collateral in the short or even medium term. Luckily we have the possibility to put our balance sheet to work to provide meaningful revenue and to avoid becoming extinct. As such I think this proposal takes us in the right direction by aiming for meaningful revenue while keeping risk properly managed. Embracing our unofficial slogan of \u201cRecklessly boring\u201d However I must comment on the quote bellow because as much as I think this is a prudent and necessary step it can appear a little misleading.     SebVentures:  But MakerDAO itself is playing with close to infinite leverage. Our current leverage is 75x (assets / surplus buffer) which is very high (LTCM was 21x). Now our problem is more than leverage grow over time as long a we are loss making.   While it is true that the ratio of assets to surplus buffer is x75 calling it leverage should be qualified. Given that the vast majority of those assets are in stablecoins and the rest is overcollateralized we are far safer than the expression of being 75x leveraged would seem to imply. We are not sensitive to asset prices assuming there is not a fundamental failure, apart from our vaults and since implementing liq 2.0 we have been through several sharp market declines without accruing any bad debt. Quite contrary, we have increased our balance in those scenarios. ",

The fund also invested in other derivatives such as equity options. John Quiggin\u2019s book Zombie Economics (2010) states, \u201cThese derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, were developed with the supposed goal of allowing firms to manage risk on exchange rates and interest rate movements. Instead, they allowed speculation on an unparalleled scale.\u201d\u2026 Also remember that the current crisis in LDI with pension funds in UK is - again - derivative-driven. The derivative programs were designed to work within reasonable market movement constraints - but completely blows things up in situations where the rise is interest rates are dramatic and large scale - as just experienced in the UK. It\u2019s when derivatives starts to play a large role on a balance sheet and in return expectations, that one should generally start getting concerned. ",
