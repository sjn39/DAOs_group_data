Therefore, I would propose utilizing these layer 2 technologies to open up Uniswap to a large number of smaller investors. That is mainly due to the fact that in order to provide liquidity, you have to pay a significant amount of ether for the transaction, and thus, smaller investors will take much longer to break-even. Furthermore, paying around 20 euros to deposit and withdraw tokens is just a huge amount per transaction. I think it\u2019s time. What are your thoughts on this? ",
