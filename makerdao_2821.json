                    "content": "Hey all, We know that at a current 4% interest rate on debt from stablecoin collateral we have about 2.5 months before accrued fees start causing stablecoin vaults to become undercollateralized. In practice, losses from potential undercollateralization are simply offset by increased Surplus buffer by the same amount. This means that Maker could be charging those fees as long as it wants, but only needs to set aside reserves inside the Surplus Buffer for impairments needed. However, there are two important questions that need to be addressed:  What is the best strategy for disabling fees on stable coin debt? How long is it sustainable to have Surplus Auctions (FLAPs) running after Surplus Buffer is reached (estimated in about a day)?  To get an answer on the first question it would probably require a long discussion about some of the trade-offs which I don\u2019t want to go into in this post. Also, it is likely not optimal to be disabling those fees very soon and we don\u2019t need a decision right now. A post on this topic is following soon though, as we still need the community to agree on general strategy in the near future. To get an answer on the second question, let us look at some numbers first. As of now, about 600.000 DAI has been accrued from fees on debt from stablecoin collateral to the Surplus buffer and we know they will be hard to actually collect if DAI price doesn\u2019t fall below $1.01. Additional 50.000 DAI accrues daily from these assets at a current rate of 4%. All these fees from stablecoin vaults are worth something if they can be collected and this only happens if DAI goes below $1.01. Even if DAI goes under that price, we are unsure how many of the vaults will need to be liquidated and what the outcome will be. This means that in the current situation every cash flow from those fees is essentially unbacked DAI if being conservative. These fees are already part of Surplus Buffer, which itself is not an issue if being unbacked until used (or not until at least you have FLOPS or spending it for other costs). But once the Surplus buffer is filled and these fees are used for MKR burn it becomes an issue \u201cslowly\u201d, because you should be making impairments for the same amount in the Surplus buffer, which is already showing inflated value. At some point you are effectivaly reducing the Surplus buffer to zero, even though it still shows 2m value. And once it goes below zero (by applying impairments calculations), you effectively have an unbacked DAI scenario, not to mention the system doesn\u2019t have any protection against losses. So what does this mean in relation to recently voted Signal to continue with FLAP auctions after the Surplus buffer is filled? It means that we will be spending about 50.000 DAI daily from stablecoin fees for MKR burn, money that isn\u2019t necessarily collected in the future. Therefore our Surplus buffer should be each day decreased by 50.000 DAI, together with an additional 600.000 DAI impairment needed from currently accrued fees. This means that in about a month, our Surplus Buffer effectively becomes drained in \u201cDAI backing\u201d terms, a situation we want to avoid. This means we would likely need to very soon either a) disable stablecoin fees or b) Increase Surplus buffer soon after continuing to FLAP auctions. Since disabling fees on stablecoins currently may not be optimal for maximizing their potential collection in the future I think it may be more wise to increase the Surplus buffer. The increase should be done by an amount that makes Maker save until we disable fees on debt from stablecoin collateral. A 2m increase would mean we would have the same situation as today in about 1 month. By then, we should already have a more clear view on the timeline regarding disabling fees. Please discuss the pros and cons of this approach before we potentially increase the Surplus buffer next Friday. I know there was a Signal already, but I think this issue wasn\u2019t properly addressed in the past. As explained above, the more we delay the increase, the more we are effectively draining the current Surplus buffer (fees collected from other collateral) and governance needs to decide about tolerance here.

Not crazy at all, this is definitely one of the best solutions. The only problem is that once majority of those Vaults reach 100% CR or some level, there might still be a large chunk of them inside this vault type with much higher CR that you may not vault to disable fees immediately\u2026 ",

Therefore we need to balance the vault DC. Smaller vaults will capture more value but would add more management work. While I hope work in this direction will continue, we need to address the short term. Either disable SF for stablecoins, increase the surplus buffer size or take the risk that DAI between 100% and 101% CR will become larger than the surplus buffer and trigger a MKR minting if something turn sour. I think the risk is really small and I think increasing the surplus buffer is not great for many reasons. But overall, increasing the surplus buffer will allow us to sleep better and is a simple fix.

As long as we burn MKR with these fees, we will just need to mint an equivalent amount of MKR (in USD terms) once the vaults get liquidated.

                    "content": "I have another potential solution to the stablecoin Vault issue. Basic idea: Autoliquidation of Vaults after a certain time. Let\u2019s face it, the current setup we have going with stablecoin Vaults is a temporary measure enacted to keep the peg following Black Thursday events and the DeFi craze. It is far from optimal, possibly not even sustainable, so let us change how it works. The proposed action sequence:  For existing stablecoin Vault types (USDC A etc etc) we introduce upwards creeping liquidation ratios, the suggested pace is 0.25% increase per week until approximately 103% is reached. The increase is to ensure that if liquidations happen they do not eat into Maker buffers. Exact figures will of course be as per the Risk team\u2019s recommendation. This slow pace of increase will allow Vault owners time to close maxed-out Vaults. We reduce the Debt Ceiling to 0 for the existing stablecoin Vault types, effectively ensuring no new Vaults of this type. At the same time we open a new Vault type especially for stablecoins. It works as before but with the added feature that the Vault will be auto-liquidated after a certain amount of time (blocks) has passed. How long? Some months to a year to start, but these are suggestions. This fully eliminates the potential issue of unbacked DAI in buffer/burner. As the new Vaults will be auto-liquidated anyway we could have a spectrum of Vault types, some with extremely low liquidation ratio or other experimentation to help with the peg. After the new Vault type is introduced we keep raising both the stability fee and the liquidation ratio for the older stablecoin Vaults, creating clear incentive to migrate to the new auto-liquidating Vault type.  Not everyone is going to like this proposal. It is tough love on the stablecoin Vault holders and it forces them to be more proactive with their Vaults. But for Maker it solves the potential issue of unbacked Dai in the buffers and it allows for more creativity with regards to Vault types as they will be closed after some time anyway. Feedback appreciated. EDIT: grammar ",

This proposal is not about the peg.     so this proposal is to make the stablecoin-vaults more and more irrelevant? don\u2019t you think this will actually hurt the peg? wasn\u2019t that the whole idea we onboarded them?

Once that occurs the price will naturally rise above $1.00 again because the system at that point will be backed properly again rinse and repeat. ",
