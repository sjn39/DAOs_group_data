I put that in quotes because it could mean a number of things.   twitter.com          Dmitry Palchun (Ethernian)     @bmann @5chdn @EthMagicians > Discourse has a bunch of features like this. It is new for me. Could you provide more info about it, like docs or keywords? Thanks!  2:05 PM - 21 Jul 2018       This site runs Discourse. It has lots of features \u2014 some through configuration, some through plugins. I have suggested that we use the Scrolls rep issues to file requested changes or updates. This #site-feedback category can of course be used for general discussion, but issues can help us keep a log of major changes. ",
