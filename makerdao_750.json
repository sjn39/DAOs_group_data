Lately, there has been a lot of discussion around ProgPOW, a new mining algorithm designed to favor GPU miners over ASICs. It has become a highly politicized discussion, and it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that Ethereum could have another contentious split. Some worry how a contentious split might harm the DeFi ecosystem (could MakerDAO even survive on both forks?) To what extent does MKR governance want to weigh in on this matter (and any other future Ethereum governance issues)? A lot of the wider Ethereum community might look to this community to throw support for one side or another (perhaps through a governance poll). I think it could be interesting to preemptively have a light discussion surrounding the topic. I think, in any event, Maker will need to (somehow) choose a side in case something happens, so probably better to start talking about this sooner rather than later. ",

I think it is really important to try to avoid a serious community fork.   I thought the whole point of PoS was that we completely avoid this.  In effect in PoS I would be asking a different question - which is more secure and creates a more decentralized ecosystem.  ASIC, or GPU mining? I wonder why in PoS we couldn\u2019t have both as possible block autheticator tech and let them both compete to complete blocks in some fashion since the verification in either model computationally simple even if different? Thinking about PoS to me this really doesn\u2019t matter because whatever the choice is - the entire eco-system will have to shift to using one or the other, but it is my expectation with PoS you would not need a GPU or ASIC to certify the block and why couldn\u2019t we move back to being able to do it with any old cpu since basically the certification is based on putting up a stake and solving a basic problem using that stake so I honestly don\u2019t know why we are even talking about this except in the context of ETH 1.0 which I agree may live on for a while. IF as everyone is saying GPU mining is preferred over ASIC for decentralization I think we should try to move in a direction that gives the community the best chance at staying decentralized.  I am pretty convinced with ASICs at least in Bitcoin this has given the ASIC manufacturers a distinct advantage with mining rewards and I\u2019m not entirely thrilled about that. In that vein I would be a supporter or ProgPOW or any other POW securing mechanism that offers the best chance of maintaining as level a miner playing field as possible for the sake of decentralization.    I honestly have not seen data regarding miner centralization in PoW blockchains with respect to the PoW alogrithms chosen.  If anyone has anything please do post here as it would be useful information when trying to weigh in on this. ",

Disagree strongly with this. You mentioned correctly that the discussion is currently contentious. If MakerDAO takes a side on the issue before a hard-fork has been \u2018confirmed\u2019 then I think we risk triggering said hard-fork (especially if we end up disagreeing with the majority opinion.) Personally I think our highest priority should be to minimise the risk of a contentious hard-fork, we do not want to deal with that situation. We don\u2019t want to have to make a choice on behalf of the ecosystem, realistically any fork with MakerDAO running on it will continue to be used versus one that doesn\u2019t, we need to be very careful of what we appear to publicly support. This provokes a problem, mainly in that all our discussions are public, therefore it is difficult for us to discuss this issue without it being picked up by members of the ethereum ecosystem with a strong agenda toward either side. Put simply, our goal should be to ensure that there is no contentious hard-fork. As soon as a group credibly commits to a contentious hard-fork we have serious problems. If possible, I would like to focus this discussion on how we can prevent a hard-fork, rather than which side we should take in the event of one. It is possible that MakerDAO publicly supporting either side could prevent a contentious hard fork (it could also have the opposite effect), but that confers a level of responsibility and expectation on us in the future that I don\u2019t think we want. We should be governing Maker, not Ethereum. I think it\u2019s fair to say at this point that we have fairly robust governance. Is there anything we can do to promote better governance and communication at the Ethereum protocol level? ",

From what I have seen the finanial and political power of the groups behind ASIC production and use (primarily Asian/Chinese AFAIK) I think is a kind of slipperly slope to centralization of Mining and overall imho this has been bad, and is bad for the community overall.    The problem here is two fold - financial interests pushing on both sides of this (one of these groups loses).   I also don\u2019t know if the Ethereum community itself has decentralization as a goal.  Even in Bitcoin they are still stuck with ASIC mining centralization so based on what I saw/see there I honestly don\u2019t think we get away from a potentially very contentious fight here. I think all players in the communities of interest have not just a RIGHT but also a DUTY to make their views known.   Ideally these should be consistent with the community goals and backed by some science and data backing up the science. So I\u2019m left with the following questions: Is support of decentralization of the protocol still important to the Maker community (poll #1). Do we have a real historical measurement metric of \u2018decentralization\u2019? Is there a distinct advantage of changing the block work method (ASIC/GPU/other) to achieving advancing the decentralization goal? Finally is this even important in the face of upcoming PoS or is this really a red herring issue to divide the community and weaken the space to the benefit of players in other spaces? I do agree I think this may become an important topic if Maker ends up having to choose which fork to move to.    I consider a contentious hard fork of the Ethereum Ecosystem just before the major moves to ETH 2.0 to be one of the worst possible events that could happen here.   I honestly hope the community can get on the right side of this generally so we end up with a single chain and not a forked one.    Personally starting to consider that there are large interests here that have a vested interest in dividing these communities and it is turning out these communities have little to no defense to these kinds of divisive politics in general.    Each time we end up getting our chains yanked and the community split by something related to securing the chain (mining). ",

I do not entirely agree with your premise. In my mind, (de)centralization is not the issue. The problem with ASICs is that they cannot be recycled for some other use, motivating a deferral of the move to proof-of-stake (PoS). I believe the ASIC community is making every possible disingenuous argument to oppose ProgPOW. For example, the ASIC community says, \u201cNo need to move to ProgPOW because PoS is right around the corner.\u201d Translation: ASIC community wants more time to capture enough mining share to eventually oppose PoS. Or maybe the argument is, \u201cMaker must side where we end up with the greatest de-centralization of the protocol.\u201d Translation: ASIC community wants to muddy the discussion by misdirecting people that they care about (de)centralization to delay ProgPOW as much as possible. In my opinion, you\u2019ve got follow the money. ASIC investment is a dead-end, but the ASIC community wants to milk the the ASIC gravy train as long as possible. I\u2019m not sure what Maker should actually do. I\u2019m sympathic to LongForWisdom\u2019s arguments as well, that is, we should wait on the sidelines for the politics to play out. I\u2019m just not sure. Maybe it would be worth publishing a formal statement that we cautiously support ProgPOW, but will adopt whichever fork is favored by most other projects. ",

So I think it\u2019s worth having the meta-conversation about how we participate in decisions like this. I\u2019m interested in working backward. If there is a hard fork, what would be our mechanism for choosing one? Then I think we can talk about what our community needs to do to prepare for that responsibility. ",

Not necessarily. $MKR can be valuable on both chains, and if maintained could prove valuable in both networks. A contenteous hard fork might be worth the airdrop. Our MKR is more valuable if it serves the extra chain. Even for an ETC-sized split, it may be worth it for the airdrop alone for us to global-settlement certain forked collateral tokens to keep the forked MKR supply under control. I believe one network will ultimately win but it\u2019s better for the shareholders if we take some easy steps toward preserving our assets, regardless of what is going on in the community. ",

Decentralization is vital to our survival but we aren\u2019t sacrificing it when we maintain the status quo. ETH price is stronger if it costs less electricity to mine ETH because there is less cost-based sell-pressure on miners. The price of ETH bounds the amount of DAI it can collateralize.     psychonaut:  ASIC community wants more time to capture enough mining share to eventually oppose PoS.
