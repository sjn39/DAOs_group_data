It\u2019s an ongoing protocol. Simple Summary A public autonomous zero-identity protocol which can greatly enhance smart contract based application\u2019s security ,for itself and for the participants, and can be a core protocol to the decentralized autonomous civilization. Abstract This protocol allows any user, developer, organization to register ,backup and update their zero-identities by running smart contracts. It can protect the user\u2019s  social media account and crytoassets held by smart contracts when the private key lost, and it can effectively eliminate theft and fraud from hackers and malicious smart contracts. This protocol is a fundamental protocol for the blockchain\u2018s decentralized autonomous civilization. The key to true autonomy is that only the owner of a zero-identity rather than any thirty party has full access control over his/her zero-identity unless the owner has his/her guardian or the owner authorizes a thirty party the highest permission. This means this protocol is decentralized, autonomous and anti-censorship. This is a fundamental protocol which an ideal public autonomous blockchain zero-identity framework is based on. It is a key proposal for building blockchain decentralized autonomous ecosystems, such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Definitions   Zero-identity : Briefly speaking a Zero-Identity is a user\u2019s Ethereum address which represents his/her effective identity and interacts with any smart contract in Ethereum.  We need your help cause this is a BIG thing! ",
