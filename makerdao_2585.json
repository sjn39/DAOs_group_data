Declaration to Replace: n/a   Specification  Context and Motivation Flash mints allow anyone to mint as much Dai as they need with the one condition that they pay it all back in the same transaction with a fee. This allows anyone to exploit arbitrage opportunities in the DeFi space without having to commit upfront capital. A flash mint module will provide the following benefits:  Improves market efficiencies for Dai. Democratization of arbitrage - anyone can participate. Exploits requiring a large amount of capital will be found quicker which makes the DeFi space safer overall. Fees provide an income source for the protocol.   Declaration Detail MakerDAO Governance requests a Dai Flash Mint module be built and integrated with the Maker system. This module should include both an optional fee parameter as well as an optional debt ceiling which MakerDAO Governance can adjust after deployment via executive vote. This implementation is flexible beyond the core criteria of adding a Flash Mint Module with an optional fee and debt ceiling.  Relevant Links  Signal Request: Add a Dai flash mint module  ",

First, let me say, I am more in favor of this than not.  I like the limiting parameters, and all the points you\u2019ve made are dead on aside from the one I quoted. When the protocol liquidates a position it\u2019s to reclaim the Dai debt and fees.  All of this is the protocol asking for Dai in return for the collateral from the position.  Since a flash lending module would expect Dai to be returned at the end of the transaction, and the new liquidation system expects Dai to be returned too, the only path that makes sense is to flash lend the Dai, so that one can give it to the liquidation system, so that one can use the collateral to source Dai on the market to return to the flash lending module.  This circuit has more steps than we\u2019ve already envisioned for LIQ-2.0.  We are planning on simply flash lending the collateral with an expectation of Dai returned at the end of the transaction.  This is a simpler circuit requiring much less gas. This doesn\u2019t take away from any of the other points you\u2019ve made, and technically what you\u2019ve written is correct; we are just envisioning a more efficient mechanism in LIQ-2.0 that would make this one feature of a Dai flash lending module superfluous for liquidations.

Exploits requiring a large amount of capital will be found quicker which makes the DeFi space safer overall. Fees provide an income source for the protocol.    This is quite thought provoking. Since MakerDAO is the primary credit generation facility of DeFi, it has the privilege to mint Dai, which is already deeply integrated as collateral types and shares of Liquidity Pools, as opposed to the recently introduced Flash-Mintable-Tokens (FMTs). A Dai Flash Mint Module would stress-test all DeFi protocols, not just those touching Dai. Since Dai can be used as collateral on secondary lending protocols (i.e. Compound, Aave, etc), one could practically borrow all forms of collateral with an arbitrarily large amount of Flash Minted Dai (e.g. 10T). Therefore, even projects without Dai support wouldn\u2019t be gated from the influence of a Flash Mint. Moreover, this acts as a second-order flash loan (in the borrowed asset), leading to improved market efficiencies beyond Dai. I agree with @LongForWisdom that we should enforce limits in the short-medium term, as it will allow projects to react with protocol improvements and defend against attacks needing limitless capital. But regardless of the guardrails, I agree with this MIP and think it\u2019ll carry many long-term benefits to DeFi (and Maker) that are simply not found in Traditional Finance. As @montyly advised, if this comes to fruition, I\u2019ll help to carry out two deliverables:  Notify and help mitigate any impact to other large DeFi protocols (think Compound, dydx, etc) Write a concise and coherent integration guide, improving the developer experience  ",

I think DYDX has 0% fee and Aave is 0.09%. Wondering what if any revenue this instrument can bring to Maker. Another questions\u2013as far as innovation\u2013will it be user friendly?

All the other services require lenders on the other side locking up their collateral whereas we have no such constraint. There is a price point at which the cost of capital allows us to dominate the flash loan/mint arbitrage market. It\u2019s not clear yet what this price point is, but we can play around with it. With regards to being user friendly, there doesn\u2019t really need to be a GUI because flash mints require custom code anyways. ",
