In addition to our weekly Office Hours, we\u2019ll be providing bi-weekly updates on our progress both in the Forum and on the G&R call. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to since our Core Unit got voted in:   Contributed to the production of Maker Relay Ep 43 and Maker Relay Ep 44 in collaboration with GovComms.   Met with a CPA, began the incorporation process, and started onboarding with Opolis.   Created a Transparency Dashboard on our Notion page, which will soon be available at content.makerdao.network.   Outlined our Content Strategy and OKRs; we welcome feedback from the community!   Met with SES to coordinate on managing and updating the Community Portal.    A tl;dr on Content Strategy & OKRs In the short-term, we plan to focus on understanding and building stakeholder journeys to support lead generation for audiences the Growth team is concerned with and help other stakeholders (MKR holders, Vault owners, etc.) find what they need. Part of this focus will include hosting two bi-weekly webinars:   \u201cWhat the World is Doing with Dai\u201d will continue the great work @DavidUtrobin\u2019s done on the community call by giving projects integrated with Dai and the Maker Protocol a platform to talk about what they\u2019re doing and help those who may be interested in building integrations understand what\u2019s possible and what the process looks like from both a technical and operational/governance perspective.   \u201cAsk MakerDAO\u201d will be a series that gives the experts of MakerDAO a platform to share their work and answer questions from stakeholders about how MakerDAO works and what it takes to maintain the Maker Protocol.   If you\u2019re interested in participating in either of these, please reach out to Jerry on rocket chat at @Jerry.G or DM @JerryAG. Our long-term goal will be to build MakerDAO\u2019s brand because, as we explain in the document, \u201cbuilding trust in our brand builds a competitive advantage over other stablecoin providers: customer loyalty.\u201d  Looking Ahead In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be:  Working to finalize our incorporation and set up payroll and accounting. Working with SES to start reorganizing the content on community.makerdao.com. Beginning the hiring process for design, writing, and video production.  Thanks for reading! @seth @JerryAG ",
