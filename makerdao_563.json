                    "content": " GovComms Biweekly Update: Special New Year Edition, Jan 03 - 14 Jan 03 - Jan 14, 2022  Looking Back: Late Q3 - Q4 2021 Our team officially started as MakerDAO\u2019s Governance Communications Core Unit on August 02nd, 2021. We hit the ground running to fulfill our mandate\u2019s outlined projects and associated goals with two full-time individuals and a small team of part-time contributors. Our primary goal was to create a better experience for stakeholders in and around MakerDAO. As we look back at our starting months, it\u2019s exciting to see how much progress and impact we\u2019ve made towards that goal. We have a lot more work to do, and in the meantime, it\u2019s essential to document and share our journey, progress, and forecast. Our initial challenges included setting up the Core Unit itself, hiring a third full-time team member, and completing our initial roadmap, as shown below. We\u2019ve succeeded in everything we set out to do, except for updating our mandate for the next few quarters. We will be submitting a refreshed team mandate to RFC by the end of January 2022.  chrome_qQe7qij5PR1237\u00d7601 87.6 KB  As expected, our mandate has evolved due to MakerDAO\u2019s needs and our own experience working to develop our projects. The changes are as follows:  Additional Stakeholder Content. New Initiatives Tracking Project. New Stakeholder Alignment and Coordination Project. A split of the original public calendar into two. Development of a bi-annual Information Output Audit to track Core Unit communication standards. And many other detailed changes within many of our existing projects.   image1084\u00d7562 58.3 KB   chrome_PEif8o8Qjf1155\u00d7651 81.2 KB  Looking back, our project categorizations of \u201cResources & Services\u201d made little sense, so moving ahead, we are trying out a new way of describing our project buckets. Our team focuses on two types of projects; Stakeholder Content and Stakeholder Coordination. Both of these focuses improve the experience of our stakeholders and the efficiency of our business activities. Some challenges we faced in these early months included:  Preventing a gap in services by arranging a grant to the Interim DAO Operating Budget Multisig to continue funding contributors on the summaries team and the Maker Relay team for the months of June and July while GovComms formed and proposed its mandate. We thank the Maker Foundation for granting us these funds and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit for facilitating the payments to our contributors. Not being compensated for two months during the administrative setup of the Core Unit. Not everyone could go through that. I personally want to thank @Artem_Gordon for his patience and understanding during that quirky phase. Hiring the right person for a given role is challenging. We thank the Talent CU, which is still in the incubation phase at SES, for helping us source a part of our candidates. We interviewed 13 people before finally hiring @thomas.flitter. Setting up the process for accounting and reporting is difficult in the absence of similar past experiences. We thank MKR voters and other DAO stakeholders for being patient with us as we developed a workflow for auditing and publishing this essential data.  Some lessons we learned:  Core Units each have their strengths and weaknesses in communications, and COM-001 is not the strongest! Lessons can be learned and best practices adopted from others besides ourselves. Our Stakeholder Database needs to be GDPR compliant to establish a high standard for protecting stakeholder information. We hired TechGDPR Law Firm to work on this with us. In a decentralized organization, we are all responsible for leading by example. When a culture of \u201cif they are not doing it, we won\u2019t\u201d flourishes, all stakeholders are usually worse-off. Proactive cross-team coordination is essential in a headless organization. Proactive feedback generation is essential. Good feedback usually doesn\u2019t appear out of thin air, and when it does it\u2019s either an unusually helpful person or a response to some issue that hurt or bothered someone. We must be proactive, reach out, and follow up\u2014it\u2019s on us to gather the information we need to improve our offerings.   Looking Ahead: Q1-Q2 2022  Team Goals Team goals for 2022 include producing redundancy for the Facilitator role by cross-training team members to perform certain tasks, writing more thought pieces, improving our utilization of the shared project tracker, having a sharper focus on identifying our individual strengths and weaknesses, expanding our knowledge of MakerDAO, improving the structure of our public Google drive, and improving the quality of our project documentation and goal setting.  Roadmap Focus Q1 is mainly focused on progressing several key projects;  Completion of the Emergency Playbook. Achieving GDPR compliance for the Stakeholder Database. Downloadable PDF Availability across all of our publications. Working through MakerDAO\u2019s initiatives and associated coordination needs.   Stakeholder Content Stakeholder Content is a key focus of our team. We continue to improve the quality and consistency of the publications we produce. We also credit the Content Production team, MKT-001, who has been an excellent partner in producing some of this content, mainly the Weekly Relay and the Governance Reviews. Check out our Stakeholder Content Roadmap for Q1 2022 for publication-specific objectives. Credit to @Artem_Gordon, our Content Lead.  Content Metrics Shortly after the ratification of COM-001, we began tracking social media and Forum metrics for our stakeholder content publications. These metrics have been visualized to show how our publications have performed from July to December 2021. Metrics are available here, in our Google Drive, containing visual representations and footnotes detailing insights. Monitoring metrics will continue throughout 2022 with improvements based on analysis and personal experience with previous metrics results. It\u2019s important to note that our barometer for success is not the view count but the quality and consistency of the publications, which we attempt to measure through this metrics analysis.  Weekly Relay Q1 of 2022 began with considerable changes to Maker Relay:  It\u2019s now called the Weekly Relay to better describe the publication through its title. State of Dai has been separated from the Weekly Relay and is now a separate publication. This will reduce noise for the Weekly Relay and allow the publications to scale by having a better separation of concerns. We will be setting up email subscriptions for automatic updates and notifications when the Weekly Relay and State of Dai are published.  Maker Relay: Purpose, Vision, and Goals + OKRs  Forum at a Glance Forum at a Glance has shown to be useful for many readers. As a result of our feedback surveys, we have implemented several improvements;  Announcements and discussions contain improved and more comprehensive summaries. We redesigned the title banners. We made several format improvements. A PDF version is now available for enhanced readability and ease of use (especially on mobile.)  Forum at a Glance: Purpose, Vision, and Goals + OKRs  Monthly & Annual Governance Review We have a few minor improvements on the calendar for the Governance Review, which will include:  Making PDF documents available for improved readability and ease of use (especially on mobile.) Improving publication distribution through social media posts.  Maker Governance Review: Purpose, Vision, and Goals + OKRs  Monthly Core Unit Updates This is a brand new initiative that is currently going through refinements to become a publication that provides all of the previous month\u2019s Core Units and non-Core Unit team updates in an easy-to-use format both on Forums and through a downloadable PDF version. There will be many continuous improvements to the MCUU throughout Q1, which include:  Complete revamp of the Forum format; Future issues will contain only quick links in the Forum post to help reduce clutter and provide the option to view both short and long versions. Making PDF downloadable version available for improved readability and ease of use (especially on mobile.) Implementing metrics tracking and a feedback survey.  All Teams Update/ Monthly Core Units Update: Purpose, Vision, and Goals + OKRs  Stakeholder Coordination Another key focus is Stakeholder Coordination. Proactive coordination efforts are necessary for MakerDAO\u2019s success. Without such an effort, teams become siloed, work is fragmented and unorganized, gaps in responsibilities result in delayed timelines, communication about initiatives and their progress is degraded, and overall accountability is lower. We have a lot to gain by focusing on this aspect of decentralized operations. Credit to @thomas.flitter, our Engagement Lead, and @Davidutro, the Facilitator.  Initiatives Tracking We\u2019ve begun developing an Initatives, Leads, & Coordination Calls Tracker to align all the different teams and to provide stakeholders with a view into the overall work items at Maker.  Stakeholder Alignment Calls In combination with the tracker, we are also setting up a framework for Stakeholder Coordination Calls in partnership with Wouter from the SES team. These calls are non-public but publicly visible on the Calls Calendar. Relevant stakeholders are proactively invited to the calls, while uninvited stakeholders could request to join the meeting if they see it on the calendar and think it\u2019s appropriate for them to join. The listed call coordinator controls access to a given call, found in the call\u2019s calendar event description and the Tracker. Feel free to dig around this section of our public google drive to explore the work done so far.  Public Calendars We will continue managing the two public calendars and their access permissions. We have no planned improvements to the calendars themselves but will be reviewing and updating their documentation in an upcoming sprint along with the documentation for all of our projects. Feedback and suggestions are welcome. Calls Calendar | Overview Votes & Important Dates Calendar | Overview  Stakeholder Database A big shift in this initiative happened shortly after our team was ratified. We initially wanted to be a lot quicker to produce this database and a public data-minimized version of it. In the interest of protecting personal information and operating through the best possible global standard we are working with a specialized law firm to ensure our management of this database is GDPR compliant.  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU.  Principles of GDPR  Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency Purpose limitation Data minimization Accuracy Storage limitation Integrity and confidentiality Accountability  Stakeholder Database Overview  Issue Discussion Calls Moving forward in Q1 2022 and beyond,  we are targeting one Issue Discussion call per month. This cadence prioritizes quality over quantity and honors the reality of call fatigue at MakerDAO. We hope to strike a comfortable balance by selecting one key issue every month, producing excellent prepared resources, and proactively ensuring the attendance of relevant stakeholders. Before each of these calls, the host, @thomas.flitter, prepares a research document outlining the issue, associated sentiments, disagreements, questions, and stakeholders. These calls aim to sync everyone up on a given topic by providing a fair synopsis and discussion of critical points. Issue Discussion Call Series Overview  Emergency Playbook The Emergency Playbook\u2019s purpose is to document MakerDAO\u2019s entire emergency management process, known emergency types, assigned coordinators, subject matter experts, and more. We are targeting a completed first version by the end of Q1 2022. We are coordinating with the new ImmuniFi Security Core Unit and multiple other CUs to produce this playbook. Emergency Playbook Overview The draft Emergency Playbook itself is a restricted document and will not be shared publicly at this stage.  Press Relations Support Our objective for 2022 is to set up an official [email\u00a0protected] email, pending the availability of that domain email service. If there is reason to believe that we will never gain access to such an email, our team will pursue setting up an independent team domain and email server. For the past few months, we have been piggy-backing on Content Production\u2019s email server with @makerdao.world emails for our work emails. In the meantime, we will continue to support members of the press by managing the forum\u2019s Media Inquiries section & Media Group membership. While also taking direct requests from press members that we know of and have relationships with. Press Relations Project Overview  Communication Platform Stewardship Our objective for Q1 2022 is to find an additional moderator for MakerDAO\u2019s subreddit and to improve the role documentation. Our current moderator intends to contribute in other ways and needs to find and train an adequate replacement.

                    "content": "    Davidutro:  Not being compensated for two months during the administrative setup of the Core Unit.   For sure\u2013this is a major challenge. I think this is something that a lot of DAO community members go through not just in Maker (there\u2019s a good tweet by Jason Choi on why its wrong for DAOs to incentivize Degens for liquidity mining without hesitation, but don\u2019t care to align proper incentivize programs for their DAO governance contributors & participants). And I think at this stage, a lot of DAO contributors throughout Crypto are building their reputation in the ecosystem, and they don\u2019t want to look greedy so many don\u2019t demand compensation, or are not compensated properly. But, on the-other-side of the spectrum you have Gov Token owners that have no experience in how to value a workforce (they have never done payroll), along with dedicated token owners who don\u2019t want to feel like their protocol is being taken advantage of. The truth is DAOs are going to view as stingy and unprofessional if we don\u2019t get things right. There\u2019s a lot of work left to be done with regards to that, for sure.     Davidutro:  Weekly Relay   Thank you for providing a visual of the CUs OKRs. With regards to Weekly Relay OKR 1 \u2013 it states: Objective: Provide greater accessibility and awareness of the MR toward non-forum users. How is GovComms thinking about attracting more \u201cGovernance Mining\u201d participants \u2013 is there anything else you\u2019re thinking about with regards to attracting more human capital to participate in Governance? Not an easy problem to solve but wondering what your team\u2019s thoughts are on such. Thank you in advanced! ",

                    "content": "Hey, @MadShills. Thanks for the thorough feedback. I wish more people like you and @flipflopflapdelegate help provide their thoughts on our stakeholder content publications. I will try to answer your inquiries to the best ability.  I am worried we are spending a lot of time providing content that is just summaries nobody is really using, and engagement is trending downward   Yes, these metrics weren\u2019t as much of a surprise as they were an eye-opener once I could visualize the bigger picture. I\u2019ve had concerns regarding the lack of engagement and began to question whether enough people even utilize these resources we are trying to provide.  Is there any plan to eliminate or restructure the current offerings and look at the actual content pieces you are working on\u2026relays, etc.  We haven\u2019t discussed eliminating any publications, but restructuring is potentially on the table. However, it\u2019s so difficult to really measure whether Weekly Relay, Forum at a Glance, and others are being utilized because Forum views do show that a significant amount of people at least open the post. I wish Discord offered a metric such as total or average view time. However, it\u2019s not unusual that these publications often have 0 comments because they are not discussion topics. On that note, I have been thinking about methods to promote discussion-like engagement into these posts but not for the sole purpose of improving metrics\u2014It has to be functional for readers and stakeholders.  it would help you to (even if just internally) figure out if your spend is justified based on the engagement and value you are seeing.  Thank you for bringing this up. I will crunch a few numbers and get back to you on this.  On the G&R calls we have approximately 50 people, if the average value of their time is 100 dollars an hour, are we getting ~7500 dollars of value out of each call?  I believe that the cost estimate is exaggerated. There are people on the call who make less, and some are either Delegates or part-time contributors. I would probably cut that down by at least 30% (but don\u2019t quote me on that!)  Nonetheless, G&R calls underwent significant improvements during Q3-Q4 by transitioning to a more discussion-focused agenda, and we even cut down the time spent on votes and polls, MIPs, and Forum review. There will be continued improvements to the G&R call, and if you have any ideas, please, let us know   Who is the target market for each publication?  MKR stakeholders, Dai users, and DAO community members are our target audience. Publications such as State of Dai are more relevant to Dai users. Weekly Relay and Forum at a Glance are more relevant to MKR stakeholders and community members. Monthly Governance Review is much more technical than the other publications and is more relevant to voters and MKR stakeholders. Nonetheless, I believe I should reanalyze the target audience for all our publications.  There were no listed metrics for the core unit update posts  The Monthly Core Unit Update is a brand new publication no more than 2-months old. Our next stakeholder content publication metrics report will contain it.  Are we able to record average read time for these posts?  It\u2019s possible with the help of TechOps. I will require admin access to the Maker Discourse account and integrate Google Analytics.  For example, \u201cResponding to feedback on the results of objective.\u201d I cannot make sense of this  I would call this a lack on my part in being unable to predict how people will respond to changes to these publications. The simple strategy is to implement a change to a publication, receive feedback from readers, and then act on that feedback. This roadmap is not immutable and is likely to include new objectives in response to feedback such as yours, for example.  maybe even try anonymous surveys after a month where you can better receive feedback from your stakeholders honestly.  All of the publications contain anonymous feedback surveys at the bottom. So far, I have gotten a total of 3 surveys completed  As you mentioned, \u201cSourcing a survey across the various CU and community would definitely get you going on where to best put your resources and time.\u201d This is likely to be the next best approach to help receive more feedback for each publication. Finally, and I wanted to save this for last, but I believe e-mail subscriptions as a service is the best approach towards getting better metrics (e.g., average read time) along with decluttering the Forums with recurring posts and publications. Thanks for the feedback! Feel free to message me if you wish to further discuss anything I have mentioned. ",

How is GovComms thinking about attracting more \u201cGovernance Mining\u201d participants \u2013 is there anything else you\u2019re thinking about with regards to attracting more human capital to participate in Governance? Not an easy problem to solve but wondering what your team\u2019s thoughts are on such.   In my surface view the problem with many Governance Mining participants is that they are not concerned with the actual protocols they mine. They are transient participants jumping from opportunity to opportunity with a low level of \u201cstickiness.\u201d We should be looking to attract this crowd(and others) in productive and sticky ways. That will only happen as a result of a very clever tokenomic redesign linked with governance participation and perhaps promotion of the redesign through various channels, including the Weekly Relay. The WR itself, and other stakeholder publications, are primarily tuned to help the existing participants rather than to attract newcomers. Although our assumption(that we are testing) is that a high-quality set of stakeholder publications will better attract any would-be stakeholders to work with us, whether by becoming a partner, user, or contributor since they make finding information and following along that much easier. This assumption being more of a secondary benefit. We are placing email subscriptions & PDFs for these publications as a Q1-Q2 2022 goal to be more user-friendly for traditional crowds outside of our forums in an effort to attract their business and participation. Another challenge with the content projects is exactly what @MadShills points out:     MadShills:  figure out if your spend is justified based on the engagement and value you are seeing.   Is this the right mental model to use for a non-marketing publication? Our goal is not engagement, it\u2019s accuracy and availability. We knew coming in that these publications are specialized for a small crowd and that engagement would largely be a function of the growth of Maker itself. Likes are an imperfect metric since most people use these publications as needed, as a reference, and for specific sections. It\u2019s acceptable that people don\u2019t read to the bottom, since they are optimizing their own time for their own information needs. As Artem mentioned, we are working on getting something like average reading time but it is not currently available. This is another reason we are pushing for a parallel email subscription service and the PDFs\u2013those two channels will give us more data on readership and interest in combination with the subjective and unreliable metric of forum likes and slightly better metric of forum views.     MadShills:  I am worried we are spending a lot of time providing content that are just summaries nobody is really using and engagement is trending downward  .   There is more utility to what we produce that can\u2019t be measured by short-term engagement metrics. Summaries, reports, reviews, etc all serve as a historic track record of MakerDAO. They are a retroactively valuable resource. Additionally, we have had confirmation from several folks that they are used and have utility. It\u2019s not a huge expense to create this stuff and it serves a long-lasting benefit even though the crowd for this stuff is small.     MadShills:  Is there any consideration about revamping your strategy with the forum posts, calls, etc? It seems the last few gov calls have been a bit underwhelming (except when we host CUs). We spend a lot of time reviewing forum post content on calls and that time could likely be better directed. On the G&R calls we have approximately 50 people, if the average value of their time is 100 dollars an hour, are we getting ~7500 dollars of value out of each call?   This is a great piece of feedback. We are always thinking about how to make the GnR more valuable for participants. We essentially revamped it in Q4 to be  Current Events Discussions  Moving forward, with the stakeholder coordination and initiative tracking stuff providing a huge help, we are moving towards  current events initiative roadmap updates discussions/presentations  Forum at a glance is an essential piece of current events. Many folks have complained that they miss forum threads despite being very active viewers of the forum. Doing a 5-minute run-through of the forum at a glance thread can surface important discussions, signal threads, and reports that GnR participants could have missed. I personally think it\u2019s worth the time value given that the average time of this segment is 5 minutes or less.     MadShills:  Instead of just rehashing forum posts in different forum posts and reading those forum posts on calls, we could maybe find a better use of your time and potentially a better fit for your audience?   Do you have a suggestion? You are one of our audience members afterall. What would you like to see in its place if we were to remove it? And like I said above, is it really a poor use of time? I am pushing back on that opinion because I disagree.     MadShills:  For example, do people who read the forums really want maker forum posts sent to their inbox? Probably safe to assume not since the trend is that people are liking and commenting these forum posts less. If people do not find them useful they are not going to use them.   We believe there are groups of people who do want this as an alternative to checking the forum. Also, it\u2019s an additional channel that can cater to a new type of crowd\u2013the traditional investor who is getting into crypto companies. And again, we don\u2019t think likes and comments are very indicative of the utility of these publications. Think about it this way\u2013how would your experience at MakerDAO be without these publications and summaries?     flipflopflapdelegate:  The truth is DAOs are going to view as stingy and unprofessional if we don\u2019t get things right. There\u2019s a lot of work left to be done with regards to that, for sure.   I am grateful that some people are mindful of this perception. In our view, DAO governors should be willing to approve growth spending while also balancing the need for accountability and quality assurance. Maker is in a decent spot with regards to this. Our team has had no issue getting out budget needs met. Granted, we are very focused on running lean and efficiently\u2013our budget/impact ratio is quite high. We\u2019ve also had no issues with regard to answering accountability requests. We are happy to talk to stakeholders about each of our projects and goals, in fact, the feedback is very welcome. Thank you for the responses you two (ElPro & MadShills)! If there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like a reply to lmk, I kind of just selectively responded to the key things I saw. Might have missed something, just let me know. ",

And like I said above, is it really a poor use of time? I am pushing back on that opinion because I disagree.   I am simply using the metrics and data you gathered from your presentation to draw this conclusion. If these are not the right metrics to measure what you hoping to achieve, what are? Feedback: Less host talking, regardless of who the host is unless there is a focused presentation. Vary the hosts in the spirit of decentralization. Less open ended discussion on the fly \u2013 e.g. sourcing agenda items from the delegates recently was not the most productive use of time. If there are to be more abstract calls,  a smaller audience than 50+ is likely best. The content seems to be focused on light makerdao users whereas most of the attendees to the calls are CU members or people deep into Maker. The GnR calls seems recently to rehash forum posts or feel like an AMA or the issue discussions. Issue discussions end up being panel discussions which are not particularly helpful if trying to move towards an objective.     Artem_Gordon:  I believe that the cost estimate is exaggerated. There are people on the call who make less, and some are either Delegates or part-time contributors. I would probably cut that down by at least 30% (but don\u2019t quote me on that!) Nonetheless, G&R calls underwent significant improvements during Q3-Q4 by transitioning to a more discussion-focused agenda, and we even cut down the time spent on votes and polls, MIPs, and Forum review. There will be continued improvements to the G&R call, and if you have any ideas, please, let us know   I believe based on the attendees and Dai and MKR comp this is actually accurate or below the true value; e.g. consider PE comp, etc. Regardless, calls and meetings takes resources and time away from other work, if you think about both the time lost and the work not gained, these are expensive: a lot can get done in 90 minutes.     Artem_Gordon:  Yes, these metrics weren\u2019t as much of a surprise as they were an eye-opener once I could visualize the bigger picture. I\u2019ve had concerns regarding the lack of engagement and began to question whether enough people even utilize these resources we are trying to provide.   I appreciate this Artem, there is some real concern . The issue David mentioned, if these are not the right metrics to measure, which ones are? We are unable to engage in scientific governance without real data. I am still a bit unclear about how vital governance communications is and why it is separate from Gov Alpha, it really makes no sense because they should both be objective, neutral, have compatible strategies and coordinate activities in lock step. Governance communications falls out from governance alpha. How are you coordinating event hosting and objectives, etc with gov alpha? What is the rationale here @LongForWisdom? As a DAO, we want to avoid issues like content production, who unfortunately have not suggested any remedy or how they would change their behavior and communication, nor produce any demonstrable KPIs if they are retained. Concerns about their performance, strategy, and utility of their spend have been raised since August. Your pro-activity in evaluating your spend and results here is really beneficial for everybody, especially yourselves.     Artem_Gordon:  All of the publications contain anonymous feedback surveys at the bottom. So far, I have gotten a total of 3 surveys completed  As you mentioned, \u201cSourcing a survey across the various CU and community would definitely get you going on where to best put your resources and time.\u201d This is likely to be the next best approach to help receive more feedback for each publication.   This is concerning because it means people are either A) not reading to the bottom or B) do not care enough to provide a reply. Both are not good. It would be a solid idea to make a truly anonymous survey and solicit feedback proactively around the utility, focus, etc on the various calls and written documents. I think you may be surprised either positively or negatively. This would give you data about where to trim resources and where to put more. It would also give you some qualitative data to either support your claims or refute them, either is good because leads towards continuous improvement and shows your good faith and objectivity. ",

Governance communications falls out from governance alpha. How are you coordinating event hosting and objectives, etc with gov alpha? What is the rationale here @LongForWisdom?   We have a close working relationship with GovAlpha and maintain the same principles about being objective & neutral. We work together to facilitate the GnR, in lockstep. We have a shared document that examines the GnR, its purpose, ways to optimize it, etc. Granted, we haven\u2019t revisited the document since mid-September 2021. We will prioritize this as we revisit this subject together. Our Core Units are separate because the scope of work is sufficiently different and large. Decentralizing here was important.     MadShills:  This is concerning because it means people are either A) not reading to the bottom or B) do not care enough to provide a reply.   It\u2019s probably both. Also important to consider is that there is a torrent of information on the forums. Filling out a feedback survey requires attention, and that\u2019s spread thin at Maker. Hence one of the key lessons we learned:     Davidutro:  Proactive feedback generation is essential. Good feedback usually doesn\u2019t appear out of thin air, and when it does it\u2019s either an unusually helpful person or a response to some issue that hurt or bothered someone. We must be proactive, reach out, and follow up\u2014it\u2019s on us to gather the information we need to improve our offerings.       MadShills:  I am still a bit unclear about how vital governance communications is   Consider the various projects we listed above and their utility. Our work is quite vital. Proving each project\u2019s vitality is another question, and we are working on that, especially concerning the metrics and content challenge. ",

One of the reasons I enjoy these calls is because such a wide range of individuals attend from across the DAO. It really adds to the depth of discussion when, for example, PE, Growth, and Oracles can all contribute to discussions there and then, rather than waiting for a forum post several days later. I certainly don\u2019t think there is anything else in the calendar that has a group of attendees with this breadth of knowledge available for discussion. While difficult to quantify the benefit of this, I suspect a great deal of value to the DAO would be lost if attendance was discouraged. ",

The conversation was more about how we can further improve the format of the call to be valuable to those who do attend. I agree with you on everything you said. My favorite calls are when there are more diverse conversations and prepared presentations from other groups. One thing we will be building into the GnR call starting next week or so is Initiative Updates. Originally the GnR call grew to include Core Unit updates, but this quickly showed itself to be impossible to scale in that call. Hence why we recommended everyone move to written updates in favor of prioritizing current events and discussion topics. Since then, we\u2019ve received a handful of comments that people are really lacking in their ability to follow along with specific initiative roadmaps and progress at MakerDAO. We are working with Initiative Leads to create such updates to be shared on the call. I think this will be a very nice value add considering the wide breadth of stakeholders who attend. ",
