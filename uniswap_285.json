                    "content": "Hey there folks! First off, I\u2019d like to say a big THANK YOU to Hayden Adams and the Uniswap core devs for seriously making financial history. Uniswap is an amazing step towards decentralization of core financial services, and I can\u2019t wait to see where it is in a few years! (Finance student here ) Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here had any thoughts relating to impermanent loss. Should Uniswap governance work towards mitigating impermanent loss through means like oracles (Bancor V2 I believe) or another creative solution? Let\u2019s have a discussion! P.S. I\u2019m not actually that well versed in how smart contracts work, including technical limitations of running on chain. If this isn\u2019t possible, let me know! ",

Interested to hear what other community members have to say! This is a lot more nuanced. I\u2019m retracting this statement, impermanent loss happens on both sides, but it isn\u2019t the only factor in the equation. ",

Anyone that added liquidity early on to ETH-UNI, or really any UNI pool is just losing UNI as the price rises so fast in relation to the other in the pair at this point.  I want to keep my UNI!  Maybe add liquidity one day, if the price (somewhat) stabilizes, or, maybe if rewards are offered in an ETH-UNI pool.  But even that\u2019s still a maybe. I\u2019d rather just hold the UNI, and be able to vote, and other things. What exactly are the creative solutions, with oracles, or others? ",
