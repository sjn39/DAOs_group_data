                    "content": "Hi all. Has anyone looked into options for growing Dai usage by having MakerDAO own and operate L2 platforms? While I disagree with under collateralized stablecoins, Luna\u2019s growth clearly has a lot to do with it\u2019s application ecosystem that it launched with. A native chain with applications and savings is a clear demand driver that actualizes growth of UST. MakerDAO and Dai seem to be in an interesting position given it\u2019s positive revenue. Below are a few options I think MakerDAO should consider:   MakerDAO could directly partner or merge with Gnosis, and probably significantly discount or pay for transaction fees for some time. Direct ownership of an L2 with free transactions could significantly drive growth. This is optimal as Dai is the base layer transaction token.   MakerDAO could partner with StarkWare and create a brand new StarkNet L2 where fees are free and the base layer transaction token is Dai. This seems interesting from a growth perspective, but doesn\u2019t tap into the EVM for growth.   MakerDAO could partner with ZK-Sync and possibly run a forked ZK-Rollup for transactions only. Their old alpha version of ZK-Rollups without any smart contract features could easily boost DAI usage. A small roadmap for this would be refactoring the Dai Wallet to link to this ZK-Rollup, translating the app into a variety of targeted languages like Korean, Spanish, Chinese, etc, and marketing it as a small payment wallet. The general cost of the rollup itself could be quite cheap and MakerDAO could likely fund all of it\u2019s use. This seems like the cheapest and easiest option at the moment.   Does anyone have comments or criticisms on this? ",
