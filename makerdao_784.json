This entails minor changes to a previously accepted MIP that reflect the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit rather than any substantial change to MIP62\u2014consequently, it is appropriate for an amendment under MIP4c3.  Amended Components  MIP62c2  The following text will be removed from MIP62c2:  \"Content Production (MKT-001) publishes the associated notices to:  Official MakerDAO Blogs Owned MakerDAO Twitter Accounts\"    MIP62c3  MIP62c3 currently states:  \u201cNew communication channels and media assets may be added to those listed under MIP62c2 without the requirement for governance vote by a joint public statement on the MakerDAO Forum to that effect by any two Core Unit facilitators, or by public statement on the MakerDAO Forum by a facilitator of GovComms (COM-001) or Content Production (MKT-001).\u201d  This proposal would remove the reference to Content Production with the new wording as follows:  \u201cNew communication channels and media assets may be added to those listed under MIP62c2 without the requirement for governance vote by a joint public statement on the MakerDAO Forum to that effect by any two Core Unit facilitators, or by public statement on the MakerDAO Forum by a facilitator of GovComms (COM-001).\u201d   Amendment Pull Request  PR   Amendment Signal Request Thread  Signal Request   Relevant Information  N/A   @MIP-Editors @PaperImperium ",
