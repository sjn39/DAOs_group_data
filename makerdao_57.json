Be sure to check out LongForWisdom\u2019s post for details on the Holiday Break from Governance. The November 4th Executive lowered the Fees on Peg Stability Modules PSM-USDP-A and PSM-USDC-A to 0.0%, distributed the Development and UX (DUX) Core Unit\u2019s budget, and included several parameter changes on various vault types. On November 11th, the Executive included parameter adjustments on the GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A vault and DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI (Aave Dai Direct Deposit Module or AAVE D3M), increased the debt ceiling on WSTETH-A from 5 to 50 million Dai and returned unused Dai from the GovAlpha Core Unit budget to the Surplus Buffer. November 18th, the Executive onboarded WBTC-B as a new vault type, increased the Stability Fee on WBTC-A, increased the Local Liquidation Limits on ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A, included a change of the covenant for P1-DROP (People\u2019s Company Series 1), and steps to offboard several different vault types. Offboarded vaults include BAL-A, COMP-A, AAVE-A, LRC-A, BAT-A, ZRX-A, and UNIV2LINKETH-A. Additionally, a signal request has been posted to offboard MATIC. Most recently, the November 25th Executive onboarded WBTC-C and the GUSD (Gemini USD) Peg Stability Module (PSM), increased the Surplus Buffer to 90 million Dai, increased the Debt Ceiling on the Aave Dai Direct Deposit Module from 50 to 100 million Dai, and released funds for several Core Unit budgets. As we mentioned, three new Core Units have been voted into the DAO, bringing the total number of Core Units up to nineteen. Congrats to the new Core Units; you can find them listed with the Ratification Polls below.

What\u2019s Ahead?  3122\u00d71745 366 KB  As per MIP51c4: Calendar Exceptions, there will be no Monthly Governance Cycle in December, i.e., no Formal Submission Window and no Ratification Polls. Check out the Governance schedule for December and January. Standard coverage is set to resume on January 10th. Provided there is enough content to warrant one, the last Executive vote of the year will begin on December 10th, with the last Governance and Risk call falling on the 16th. Outside of this Executive, no polls are currently scheduled for the tail-end of the governance cycle. ACREinvest has just announced themselves as a Recognized Delegate. They will present their delegate platform at the Meet Your Delegate call on December 7th. We now have a total of 9 Recognized Delegates and 10 Shadow Delegates. Governance Communications will soon publish the first monthly Core Unit Updates Review; A \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 to catch up on all Core Unit updates for the month. Next month\u2019s Maker Governance Review will be an Annual Governance Review, covering the entire year of 2021. That said, be on the lookout for LexMaker #2 - System of a DAO: A Legal Framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, hosted by Miles Jennings of a16z, and David Kerr from Cowrie LLC. The two are set to dissect their published analysis on legal frameworks for DAOs. The call is scheduled for December 15th at 4:00 PM UTC. Happy Holidays!

The passage of the final Executive of September on October 2nd kicked off the offboarding of several collateral types with USDT and also included Core Unit budget distributions for the month. The following October 7th Executive ramped up offboarding by finalizing the shutdown of BAT-A, LRC-A, ZRX-A, UNIV2AAVEETH-A, and UNIV2LINKETH-A. This Executive also included more funds for Core Units. The October 21st Executive onboarded staked ETH (wstETH) as a collateral type and included several parameter changes detailed below in \u201cParameter Changes & Vault Upgrades.\u201d And last but certainly not least, the October 28th Executive included the onboarding of the Aave Direct Deposit Module (D3M), along with budget streaming to the Growth Core Unit as well as the newly onboarded Data Insights Core Unit. It has also been a huge month for many of the projects MakerDAO has been working on:   G-UNIV3-DAI-USDC1-A (G-UNI) hit its debt ceiling twice after going live in September; first at its initial debt ceiling of $10m and again only two days after its increase to $50m. The Dai Direct Deposit Module (D3M) launched and is off to a hot start, also reaching its initial debt ceiling in less than 48 hours.  Wrapped Staked Ether (WstETH) also saw an explosive launch, scraping up against its initial debt ceiling of $10mil in just over a day.  Vote delegation also saw significant shifts after the former Recognized Delegate, Planet_X, announced an indefinite sabbatical from the DAO. A snapshot of the current Governance landscape can be found in the \u201cKey Outcomes\u201d section below.  Key Outcomes After the redistribution of the MKR delegated to Planet_X, the current governance landscape is as follows:     Delegate MKR allocated Proportion     Flip Flap Flop LLC 23,903.23 45.31%   Feedback Loops LLC 10,102.26 19.15%   PaperImperium 8,511.07 16.13%   monetsupply 5,139.34 9.74%   MakerMan 5,061.75 9.60%   ultraschuppi 33.00 0.06%     Maker Improvement Proposals The month of October contained six ratification polls, three of which have passed:     Ratification Poll Discussion Winning Option     Modify Core Unit Budget, MKT-001 Discussion No   Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 Discussion Yes   Adding MakerLabs Core Unit (SNUNK-001) Discussion No   Adding Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001) Discussion Yes   Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) Discussion No   Implementation of DSS Charter (MIP59) Discussion Yes     Delegation  PaperImperium Supplemental Compensation PaperImperium Supplemental Compensation - October 11, 2021 This poll did not pass to support the following changes:  Transfering 50,000 DAI to recognized delegate PaperImperium as Supplemental Compensation.

Community Greenlight Polls Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. Community greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month and run for two full weeks. The month of August had four Community Greenlight polls:     Asset Date Began Date Ended Voted Yes Voted No Voted Abstain     CurveLP-stETH-ETH October 4 October 18 34,301.72 MKR (54.77%) 0.00 MKR (0.00%) 28,325.95 MKR (45.23%)   Curio Stablecoin October 18 November 1 5,343.20 MKR (7.78%) 28,616.94 Voting (41.69%) 34,679.31 MKR (50.52%)   Security Tokens Refinancing October 18 November 1 108,694.07 MKR (98.22%) 0.00 MKR (0.00%) 1,965.00 MKR (1.78%)   TM2-DROP October 18 November 1 26,184.69 MKR (53.93%) 28,616.94 MKR (41.69%) 5,343.20 MKR (7.78%)    Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead?  3035\u00d71727 423 KB  As we roll into November, there are a few things to look forward to. There are Community Greenlight Polls for MD Irradiance LLC and Olympus DAO, which are active until November 15th. The month of October contained many signal requests; some of them have not yet made it into executive voting, such as launching Nexo Institutional Vault and increasing maximum Delegate compensation to 144k Dai. They will be up for vote soon. Regarding Delegation, @ultraschuppi arrives into the ring as a Recognized Delegate. Check out Meet Your Delegate #5 with UltraSchuppi. Look out for his addition to the Monthly Delegate Round-up for November. The Clean Money initiative for MakerDAO received mixed outcomes; The Sagittarius Engine signal request did not pass. However, a sentiment poll for Clean Money did pass. For MakerDAO to continue on the best path forward, there will likely be more polls and votes within the upcoming months to help improve the next steps and objectives. Finally, there has been much discussion regarding the MIP in RFC for offboarding the current facilitator of the Real World Finance Core Unit. Solutions and next steps are being made to continue with a best-decision approach for MakerDAO and its community. Keep an eye out for future posts on this discussion.

Delegation applications and the MKR Holder\u2019s Guide to Delegation have been the talk of the month. There are already several MKR holders who have proposed themselves as Delegates, along with a number of shadow delegates. There was also much discussion and progress regarding Maker Institutional Vaults with the Growth Core Unit leading the way in discussions. In addition, there has been an expansion in calls for the Maker ecosystem; we had three Speaker Series calls along with the first Meet Your Delegate call, which are all posted on YouTube. Check them out! July contained a total of eight ratification polls. Both budget modifications for Content Production and Growth Core Units, Special Purpose Fund (MIP55), and Governance Communications Core Unit have been ratified and are now active! Unfortunately, the other four ratifications polls did not pass, which included AmaZix Marketing, Strategic Marcomms Core Units, Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, and Dispute Resolution (MIP52).

Community Greenlight Polls Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. The community greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month and running for two full weeks. The month of July had three Community Greenlight polls:     Asset Date Began Date Ended Voted Yes Voted No Voted Abstain     0xBitcoin Neutral Mineable Token July 5th July 19th 112.53 MKR (0.30%) 34,480.93 MKR (93.18%) 2,413.04 MKR (6.52%)   Untangled Finance DROP July 19th August 2nd 29,884.30 MKR (85.43%) 1,538.46 MKR (4.40%) 3,556.72 MKR (10.17%)   G-UNIv3-DAIUSDC July 19th August 2nd 35,048.96 MKR Voting (99.91%) 9.41 MKR Voting (0.03%) 22.41 MKR Voting (0.06%)    Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead?  |624x418.53012568574471380\u00d7926 106 KB  August is here, and there are some things to look out for. Delegation has been the talk of the season; expect more MKR holders to propose themselves as Delegators. There is also a brand new delegates page on the MakerDAO Governance Portal, thanks to the dUX team! August\u2019s first Executive Vote will include the addition of four Centrifuge assets; CF-DROP, HTC-DROP, FFT1-DROP, and P1-DROP, which will be added to the Maker Protocol as new RWA vault types if passed. Additionally, there are polls currently live (at time of posting) to greenlight 120dB Films, increase the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A debt ceiling, and change parameters as proposed by the MakerDAO Open Market Committee. Check out the Forums because there will be some general Forum improvements concerning tags, which should help refine posts and searches. The Protocol Engineering Team has also proposed a blueprint for Institutional Vaults. If passed, new Vault mechanisms specific to Institutional and Long-term Vaults would be implemented. Carl Vogel from the Paxos team proposed creating a PAX PSM to extend PAX as a way to diversify DAI collateral. This comes on the heels of community concern around the growth of Dai\u2019s USDC backing, which sits at 60.6% according to Daistats.com. To sweeten the deal, Paxos plans to add DAI to its platform before Q1 of 2022. Beginning Monday, August 9th at 16:00 UTC, Ratification Polls for formally submitted proposals will go live and run for two weeks until Monday, August 23rd. At the moment, it looks like there will be a couple of Core Units being proposed, as well as B.Protocol\u2019s declaration of intent to create a new vault type that\u2019s integrated with them.

Within the first months, the Maker Foundation dissolved and opened the door for the first Core Units to develop. During Q2, Maker released the long-awaited Liquidations 2.0, which significantly reduced collateral vaults\u2019 risk and price volatility. Shortly after, a new and improved Monthly Governance Cycle was formalized through MIP51, and the Flash Mint Module was activated, allowing anyone to mint as much Dai as they need. Q3 of 2021 has been a particularly significant year for governance with the release of Vote Delegation. There are now 9 Recognized and 9 Shadow Delegates in less than six months, totaling over 100,000 MKR, being delegated! If that isn\u2019t enough, coming into the end of 2021, Rune Christenson posted The Case for Clean Money, which envisions Dai being used to drive investment in clean energy sources at a global scale with the power of DeFi. This change in direction led to several polls and discussions towards the next steps to help meet this vision. As 2021 comes to a close, the DAO did not cool off; The first Core Unit originated during early 2021, but by the end of December, the year closed with a total of 15 ratified Core Units! Here\u2019s the top news from 2021:  Q1  The Maker Foundation Development Grants Program Sunsets Road to DAO: the Core Unit Operating Model [sic] The First Core Units are Onboarded Liquidations 2.0   Q2  The Maker Foundation Focuses On Its Dissolution Maker Foundation Returns 84,000 MKR to Governance Monthly Governance Cycle formalized in MIP51 Flash Mint Module Activated   Q3  RWA Onboarding from Tinlake/Centrifuge Governance Launches Vote Delegation Official DAI Token Bridge now live on Arbitrum One   Q4  AAVE D3M Onboarded USDC dependence wanes  Under 40% - Oct 25 Under 26% - Nov 17   2-Year Anniversary of the Launch of Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) Rune Christensen publishes The case for Clean Money Robert Jordan presents Beyond the Maker Foundation: Past, Present, and Future at ETH Portland (Oct 28 & 29) 9 Billion Dai total supply!

Who\u2019s ready!? Here are some things to look forward to this year:   More calls:  We now have Issue Discussion Calls, LexMaker, internal and public calls, and more! Governance Communications, Content Production, GovAlpha, and other Core Units are working together to help scale communication, discussion, updates, and project management through new calls. You can find currently available public calls here.     Q1 Core Unit budget modifications:  As the new year rolls around, it\u2019s about that time for many Core Units to begin updating their budget modifications for Q1, 2022. Keep an eye out on the forums for budget modifications here.     January\u2019s first executive:  The first Executive Vote of the year is expected to go live on Friday, January 7th, 2022.    Delegation overall improvement & compensation:  Last year contained a lot of focus and discussion around delegation, delegate compensation, and optimization. With an entire year ahead of us, there will likely be continued discussion and implementations made to improve delegation overall.    Improving Core Unit financial management:  With the number of Core Units scaling at a phenomenal rate, many concerns have been brought to light regarding MakerDAO revenue and spendings.

Each review is written to keep the Maker community informed of Governance developments.  Top Governance News April was another significant month for the Maker Protocol, seeing a number of highly anticipated MIPs get passed along with a number of important changes and additions as usual. The workforce at MakerDAO is evolving. Four more Core Units were voted in. Say hello to Content Production, Growth, MakerDAO Shop, and Protocol Engineering. Be sure to check out the Core Unit Corner to track what Core Units are in the pipeline versus which are already ratified and operating. An updated liquidation system is finally live. Liquidations 2.0 contracts were authorized in mid-April alongside activation for LINK-A Vaults. The following Executive implemented YFI-A Vaults. And the Executive after that, on April 30th, included implementation for ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, and WBTC-A Vaults. More Vaults are expected to be upgraded in the months ahead. MKR Voters beefed up security. Accompanying an increase to the Emergency Shutdown Threshold, the amount of MKR needed to initiate an Emergency Shutdown; the engineering team added some important upgrades to the ESM and END Modules. Two bugs were fixed, and the team explained the logic behind decision-making around disclosure and the fix. This was posted in parallel with the Protocol Engineering Team\u2019s Road to DeFi Safety piece. A community-led petition letter to a16z was proposed on the forums in early March and moved on-chain to a governance poll in mid-April. The poll passed, but 66% of voters abstaining. This signaled that at least some MKR voters were in favor, though most were apathetic. No official response from A16z. Real-World Assets are getting their start. New Silver Series 2 DROP was onboarded this month as the RWA002-A Vault. Not too long after that, we saw them generate 500k+ in Dai. One step in the right direction, according to the Real World Finance Core Unit, but still lots of details to be figured out.  Key Outcomes The April Governance Cycle, which began on April 5 and ended on April 30, summary of changes:  Maker Improvement Proposals The April 2021 MIPs Bundle vote passed on April 27, 2021, and was executed on April 29, 2021.

Domain Rights  MakerDAO Shop Core Unit will be granted the exclusive right to the shop.makerdao.com domain until revoked by Governance.  Visit the MIPs Tracker to learn more about MIPs and core unites in progress and view MIP statuses.  Parameter Changes & Vault Additions The April Cycle also included a number of Executive Votes that changed parameters in response to the conditions on Ethereum in addition to adding a couple of new Vaults. This included: Stability Fees  Many changes, listed here.  Surplus Buffer  The System Surplus Buffer will be increased from 30MM to 60MM over a period of 99 days, targeting 25% of incoming revenue used to burn MKR.  Emergency Shutdown Threshold  Increase from 50,000 MKR to 75,000 MKR.  Debt Ceiling Management & Optimizations  COMP-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 10 million DAI to 30 million DAI. ZRX-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 5 million DAI to 10 million DAI. YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 45 million DAI to 75 million DAI. PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling increased from 1 billion DAI to 2 billion DAI.  Auction Optimizations  LINK-A added to Liquidations 2.0 Framework. YFI-A added to Liquidations 2.0 Framework.

Vault Additions  New Silver Series 2 DROP onboarded to the Maker Protocol as RWA002-A.   Community Greenlight Polls These polls gauge community sentiment for collateral onboarding. Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. These polls run for two weeks, starting Monday on the first week and the third week of each month. April\u2019s Greenlight Polls ended on May 3rd, with the following results: Seven collateral types were considered; all of them were greenlit by the community.  bBADGER (Badger Sett Badger) MCO2 (Moss Carbon Credit)  UNI-V2-GUSD-DAI (Uniswap V2 GUSD-DAI LP Token) 1INCH (1inch Liquidity Protocol) rETH (Rocket Pool Staked ETH)  SLP-DAI-USDC (Sushiswap DAI-USDC LP Token)  UNI-V2-DAI-PAX (Uniswap V2 DAI-PAX LP Token)   Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead? May is here, and there are some things to watch out for. Formal submissions for the May cycle are wrapping up tomorrow, May 5th. Two more Core Units! Both the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit and the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit have entered into the May governance cycle. LongForWisdom and the GovAlpha team propose changes to the Monthly governance Cycle to streamline the procedure, aiming \u201cto reduce the cost of participation for governance by reducing the number of votes that take place for each monthly cycle.\u201d In addition, an amendment to clean up MIP0 is also in the pipeline for May. MIP50, the Direct Deposit Module, is also being entered into formal submission. The Direct Deposit Module interfaces with third-party lending protocols to directly supply Dai to their markets. Maker Governance is able to pick a target variable borrow rate, and the module will automatically deposit/remove liquidity to ensure that the target rate is hit. This will be yet another technical MIP which, if passed, will be added to the Protocol Engineering teams growing backlog alongside Dai Flash Mint Module, Governance Contract Upgrade, and others. Finally, MIP49, Staking Rewards, is being entered into formal submission. MIP49 covers the creation of a Staking Rewards process for MKR token holders, designed to distribute DAI as a percentage of protocol profits. MIP49 would entitle MKR holders to a share of this percentage based on the weight of their MKR staked in the Governance Contract. Should this proposal be accepted by the community, the plan would be to use @hexonaut\u2019s DssGovRewards Code to implement. The MIP also mentions its intentionality behind not setting a particular path for the distributions to allow for different implementations in the future and some flexibility around future Governance improvements.  882\u00d7757 41.9 KB   Resources Public Google Calendar Bookmark or Subscribe to this calendar for Votes and Public Calls.

                    "content": " 960\u00d7540 285 KB   Top Governance News The month of September had no executive vote delays (thanks to delegates and voters!) and contained many updates for Governance. The DUX team released an updated version of the Governance Portal that includes additional features and matches information with the MCD Voting Tracker. Additionally, the DUX and Token Flow Insights teams have worked together to help redefine and further clarify the voting algorithm rules for determining each wallet\u2019s correct MKR vote weight. We are four months into delegation, and so far, there are seven public delegates and seven shadow delegates who collectively have been delegated over 74,000 MKR. Delegate profile details are now available on the MakerDAO delegate page! Additionally, the first Maker Debate Series call took place on September 14th, which focused on delegate compensation. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit launched the long-awaited Dai Token Bridge on Arbitrum One. The bridge allows users to transfer Dai to and from the Arbitrum L2 network. Steps towards functional L2 governance controls are happening; September 24th\u2019s executive vote included a number of L2 test actions. The actions test the configuration of L2 components, including the governance relay and L2 DAI. Once it is confirmed that Governance has control over all L2 systems, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit will manually deny its deployer addresses, meaning Governance will be the only authority retaining full control of the token bridges. September\u2019s ratification polls welcome four new Core Units: Collateral Engineering Services, Development & User Experience, StarkNet Engineering, and Strategic Happiness. As MakerDAO scales and the number of Core Units continues to grow, the GovComms and GovAlpha teams presented a new format for the Governance and Risk Calls to help redefine the purpose of the call. Beginning September 9th, the calls have followed the new format focusing on deeper discussions on high-priority issues and projects. With MIP54: DssVest ratified on June 28th, the executive vote on September 3rd implemented the first DAI and MKR token streams to Core Units, detailed below. In addition, this executive vote distributed three one-time budgets to Core Units, also detailed below. Since their launch, some collateral types have shown themselves to be unprofitable. This concern was addressed and, in response, has resulted in the successful offboarding of two unprofitable collateral types; KNC-A and USDT-A. Finally, there were two community greenlight polls. Both passed, resulting in higher prioritization of the RARE (SuperRare) and RAI (Rai Reflex Index) Vault types.  Key Outcomes  Maker Improvement Proposals The month of August contained eight ratification polls, which all passed:     Ratification Poll Discussion     Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, CES-001 Discussion   Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001 Discussion   Development & UX Core Unit, DUX-001 Discussion   StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 Discussion   RWA Foundations (MIP58) Discussion   Risk Core Unit MKR Compensation Discussion   GovAlpha Core Unit Budget Q4 2021 to Q1 2022 Discussion   Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Discussion     Core Unit Budgets Distribution The executive vote that passed on September 4th distributed three one-time budgets.

Once confirmed that Governance has control over all L2 systems, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit will manually deny its deployer addresses.  Executive Spell L2 technical detail can be found here.  Parameter Changes & Vault Upgrades  Stability Fee Management There were no proposed Stability Fee changes. Stability Fee parameters were well-positioned given September\u2019s conditions. View a detailed breakdown of the rate change proposal here published by the Parameter Proposal Group.  Debt Ceiling Management and Optimizations The Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) was activated for PSM-PAX-A with the following parameters:  Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) was set to 500 million DAI.  PSM-PAX-A Debt Ceiling increased from 50 million DAI to 500 million DAI.   Target Available Debt (gap) was set to 50 million DAI. Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl) was set to 24 hours.  PSM-USDC-A Target Available Debt (gap) was reduced from 1 billion DAI to 950 million DAI.  New Vaults and Other Facilities GUNIV2DAIUSDC1-A Vault was onboarded with parameters detailed in the poll. Paxos\u2019s stablecoin (USDP) was onboarded through the PSM-PAX-A facility.  Offboarded Vaults KNC-A Vault was offboarded through a 2-step process:  Immediately lowering the KNC-A liquidation penalty (chop) from 13% to 0% to avoid penalizing liquidated vaults. Raising the KNC-A liquidation ratio (mat) from 175% to 5,000% over 60 days to liquidate the remaining KNC-A vaults.  USDT-A Vault was offboarded through a 2-step process:  Lowering the USDT-A Liquidation Penalty (chop) to 0% to avoid penalizing liquidated vaults. Raising the USDT-A Liquidation Ratio from 150% to 300% to trigger liquidation of all remaining vaults.   Fee Changes Flash Mint Fee (toll) decreased from 0.05% to 0%.  Community Greenlight Polls Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. Community greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month and run for two full weeks. The month of August had two Community Greenlight polls:     Asset Date Began Date Ended Voted Yes Voted No Voted Abstain     RARE (SuperRare) September 6 September 20 64,210.99 MKR (90.81%) 6,494.47 MKR (9.19%) 0.82 MKR (0.00%)   RAI (Rai Reflex Index) September 6 September 20 68,665.98 MKR (95.12%) 3,358.88 MKR (4.65%) 162.04 MKR (0.22%)    Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead?  chrome_jcZd9RJ7iU1601\u00d7873 95.5 KB  Votes & Important Dates Calendar Here are some things to look forward to for October: The DUX team recently presented their updates and future work on Governance, Risk, and Core Unit Launch Pod Calls. Look out for many new updates and integrations on the Governance Voting Portal and Delegate sites. Although the Dai Token Bridge allows users to trade, lend, provide liquidity, and yield farm with Dai on the Arbitrum L2 network, there is no support for Maker Vaults. The recently passed executive vote transferred sole-authority over token bridges to Governance, which will allow upgrading the Gateway to enable Vaults, fast withdrawal schemes, and DAI minted on L2. In September, offboarding low-tier Vaults was a heavily discussed topic and is now coming into action with the most recent active poll to offboard USDT Collateral Types. Expect more low-tier Vaults to be on Governance poll for offboarding in response to this recent signal request. Nexo Institutional Vault has received proposed risk parameters through risk evaluation; Look out for a poll launching the Nexo Institutional Vault with proposed parameters in the near future. Growth Core Unit has been working with legal and compliance teams to help find a solution to open Institutional Vaults with traditional companies interested in having liquidity from the Maker Protocol. They are pushing the Institutional Vaults initiative (for a product focused on crypto-institutions) in Europe. The Maker Foundation notified the community that it would be discontinuing Rocket.Chat. The community discussed and decided Discord is to become the next primary channel of communication. GovAlpha, Content-Production, and Tech-Ops are collaborating on a proposed layout for the channel implementation. GovComms is collecting Discord handles and other associated account information from DAO members, stakeholders, and anyone who wants to be added to the Discord prior to launch. The current goal is for the new Discord to go live on Monday, October 18th, two weeks before the October 31 deadline for shutting down Rocket.Chat. During September, delegate compensation parameters were discussed, and an Issue Discussion Call was held. In response, we have already seen one delegate propose a conditional one-time supplemental compensation. A MIP in RFC for delegate compensation has been submitted, which we can expect to stimulate further discussion around the topic. Finally, the D3M is undergoing a final audit by the Risk Core Unit. Growth Core Unit is ready to launch D3M once the audit is complete, which tentatively looks to be mid-late October.  Resources Public Google Calendar.

Each review is written to keep the Maker community informed of Governance developments.  Top Governance News In January, Governance officially onboarded UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH and UNI-V2-USDC-ETH as new collateral types to the Maker Protocol. Additionally, an Executive Vote approved the January 2021 Governance Cycle Bundle that officially onboarded three new facilitators to Risk, Smart Contracts, and Operational Support Domains.  January\u2019s Governance Polls and Executive Votes  Jan 29: Executive Vote: Add ETH-A to the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module  Jan 25: Executive Vote: Approve January 2021 Governance Cycle Bundle  Jan 25: Governance Poll: Add NS-DROP (New Silver DROP) as a Collateral Type  Jan 22: Executive Vote: Collateral Onboarding, Debt Ceiling Adjustments, Other Changes  Jan 15: Executive Vote: Stability Fee Changes, Oracle Whitelisting, Other Changes  Jan 4: Executive Vote: Increase ETH-A & USDC-A Debt Ceilings    Governance Cycle Updates  Key Outcomes of the Eighth Governance Cycle The Eighth Governance Cycle began on January 4 and ended on January 29. The January 2021 MIPs Executive Vote, which was posted on Monday, January 25 and passed on January 28, included:  MIPs:  MIP29: Peg Stability Module MIP30: CropJoin - Farmable cUSDC Adaptor   Subproposals:  MIP13c3-SP7: Declaration of Intent - Governance Communications Domain MIP7c3-SP5: Onboarding S\u00e9bastien Derivaux to the Risk Domain MIP7c3-SP6: Onboarding Sam MacPherson to the Smart Contracts Domain MIP28c7-SP2: Onboarding JuanJuan to the Operational Support Domain  This Monthly Cycle Bundle included a declaration of intent from a working group to form a Governance Communications Domain with the mandate to create and maintain a communication system between the DAO, the DeFi community, and the public. It also ratified @SebVentures, @hexonaut  and @juan as facilitators of Risk, Smart Contracts, and Operational Support Domains.  MIPs in Progress There are 18 proposals currently in the Request for Comments (RFC) phase. This means it is now time for the Maker community to provide feedback on each or request changes from the Proposal Authors.  Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls Community Greenlight Polls are Governance polls that are specific to gauging community sentiment for collateral onboarding. Specifically, Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to inform the Domain Teams (Risk, Smart Contracts, and Oracles) of their preferences for collateral types that have been proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. These polls run for a period of two weeks, starting the third week of the Governance Cycle. Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index. While Domain Teams are free to choose their workloads, it is important to gather the opinions of MKR token holders before the full domain work takes place, as a matter of efficiency.  January\u2019s Greenlight Polls ended on February 1, with the following results: Ten collateral types were considered and subsequently greenlit by the community.  renFIL (RenVM Filecoin) WFIL (Wrapped Filecoin) STAKE (xDAI STAKE) stETH (LidoDAO Staked Ether) UNI-V2-DAI-USDT (UniswapV2 DAI-USDT Liquidity Token) UNI-V2-DAI-USDC (UniswapV2 DAI-USDC Liquidity Token) BPT-50WBTC-50WETH (50% WBTC 50% ETH Balancer Pool Token) UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC (UniswapV2 DAI-WBTC Liquidity Token) P1-DROP (Peoples Company DROP) UNI-V2-DAI-YFI (UniswapV2 DAI-YFI Liquidity Token)   What\u2019s Ahead? Formal submission for February Governance Cycle begins today, February 1, and ends Wednesday, February 3, EOD UTC. Some notable MIPs in the RFC Phase to look out for this month are part of the Road to DAO: the Core Unit Operating Model, a MIP set that includes:  MIP38: DAO Primitives State MIP39: Core Unit Framework MIP40: Budget Framework MIP41: Facilitator Framework  Keep an eye out for the Weekly MIPs Update, typically posted in the Maker Forum on Sundays or Mondays. The update summarizes the most recent events in the world of MIPs, the previous week\u2019s activity, what to expect from the current week, and what\u2019s on the agenda for the next week. It also covers updates with respect to Governance polls and votes, collateral onboarding, and rate adjustments.

Each review is written to keep the Maker community informed of Governance developments.  Top Governance News In February, Governance Polls passed to onboard UniswapV2 WBTC-DAI LP, UniswapV2 LINK-ETH LP, and UNI-V2-DAI-USDC Tokens. Additionally, Community Greenlight Polls considered 12 new collateral types and greenlit 10.

Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls Community Greenlight Polls are Governance polls that are specific to gauging community sentiment for collateral onboarding. Specifically, Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to inform the Domain Teams (Risk, Smart Contracts, and Oracles) of their preferences for collateral types that have been proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. These polls run for a period of two weeks, starting the third week of the Governance Cycle. Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index. While Domain Teams are free to choose their workloads, it is important to gather the opinions of MKR token holders before the full domain work takes place, as a matter of efficiency. February\u2019s Community Greenlight Polls ended on March 1, with the following results: Ten collateral types were considered, all of them were greenlit by the community:  UNI-V2-UNI-DAI (UniswapV2 UNI-DAI Liquidity Token)  FFT1-DROP (Fortunafi DROP) UNI-V2-BAT-DAI (UniswapV2 BAT-DAI Liquidity Token)  UNI-V2-YFI-ETH (UniswapV2 YFI-ETH Liquidity Token) REINNO (REINNO Stablecoin) SB-LDB (SolidBlock London Digital Bonds) UNI-V2-DAI-COMP (UniswapV2 DAI-COMP Liquidity Token) UNI-V2-LINK-DAI (UniswapV2 LINK-DAI Liquidity Token) GLM (Golem) UNI-V2-LRC-ETH (UniswapV2 LRC-ETH Liquidity Token)   The following collateral types were deferred:  renDOGE (RenVM Dogecoin) UNI-V2-COMP-ETH (UniswapV2 COMP-ETH Liquidity Token)   What\u2019s Ahead? Formal submission for the March Governance Cycle begins today, March 1, and ends Wednesday, March 3 EOD UTC. You can read more about MIPs in RFC and Formal Submission for the upcoming Governance Cycle in Weekly MIPs Update #28.

The new setup provides a simpler experience for MKR voters, eliminating bundled MIP votes and the three-stage voting process of the past. Instead, each proposal or proposal-set will go through an individual Ratification Poll that runs for two weeks. What happens on week 1 has not changed, the RFC & Formal Submission dates remain the same. May 2021 had six MIPs accepted along with a bunch of Vault upgrades to Liquidations 2.0 and other parameter changes; As a result of smaller vaults not going to auction fast enough, a flat 300 Dai incentive is now automatically rewarded to anyone triggering or resetting auctions; The KNC-A vault was retired due to lack of profitability; And the USDC-PSM recieved a 1 billion Dai Debt Ceiling expansion, after the previous ceiling of 2 billion was coming close to full utililization. Twelve Community Greenlit Polls went out during May; all passed with varying amounts of participation.  Key Outcomes  Maker Improvement Proposals The May 2021 MIPs Bundle vote passed on May 25, 2021, and was executed on May 27, 2021. As a result of the Bundled Vote, the following MIPs were ratified:  MIP Status Change  Accepted MIP50: Direct Deposit Module  Accepted MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle  Accepted MIP4c2-SP14: MIP0 Amendments  Accepted SES-001 MIP39c2-SP10: Mandate  Accepted SES-001 MIP40c3-SP10: Budget  Accepted SES-001 MIP41c4-SP10: Facilitator Onboarding   Visit the MIPs Portal to explore accepted MIPs and ones still in the proposal phase.  Vault and Parameter Changes The May Cycle also included a number of Executive Votes that changed a few parameters and added many new Vaults to the Liquidations 2.0 framework. This included:  Stability Fees Handful of changes, with a detailed breakdown here.   Auction Parameters  All Vault types\u2019 auction triggering and resetting incentive, called tip, increased from 0 DAI to 300 DAI.   Debt Ceiling Management & Optimizations  PSM-USDC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 2 billion DAI to 3 billion DAI. KNC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling decreased from 5 million DAI to 0 DAI. PAXUSD-A Maximum Debt Ceiling decreased from 100 million DAI to 0 DAI. USDC-B Maximum Debt Ceiling decreased from 30 million DAI to 0 DAI.   Liquidation Ratio Management  UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Liquidation Ratio decreased from 110% to 105%   Vaults Upgraded to Liquidations 2.0  UNIV2DAIETH-A UNIV2USDCETH-A UNIV2ETHUSDT-A UNIV2WBTCDAI-A UNI-A AAVE-A BAT-A RENBTC-A LRC-A MANA-A COMP-A KNC-A BAL-A ETH-A ETH-B ETH-C WBTC-A   Oracle Whitelisting  B.Protocol whitelisted on WBTCUSD OSM and Medianizer Oracles   Community Greenlight Polls These polls gauge community sentiment for collateral onboarding. Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. These polls run for two weeks, starting Monday, on the first week, and the third week of each month.

What\u2019s Ahead? June is here, and there are some things to watch out for. Formal submissions are open from June 7th to June 9th 4:00 PM UTC. Additionally, the Monthly Governance Cycle begins with an updated schedule of individual two-week Ratification Polls replacing the three rounds of voting for MIPs and subproposals that voters had to do in the past. The Protocol Engineering Team will be performing an architectural debt cleanup by migrating the remaining collaterals to the Liquidations 2.0 framework. Additionally, that team posted a thread outlining the multichain landscape as they see it, Maker\u2019s unique opportunities and challenges, and a proposed roadmap for community discussion. The Oracle and Protocol Engineering teams will be getting the remainder of LP Vaults onto the Liquidations 2.0 framework. New Core Units are continuing to be proposed, with four in the current pipeline; Oracles, Governance Communications, Collateral Onboarding, and Strategic Happiness.

Each review is written to keep the Maker community informed of Governance developments.  Top Governance News March was a significant governance cycle for the Maker Protocol, seeing a number of key MIPs get passed along with a number of important changes and additions. The Core Unit framework was officially ratified, meaning MakerDAO can now engage with independent teams to provide much needed services to the DAO and to compensate those teams. Core Unit teams can propose themselves to MakerDAO for consideration. An enormous step towards the further decentralization of the protocol. We also saw a number of technical MIPs get ratified, that are now on the road to being implemented. Liquidations 2.0, a redesigned liquidation system that removes capital requirements for auction participants. And there are a number of others listed below.  Key Outcomes The March Governance Cycle, which began on March 1 and ended on March 26, summary of changes:  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) The March 2021 MIPs Executive Vote was posted on Monday, March 22, passed on March 25, and was executed on March 27. As a result of the Bundled Vote the following MIPs were ratified :  The Core Unit MIP set. Core Unit MIP set related amendments. The Keg module MIP set. MIP43: Term Lending Module. MIP45: Liquidations 2.0. MIP46: Parameter Proposal Groups. MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management.  This Month\u2019s MIPs Bundle also ratified the following Core Units, including their mandate, budget, and facilitator onboarding proposals:  RWF-001, Real World Finance Core Unit  Mandate  Budget of 40k DAI per month for an unspecified number of months  Facilitator Onboarding of S\u00e9bastien Derivaux   GOV-001, Governance Core Unit  Mandate  Budget of 80k DAI per month for 3 months, April-June  Facilitator Onboarding of LongForWisdom   RISK-001, Risk Core Unit Proposals  Mandate  Budget of 100,500 DAI per month for 3 months, April-June  Facilitator Onboarding of Primo\u017e Korde\u017e    Visit the MIPs Tracker to learn more about MIPs and core unites in progress and view MIP statuses.  Parameter Changes & Vault Additions The March Cycle also included a number of Executive Votes that changed parameters in response to the conditions on Ethereum in addition to adding a couple of new Vaults. This included: Stability Fees  Many changes, listed here.  Debt Ceiling Management & Optimizations  The ETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 2.5 billion DAI to 15 billion DAI. The WBTC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling increased from 350 million DAI to 750 million DAI. Debt Ceiling Increases to three UNIV2-LP vaults following successful LP-Oracle audit. Instant Access Modules enabled on three UNIV2-LP vaults. The ETH-A Target Available Debt (gap) increased from 30 million DAI to 80 million DAI, making Debt Ceiling increases on ETH-A less frequent.  Auction Optimizations  The Bid Duration (ttl) parameter decreased from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types with liquidations enabled. The Max Auction Duration (tau) parameter decreased from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types with liquidations enabled. The Maximum DAI amount that can be out for auction at any given time(box) parameter increased from 15 million DAI to 20 million DAI. The Minimum Bid Increment (beg) parameter increased from 3% to 5% for the ETH-B & UniswapV2 Liquidity Pool vault types. The Surplus Lot Size (bump) parameter increased from 10,000 DAI to 30,000 DAI, giving surplus auctions larger instances.  Debt Floor Requirements  These increasing minimum position sizes are due to the growing gas costs involved with liquidating positions. The Debt Floor (dust) parameter increased from 2,000 DAI to 5,000 DAI for all vault types with the exception of ETH-B, PSM-USDC-A, and RWA001-A. The Debt Floor (dust) parameter increased from 2,000 DAI to 15,000 DAI for the ETH-B vault type.  Vault Additions  ETH-C vault type was added to offer borrowers a facility with a better rate in exchange for a higher collateralization requirement. The RWA001-A vault type was added using RWA001 (6s Capital) as collateral with preliminary, non-final parameters for testing purposes with a Debt Ceiling of 1000 Dai.   Community Greenlight Polls These polls gauge community sentiment for collateral onboarding. Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types that have been proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. These polls run for a period of two weeks, starting the third week of a given month. March\u2019s Greenlight Polls ended on March 29th, with the following results: Nine collateral types were considered, all of them were greenlit by the community.  aAAVE (Aave AAVE) SNX (Synthetix) SolarX (Uprets/SolarX REIT)  aWETH (Aave wETH) SB-BFDC (SolidBlock BeachFront Digital Coin) CurveLP-cDAI-cUSDC (Curve cDAI-cUSDC Liquidity Token) sUSD (Synthetix USD) xSUSHI (Sushibar) CurveLP-renBTC-WBTC (Curve renBTC-WBTC Liquidity Token)  Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead? April is ahead, and there are some things to watch out for. Formal submission for April Governance Cycle begins Monday, April 5th, and ends Wednesday, April 7th EOD UTC. Smart Contracts and Growth Core Units have signalled their intention to formally submit their proposals for the April cycle, while others continue to develop and refine their proposals in the Forums in preparation for their own formal submissions in the months to come. Implementation of Liquidations 2.0 will begin, with support for the LINK-A vault being the first step to look out for on April 9th\u2019s Executive Vote and YFI-A support tentatively planned for April 18th\u2019s Executive Vote. April 30th\u2019s vote will depend on what is happening during that weekly cycle\u2019s Governance Polls. With the approval of the Parameter Proposal Groups MIP, we can now expect parameter proposals to come consistently on the first Monday of the month, for inclusion into the weekly cycle in the second week of the month.  880\u00d7757 35.7 KB   Resources Public Google Calendar Bookmark or Subscribe to this calendar for Votes and Public Calls.

In the span of only one month, the Vote Delegation Portal now holds a total of 7 Recognized Delegates and 6 Shadow Delegates, with over 73,000 MKR delegated! As a result, we may start seeing weekly executive votes have a meaningful increase in MKR participation. In parallel, MakerLabs produced a proof of concept web application displaying information and statistics to provide delegators with a tool to understand how their delegate is performing. Weekly executive proposals were skipped twice this month and bundled into the following week\u2019s executives in response to an unofficial bi-weekly schedule proposed by the GovAlpha Core Unit. There were no executives on August 13th and August 27th. Governance-related content expansion continues; Maker Relay sections such as State of Dai & Votes and Polls are now available in video format on MakerDAO\u2019s Youtube channel. August had several AMAs and Meet Your Delegate calls that dig deep into our new delegates\u2019 views on DAO governance and other important topics. August had three ratification polls; the Dai Foundation Core Unit, the Growth Core Unit MKR Budget Plan, and a Declaration of Intent for Onboarding a Collateral Type Backed by B.Protocol v2, which have all passed. There were a total of four community greenlight polls. Three have passed, resulting in higher prioritization of the NCP01-DROP, CGFF-DROP, and RWA-120dB Vault types. However,  CNC1-DROP did not pass and was thereby deferred.  Key Outcomes  Maker Improvement Proposals The month of August contained three ratification polls, which all passed: Ratification Polls:     Ratification Poll Discussion     DAI Foundation Core Unit, DAIF-001 Discussion   Growth Core Unit MKR Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP23) Discussion   Declaration of Intent - (MIP13c3-SP11) Discussion     Core Unit Budgets Distribution The executive vote that passed on August 22nd distributed budgets to 10 Core Units.

What\u2019s Ahead?  1305\u00d7797 50.7 KB  Here are some things to look forward to for September: Governance polls to Lower the Flash Mint Fee toll to 0% and Add RWA007 (SolarX) as a new RWA Vault Type both passed on Thursday, September 2nd. They will be included in next week\u2019s executive vote, which will be a bundled executive containing polls that have passed during the previous two weeks. DUX and the GovAlpha Core Unit are working together on improving the UX of the Maker Voting Portal. Keep an eye out on the forums for potential updates. DUX and Growth Core Unit are also working together to help improve participation in Maker Governance. DSpot and GovAlpha Core Unit are working together to improve the MIPs Portal website by fixing some bugs and updating the selection menu. MakerLabs continues to improve and update its proof of concept web application by offering more options and analytics on delegate performance. Keep track of their updates here. As delegation finds its feet, delegate compensation emerges as the next important topic for the DAO to work through. Maker\u2019s Institutional and Long-Term Vaults proposal is now attracting many customers, such as Nexo. Although there has not been an official Vault launch, governance and Core Units have been helping lay down the foundation for potential terms and agreements. These Vault Proposals are being discussed with Deco Protocol and Nexo, and hopefully, a final agreement on terms and conditions will be met very soon. Multiple groups are working on developing a Framework for Institutional and Treasury Vault types. The Risk Core Unit is also working on MATIC Treasury Loan Risk Assessments and Parameter Proposals. Institutional Vaults and Treasury Loans will continue to be an important topic during September. Another monthly governance cycle is upon us. As usual, Formal Submission for Maker Improvement Proposals begin on the first Monday of the month and close after three days.
