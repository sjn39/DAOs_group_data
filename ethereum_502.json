Following TEthashV1 algorithm suggests safe transition of PoW algorithms and secure the FNV Algorithm in MIX Parts.  ## Motivation     This file has been truncated. show original      EIP-1485 discussion. TETHashV1 (Trust Ethash Version 1) : ethash PoW algorithm upgrade for preventing the ETH-Asic devices. and more securing the Mix parts / Dag parts algorithm. ",
