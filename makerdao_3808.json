                    "content": "Hi Maker community, Cole Kennelly from Volmex (volmex.finance) here. We are excited to share that Volmex v1 is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. We think the Maker community will be keen to hear that Dai is the first supported collateral type on Volmex v1.  Liquidity providers can mint volatility tokens (e.g. ETHV & iETHV or BTCV & iBTCV) with DAI here: https://app.volmex.finance/ Additionally, several volatility token Uniswap v3 pools (paired with USDC) have been created by the Volmex community, where volatility token liquidity can be provisioned. Additional Volmex resources:  Mainnet launch post Introductory blog post on functionality, security, audits, etc. Interact with the Volmex API for live index pricing here. A sample query returning the current volatility index is available here.  Have questions? Join us on Discord! Thanks, Cole ",
