What is happening? @LongForWisdom is acting as stakeholder and project manager for the creation and continued work on mkrgov.science. Why is it happening? @rich.brown identified the need for a governance analytics dashboard and has paid Protofire to create it out of the Maker Foundation Community Grants fund. Rich has many responsibilities, so he has delegated management to @LongForWisdom Who is involved? @rich.brown @LongForWisdom are both involved on the MakerDAO side. Protofire have been engaged to do development work on this project. When should we expect results? Maker Governance Analytics Dashboard v2.1 - Last update for the foreseeable future. Previously These have been delayed by the whole Covid Crash thing. I will update once we have a date for resuming work on this.  The development has slowed down over the last few weeks after the launch of version 2. Going forward, the project is moving to a two-week release cycle, the aim is to produce iterative polish and functionality changes more rapidly going forwards. These two-week cycles should begin in March. ",

This website will provide time-series data on all relevant Maker stats broken-down by collateral / vault type. Why is it happening? @hexonaut identified the need for a business analytics dashboard to answer governance questions beyond peg stability. Who is involved? @rich.brown is involved on the MakerDAO side. @hexonaut is the project lead for development. When should we expect results? An initial version should be ready for early/mid-May 2020 with a more feature complete version ready for mid-June. I will update the time estimates as progress is made.

The dashboard can be found at mkrgov.science   New in this version!  The poll list now lets you navigate past the first page of data. Executive Metadata is now visible for older executive votes. Changed MKR Participation number format on the poll list such that it shows a reasonable number of decimal places. You can now link to individual metrics if you want to share them with others. Significantly reduced load time for most pages. No longer show invalid data while polls are loading.   Thank you to the following:   Protofire for their work on this dashboard.
