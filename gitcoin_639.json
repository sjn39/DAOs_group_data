We would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Wednesday, January 5th, in advance of payouts being made the week of January 10th.  Options to vote on: 1. Ratify the round results You ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GR12 final payout amounts through the non-custodial GR12 deployment contract. 2. Request further deliberation You do not ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.  TLDR from the Results Post:   Grants Round 12 ran from Dec 1-16, 2021   GR12 was Gitcoin Grants\u2019 largest round ever with $6.1M raised for public goods, representing 135% round-over-round growth vs. GR11\u2019s $2.6M. Of the $6.1M raised in GR12, $3M came from the matching pool and $3.1M came from the community.   GR12 featured ten rounds:  The main round Six ecosystem rounds: Uniswap, Synthetix, ZKTech, Polygon, Forefront, Gitcoin Building Gitcoin (on dGrants) - not governed through the community multi-sig  Three cause rounds: Climate, Advocacy, Longevity    In GR12, we ran an experiment in the main round \u2013 having a single pool, rather than a category-based approach. Broadly speaking, this experiment was a success and the Public Goods Funding workstream plans to propose running more single pool rounds in the future.   In addition, GR12 saw a marked increase in side rounds \u2013 both \u2018ecosystem rounds\u2019 and \u2018cause rounds\u2019 \u2013 with side round matching funds accounting for double those of the main pool ($2M side rounds + $1M main pool). We\u2019re excited about continuing on the momentum of these ecosystem & cause rounds in GR13.
