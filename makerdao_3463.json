Welcome to Core Unit Tools #5. Today we\u2019re going to be getting to know a bit more what Bitwage is. Today I\u2019m very happy to be with Fabiano, Jonathan, Matt, and Ra\u00fal from Bitwage, who are going to be telling us a bit more about this. For other episodes of Core Unit Tools, please check the forum.

Is that a prerequisite? 08:54 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Potentially an individual could decide to use Bitwage even if the company is not in the system  1920\u00d71080 116 KB   1920\u00d71080 171 KB   1920\u00d71080 112 KB   1920\u00d71080 164 KB   1920\u00d71080 95.9 KB   1920\u00d71080 101 KB   1920\u00d71080 118 KB   1920\u00d71080 121 KB   1920\u00d71080 165 KB   1920\u00d71080 119 KB   1920\u00d71080 103 KB   1920\u00d71080 94 KB   28:31 \u2014 Question in the chat: Is there any current example of a company in the US paying Latin American employees that are not a contractor   31:51 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: In Argentina you would pay in dollars, right? Because I didn\u2019t see the Argentinian peso   33:00 \u2014 Payton Prose: audio got bad here :(   34:19 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I know that you said 2% as an extra fee when you\u2019re paying in Dai. I don\u2019t know if you can cover a bit on the pricing and speak a little bit about that   36:02 \u2014 Nadia \u00c1lvarez: Do you have a tutorial video or a brochure or something like that to start providing some food for thought for them in an easy to understand way?   38:20 \u2014 Nadia \u00c1lvarez: Besides the payment, do you have other benefits for the employees or contractors? Maybe healthcare insurance, credit cards or something like that?   41:17 \u2014 Frank Cruz: I was trying to gauge the health of the company. I saw that you raised some money in 2018. With regards to that, I was wondering if the survivorship of the company is dependent of the revenue that\u2019s going to be made by the fees that you\u2019re charging, if you have raised money since 2018\u2026 What\u2019s the health of Bitwage?   42:52 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I don\u2019t know, Jonathan, if we\u2019re leaving something or there\u2019s something that we\u2019re forgetting to ask and you would like to have it covered   44:14 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Fabiano, anything else that you would like to comment?   Closing Comment  David Utrobin  Outro  Thanks, everyone, for coming. It was great having you, Jonathan, Fabiano, Matt, and Ra\u00fal.   Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
