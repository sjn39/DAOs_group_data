Completely agree I think if there were a way in the future to be able to get the message out to Uni holders far and wide this would prove beneficial to the community and allow everyone to feel involved in the decisions made. To add onto this I think there is an issue with the current delegation lock that gets put in place, that if a user doesn\u2019t delegate before a certain block it makes the \u201cineligible to vote\u201d I think this should be re thought out and re approached to allow for a more inclusive process in my opinion.

Any governance changes I would support would be raising minimum for quorum to 5% and also a 2/3rds majority for a proposal to pass.

                    "content": "Maybe I\u2019m just particularly pessimistic in this way but I think the thresholds for quorum and proposals need to come way down. Like, way down. Looking at even real life examples, there will always be a significant chunk of people who won\u2019t delegate and who aren\u2019t interested in voting or are in different time zones or are holding these for investment and doesn\u2019t even know the community exists or whatever. The key is that it\u2019s pretty much unavoidable that if you use a high quorum to enforce decentralization , you\u2019re likely to get stagnation. In real life examples, American voter turnout has always been low, because many don\u2019t feel that their opinions were represented, or they don\u2019t care about the issues, or that they didn\u2019t know, etc. And in a sphere like this you can\u2019t force people to delegate without people randomly delegating as a popularity context for \u201cfor the lulz\u201d.  This of course benefits centralization because if you can just use attention to get votes from people who don\u2019t care, well, there it is. I think that there should possibly be a few different categories of proposals in addition to the \u201cpork problem\u201d (riders that gets added on for the benefit for a few), in terms to what degree they affect policies writ large how much potential impact, insfoar as they can be calculated, and adjust the requirements accordingly. How many counts for a quorum, how many needs to just to get the proposal on the table, etc, doesn\u2019t need to be fixed forever but be done on a sliding scale. Now, of course the law of unintended consequences tends to throw wrenches down the line, but that just requires some sort of way to figure out how quickly these can change via voting. It may tale some time to work out a reasonable system here on testnet or something before this can be put in. And some of this is spitballing but I\u2019ve been intrigued with the notion of decision-making in a certain sense by lottery. Now, an ordinary lottery wouldn\u2019t work if a centralized actor holds a ton of power already, but it may also be possible to essentially delegate specific proposals addressing more particular areas of reform out to smaller groups of randomly selected voters who are put their hats i nthe ring so to speak, to work out, and then depending on impact either then put it in as a general proposal or if it\u2019s something truly minor, enact it with obvious knowledge ahead of time. I need to flesh this out, certainly. There are no perfect systems and the goal needs to balance between functional and fairness and that\u2019s kind of a problem that has existed for centuries. I\u2019m personally less concerned about \u201cgovernance attacks\u201d per se but more the way it is done. We\u2019ve seen both relatively easily systems go to waste (the 1933 March German Elections, even though their safeguards meant that Hitler failed to even get a majority but were able to get dictatorial power anyway) with overwhelming support with threats of violence and bribery) and in the current US congress where pretty much nothing ever gets passed because even though they\u2019re only a few votes short, that gives immense power nonetheless to the party with even 1 extra vote to dictate literally everything. I personally think that the way you prevent hostile takeovers is to not create a system where power can truly be concentrated in a way such as that. I know this is all lofty but pie-in-the-sky right now but at least that\u2019s the sort of safeguards we need to have in mind. I\u2019ll gladly do some research in the next few (I\u2019m quarantined right now so at least I have time) because governance is of course hard but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bound to fail. ",

This has been an interesting ride and actually, @Danpi314\u2019s opinion summarizes this proposal pretty well. These are thoughts I read on the forum. I think this was a successful first proposal.  It has indeed resulted in awareness for Uniswap governance. I\u2019ve seen amazing discussions on this forum. And, even though it was necessary to (unfortunately) address certain issues (e.g. false flagging), these discussions resulted in new ideas as well as users being able to find enough information to form their own opinion. Personally agree with the rider comment.  Regardless, I\u2019m hoping this proposal will lead towards continuous discussions and new proposals on Uniswap. I had some comments on Twitter / Telegram that this clearly demonstrates governance \u2018doesn\u2019t work\u2019. However, I agree to disagree the first proposal getting rejected does not mean governance doesn\u2019t work. Great things were learned, let\u2019s move forward and apply these learnings! ",

Lowering the quorum makes the governance more agile, but at the expense of passing more contentious proposals. In my opinion our governance is too young, and we should try to move slow until we settle in some good processes for it.   Autonomous proposals have been talked multiple times as an alternative to make governance more liquid, while preserving the robustness of a high quorum. This possibility should be explored in more depth.   One of the reasons this proposal was made is to improve the chances of passing the \u201csecond airdrop\u201d proposal, although I don\u2019t think this is the context to give my opinion on that one, I think we should vote on it using the original governance parameters, lowering the quorum only to pass a contentious proposal has a good chance of fracturing the community.

                    "content": "From literature on DAOs. There are 4 cited issues with this typology. 1. Procedural Nature Lack of voter participation, or in our case, delegation to enter the timelock, self or otherwise. This particular issue has a long-standing history in democracies and we are better served not attempting to solve it. Strategies to mitigate:  Lower the threshold for quorum Make quorum a factor of the currently delegated amount, and keep the % required proportional to \u2018interest\u2019 Implement a \u2018liquid democratic vote\u2019 found here, which calculates the \u2018configurable\u2019 percentage required between the difference in Yes and No votes over the total Allow tokens to achieve \u2018tenure\u2019 like in LTSE For example, holding tokens for 1 year may give you 1.5x voting size. This balances the needs of long-term holders and short-term investors that may otherwise overwhelm governance.  What not to do:  Remain stuck on the Compound governance fork with the initial constructor configuration of 1% and 4%. These percentages are over the Total tokens in circulation, NOT delegated. The human function of progress and innovation is to \u2018copy\u2019 and \u2018improve\u2019. So far, all we have done is \u2018copy\u2019.  2. Legal Indeterminacy Not much to be said here, but we are an illegal organizational structure, and when the SEC can be bothered, they will come after us. If we issue governance tokens, we become a target. Are we prepared to extend \u2018unlimited liability\u2019 to our customers? If not, we have no right pursuing a cryptoanarchist agenda. Strategies to mitigate:  Keep evolving with the space and whenever there is an opportunity to legitimize our group, we have to have the flexibility to do so. This is precisely why i think the crypto-anarchist decentralized agenda will ultima hurt Uniswap. Their ideology is more important than the financial integrity of the services they offer. A financial stake normally solves this problem because it ensures that you have \u2018skin in the game\u2019. To pursue this fully we would have to experiment with the idea of a non-delegated vote. In this voting regime, idealogues\u2019 votes would be muted, especially those with little to no substantial stake in the success of Uniswap. If the SEC does get involved, they will go after who they can - in this case it would be \u2018Delegates\u2019 with public identities  3. The DAO is code The essential construction of the DAO is held in turing complete Solidity contracts. This makes it extremely difficult to alter once in operation. Even a trivial bug fix has to undergo a vote. (have we been audited?) This creates a dichotomy. Although the code is highly transparent, it is difficult to repair or modify. Strategies to mitigate:  Create an emergency \u2018governor\u2019 like function that will allow us to implement bug fixes quickly. Any proposed changes will have to go through an emergency audit to maintain integrity and accountability. The auditor must remain an objective 3rd party.  4. Voter Manipulation It is possible, however difficult to prove, for groups of voters to scheme against the DAO machine. Horizontal accountability is required to preserve the democratic nature of this group. We saw plenty of this drama play out on the forums. Most of it was unsubstantiated fear mongering about elaborate schemes to overthrow Uniswap, like this was a chapter in Lord of the Rings. However, if the possibility is there to manipulate the vote, system actors will eventually attempt to exploit it. Welcome to human nature. Strategies to mitigate:  Implement the \u2018tenure voting\u2019 mechanism mentioned above Make the vote \u2018HIDDEN\u2019. This is already a fairly well studied voting procedure, and it will curtail all the scheming that occurs during the 7 day active vote. Instead of focusing on and gaming the voting results, delegates should instead respond in faith to the proposal being put to a vote. This also reduces the \u2018abstain\u2019 vote, because in this scenario it is not clear that \u2018abstain\u2019 counts effectively as a \u2018no\u2019 vote. Abstain should be reserved for those who take issue with the proposal, and remain uncomfortable with either a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 vote. Open a formal proposal topic in the forums for a 6 day discussion. Once closed voting takes place over a tighter 24 hour period. This allows discussion to take place and limits the \u2018politicking\u2019 to a 24 period of time. If we implement the quorum strategies above, we can safely pass good proposals with the currently \u2018engaged\u2019 delegates, and not worry about having a time window artificially stretched to \u2018gather\u2019 in sleepy voters.  What not to do:  Don\u2019t make the voting progress visible. Humans are prone to story-telling with little to no evidence, and any legitimate attempt to push through a good proposal will always be subject to \u2018manipulation\u2019, political machinations, and coercion.

In my opinion our governance is too young, and we should try to move slow until we settle in some good processes for it.    I want to politely disagree. My full-time job is to help large enterprise organizations go \u2018digital\u2019. The strategies we implement are \u2018complexity science\u2019 based, and are proving to be far more effective than traditional MBA-like approaches, which feature deadly conservatism. I think @Agusx1211 what you are articulating is a concern to not allow governance to become so easy to change, that it degenerates into chaos at the hands of evil actors in the system. This is a good concern, and one i share. However, life is not a polarity, and i caught you saying \u2018spectrum\u2019 several times already, so i know that you get it.

Systems have to find that point of criticality in the middle where change is aggressive enough to represent \u2018positive adaptation\u2019. Today, for large organizations, \u2018slow\u2019 is bankruptcy - it\u2019s just a matter of time. In the words of a well known \u2018systems behaviour\u2019 scholar Ackoff, we want to be \u2018interactive\u2019, which is to say\u2026 We want to aggressively interact with our ecosystem, our token holders, our governance rules, to find out what works. It\u2019s a race against time, because the next UNI-killer is just around the corner. We operate within this highly mercurial space and we know this to be true.     Agusx1211:   One of the reasons this proposal was made is to improve the chances of passing the \u201csecond airdrop\u201d proposal, although I don\u2019t think this is the context to give my opinion on that one, I think we should vote on it using the original governance parameters, lowering the quorum only to pass a contentious proposal has a good chance of fracturing the community.    Dharma has nothing to gain financially from this, except indirectly through the good-will of their users. Additionally, only 4000 or so Dharma users were impacted, so we aren\u2019t talking about a massive horde of tokens. I agree with you however, because Nadav admitted it openly under the claim of 'broken governance to give it added legitimacy. Also, i fail to see how Dharma users getting UNI would fracture the community. Most of them don\u2019t even know this is happening and are blissfully unaware that they may one day see a \u2018claim\u2019 call-to-action on their mobile client. Who are we defending against? Dharma and/or it\u2019s users? We should be focused on growing the ecosystem, not fighting proposals that are intended to expand wealth and good will. Let\u2019s test out this theory. Ask yourselves this \u201cdoes interaction with uniswap, either to swap tokens or provide liquidity, automatically entitle you to care about Uniswap\u2019s long-term viability?\u201d It\u2019s very likely that many UNI holders today don\u2019t care, and yet, they have governance entitlement to vote. Now you have a community like \u2018dharma\u2019 that cares, at least that\u2019s what they are signalling, and what are we doing? We are spending time characterizing them as vile tryants attempting to overthrow governance. The hypocrisy is too funny not to call out tbh. Leaders in this community should be building bridges, not stoking fires. ",

(Airdropping more UNI to those unhappy about not getting the first airdrop). Secondly, I think governance decisions should hold more worth and only be done with the utmost urgency to fill a need that is important to the UNI-verse at large. Lowering the quorum also risks damaging the governance by allowing much more contentious and self-interested parties to pass governance that may hurt the system at large by allowing them to take a quick profit at the expense of the many. And finally if anything I think they need a system on the front-end page like the scrolling numbers at the bottom for votes to make the users, aka. uni-holders aware there are actually votes going on.
