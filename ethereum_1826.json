Here are some questions I have:  Are there any better consensus mechanisms we\u2019re looking at for future Ethereum improvements (better than PoS)? How will we go about making consensus more accessible? Since we\u2019ll be in Bogota, are there any plans to do more outreach and public goods in South American countries like Colombia?  There\u2019s lots to discuss, but I think touching on these would be great. ",
