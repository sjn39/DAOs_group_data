MakerDAO\u2019s survival depends on USDC\u2019s solvency. Over 84% of DAI is currently generated from USDC. Nearly 7% of circulating USDC is sitting in Maker PSM. Getting 100% clarity on USDC\u2019s reserves aren\u2019t just a nice-to-have for Maker. It\u2019s a necessity. After reading the post, I hope you agree with me that MakerDAO needs to:  approach Circle to gain unprecedented insight into the state of USDC reserves, OR replace USDC with a more transparently-backed asset, OR begin developing a plan to wind down the PSM concept.  The survival of this entire project may depend on one of these three things happening in the very near future. ",

                    "content": " The article provided a glimpse into the USD \u201creal world\u201d reserve allocations. 61% are held as cash & cash equivalents (would be interesting to know at which bank (or banks) and if the bank is paying them interest) and the remaining are in \u201csafe\u201d investments, meaning that there is no principal at risk if the investment is held until maturity. They are probably doing the same ALM exercise that we are doing and determining that 61% of USDC is volatile while the remaining USDC can be invested in \u201clonger\u201d duration vehicles. There seems to be a lot more resource and focus on risk management than at the other CeFi projects that have collapsed. But agree that DAI collateral diversification is very important and reducing USDC dependency is crucial not just for reducing any risks associated with Circle but for swinging the DeFi balance back.
