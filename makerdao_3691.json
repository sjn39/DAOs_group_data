                    "content": " What Is a Press Release? A press release is a piece of news or information that companies send out to inform the public about something noteworthy or of material significance. Press releases are often handled by a company\u2019s public relations(PR) department. (source)  Over the last few months, I\u2019ve seen this topic brought up a number of times;  When will the DAO start doing press releases?  And I think people are right for thinking about this\u2013in fact, I\u2019ve been thinking about it too. Press Releases are a powerful communication tool for many good reasons:  Can be used for multiple purposes. Can help us improve our image. Can enhance the effectiveness of our marketing plans. Creates a channel through which we reach a wider audience. Gives us Instant exposure for what we consider to be important. Offers readers(and journalists) a level of convenience. Gives us more ability to steer and manage our own narrative. Gives us the opportunity to refine our messaging. Engages potential customers. Helps distribute our content across more channels. May potentially help with SEO. Gives the media a foundation to build their stories from.  In today\u2019s world, press releases are not as standard as they used to be. In many cases, a handful of relationships with great journalists is enough. The questions we should be asking though, is, what\u2019s right for MakerDAO?  Questions up for discussion  Should we do press releases at all? What kinds of press releases should we do? Who owns them, who is involved in producing them?  My personal view:  Yes, I think the benefits are many and it almost feels like a no-brainer. The one thing I hope for is that we develop healthy criteria for what we put out so that we don\u2019t create noise. I am curious to hear views against press releases. What makes the most sense to me: Crisis Communications Press Release (for when shit hits the fan), Product Launch Press Releases (for when PSMs, FlashMint Modules, etc come out), Product Improvement Press Releases(similar to above), Merger, Acquisition & Partnership Press Releases (for major news, not for smaller partnerships and integrations) I think one CU should \u201cown\u201d the process for coordinating, publishing, and distributing Press Releases and should collaborate with other CUs to put it all together. With my current view on the MakerDAO comms landscape(see below), I think Content Production should own this and work with the DAO to get it right. Also, given that the GovComms scope includes Emergency Communications Support, we can specifically own the Crisis Communication Press Releases since we would already be involved in coordinating comms around crisis events.   Current Communication Teams Landscape at MakerDAO At time of posting, MakerDAO does not have a \u201cPublic Relations\u201d Core Unit. Instead, it has:   Content Production Marketing Content   And is on its way to having:   Strategic Marketing Marketing Campaigns   Governance Communications Organizational Comms   On the horizon:  ??? unclear beyond the above.  Public Relations at Maker, I sense, will be a group effort between teams and not solely owned by any-one team. PR already bleeds into Marketing teams pretty often in traditional companies, so the fact that it would be embedded across all our communication teams makes sense to me. ",

MakerDAO is (I think) something in the middle between a company and a purely decentralised open opensource project.  unlike a pure anarchic opensource project, we have a source of authority: MKR on-chain votes. unlike a company, the vote only reflects a relative majority of opinions.  So, if we want to introduce a CU for \u201cpress releases\u201d we should always be careful that such CU only illustrates the results of the votes, and does not express strong opinions (there is no CEO). For example, to illustrate what I am trying to say by means of an extreme example, even if a  \u201care you in favour of KYC\u201d  on-chain vote received a 55% YES, I would find it ackward if the PRESS CU went to say in TV that MakerDAO is in favour of KYC.

Who owns them, who is involved in producing them?     Yes What you have listed, plus key milestones Crisis communications is one of the most challenging areas in PR communications. Hats off to the Governance Communications team that has put a lot of thought into it and formed a plan. As for other press releases, if the content team plans to handle all press releases from start to finish, then that\u2019d be fine with our unit.  As a communications professional and former journalist, I can say that having one place to go to for information, whether urgent or not, is very important for journalists. Clarifying responsibility is a start. As the next step, I suggest we form a collaborative group with key members across three units to ensure that the journalists only need to go to one place to get their information. That way, we can also avoid working in silos and effectively communicate as a DAO. We should keep in mind that producing press releases is one of the tasks of Public Relations. There\u2019s more to PR, including the following: *Pitching interviews and stories with major news outlets and publications to increase our visibility *Research on public opinions *Media training *Filter and facilitate interview requests *Interview preparation *Answering questions from media *Building relationship with the press *Promoting and lobbying *Counseling *It protects a brand\u2019s reputation and image Our unit with PR experts has included PR as part of our proposal. We are working on a revised proposal and will share that with the community in the near future. ",
