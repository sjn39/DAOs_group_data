I\u2019m a non-coder who came to the Ethereum Magicians site for the first time today and saw this topic and was inspired to create an account and post. I\u2019m not sure how much or where I can contribute but I\u2019d like to contribute and go a bit deeper into this stuff and learn more than you can on Reddit (which is great too and serves a much wider group but has a different purpose I think). I don\u2019t have a technical background - I\u2019m a technology and finance lawyer with a background in litigation, regulatory disputes and risk management. Although I\u2019m very comfortable with technology and have done a lot more than most non-technical people (have been on the Internet since the early 90s, installed Linux on my home PC in the mid 90s, can more or less explain what \u201csharding\u201d is in layman\u2019s terms etc). I\u2019m pretty experienced at talking to coders and getting them to think about legal issues and risks for their project from an early stage, and achieve their goals while minimising legal risks (and I had quite a few discussions like that at Devcon in Osaka). For now I\u2019ll keep reading and learning and maybe poke my head over the wall and comment sometimes - any suggestions on how I can help and get involved  appreciated. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the welcome @wschwab ! I looked at the ethereum.org website. It\u2019s a a lot better than it used to be for sure. For me personally the EF website is unnecessary - in the sense that I know everything that\u2019s on there. I\u2019ve been reading r/ethereum and r/ethtrader/ethfinance on a daily basis for two years, I use dApps, I have a  Peepeth account, etc. I\u2019m not really the target demographic for the site, but that\u2019s just me. But if it\u2019s being targeted at people new to Ethereum then I think it is much improved. My main comment would be that it divides everyone into a \u201cdeveloper\u201d (who can contribute to the ecosystem by coding) and everyone else who can (impliedly) only contribute by being \u201cusers\u201d. Those are the only two categories on the website. But as you\u2019ve pointed out, the ecosystem needs non-devs to do a lot more than just use dApps (speaking for myself, almost every dApp I\u2019ve seen seriously needs the help of a good UI/UX designer). Perhaps reorganizing the site categories? \u201cUsers\u201d and \u201cContributing to the ecosystem\u201d, with \u201cdevelopers\u201d as a subcategory and other ways of contributing as subcategories? I\u2019m just thinking aloud - it doesn\u2019t have to be exactly like this - the idea is just to make it clear that it is possible to do more than just be a user and contribute more without being a dev? It doesn\u2019t have to be prescriptive pathways - just examples (or case studies maybe - could do it for devs too - of how people got involved with contributing to the ecosystem). \u201cThis is Dave, he\u2019s a designer who worked on the UX of [dApp]\u201d or whatever. @anett - I pretty much did what you suggest two years ago and then went a lot deeper. I\u2019ve done some (legal) work relating to Ethereum in the last 1-1.5 years, but it\u2019s only after attending Devcon this year and meeting a ton of people that I\u2019ve started to go to the next level and get more involved. It\u2019s a decentralized system and I\u2019m not suggesting anything prescriptive like a fixed career path but I certainly think more can be done to a) identify areas in need of non-programmer contributions (I can think of a bunch off the top of my head); b) highlight the need; and c) publicize how it is possible to get involved and contribute. (Lots of ideas - for example, a discussion forum or something to match up devs working on a project with non-dev skills they need and vice versa?) EDIT: Just to add. I came to this forum out of idle curiosity. I happened to see this thread and decided to create an account and post, but if I hadn\u2019t seen it, I would have just thought \u201cI don\u2019t understand most of this stuff - there\u2019s nothing for me here\u201d and gone on my way. How many people is ethereum.org (for example), losing due to a similar dynamic? ",

I just saw someone asking on Reddit about resources to learn more about Ethereum (as a dev) and saw they were directed to the website, so it does seem to be happening. @serapath - I saw the site (it looks cool) and read the Medium article. If I understand correctly, it\u2019s meant to be an easily searchable resource of smart contract code for devs? Both  for newbies to learn examples of good basic code and more advanced people to find examples of more advanced code? With the idea that (eventually) non-devs can learn enough of the basics to do some simple smart contract coding for their own purposes? Is that about right? If so, I\u2019m not sure where to start - should I wait for the beginner friendly templates and look through them (when they are released)? @jpitts - thank you, good to be here. I looked at r/ethlaw - it\u2019s a great resource of useful legal developments (and I like the focus on Ethereum, because otherwise the discussion can lose focus and become more about Bitcoin or other cryptos - that\u2019s not necessarily bad, but the higher level the discussion, the more vague it tends to get). You posted the EU Blockchain Observatory report on the legal framework for blockchain - I just saw them present it in person at the Convergence conference in Malaga this week.     jpitts:  Overall each field needs organizers in the community, and you are welcome to do that on our Forum and at events where Ethereum people gather. Some \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d rings include the Education Ring and the Data Ring.   On this point - yes, I\u2019d definitely like to help with this (or organize it if no one is doing it already), if I knew where to start. If I understand correctly, \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d rings are basically interest groups? And the Education Ring and Data Ring are categories of interest groups, and an \u201cEthlaw\u201d group (so to speak) might fall under one or both of those? And the idea would be for the community organizers to generate discussions in the \u201cEthlaw\u201d group in this Forum (amongst lawyers interested in Ethereum or anyone interested in the legal/regulatory issues really, doesn\u2019t have to be lawyers only), or Reddit etc, and organize in person meetups if there\u2019s enough interest, at EthCC/EDCON, etc?

                    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019ve poked around at posts on Ethereum Magicians for a while now, but think this is my first post. I think I found it through the Gitcoin communty. My interest in it originally was very much related to this post. A few topics / posts that particularly piqued my interest were about product management in crypto as well as business models in crypto, but as I think is evident from this post those are few and far between so I\u2019m glad to see this discussion. I\u2019ve been a product manager for ~7 years in non-crypto companies and a pretty enthusiastic follower of crypto for ~3 years. About a year ago, I joined a new company to be the product lead on a permissioned blockchain product and am really grateful to have made the jump and am enjoying the work a lot. Since it took some time to make that switch and I got impatient, I started a podcast with a friend of mine who I used to work with and is a fantastic UX designer with experience as a PM as well. I\u2019ll go into the podcast more below. Sharing all of this to give some context on what I share. My perspective is that we need (and have needed) more non-developers to jump into the fray in order to help crypto succeed. Not too long ago I hear a similar sentiment echoed by folks like Chris Dixon on some a16z podcast. Bringing diverse perspectives and experiences into building products is essential for any type of product, but I\u2019d argue it\u2019s even more critical in crypto. That\u2019s because the technology is even more complicated than in traditional software products. I\u2019ll highlight a few bright spots in crypto where I think non-developers are being integrated into growing the space, or at least where I think non-technical topics are getting some love. First is Gitcoin. While definitely quite dev-focused, I think Kevin Owocki (founder of Gitcoin) has done an amazing job growing the project and being vocal about things like business model innovation. Even the way they have developed their community is worth learning about given how critical community development is to open source and crypto product success. As noted already, Gitcoin Quests and their products in general were necessarily focused on devs, but I know they have ambitions to branch out and we\u2019re already starting to see that. Second is ConsenSys. They technically fund Gitcoin, at least in part, but they have definitely done some great work in the space to promote thinking outside of technical and dev topics. In particular, I think they have done great work in the design space and recommend checking out the ConsenSys Design website as well as their blog posts on design topics. Third, though not at quite the same level of depth, I\u2019d recommend checking out Chris Remus. He\u2019s an interesting guy who has been pretty vocal about product management in crypto. You can check out blockchainpm.substack.com and his Twitter account @cjremus. Fourth is a shameless plug for the podcast that I started and co-host with my good friend Nick. We started it because, as a former PM - UX pair trying to make successful products, we wanted to understand how teams in crypto are dealing with the unique challenges of building with this technology on top of all of the typical challenges any team faces when trying to build great products. There are plenty of resources and podcasts (like Epicenter) focused on technical aspects, but few to our knowledge cover the vast space of everything else you need to get right to have a successful product. So we interview founders and builders in the space to get a more holistic view of how they are building products. Several areas we like to focus on are user research, UX / design, testing assumptions and experimentation, how teams organize and manage their day-to-day processes, go-to-market strategies, business models, etc. In fact, the name of the podcast, Fork the Product, is inspired by the concept that in crypto anyone can fork the code of your product, making it really difficult to build sustainable business models. We completed and have season 1 up already at forktheproduct.com (also on Spotify, Apple, Google and most podcast players) and we\u2019re planning to release season 2 within the next week or so. In season 2, we narrowed the focus to two topics - Non-Fungible Token (NFT) projects and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects. We are grateful to have lined up some amazing guests including SuperRare, Compound, OpenSea, Dapper Labs / CryptoKitties, PoolTogether and more. I\u2019d greatly appreciate if anyone here would give us a listen, share, rate, etc., but also reach out with any ideas or feedback for the show! We\u2019re passionate about this stuff and hope this can become a resource for the whole community, and especially for the non-dev / non-technical crypto community. Sorry for the long post, this topic gets me energized\u2026 ",

What I find interesting - from a sample size of two in this thread - is that people who are sufficiently interested in Ethereum/crypto will find a way to get involved even as non-devs - but there would be huge benefits from signposting the path to make it a bit easier and make it clear there are opportunities in crypto (for non-devs) that go beyond \u201cHODL\u201d.

And the Education Ring and Data Ring are categories of interest groups, and an \u201cEthlaw\u201d group (so to speak) might fall under one or both of those?   Yes, they can be interest groups, although generally we encourage community members to organize into working groups. Whatever the interest may be, set an agenda and get some things done! Most Rings are centered around a category of EIPs / ERCs, or have a long-term agenda such as improving education, funding, security, data availability.     Ashaman:  And the idea would be for the community organizers to generate discussions in the \u201cEthlaw\u201d group in this Forum (amongst lawyers interested in Ethereum or anyone interested in the legal/regulatory issues really, doesn\u2019t have to be lawyers only), or Reddit etc, and organize in person meetups if there\u2019s enough interest, at EthCC/EDCON, etc?   Even though there may be better online places for particular topics like law (https://reddit.com/r/ethlaw) or UX / design (http://discuss.conflux.network/), the Magicians\u2019 Forum here is a good way to go for organizing any in-person meetings adjacent to crypto conferences and other large gatherings.
