Has the community thought through a proposal to actually switch on the fees? There are obvious reasons for a no and a yes. Yes - UNI becomes an income-generating token and will appreciate in price No - Incentives becomes misalign between LPs and Token holders. Potential solution - add back liquidity mining for UNI to certain pools (at a much lower rate) This may incentivize LP to stay so they can earn an appreciating asset. Thoughts? ",

I don\u2019t really follow along with the reasons not to, although I understand that incentivizing LPs in the market to give liquidity to Uniswap is an important factor to UNIs long-term value. I\u2019ve wondered if there would be a way to programmatically alternate between incentives that keep us competitive when the situation calls for it and paying \u201cdividends\u201d (hopefully this is a suitable name for it) to token holders when competition in the DEX marketplace is less threatening to Uniswap\u2019s market share. I\u2019d guess this is probably a while away considering there\u2019d need to be reliable means of feeding market data into the contracts + a carefully considered formula for evaluating the position of Uniswap in the marketplace and emerging threats. That kinda brings me to a point that\u2019s important to me as someone who only holds 400 UNI, but probably somewhat insignificant to others. How do we laypeople correctly evaluate how important the right incentivizing instruments are now, how important they will be in the future, and when exactly we should vote to apply them at the short-term expense of token-holders? Are there monthly reports on the state of the market we can read somewhere, are there easy to find articles that explain the antagonistic forces at play, and the performance indicators that we need to pay attention to? If we don\u2019t have this knowledge how do we delegate or vote in our own long-term interests? I don\u2019t think anyone would suggest we delegate blindly. I haven\u2019t personally come across any sort of curated knowledge base that explains all the factors at play, I have seen posts dotted around this forum that references dune analytics dashboards/visualisations that help clarify what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and on the Uniswap platform, but I\u2019m wholly ignorant of all the instruments being proposed and need help to interpret what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not the kind of person to beg people to explain it to me on a discord room, I\u2019m pretty averse to doing that in fact, but without some form of wikisite that can explain all the jargon and proposed strategies, I feel pretty lost.

These whales know the incredible impact the fee switch will have on price. Further, while the .005% could pose an issue to a select few, the transaction volume of  Uniswap compared to other dexes is miles ahead. So if they were going to leave for a farming chance like on sushiswap or bancor, they would have done so already so I dont see them leaving when other swaps also have a fee for stakers, yet dont have the volume to offset it like uniswap does.

However other protocols already have a fee switch and uniswap transactions are more than all dexes combined, so even a slight reduction in direct lp rewards still makes it much more profitable to lp on uniswap over other places. Additionally whale lp\u2019s are better than 90% likely to be uni holders since they have so much invested in the platform that it will actually be a net benefit for them. Easy choice imo, fee switch = utility for uni for small holders via passive income, and will result in a net gain for whale LP\u2019s because the price of uni will go up dramatically. ",
