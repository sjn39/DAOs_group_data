Reading time: 2 min read         Uniswap\u2019s  Penguin Party is bringing you Fish!    Hey there Penguins! Today, we\u2019re proud to announce that we are preparing to introduce Fish , a new social currency to control PenguinParty.eth governance on an off-chain solution such as http://snapshot.page. https://miro.medium.com/max/346/1*3YktdUmwm1xF9BSaQqHm4Q.gif(image larger than 4096KB) We\u2019d like you to think of this like Layer-2 of governance. By delegating to PenguinParty.eth, you can get your voice heard without paying all that pesky gas. This is exactly the kind of solution the little guy, the regular user, needs for governance. Fish  is a social currency that will:  Function as a reward mechanism to reward our delegators the right to vote in how Penguin Party will actually vote on-chain. -Function as a reward mechanism for software contributions to Penguin Party. -And will reward technical and non-technical users alike for discord discussions and ideation.  We have a working SourceCred Instance up on our Github which you can check out right now to view the current \u201cCred\u201d leaderboard, a measurement of everyone\u2019s current contributions to the project\u2019s code and discussions! You can find that here: https://penguinparty-eth.github.io/SourceCred-Instance/#/explorer  Everyone loves to FISH right?! With Fish , the Gamification cycle will be complete and PenguinParty.eth will be even more decentralized. : )  Are you Penguins ready to go fishing?

With Snapshot, the community can now ideate and inform the co-delegators on governance issues pertinent to the community and inform the party\u2019s decision-making in a safe, pseudonymous, and trustless manner\u2026and best of all? No gas required!

(We will target redeployment after further internal testing)  A Bug Bounty plan  is in the works! The Penguin Party dapp is developing nicely and multiple developers have joined the project. Three users missed out on the airdrop and will be compensated by the multi-sig treasury for the 1,000  they missed out on, by vote of the multi-sig.
