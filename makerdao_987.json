                    "content": "Hi, @Doo_StableLab. You can find monthly reports on the following tag: #financial-report . The latest one for March is available here.      LTM Maker did extremely well, Apr-21 to Mar-22, with 136M in net revenues and 68M in recurring net protocol income (110M including liquidations). This is extremely profitable and quite unusual. This does not include MKR vesting, which accounts for ca. 10m of further non-cash (but actual) expenses. NTM is misleading as it is not an actual forecast, just March x 12. Even on this basis Maker is still very profitable. Where is the landing point for profitability? It\u2019ll be the balance of two competing forces:  The protocol runs on a distributed network and in essence spreads the cost of operations to all the participants and validators on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that over time we should be able to scale revenues much faster than costs. We could expect the efficiency ratio (costs/revenues) to decline over time. i.e. if we 5x assets will we really need 5x the operating expenses / personnel? Probably not. The crypto lending sector is maturing so we should expect vault profitability to compress over time. Eventually we will need to switch the DSR back on. We are charging ca. 2% stability fees on most crypto vaults. The path to growth is onboarding as many crypto whales as we can onto our protocol. Dai and its network effects are a key differentiator in favor of Maker - Dai needs to be everywhere and it needs to be credibly backed for Maker to be interesting as a vault. Lack of multi-collateral vaults is a downside. Stability fees / net costs for vault users are the ultimate arbiter.   Mitigants:  Nurture and grow the crypto whales Increase the number of revenue-generating bets Improve asset productivity  Of revenue-generating bets, D3Ms, IVs and multi-chain are Maker\u2019s core business today. RWAs are the revenue-generating bet on business resilience for the future of Maker, to capture an incipient market opportunity early. Real-world asset lending is the natural logical endpoint to convergence with non-crypto related financing and a much larger market opportunity than the $2tn dollars currently locked in crypto, let alone the subset of that which is purely in DeFi of some kind. @teej explains:    Charting a Path For RWAs - The Case For Continuity   For DeFi to fulfill its potential, it needs to integrate, not steamroll traditional finance. For DAI to generate scale and utility, it must provide a bridge between atoms and bits. Like the Bering Strait, such a bridge provides access to a completely new and much larger market. To finance real world assets is to expand DAI\u2019s reach beyond the narrow corridors of DeFi. While the total crypto market cap is ~2T, global fixed income is $199T, global equities are $125T, and global real estate is $326T.   Finally, our capital structure could be our greatest weapon if leveraged correctly. @SebVentures outlines how Maker could start taking measured risks with our asset side. This would provide an uncorrelated source of revenues that can help weather periods of volatility, improve the backing and therefore attractiveness of Dai and reinforce the stability of the protocol for borrowers as well as open the door to reintroducing the DSR in a sustainable way over time. Investing our assets in short-term bonds would provide a highly liquid and diversified source of yield. The proposal to add an SPF to identify ways of automating yield generation for the protocol and increasing utility to Dai aims to solve these pain points directly from the equity layer:    MIP55c3-SP4: Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway   Our aim is to begin experimenting with generating yield on balance sheet assets and support DAI liquidity/utility, creating a new revenue stream for the protocol. As DeFi is evolving quickly, we should continue researching, investigating, and experimenting with DeFi-native yield-generation strategies.   ",

                    "content": "I was confused by mkrburn for awhile as well and had to really dig into details to understand why the income estimate has been so off recently. On the expense side, the main factor recently is the Oracles budget which included a 4 month refund to maker foundation, a 3 month reserve, and a 3 month risk adjusted budget that assumed a scenario where eth fees doubled.  In actuality, I think they have fallen so this budget should come back to the protocol in reduced future withdrawals for oracles or maybe a refund if fees stay low.  Unfortunately, oracle\u2019s need for a large reserve and conservative estimates will continue to cloud the expenses seen on mkrburn. On the income side, mkrburn aggregates stability fees and income from liquidations and there was a big liquidation event in January that just rolled out of the 3 month calculation (notice the 18.4 mil non interest income in the financial report).  I believe it was the event that caused the SB to be increased to 250 mil.  Liquidations are hard to predict but with the volatility we\u2019ve seen, it makes up a non trivial amount of income for the protocol.  It\u2019s also not the best type of income since it reduces the holdings of MKR\u2019s current customers and thus the annual stability fees.  For that reason, I think the real focus should be placed on stability fees as in a more mature market there should be less liquidation events (unless we decide to lower liquidation ratios for some reason). All that to say, the financial report @adcv has provided represents the true current financial state of the protocol and mkrburn\u2019s profit estimates are not terribly accurate.  Of course, this is not an indictment on mkrburn.  I love mkrburn.  If you understand the numbers, it still gives you the best up to date state of the protocol.  We only get a financial report once a month after all. ",
