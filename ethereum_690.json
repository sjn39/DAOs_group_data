This would have the benefits of anyone still being able to edit the wiki (they do not even need to create an account, although there are advantages to doing so), as well as being able to more easily moderate content. \u2014 https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki#a-proposal-to-move-the-content-in-this-wiki-to-a-wikipedia-style-wiki-site  Also quoted as above in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1053.

I agree that the syntax isn\u2019t as good as GitHub Flavoured Markdown. You would either have to happen to notice a change while browsing or trawl through the edit history of each page and compare the history of revisions. If you know of a Wiki host that has a notification functionality with a UI that is more preferable to you then I\u2019m all ears. I\u2019ve asked a question on WebMasters Stack Exchange about this, and previously I passed on feedback to GitHub Support to request for watchability. To watch a page on a Media WIki site, you tick the \u201cWatch this page\u201d check button while making an edit, or add the title of the page in a new line at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditWatchlist/raw. Note that there have not been too many graffiti edits so it doesn\u2019t seem to be too much of an issue now, but as Ethereum grows that may change. At one point a user (probably unintentionally) edited the title of the home page while translating it, which actually broke the link to the home page. I have added a warning to the home page to help avoid this from happening. Other people have added spam, or self-promotional content in areas that are not really suitable for it to be added. Another example: someone edited this list of dapps with a statement that is not true, claiming that the list of dapps on the page was sourced from DappInsight, which they added a link to in the list. I happened to check the change when I saw the latest edit was from someone else when I went back to add something to the list. They also added more references to DappInsight in the sidebar and another reference on that page, which were unnecessary. ",

We have to understand who the audience is and who is taking responsibility. Which \u201centity\u201d will run a single Ethereum wiki? How do we both collaborate and intensify efforts around one repository, while leaving room for other groups to run parallel efforts (forking documentation?). I am even sensitive to colonizing this site. Have had great discussions with @jpitts on Twitter, but am essentially \u201cassuming\u201d that I can move in and use the Working Groups space as an area to document best practices for having technical / design / etc. meetups. Anyone: question 1 is \u2013 which entity (including no entity, just a group of people who do it) will take responsibility for hosting, running, and maintaining the wiki at a technical level, as well as at a moderation level. Essentially, who gets to say \u201cno\u201d? I\u2019d love to see efforts like this go into a grant system as well. Let\u2019s gather some funds so N people can work on it for three months.

Personally, I think that main Ethereum wiki should be focused on describing different parts of the protocol and it\u2019s development (like sharding). It should be a great resource for client developers and core devs for helping organize and document the extensive efforts going on here. There has been fantastic work done here, and focusing it allows it to have even greater detail and utility to the audience you serve. Again, as it grows, you might want to implement a governance structure to ensure at least a subset of client developers and core developers agree on the wording and language used as accurate and understandable. I see this being more of like an EIP editor role, rotating on a regular basis and only concerned with structure and voice and ensuring consensus, and not making any political decisions. ",

We also plan a more formal set of guidelines that would be peer reviewed and released. The individual wikis can be linked together as a metawiki, buy I think each large section needs it\u2019s own group of editors and administration to be successful. This is especially true for the smart contract guidelines we are working on because they will ultimately enforce formal communications between developers and security auditors, and serve as the basis for a quality standard that people external to our community can understand when using products developed on the Ethereum platform.

[ ] no sidebar [ ] not able to search for content in pages [ ] pages appear to be out of sync, e.g. https://en.ethereum.wiki/edit/famous-bugs and https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Bugs. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Decentralized-apps-(dapps) is missing (on the WikiJS site). https://en.ethereum.wiki/fundamentals/getting-ether exists, but it was confusing to navigate to https://en.ethereum.wiki/fundamentals (click all pages in the sidebar, then click the arrow in fundamentals), which should probably not be a page. If you don\u2019t click the arrow but just click anywhere else on that Fundamentals line, it will take you to a list of sub pages in the sidebar.  I would probably consider any one of the above issues to be a deal breaker to using the wikiJS site over the GIthub wiki, especially without wikiJS 2.0. Also, there is no ability yet to watch a page and other features for moderators, but this can\u2019t be considered an issue as Github wikis do not provide this feature yet either, nor have they committed to doing so, while it is planned for WikiJS 2.0.

Is there a list of tasks for migrating somewhere that the community can help with?   The goal is to make this preferred wiki.  There will of course be others (e.g., ethdocs), that is more static documentation than a Wiki. I would like these to be eventually be using the github.com/ethereum/ repo, but it\u2019s not absolutely required.  I suppose whenever people are willing to move, and they can simply clone from https://github.com/ethresearch/en-ethereum-wiki and I\u2019ll point ethereum.wiki to sync against the new location. @Jamesray1 wanted the existing sidebar imported into en.ethereum.wiki, so I did the best I could with that via tables.  I\u2019m sure we could do something more clever with raw HTML (and if we really wanted that I\u2019ll do my best to figure it out).  One nice thing about WikiJS markdown is that you can always insert raw HTML.  So if anyone wants to have a go at it, . ",

I\u2019ve done a little bit of hacking on WikiJS and am figuring it out as well. I understand nuking the issue queue, but if you want the community to help I think it\u2019s most effective way to handle it. I don\u2019t think which repo is used matters. The history from what I can gather is that no PRs were ever accepted and there was no process for people stepping up to become maintainers. Are you actively looking for more maintainers? Is there a list / issue queue somewhere of what help is needed? ",
