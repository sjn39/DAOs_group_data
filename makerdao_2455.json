Paragraph Summary This proposal defines and formalizes a solution using the Weekly Governance Cycle (MIP16) for making weekly Actual Debt Ceiling and Actual Risk Premium Adjustments. Additionally, the proposal describes how to propose modifications to the actual calculation logic behind the debt ceiling and risk premium adjustments. Component Summary MIP17c1: Definitions Defines key terms related to the Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling and Actual Risk Premium Adjustments. MIP17c2: Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments Defines the calculation logic on how to modify the Actual Debt Ceiling securely. MIP17c3: Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments Calculation Logic Modification Process Defines the process for altering the calculation logic for the Actual Debt Ceiling. MIP17c4: Actual Risk Premium Adjustments Defines the calculation logic on how to modify the Actual Risk Premium securely. MIP17c5: Actual Risk Premium Adjustments Calculation Logic Modification Process Defines the process for altering the calculation logic for the Actual Risk Premium. Motivation The purpose of this MIP is to introduce an initial version of secure Actual Debt Ceiling adjustments and Actual Risk Premium curves. The Actual Risk Premium curves improve the Maker Governance system to more effectively and dynamically adjust Debt Ceilings and Risk Premiums to better match user patterns. Specification / Proposal Details MIP17c1: Definitions   Risk Parameters: Each type of collateral added to the Maker Protocol is associated with its own set of risk parameters, influenced by the collateral token\u2019s financial and technical characteristics. Risk parameters are calculated by a Risk Domain Team, typically using the collateral type\u2019s information provided by the collateral proposer (via a MIP6 application).  Actual Debt Ceiling: The Actual Debt Ceiling is the current Debt Ceiling set in the Maker Protocol. Note this is different from the Target Debt Ceiling and current existing system Debt.  Target Debt Ceiling: This is a risk parameter that is set by MIP12 subproposals, which regulates the adjustment of the Actual Debt Ceiling and the Actual Risk Premium in the Weekly Governance Cycle (MIP16).  Current Debt: The current outstanding Debt in the Maker Protocol (this is not the same as the Debt Ceiling).  Actual Risk Premium: The Actual Risk Premium is the Maker Protocol\u2019s current Risk Premium. It is adjusted based on the utilization of the collateral type and used to calculate the Stability Fees in the Maker Protocol. The Actual Risk Premium is the value that is added to the Base Rate to get the Stability Fee value.  Target Risk Premium: A risk parameter set by MIP12 subproposals which regulates the Actual Risk Premium\u2019s adjustment.  Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustment: An adjustment process to securely modify the Actual Debt Ceiling so that it minimizes the system\u2019s attack surface while still enabling growth and not frustrating users.  Actual Risk Premium Adjustment: The Actual Risk Premium calculation is based on the Target Debt Ceiling utilization.   MIP17c2: Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments The Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustment calculation logic is used to securely manage the free Debt Ceilings of collateral assets in the Protocol, except for those onboarded as non-standard assets (such as USDC-B). The adjustment process uses a parameter called the Target Debt Ceiling and introduces a weekly cadence for making changes to the Actual Debt Ceiling. When the calculation logic outputs an adjustment value of the Actual Debt Ceiling for one or more Collateral types, the changes are put up in a single (bundled) Weekly Cycle Poll on the Monday of the weekly cycle. Note that the Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustment will be calculated and proposed by a mandated governance domain actor. If the weekly poll passes successfully, the poll contents will be put up in an Executive Vote on the Friday of the same weekly cycle, according to the processes defined in MIP16. The Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustment calculation logic is further explained below. Calculation Logic Values are based on the protocol state Monday at 8 am UTC. If the Actual Debt Ceiling minus the Current Debt fulfills any one of the following conditions:   For collateral types with more than 20 million Target Debt Ceiling:  Less than, or equal to, 10% of the Target Debt Ceiling or, More than, or equal to, 16% of the Target Debt Ceiling    If one of the conditions are met, the new Actual Debt Ceiling is calculated as Current Debt Ceiling + 15%   For collateral types with less than 20 million Target Debt Ceiling (Inclusive):  Less than, or equal to, 2 million More than, or equal to, 3.2 million    If one of the conditions are met, the new Actual Debt Ceiling is calculated as Current Debt Ceiling +15% Notes:  The Actual Debt Ceiling can surpass the Target Debt Ceiling. The Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustment calculation logic may be modified by using the subproposal process defined in MIP17c3: Actual Debt Ceiling Modification Process.   Example Scenarios   Example 1: A collateral type has a Target Debt Ceiling of 150 million, an Actual Debt Ceiling of 80 million, and a current debt of 75 million. The next weekly poll would then propose to adjust the Actual Debt Ceiling to 97.5 million.  Example 2: A collateral type has a target debt ceiling of 200 million, an actual debt ceiling of 100 million, and the current debt of 65 million. The next weekly poll would then adjust the Actual Debt Ceiling to 95 million.   MIP17c3: Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments Calculation Logic Modification Process The modification process for the Actual Debt Ceiling adjustment calculation is completed by using a subproposal, in which MIP17c3 subproposals are submitted to the Monthly Governance Cycle like any other proposal. MIP17c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 3 months  Frozen Period: 1 month  MIP17c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP17c3-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.  MIP17c4: Actual Risk Premium Adjustments Actual Risk Premium is the Risk Premium used to calculate the Stability Fee of collateral assets in the Maker protocol. It is calculated as a function of the Actual Debt Ceiling, the Target Debt Ceiling, and the Target Risk Premium. Any time there is a proposal to adjust the Actual Debt Ceiling of one or more collateral types, there will also be corresponding adjustments to the Actual Risk Premium of those collateral types. The Actual Risk Premium Adjustments will be calculated and then proposed in a Weekly Poll by a mandated governance domain actor. If the Weekly Poll passes, then the adjustments will be put up in an Executive Vote on the Friday of the week to determine if it should be officially implemented to the Maker Protocol. Glossary of Terms:  ARP = Actual Risk Premium TRP = Target Risk Premium ADC = Actual Debt Ceiling TDC = Target Debt Ceiling  The new Actual Risk Premium is calculated using the following formula:   Formula: ARP = TRP*2^(2*((ADC-TDC)/TDC))   ARP Formula Examples Example 1:  TRP = 5% ADC = 3000000 TDC = 2000000 Calculation: 10% = 5% * 2^(2*((3000000-2000000)/2000000)) Curve Output:  curve1217\u00d7806 28 KB Example 2:  TRP = 5% ADC = 40000000 TDC = 20000000 Calculation: 20% = 5% * 2^(2*((4000000-2000000)/2000000)) Curve Output: curve-example21689\u00d71167 48.3 KB   Example 3:  TRP = 7.5% ADC = 6000000 TDC = 3000000 Calculation: 30% = 7.5% * 2^(2*((6000000-3000000)/3000000)) Curve Output: curve-example31673\u00d71148 45.3 KB   Example 4:  TRP = 10% ADC = 13456034 TDC = 10000000 Calculation: 16.15% = 10% * 2^(2*((13456034-10000000)/10000000)) Curve Output: curve-exmple4n1658\u00d71154 30.9 KB   Example 5:  TRP = 0.75% ADC = 19148224.3 TDC = 12000000 Calculation: 1.71% = 0.75% * 2^(2*((19148224.3-12000000)/12000000)) Curve Output: curve-example51694\u00d71156 13.9 KB   Example 6:  TRP = 5% ADC = 1000000 TDC = 15000000 Calculation: 1.37% = 5% * 2^(2((1000000-15000000)/15000000)) Curve Output: curve-example61666\u00d71153 28.1 KB   Notes:  Values are based on the Maker Protocol\u2019s state each Monday at 8 am UTC. ARP output is rounded to the nearest two decimals.   MIP17c5: Actual Risk Premium Calculation Logic Modification Process MIP17c5 is a Process MIP component that allows community members and domain teams to modify the Actual Risk Premium calculation logic (formula). MIP17c5 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 3 months  Frozen Period: 1 month  MIP17c5 subproposals must use the template located at MIP17c5-Subproposal-Template.md.

                    "content": "I had some thoughts about using an exponential curve for the risk premium. I believe I understand the intuition for wanting to use an exponential as it will rapidly prevent the debt ceilings from rising beyond what we are comfortable with. I agree with this tactic in general, but am concerned that an exponential may quickly reach rates that are very high, very quick in a situation like what has been happening now with COMP yield farming. Currently we are rapidly raising the debt ceilings to meet this exploding demand, but the new demand is unique in that it is not generating any downward force on the peg. If we were to have a target debt ceiling on ETH-A of 100M at 2% target risk premium we would quickly move into the double digits even at the current levels of debt. This would almost certainly exacerbate the upward motion on the peg as ETH leverage seekers start repaying their loans. Now we could also use the Base Rate to counteract this effect by voting in a more negative value to keep the Stability Fee ~0%, but due to the exponential nature of the ETH-A RP increase and the max -4% adjustment in the Base Rate, the ETH-A RP would quickly become dominant. I understand we could vote in new target parameters for ETH-A, but doesn\u2019t that kind of defeat the purpose of a sliding scale in the first place? All in all I think it\u2019s a good idea, but I think it may be worthwhile to look at something like a quadratic function for slope which is far less intense than an exponential, but can still curb supply growth if we go beyond the target parameters. Alternatively we could reduce the multiplicative factor in the exponential as well. Reducing it to 1 or 1/2 or something. ",

Also, if we don\u2019t use a percent of total debt then this process doesn\u2019t actually reduce the number of votes needing to be cast, and so has approximately the same governance load. We are likely to have to adjust the target debt ceiling regularly in order to keep a reasonable risk premium. In fact most of the time when a debt ceiling adjusts upward due to high demand for a collateral type I would expect the debt to remain above that level long term. I also agree that the exponential risk premium adjustment is too steep. ",

The risk due to over-exposure to an asset. This will be dependant on the relative size of the Dai debt from the particular asset compared to overall Dai debt.

I don\u2019t want to talk about implementation issues but simply the me\u2026     Also as in my proposal adjusting the target DC automatically adjusts rate - over the entire curve.  So just pay attention to that.   I think the whole fact this is not just coded in to the rate calculations directly means as Jiecut said:     Jiecut:  Very easy to overshoot.   It will overshoot both ways and probably be very unstable if used not as a software update but a governance manual process. I honestly think we are back to this whole discussion about general rate vs. risk premium.   I really want to hear @cyrus on this.   Should the risk premium be related to DC or should the stability fee be?   I always felt the risk premium was just based on the quality of the assets.   I suggested the idea of a facility SF based on utilization because it would allow the participants of the system to drive rates based on utilization at both ends of the DC utilizatio curve (SF going down if utilization was low or up if it was high relative to WHATEVER DC was).    The whole point of using a facility usage based SF was via a smart contract based code implementation was that governance should only need to change either the DC or the SF target rate to manage system liquidity and do it LESS often - not MORE often and with greater complication. I come back to a general question.   What problem does this proposal seek to solve?  compensation for risk in the system? Or ?  Without knowing the problem one is trying to solve I am having a hard time seeing how the application of this is going to help governance here.   Also the results of the formula basically vary depending on actual DC and target DC differences as dramatically seen between the examples.     equivrel:  Is it clear that adjustment of risk premium on a collateral type based on debt ceiling utilisation is a good idea?   Back to same question.   What problem is MIP17 being proposed to solve?     hexonaut:  You may be right that this is over-engineering a solution for a problem that is not well defined yet.   So I looked back:     charlesstlouis:  Motivation The purpose of this MIP is to introduce an initial version of secure Actual Debt Ceiling adjustments and Actual Risk Premium curves. The Actual Risk Premium curves improve the Maker Governance system to more effectively and dynamically adjust Debt Ceilings and Risk Premiums to better match user patterns.   Sure we probably want to discuss an \u2018initial version\u2019.  The claim in the motivation above that \u201cActual Risk Premium curves improve the Maker Governance system\u2026\u201d  This does NOT dynamically adjust DC and Risk Premiums - what it does is have governance manually adjust them and what I want to know is how we are going to measure whether doing the above, in a manual way through governance, will 'better match user patterns\" ",

We would still vote to set risk premiums, but these shouldn\u2019t change as frequently as the debt ceiling. I think this risk premium curve thing was too complicated and there\u2019s too many unanswered question about how steep it should be. But we should ask ourselves: what are the real risks of raising the debt ceiling? In the case of eth, there should be basically no limit, except we want to have the debt ceiling not be higher than 10-20% above utilization. In the case of usdc and wbtc, and other collateral types we add, we may want some cap. No more than 20% total dai supply comes from usdc, etc. And probably also it should not exceed some percent of the market cap of the collateral (say 50%, which we\u2019ve run into several times with wbtc). This kind of proposal seems better as a first step because it tries to solve 1 problem, and doesn\u2019t get tangled up with questions around the risk premium on top of that. ",

Each unit of DAI debt incurred in excess of the target debt ceiling would release a progressively smaller amount of DAI erc20 to the borrower until reaching a hard limit (~actual debt ceiling) where no more DAI can be borrowed. eg. origination fee rate (TDC utilization) = 0.1 * (TDC utilization - 100%) origination fee rate (100%) = 0% origination fee rate (110%) = 1% TDC = 100 million DAI current debt level = 100 million DAI new borrow = 1 million DAI DAI erc20 received = 999,500 DAI (0.05% fee) TDC = 100 million DAI current debt level = 109 million DAI new borrow = 1 million DAI DAI erc20 received = 990,500 DAI (0.95% fee) ",

A 1% origination fee is quite high, especially if it\u2019s just a short term spike. Can result in quite a high APR. Can be bad optics if it\u2019s not conveyed clearly. 10% isn\u2019t a lot of DC room for smaller caps. And one of the goals is for more scaling on the smaller caps. On the other hand this will add more OSM risk for ETH-A. Which might not be that big of a problem since you still get the origination fees and you have the actual debt ceiling limit. ",
