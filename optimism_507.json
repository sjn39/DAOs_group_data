(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): Mava is a customer support platform for web3 organizations. We enable you to support your community across multiple channels (your website, Discord, Telegram & Twitter) from one powerful and secure dashboard. Mava is backed by leading European VCs such as Seedcamp and we\u2019re currently live with communities such as Gitcoin, Trader Joe & CryptoPackagedGoods.

While we raised VC funding, the business ultimately didn\u2019t work out and we decided to pivot. It was a great learning experience and the fact that we remained together as a founding team proves that we\u2019re in it for the long term and are serious. We still had half the investor funding remaining when we decided to pivot and are currently using this to build / grow Mava. Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): New clients with at least one channel connected: 27 (+125% MoM) Total clients with at least one channel connected: 90 (+64% MoM) Total active clients with users creating tickets: 58 (+42% MoM) Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://zendesk.com/ https://intercom.com/ - web2 support players Is/will this project be open sourced?: In the Future Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 3/31/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: Our mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to web3.We\u2019re empowering organizations to engage and delight the next 1bn web3 users, through intuitive community support software that is natively designed for web3 organizations. Mava aims to be the go-to tool for anyone looking to start, hyper-scale or support any type of web3 community.Problem:Traditional customer support tools are not designed for web3. Today, teams are wasting precious time answering repetitive questions, going through endless spam messages, keeping track of a bunch of channels and going back-and-forth with users because they have no context when entering a conversation. Mava is solving all these problems with its customer support platform natively designed for web3. We\u2019ve started building our platform 6 months ago and are currently live in beta, with many basic features, such as aggregating tickets from different channels and various automation features, already live. With the grant, we\u2019d like to build several features specifically helpful for projects building on Optimism. We would like to build the following features: - Add Optimism on-chain data into our dashboard- Outbound messaging, with segmentation options based on this on-chain data How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: - On-chain data: showing on-chain / transaction data in the dashboard immediately provides context to the support agent and allows them to solve queries more efficiently. There is no need to go back-and-forth with the user and wait for their response in order to resolve the issue. For example, a support agent can immediately see that a transaction might have failed because the user has insufficient funds to pay gas fees, or a transfer to an exchange might have failed because the user didn\u2019t input a reference.Compare this to e-commerce, for instance, where support staff will always have an overview of orders in front of them to better assist customers and know what they are referring to. - Outbound messaging: we want to go one step further than reactive support and responding to questions or complaints. In order to onboard more users and convert high value users, being proactive can be very powerful. The idea would be that projects can send messages via web chat (and later on wallet notifications) when users enter their dApp, and these messages can be customized based on whether the user is a new user, whale etc.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: In order to onboard the next 1bn people onto web3 we need better tools. \u201cMainstream\u201d end-users expect to be able to speak with someone when they have a problem or question, but in order to enable this, teams will need tools that can help them manage this huge workload and automate and optimize as much as possible. Moreover, the outbound messaging feature will directly help organizations bring in more leads, onboard and convert more users by allowing them to reach out with the right type of messaging and education.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 15,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: NA How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): NA How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): All funds will go towards hiring an additional freelance developer who can help us build the features proposed. We will obviously also put sales and marketing efforts, but this will be coming from our own, existing budget and resources. In addition, we are happy to provide credits / discounts to founders building on Optimism if we receive the grant. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: - We will firstly need up to ~4 weeks to source a suitable freelance developer. - We expect them to be able to finish the on-chain integration work in 1 month. - We expect the outbound messaging and segmentation based on wallet data to take a further 2-3 months. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: - Build a module in our dashboard that shows wallet and transaction data. We want it to include at minimum the following items: balance; sending and receiving cryptocurrencies / fiat; NFT mints, buy, sell, trade. We would display from and to address / contract; amount in USD; amount in token; txn fee in a clear and understandable format. - Build a simple-to-use interface where our clients can segment their users based on wallet data, such as whether they are a holder or not, beginner or a whale, and allow them to send custom content based on this segmentation. For example, the client could send a tutorial to new users or send an invitation for a chat with the CEO for a potential high value client. Clients could also inform users of platform issues or new rewards or features to encourage engagement. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We are building a useful tool for founders building on Optimism to help support their user base and manage their community as it scales. There is no risk of churning after incentives dry up as we do not plan to give out any special incentives or sign-up bonuses to start with. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): NA Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",
