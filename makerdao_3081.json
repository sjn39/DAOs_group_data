Ownership of TUSD will be moving over to an Asia-based consortium that will be working with TRON to develop TUSD on Ethereum, TRON, and other blockchain networks.  The TUSD contracts are upgradeable, and this new (and seemingly unknown) entity will be able to update the token at will. Because of this, I would imagine that parts (or all) of the risk analysis previously done on TUSD will be nullified. In this case, is there a procedure to re-evaluate the asset? Alternatively, would it be more prudent to reduce the exposure of it? Edit: the language in this post has been updated from \u201cremove vault\u201d to \u201creduce exposure\u201d. ",

Once you had done that you would basically be waiting for people to close out their positions or get liquidated as they accrue interest. All of that is to say, i think something can be done.

Yes, as announced, ownership of TUSD is moving over to an Asia-based consortium that will be working with Tron to develop and grow the product. We believe TUSD is the same strong product you know and (hopefully) love and this shouldn\u2019t require a change to its level of integration in Maker. In fact, given the new ownership of TUSD, I think you might see increased usage in the community, which could benefit everyone. Additionally, in the interest of full transparency with communities such as Maker, we\u2019ve made this public announcement several weeks in advance of the smart contract ownership moving over. This gives communities like yours time to discuss the changes, ask any questions, and hopefully choose to continue fully supporting TUSD as you have been. Some details:  TrustToken Inc. will continue to manage the operations, compliance, and banking relations of the TUSD product. There are no smart contract upgrades planned at this time, we\u2019ll let you know if/when we expect any changes and of course will submit the changes for whitelisting in the adapter  I\u2019m available here for any comments and questions.

All of these will be dependent on third party attestations, provided by Armanino and on-chain Proof of Reserves with Chainlink. TrueUSD will continue to be one of the top stablecoins in transparency, regulating, and real time auditing. Like Rafael said above, while ownership of TUSD will be transferred, the original Trust Token team will still be onboard and running the project, and compliance will continue to be managed by the same individuals from TrustToken, Inc. Rafael himself will of course still be here as well! The product you know and trust will not be changing. The TrustToken team will continue to manage operations, compliance, and banking relations of the TUSD product \u2014 only now with further support in customer success, marketing budget, engineering resources, and liquidity. The new TUSD ownership means more resources to grow and develop TUSD onto more blockchain networks, and with greater global reach. We hope the community will continue to support TUSD, as it will be the same awesome product. For every development and movement, we will share with the community. We\u2019re here, like Rafael, for questions and comments. We thank everyone for your support, and looking forward to growing TUSD together with TrustToken and the Maker community! ",

We want you to feel confident that we as the new TUSD team is going to run TUSD with the same high level of trust and transparency Trust Token has always done.   What is the process for freezing TUSD (a.k.a blacklisting a TUSD address)? The orperation process will remain excatly the same as before. we will keep everything unchanged. We will only freeze funds when directly ordered to do so by a law enforcement agency or court of competent jurisdiction, and this agency or court provides appropriate documentation proving their right to issue said order. We are 100% guarantee that funds will not be frozen under any other circumstances.   How many signers are there in the multisig? This stays the same as before. An absolute minimum of 3, with 2/3 required to sign any owner action. More signers may be added over time for additional security (e.g. 3/5 or 5/7).   What type of multisig will be used? A Gnosis SAFE (gnosis-safe.io). The Gnosis SAFE is extensively audited and is the most trusted multi-sig wallet on the market today. It was used by the TrustToken team to secure the TUSD smart contracts as well. We keep that the same as before.   Who are the signers in the multisig? The signers for the multisig are senior members of our new TUSD team.   What auditing will be in place for the funds backing TUSD? We will continue working with Armanino who provides real-time attestations and an on-chain oracle for the funds backing TUSD. This is part of what has made TUSD the most transparent stablecoin to date and we intend to build upon the strong foundation that has been laid.   We\u2019re here to listen and to answer questions. Please feel free to message - your feedback is very valuable to us! What else would help you feel comfortable continuing to fully support TUSD, we\u2019re looking to build a great & trusted product and your feedback is valuable. ",

Not sure it\u2019s the best place, but looking at the Armanino report:  The Hong Kong depository institution also invests in other instruments to generate yield to answer administrative and related costs, fees and charges. In all cases, cash equivalents and other instruments are recorded at cost which approximates the fair value, or cash value  We don\u2019t know what, how much and it\u2019s not mark-to-market. That has a strong 2008 smell. I think we should make proper due diligence before accepting $50M of liability from someone (this goes for other stablecoins as well).

The largest and most trusted crypto-backed stablecoin will remain DAI of course.      LongForWisdom:  I feel like we\u2019re getting mixed signals here. Who is managing TUSD?

As @TrueUSD_Official has described above, the signers for the multisig will be senior members of the new TUSD team from the consortium. They will be continuing to use the high security standards that we have had before.     LongForWisdom:  Could you provide a list of these jurisdictions?

This gives MakerDAO and other users a chance to react to the change and decide if they want to continue using TUSD. If you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to.

                    "content": "Hey all, Thanks for the feedback, and understand the concerns and curiosity. The acquisition of TUSD is led by Techteryx, an Asia-based conglomerate with businesses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing etc. in the traditional real estate, entertainment, environmental, and information technology industries. The conglomerate sees a significant unmet need for financial innovation in global amongst traditional sectors, and have identified cryptocurrencies and in particular, stablecoins, as a key part of the next generation of financial products and services that is capable of driving significant adoption. For purposes of acquiring TUSD, they have created a joint venture led by Ms. Jennifer Jiang, the largest owner and a business executive with prior experience in the traditional financial industries in mainland China and Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Hong Kong. Ms. Jiang has previously led the acquisition of over a dozen companies, currently worth over US$3.0 billion and is deeply connected with traditional industries. I\u2019d like to emphasize that, while Ms. Jiang is chief executive of the new joint venture, neither she, the conglomerate nor anyone else affiliated with the conglomerate has control over the underlying private keys and funds. The private keys are managed in the same way as before, by the new TUSD management team with multisignature, a Gnosis SAFE (gnosis-safe.io) solution. All TUSD funds are held at fully licensed and regulated banks and trust companies in the United States and Hong Kong, including PrimeTrust (https://www.primetrust.com/), Silvergate Bank (https://www.silvergatebank.com/) and First Digital (https://1stdigital.com/). All funds are held in FBO accounts for the benefit of TUSD token holders and cannot, under any circumstances, be withdrawn by its owners for any proprietary use. All minting and redemptions of TUSD will continue to be verified by these custodians and banks regulated by U.S. and Hong Kong regulators before any TUSD can be created or burnt. Neither the old or the new TUSD management has discretion to create TUSD or burn TUSD. Ms. Jiang is a business executive and has no intention nor the ability to deal with private keys or technological matters. Importantly, as noted above, we\u2019d like to emphasize that (1) the same TrustToken team will continue to be involved in minting and redemptions of TUSD, for compliance and for management of the underlying reserves, (2) the underlying reserves will continue to be audited and attested to on a live basis by Armanino LLP, a top 25 accounting and audit firm based in the US (https://www.armaninollp.com/) who, in addition to live attestations of stablecoins, also provide \u201cproof of reserves\u201d audits for exchanges (https://www.armaninollp.com/software/trustexplorer/proof-of-reserves/). None of these core features of TUSD will change based on the new ownership. This structure is similar and directly on par with USDC issued by the CENTRE consortium. Ms. Jiang will be supported by a diversified group of team members from the constituent enterprises. The exact team appointed for Techteryx is talented and experienced, with team compositions including Terrance, who is responsible for the engineering and product and myself in leading the marketing and business operations. If you have further questions about TUSD, feel free to reach out to us. Engineering representative Terrance: [email\u00a0protected] Marketing and business representative Annabel: [email\u00a0protected] I must clarify, especially in regards to questions like whether TUSD 's new ownership is Justin Sun - no it is NOT. We also have no connection with the company which invested in Poloniex. Poloniex currently doesn\u2019t list and support TUSD in any way. We are hoping to get TUSD listed on Poloniex in the future. We will develop stablecoins on TRON as well as other blockchains like AVA, and work along with our important partners to further promote the use and adoption of TUSD in the same way that TUSD has conducted its operations, compliance and banking relationships in the past. TUSD will continue to actively support the Ethereum and Binance blockchains, user experience and benefit will remain and enters the next stage of growth. We have also recently entered into a collaboration with Avalanche to launch TUSD on AVA as well. We will work to earn your confidence and trust, and we will go all out to make TUSD better. TUSD will continue to live on the Ethereum blockchain and support the Binance blockchain, and will soon be coming to Tron, Avalanche and additional blockchains natively. Again, I must emphasize that we will continue to work with @rafael.cosman and the TrustToken team for TrueUSD. Banking and live attestations are and will continue to be with the original organizations TrustToken Inc. had worked with. Thanks! ",
