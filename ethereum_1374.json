I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be there, though. Are any of the major voices in the conversation going to be there? (I\u2019ll tag @SamWilsn @adietrichs, and @yoavw  , though I don\u2019t mean that to the exclusion of anyone else in the conversation, just don\u2019t want to clutter this with a ton of @s) Otherwise, is there a general interest from anyone else here for something like this?
