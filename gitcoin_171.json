I wanted to let you all know that the podcast is moving into a thematic season about Digital Identity & Sybil Resistance, starting Thursday next week. Guests include: BrightID, Upala, Orca, Bryan Ford, Humannode, Chase Chapman, Ceramic, Disco, GoodDollar/ Spruce, PolygonID, Paula Berman, Idena, GovernorDAO, KYCDAO, WorldCoin, Unique Network, & more A lot of these guests are possible Gitcoin Passport integrations!
