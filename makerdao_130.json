Mike\u2019s background includes originating and providing structured trade solutions to Citibank clients globally, primarily in the channel finance sector. Prior to this he was active in the securitization market originating asset-based loans for the NY branch of WestLB. Most recently, Mike served as the Managing Director of Greensill, leading the Americas and driving business from $100 million in assets to over $4 billion during his tenure. Mike holds a Bachelor of Arts from Ohio Wesleyan University. Harbor Pool Updates Harbor recently closed on a supply chain finance program for an injection molding facility in Mexico. Harbor\u2019s program will allow the business to procure goods from their international suppliers on credit to better manage their working capital. Working capital management is currently of heightened concern for businesses that trade internationally as slow shipping speeds due to Covid-related container shortages and port closures have caused major delays to production schedules and sales. Soaring freight costs are also to blame for the current hostile global trade environment. In addition, production capacity is down due to Covid-related restrictions in petrochemical hubs like China and Thailand. Recent inclement weather in Louisiana and Texas is another cause for supply shortages and rising prices. With Harbor\u2019s supply chain finance program in place, suppliers are paid at shipment and the buyer is given extended terms, injecting liquidity into the supply chain. Injection Molding Facility Gets Working Capital Injection From Harbor | Secured Finance Network HTC2 is open for investors looking to allocate funds towards the TIN tranche (junior).

This is certainly driven by the increase demand due to change in consumer behaviors as a result of Covid and the aging population of truck drivers (supply/demand). Although, it seems \u201clast mile\u201d is not so much the issue but rather \u201clong haul\u201d, cross country. Internationally freight bottlenecks seem to be driven by a few factors: unexpected consumer demand, worker shortage and containers on the wrong continent.
