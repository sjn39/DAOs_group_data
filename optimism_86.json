From these information combined with OP token price history, I strongly suspect there was insider trading. Insiders were aware of the exploit 2 days earlier than public disclosure. A summary of timeline:   twitter.com    TechnoArtoria (\ud83e\udd87,\ud83d\udd0a) @artoriamaster  A summary of $OP exploit timeline. Hope this explains why the incident happened and why retails got rekt (spoiler: pure incompetence of @optimismPBC and Wintermute)\ud83e\uddf5   Optimism (\u00a0\u2728\u00a0\ud83d\udd34_\u00a0\ud83d\udd34\u00a0\u2728) @optimismPBC  Wow, what a day.   OP Drop #1 had a turbulent launch which we finally stabilized after more than five hours of non-stop work.  We\u2019ll be publishing a full, detailed retrospective on the lessons learned next week. Let\u2019s quickly talk about what happened.    10:20 PM - 8 Jun 2022           11                1            Key information: \u201cWintermute notified us that someone else had taken control of the address on June 06\u201d, as posted by @jinglejamOP   twitter.com    Optimist Prime \ud83d\udd34\u2728 @jinglejamOP  @veryHighLander @optimismPBC At the time of launch, the tokens were recoverable. With the intention of exercising caution, Wintermute wanted assistance from Gnosis, but they were not available until June 07. Wintermute notified us that someone else had taken control of the address on June 06.   1:21 PM - 8 Jun 2022           6                1            Briefly speaking, Optimism team was notified by Wintermute of the exploit on June 6th. The disclosure came to public on June 8th. During these 2 days, OP token price fell from $1.3 to $0.8 (BEFORE the public announcement was made). A 40% drop within 2 days is hardly explained unless there was insider trading.  image1004\u00d7512 33.3 KB  I request Optimism and Wintermute to explain: (1) Why did it take 2 additional days after the exploit to disclose the information? (meanwhile, Optimism tweeted about the airdrop retrospective on June 6th as if nothing major happened) (2) Was there insiders who, based on information about the exploit not yet available to the public, sold OP tokens before the public announcement? If these questions are unanswered, we cannot trust any promise on mitigation plans that Wintermute and Optimism have made. ",
