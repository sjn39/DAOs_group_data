(If so, please link to committee): Yes. This falls under the Optimism Tooling/Infrastructure Committee - [DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee 5 Project description (please explain how your project works): Ambire wallet is an open-source smart wallet focusing on security and UX. Fully self-custodial, it offers custom dApp interaction and gas optimisation solutions, features email/pass access, upgradable security (including multisig) and native swap, cross-chain and earning functions. Community ownership and governance is ensured through a native token.

Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: Before Ambire Wallet, the Ambire team developed AdEx Network, the first decentralized ad network built on Ethereum and the biggest payment channels network on Ethereum. Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Currently there are more than 92,000 registered wallets, 12,000 of which hold funds. Most used chains on Ambire are Ethereum, Polygon and BSC. At the moment Ambire wallets volume on Optimism is modest, but it has a good potential, so an OP incentive will help us promote Optimism among Ambire users and increase Optimism TVL.  stats-11283\u00d7238 19.1 KB   stats-21824\u00d7338 76.6 KB  Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Smart contract wallets: Safe (focused more on company multisigs rather than individuals, peers) Argent (not available on Optimism) EOA wallets: Rainbow Metamask TallyHo Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, all major components are open-sourced already Optimism native?: EVM native Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: May 13th, 2022 (Announcement) Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? The EVM ecosystem, including Optimism has always been particularly challenging to build a wallet for, due to a few underlying characteristics that ultimately lead to user inconveniences:  It\u2019s complicated to create a wallet and learn the importance of protecting a seed phrase; this requires 5x more time than creating an account on any web2 app. Most desktop wallets require installing an extension, which is a not a natural flow for web2 users. Multiple transactions needed to deposit into DeFi protocols, stuck transactions due to gas fees; you also need ETH or the chain\u2019s native currency to transact. Generally bad and overcomplicated UX - most wallets don\u2019t parse transaction data in human readable way which paves a way for scams, social engineering attacks and user errors.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?  desktop1903\u00d7968 127 KB  Ambire Wallet is an open-source smart contract wallet and has been built with security and ease of use in mind. It is designed to satisfy and improve the user experience of both newcomers and degens in ways impossible for existing EOA wallets. Ambire Wallet started as a web app, but soon native iOS and Android apps will be released, together with Chrome extension. The web app is mobile-friendly and 100% usable on mobile browse. Some of Ambire\u2019s game-changing features:  Sign up with an email/password without compromising the self-custodial nature of Ambire Wallet (*how it works*); Paying transaction fees in stablecoins;  Transaction preview: before signing a transaction, we show a human-friendly description of what it does, step by step; Automatic transaction fee management, automatic front-running/sandwiching protection via Flashbots; Transaction batching: ability to do multiple actions in one transaction (e.g. combining token approval and swap on Uniswap in the same transaction, instead of signing two); Multiple signers (keys) can be used to control the same account: e.g. a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger and Grid+ Lattice1 support) AND a software wallet; those can be easily enabled or disabled; Connect to any dApp through WalletConnect, built-in dApp plugin system for a secure and faster connection with a curated set of dApps (new ones being added gradually); Available on Optimism and 11 more EVM chains, built-in cross-chain aggregator for a seamless transfers between L1 and L2.  You can create a wallet with email and password only, or if you prefer use hardware wallet or Metamask as a signer:  login1073\u00d7749 230 KB  Find the best routes for bridging between L1 and L2:  routes-bridge753\u00d7448 18.8 KB  Human-friendly transaction parsing, pay for network fees in stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens, automated gas management:  transaction-screen1434\u00d7855 66.9 KB  The Ambire dApp catalog:  dapp-catalog-optimism1908\u00d7969 191 KB  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Ambire Wallet is on a quest to solve important UX problems of EVM wallets that prevent wider adoption. We believe that we are very well positioned to do it with account abstraction and the benefits of smart contracts over EOAs. The Optimism ecosystem will benefit from a wider adoption of Ambire Wallet, as it will reduce friction both for novice and experienced users, bringing UX improvements and smart wallet features that currently no other wallet solution on Optimism can offer. Ambire\u2019s dramatically improved UX, combined with Optimism\u2019s high performance and scalability can pave the way to onboarding the next billion users to crypto. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 425,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives?: We will run a governance proposal on our end to introduce a limited-time (while OP is distributed) $WALLET multiplier for Optimism users to support the incentive. TLDR: The $WALLET token is distributed to Ambire Wallet users based on the amount of funds they are holding in their wallets. There are several multipliers of these rewards that some users are eligible for, e.g. early users; users who transact often, etc. We will introduce a 1.25x $WALLET multiplier for users who really use Optimism often (more than 10 transactions in 30 days). The introduction of the multiplier will add $WALLET tokens to the OP allocation, so it will be an additional incentive on our side. Proposal for token distribution: All of the $OP allocation will be distributed as an incentive: I. For users to explore and use Optimism with Ambire Wallet, to bridge assets to Optimism within Ambire Wallet  17% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to bridge funds onto Optimism with Ambire 12% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to swap on Optimism inside Ambire Wallet 23,5% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to hold OP in their wallets instead of dumping 23,5% OP will be distributed as an incentive to complete OP quests using Ambire Wallet  II. For developers to integrate Optimism-native d\u0410pps into Ambire Wallet and direct Ambire Wallet connection  12% OP wil be distributed as an incentive for d\u0410pps to create Ambire dApp catalog compatible dApps  Ambire dApp catalog main page:  dapp-catalog-optimism1908\u00d7969 191 KB  Lido Staking dApp loaded in the dApp catalog:  lido-dapp-catalog1891\u00d7975 103 KB   12% $OP will be distributed as an incentive for Optimism-native dApps to integrate direct Ambire connection (connect with Ambire) and skip the WalletConnect modal on Optimism, e.g. Lido (Ethereum):   walletconnect-modal448\u00d7578 27 KB  Allocations and Targets     Incentive For OP Allocation Period Target     Bridge funds Users 75,000 Proportional to bridged sum (capped to prevent   draining the whole allocation). Each account will be eligible for one allocation per month ( to reduce sybil). 3 months 3,000 addresses with bridged funds from all EVM networks to Optimism for 3 months   Swap Users 50,000 Proportional to swapped sum (capped to prevent   draining the whole allocation). Each account will be eligible for one allocation per month ( to reduce sybil). 3 months Volume swapped more than $100,000   Hold Users 100,000 Proportional to OP held and gradually unlocked if users hold OP in their Ambire wallets for a longer period 6 months TVL OP held on Optimism ~ $1m   OP Quests Users 100,000 Reward users who complete all 18 Op quests using Ambire wallet 3 months 3,000 Ambire users to complete all 18 OP quests   Integrate into dApp catalog Devs 50,000 Reward/incentivize developers who integrate their protocols in the Ambire dapp catalog - targeted for all native Optimism dapps 3 months 25 dApps added to the Ambire dapp catalog   Integrate direct Ambire connection Devs 50,000 Incentive for Optimism-native dApps to integrate direct Ambire connection (connect with Ambire) on Optimism, e.g. Lido (Ethereum): 3 months 25 dApps with direct Ambire connection     Sybil-resistance We will apply all standard practices like on-chain behaviour analysis to prevent sybil manipulation. Additionally we will simply try to incentivise users to stick to 1-2 wallets, instead of creating additional ones:  Introduce a limitation of rewards per account that still allows users to get the same reward multiple times if they continually and reasonably use the wallet on Optimism - e.g. get rewards for bridging and swapping every month Stimulate users to hold OP in their wallets and reduce dumping of the OP tokens and incentivize long term usage of both Ambire and Optimism Introduce $WALLET reward multipliers for frequent use of wallets on Optimism, additionally incentivizing people to stick to one wallet  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) All Ambire Wallets have the same bytecode (you can find the bytecode here) and are minimal proxies with this contract as base: 0x2a2b85eb1054d6f0c6c2e37da05ed3e5fea684ef This method of facilitating accountability is unique for Ambire Wallet and not possible with regular EOA wallets.

We read that shorter periods are preferred when applying for OP grants, so we tried to fit most of the incentives in 3 months.

However, wrapping the deployed wallet with 4337 functionality will be more challenging since your fallback function doesn\u2019t implement external \u201cfallback handlers\u201d.  Gnosis Safe was able to add the functionality through wrapping, but adding a module and a fallback handler that implements the validation function.  Without this, it can be a challenge.

No one has yet completely eradicated sybil exploits and probably neither will we, but we believe that we can mitigate it to some extent:     vanzoo:   Introduce a limitation of rewards per account that still allows users to get the same reward multiple times if they continually and reasonably use the wallet on Optimism - e.g. get rewards for bridging and swapping every month     We won\u2019t limit people to claim only once per account, but introduce a conscious multimple claims during a longer period. This will probably incentivize people to use the accounts over time and stick to them. This will be combined with:      vanzoo:   Introduce $WALLET reward multipliers for frequent use of wallets on Optimism, additionally incentivizing people to stick to one wallet    If you know that you will get even more OP if you use the wallet often, you will probably try to optimize how you are using it and invest your time to create the optimal allocation of your funds. This doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be any wash trading or sybillers, but being a wallet we believe that we are in a good position to have people stick to one account and get more OP on one place instead of wasting time to create more accounts. Of course additionally we can analyze on-chain activity and make it harder for wallets to be eligible for OP incentives - set minimum amount of transactions to be made or detect if wallets are just moving the same tokens between each other to simulate activity.

                    "content": "There are two other proposals quite similar to this one:   [Review][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism \ud83c\udf08 Rainbow (already passed) [REVIEW][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism \ud83e\udd1d Tally Ho - #36 by FilterBySpam  What all three have in common is that they mean to incentivize wallet users to use Optimism (with the given wallet) and perform some special actions like swapping tokens or holding OP for a specific period of time. However, all of them lack detailed plans on how they are supposed to distribute funds to the users. The Rainbow team mentioned that they are already working with some people from Optimism Foundation in order to come up with some incentive structure. I believe that all wallets should have the same incentives structure or at least that their incentive structures should not be competitive - it wouldn\u2019t make sense for Optimism to pay more for swapping tokens in one wallet than in another wallet (of course each wallet is free to additionally reward users for those actions apart from OP rewards). Moreover, Rainbow proposal introduces KPI milestone that needs to be achieved before releasing additional funds (only 30% of the requested amount is released upfront), I believe that the other proposals should also include similar KPI requirements. Given that I believe that a common incentive structure should be obtained before proceeding further with such proposals. Furthermore, both TallyHo and Ambire proposals include using ~25% of the allocated funds in order to incentivize dApp developers to integrate with their wallets. I believe this part of the proposal should be excluded to a separate one so that community would be able to decide if OP should directly fund this (as this benefits more the wallet itself and not OP ecosystem) and those grants if separated would be substantial by themselves (~100k OP). To be clear - I\u2019m not against OP funding this, just would like to see it separated from the grants to incentivize using Optimism with the given wallet (also to be able to compare those grants as apples to apples). Moreover, it might be worth considering making sure that OP is not rewarding the same wallet for using Optimism across different wallets. Right now it feels like overkill to me, but from OP perspective it\u2019s quite possible that a single user will farm OP rewards for the same Optimism activity in every wallet with an incentive structure (yet I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s necessarily bad). To summarise, what I propose would be to:  Separate wallet integration into separate proposals. Streamline the work on incentive structure between Rainbow, Tally Ho, and Ambire to have a common incentive schema between wallets (or at least make sure that common parts between wallets are not competitive). Wait before proceeding with any additional grants related to incentivizing using Optimism in wallets until the common incentive structure is obtained.  Of course, in order for this plan to work it would be necessary to effectively work on the common incentive structure, but each of the projects needs to figure it out before implementing anything anyway, so it seems like a good milestone whatsoever. I\u2019ve posted a similar comment in the other mentioned thread. ",

                    "content": "Hey @kaereste & @Gonna.eth  thank you for your comments - very valid points in there. About the developer grants - yes, they might have more obvious benefit for Ambire/the wallet, but overall a wider adoption of these dapps in wallets means wider adoption of Optimism as well, because users will have more things they can do on Optimism, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s bad. However, we are okay to separate those two types of grants from the rest as another proposal. About the common incentive schema between wallets -  By no means we want to compete with other wallets solely by the amount of OP distributed to users. We believe that competition should be on the field of user experience and features and equal compensation standard for users is a great idea in this sense. That being said we will be very happy to work together on such schema with the Rainbow, Tally Ho and Optimism foundation teams.  ",

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2- About the project  Ambire is an open-source smart wallet that has Optimism support since May 2022.  3- About the following  The proposal was published on October 25th asking for 425k OP tokens. As a Tooling committee, the project was recently catalogued as \u201cTooling\u201d in the Grant category, and so we\u2019ve taken on the responsibility of issuing a recommendation.  4- About the proposal valuation    Added value (good to bad): average. Ambire is an opensource and really interesting project. But the added value to optimism is small since the incentives are mostly to using Ambire in optimism.  Impact or expected usage (high to low): medium. Ambire is free to use and all optimism users can try it. The proposal would probably increase Ambire usage in optimism but not sure if this will help Optimism itself in some way.  Current Status [Development stage/Open Source?] (early to ready): ready. The wallet is ready and  Expenditure plan and distribution (appropriate to inappropriate): reasonable. The incentivization distribution plan is reasonable though there is very strong sybil concerns.  Amount requested (high to low): medium.  The requested amount is reasonable compared to other projects but bordering on the high side. The fact that they are willing to start a governance proposal to introduce matching with their $WALLET token is favorable.   5. KPIs and impact tracking It would probably make sense to have a dune dashboard or some other kind of way to track how many users bridged to Optimism to use Ambire and how many devs built on Ambire compatible dapps, how many users held $OP for the duration of the incentives program (and how many dumped right afterwards).  6- FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Abstain The final recommendation comes from the fact, that as has been pointed out on the forum - there are many proposals approaching user incentivisation using OP rewards, but there is no common framework for user rewards structure across different projects. It would be unfair if the reward structure differed between projects, so we suggest delaying any further grants toward user incentivisation in wallets until such a framework is formed. After that, each wallet asking for a grant toward user incentivisation should follow this framework of rewards structure. Furthermore, we recommend separating the work for integrating the wallet with specific dapps into another proposal, so that this aspect can be voted separately. Once that\u2019s done we would be more inclined to suggest a yes. ",
