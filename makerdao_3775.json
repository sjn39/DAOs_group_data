Further Amazix plans resources (skills, talent) across client project timelines, with a policy of double, or triple-capacity (back-up resources) based on a risk management strategy to ensure successful project delivery. The Account Services team is staffed with Partners, and Senior, Intermediate and Associate level professionals that can double up and backup our professional team members.  Our Creative Solutions teams are staffed similarly, with creative award-winning horsepower, redundancy and capacity. We will answer the next question (#1) on Monday with a capabilities deck and recent work examples, and look forward to receiving more questions from this forum and are happy to provide comprehensive, transparent answers to the group.

                    "content": "In advance of this question, I saw a post from a mobile phone screenshot (not posted here) about issues related to Dai that are not marketing related, but supply constraint related (not minting enough Dai) -  And my answer relates to some marketing work we delivered for FRAX (a novel undercollateralized stablecoin that maintains a strong peg). - This is something we do not directly address in our proposal because it is not \u2018marketing related within the scope/proposal/request for proposal\u2019 - But relates to sample work we have performed.  To quickly answer this valid issue:  Supply constraints is not a direct marketing issue, but an operational one.  We are not tasked as a marketing agency, to handle tokenomics over or undercollateralization, or other operations, or issues not related to marketing.  Restricting demand is one solution (turn off the marketing spigot), and incentivizing increased supply (to mint more DAI) through incentives and marketing communications. In our previous work with FRAX, our work was related to community management, positioning, writing and blog posts to position them as an innovation leader in stablecoins.  The work was not related to demand-generation.  There is more than demand generation in marketing: positioning, thought leadership, positioning, competitive/rivalry strategy that impacts the perceived trustability of a stablecoin not related to demand generation per se but the long term viability perception, usability (reliability and variability around the peg) and liquidity issues some stablecoins face.  We need to quickly understand the algorithms, Curve AMOs and other types of AMOs to stabilize the price through its FRAX token. For example, in FRAX\u2019s case their peg was held by price peg adjustments driven by arbitrage by the general community.  The demand/profit incentive was required by FRAX to maintain its strong peg.  In this way the profit motive coupled by thought leadership (positioning, whitepaper, articles, blogs, community engagement) was required, coupled with the requisite awareness-level of FRAX to outperform its competitors.  Our solution was not shilling-related but more of a consultative/thought leadership positioning strategy to establish credibility, trust and viability. ",

                    "content": "Jenn,  thanks for this really good question. The Pros and Cons of Using an Agency vs In-House Marketing Team. The advantages and disadvantages of hiring an external marketing agency vs building an in-house team can be categorized into 3 areas: 1. Cost - Advantage to InHouse Team  Building an in-house blockchain marketing team (in-house agency) typically costs less as employees are compensated annually and have lower billable rates than agencies and contractors. However, if the team or business situation evolves where there requires the dissolution of the team, these marketing employees need to be either reassigned elsewhere or there is a termination cost involved (severance, vacation, and other termination costs) that can erode the cost advantage. Clients pay for the profit margin of a blockchain marketing agency. Agencies have larger economies of scale than in-house teams (media buying, software subscription costs (tech stack), project management that is spread over multiple clients. This erodes cost advantages of an in-house team. Larger Tier1 or Tier2 blockchain firms with larger resources can afford to pay for the best talent. This erodes or negates this advantage for an in-house team.  2. Skills - Advantage to Agencies  Skills in blockchain design, strategy, copywriting, promotion, advertising, marketing processes, and efficiency are likely to be higher in agencies than in-house marketing teams. The reasons are manyfold:  1. Depth and breadth of experience in blockchain by agencies because of its client experience, give agency talent much more experience. Agency talent leverage this experience in strategy and execution to the benefit of other clients. The synergy between agency staff and clients accelerates learning, innovation and marketing through leadership more than an isolated in-house team. Creative talent, especially highly skilled want to work for an agency more than a typical blockchain startup for these reasons: range of experience, marketing project variety, agency reputation and esteem vs singular client reputation/esteem, and that the creative talent is the core business of an agency whereas in a blockchain startup or company, marketing is often viewed as an \u2018evil-necessity\u2019 or secondary function to its core technology (engineering) and can demoralize or demotivate creative staff and contractors. The best talent migrate to leading blockchain and creative agencies. Talent with strong agency experience on their resumes get better pay and opportunities.  Agency talent are motivated by building a diverse blockchain portfolio on their resume to get more work and better work, and thus more income. 2. InHouse staff probably have less industry experience than many blockchain agencies (not all). 3. Agencies may have shorter turnaround times than in-house teams because they can assign larger staff working in parallel (like community management teams) and teams during crunch periods (e.g., Roadshows, Token Sales, STOs, IDOs) that require high temporary throughput during a shorter time period. 4. In-house blockchain marketing skills tend to be broad and generalist rather than specialist or specific. E.g., agencies may have expertise in NFT growth hacking, yield farming and staking positioning, P2P wealth management blockchain platform marketing, cross-platform composability and cross-chain platform marketing, DeFi Wallets, blockchain investor sentiment market research for an agency). 5. Agencies like Amazix employ staff and contractors including adjunct and distinguished professors in marketing from leading global universities, as well as retired and current CEOs that have vast and deep strategic marketing experience, available on-call.  3. Dedicated Knowledge, Confidentiality - Advantage to InHouse Teams  In-house teams understand the firm\u2019s blockchain products, technology features, services, and technology better because of a singular focus. Agency staff must learn all their clients\u2019 technologies and marketing strategies to a degree probably less than their client, but this is not true in many cases of dedicated agencies (Spark44, a dedicated agency founded by LandRover and Saatchi and Saatchi, as an example). There is less risk of confidentiality breaches/risk exposure to in-house teams (NDAs not required for in-house teams). However, clients who lose or terminate employees can break employee NDAs and confidentiality to their next employer. Disgruntled employees threaten this confidentiality and dedicated knowledge, which erodes the sense of control and confidentiality advantage.  4. Flexibility - Advantage to Agencies  For the higher cost, clients get the flexibility of termination and quickly eliminate or reduce marketing expenses without longer-term liabilities (employee termination). If BTC prices go down, and the market goes into bearish territory, clients have the flexibility to quickly reduce costs. Agencies with more extensive staff can provide added marketing capacity to clients experiencing rapid growth, especially in blockchain bull run-ups. There is no need to staff up, which can take 2-8 weeks for recruitment, onboarding, training, and team-building for in-house teams.  5. Control - Advantage in-house teams  Clients with in-house team have a greater sense of control over their work/project deliverables. This is in part due to listening to and heeding the advice of an external agency and its counterparts. In-house teams are viewed as \u2018on the same team,\u2019 but not always. However, agencies with professional best-practices procedures and controls erode this advantage for in-house teams.  In the end, it is important to assess your situation given your circumstances to determine if it is more advantageous for you, or MakerDao, to hire an external agency versus building an in-house team given these factors, at any given time. These advantages may appear or disappear given your specific context.  These characteristics are general observations and provide a guideline only and do not necessarily hold in every circumstance. Of course we would welcome the discussion to determine if these advantages outweigh the disadvantages, given Maker Dao\u2019s specific situation in a forthright and neutral way. ",

Cost You can check out their proposed budget here: MIP40c3-SP20: Adding Budget to AmaZix Marketing Core Unit, AMZX-001 Both at my time at Maker as well as previous blockchain companies, I never seen \u201cMarketing Research/Strategy\u201d that cost $500,000 USD for 1 month. This is even higher than top legal consulting and legacy business consulting companies. Also, AmaZix or any marketing applicant should have researched or figured out strategy beforehand and offer to the governance, not asking the governance to pay the team to study about the protocol and figure out the strategy for a half million. 2. Questionable Background If you examine the team\u2019s background. It raises questions. For example, Al Leong worked at S4FECHAIN and BitCover. Based on many indicators, S4FECHAIN underperformed. Their social media also lacks engagement. I couldn\u2019t find any info on BitCover which also shows lack of public engagement and exposure. If he couldn\u2019t successfully market his own project before, how are we trusting him and the team to help Maker?

                    "content": "Thanks for raising your concerns about my qualifications and cost. To address your questions, I was contracted as CEO for S4FECHAIN to help build their executive team and not operational, and this is not my own project. And due to the founder\u2019s underperformance, I resigned (Al Leong Steps Down as CEO, S4FECHAIN). As for \u2018social engagement\u2019 experience, I personally have approximately 130,000 blockchain and marketing strategy followers on my personal twitter channel (https://twitter.com/iDesignStrategy) and may humbly be considered an influencer. This is just shy of MakerDao\u2019s organizational-wide follower count of 158.9k followers.  More importantly, and notably, I am a criminal informant for the FBI, SEC and Ontario Provincial Police for anti-money laundering and financial crimes and worked under a licensed financial services advisory called QRC HK and InfintoDAX in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. I have undergone KYC, Due Dilligence (DD) and Enhance Due Dilligence (EDD) in my roles. In the late 1990s, I have launched products for Apple (MacOS 8, Powerbooks and organized Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conferences for 5 years), launched Adobe Postscript 3, launched Sony\u2019s HDTV platform worldwide, and launched IBM\u2019s \u201ce-business\u201d global marketing campaign strategy back in the late 90\u2019s. I started my career assigned at Ogilvy & Mather/Direct on a $40 million Microsoft global direct response account as well as being assigned to drive marketing for Intel and Visio. Very early on, I was a teaching assistant for an Advanced Marketing Management at the University of Toronto.  I believe in a lifelong pursuit of learning.  My personal and professional profile with portfolio, along with client testimonials and references can be viewed at: http://www.alleong.ca. There, you can find 3 years of market research studies I have conducted on the blockchain industry published with associates and a Phd-level business partner, Dr. Daniel Araya (Government Relations and Public Policy). I am a Senior Partner of AION Advisors, a Marketing Advisor for NULS.io, and formerly for CertiK, QRC HK Limited/Infinito/Moonstake.io, Wealth Square SAS, OTC Trade, and a former marketing campaign advisor for Token2049, raised USD 31 million in an ICO for a blockchain trading terminal platform in 2018, developing realtionships with Binance Labs, OKEX, Fusang and NASDAQ. I am a former consultant to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly (for Member of the Legislative Assembly Dr. Shin), and consulted as a team leader for Siemens on a global business impact project in Toronto, Canada.  I have also been security cleared with Metro Vancouver CrimeStoppers, as their former Board Director, and the US Department of Defense in the 90s. I am also a former Board Director for these social and non-profit organizations for humanitarian reasons:  AIDS Vancouver, Burnaby Hospice Society, American Marketing Association of BC, AMA Toronto, and the BC Borstal Association.  I have won 7 awards in the past 4 years for client work.  My blockchain working relationships have included Miko Matsumura, Scott Walker, Michael Terpin, and Richard Titus.  Amazix is also a partner agency of Bitcoin Suisse.  I have sat on the Board\u2019s marketing steering committee of Vancity Savings ($27 billion assets under management) in Canada.  Thank you for your important question and opinion and it is well noted. As for the pricing, we have 2 university PhDs, (Faculty and Research - Faculty List - Kenneth Wong); (https://smith.queensu.ca/faculty_and_research/faculty_list/CVs/Kenneth-Wong-CV.pdf), and (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyrgreenberg/) that would be and professors along with 4 senior strategy consultants and marketing agency executives/partners assigned to deliver market and global strategy for the Maker Dao Team. This team of very senior agency and academic advisors does not come inexpensively. The price is well under a McKinsey/Bain/Tata engagement and designed to be priced under a Top-Tier global McKinsey engagement. There is a typo in the engagement duration of the proposal submission, and for that I apologize on behalf of my teammates who rushed to put this submission into the DAO. It should not be 1 month, it is expected to take approximately 4-6 months.  This will be corrected in the proposal submission. If the DAO feels the cost is an issue (not within the realm of your annual marketing budget), there may be a way to reduce the cost by reducing the number of professors and high level strategy/ad agency executives on the team, to a budget or price point that  meets with the DAO\u2019s budget.  For example, we can halve the # of Phds and executive consultants to deliver a tighter engagement, shorten the duration based on an smaller scope of work for strategy to deliver that at $250k for a 3-4 month strategic marketing engagement component.  Let me know if this helps. As for capacity, we employ over 60 staff, contractors and partners and have a strong network of additional resources that can be augmented, depending on the scope of new projects.  In 2017 after our first year, we managed over 100 community management project clients concurrently with revenues of USD 17 million in billings by our second year.  Since the last \u2018blockhain winter\u2019 we scaled back, but are able to grow again quickly based on our experience.  We are likely the largest blockchain agency worldwide, and so if you have a concern about capacity, I do not think any other blockchain-focused agency, worldwide, apart from traditional global ad/marketing agencies and networks may be able to fulfill heavy demands based on your implications of capacity. In that respect, a clear identification of scope of work is required before Amazix would consider taking on this project. Finally, your comment \" figured out strategy beforehand and offer to the governance\" is not a condoned business practice in strategy consulting because strategic development and management is not \u2018cookie-cutter.\u2019  As a former member of the Canadian Strategic Management Consultants society (https://www.cmc-canada.ca/) , this practice is considered unethical because no new work/analysis is created (copying a strategy is not really strategy, but an implementation of a case study that may or may not work).  Strategy is unique to a firm and must be developed, along with frameworks for a client for a specific period in time and situational context. I earned an MBA in Strategy Consulting, Global Management, and Innovation (triple major) at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto; and a Certificate in Managing Complex Product Development from M.I.T./Sloan. And, a B.Commerce and Business Administration in Marketing from UBC. Strategy is a in depth process that takes extensive (months) of research, analysis, planning, modelling, testing, validation, risk management and scenario analysis for a specific engagement time period, and cannot be performed as pre-work for any prospective client. Not only is it impossible, it is unethical.  No professional consulting firm like Bain, McKinsey, Tata, Deloitte, EY, BCG, operates this way. But I do appreciate that some members of this forum may want this work for free.  Alas, we do not provide work on \u2018speculation\u2019.  A McKinsey, Bain engagement typically starts at $1 to $2 million as an entry-point. (at least this is what my friends/colleagues tell me\u2026 they are Partners at Bain & Co. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-mckeown-b8b9581/), and McKinsey & Co (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-buckley-cfa-a43890/) and my former MBA colleagues who is a an Assistant Professor at Kellogg School of Management (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillian-darroch-chown-a68857/) Last as a leadership style, I believe in collaborative, inspiration leadership, and leading by example. And that is how the Amazix team is designed to operate.  For me, it is a focus on getting measurable results, with a focus on SMART goals and marketing operational efficiency (like return on marketing investment ROMI, or return on objectives (ROO)). I hope I have answered your concerns and welcome the opportunity to answer additional questions related to the performance of getting the marketing work done at Maker Dao. I have reviewed the post comments on What are our priorities? And how can we stay focused on things that matter the most? - and see merit on both sides: the need for a clear vision and objectives, and your desire for expediency, cost-containment, and a clear action plan without re-rigging strategy, vision and mission in a marketing working group.  There is probably a solution that can address both viewpoints and we are here to help. ",

                    "content": "MakerDao: Benefits of DAI and why is Dai better than its competitors. To answer this question, we must do a thorough competitive analysis of Maker Dao and its competitors with respect to a stablecoin\u2019s performance (product), positioning, and key advantages.  Answering this question actually gets into the deliverables of the engagement and scope of work and therefore a full analysis is not provided here.  What I will provide is a summary of some initial findings that are intended to provoke discussion within the Dao community and Maker\u2019s marketing efforts. A qualitative analysis of major stablecoins was conducted and published by Wes Levitt, Head of Strategy at Theta Labs on Medium (January 4, 2019). The stablecoins studied included: USDCoin (USDC), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD), Tether (USDT), and Dai (DAI). At the time of the analysis, USDT controlled 96% of the average trading volume while all others were 0% to 2% (PAX).   Core functionality - stablecoins:  Performance metrics included 1) deviation from the $1.00 peg (winners were USDT, PAX, and TUSD, while GUSD and DAI underperformed.  Metric #2:  Downside deviation from $1.00 peg (winners were PAX, USDC, and TUSD, while DAI, USDT, AND GUSD underperformed.  Metric #3: Volatility of price changes (winners were PAX, USDT, TUSD, USDC) while GUSD underperformed.  DAI was not mentioned.  Metric #4: Market correlation in a downturn (winners were PAX, TUSD, USDC) while DAI, GUSD, and USDT underperformed.  In this quantitative analysis, USDC, T|USD and PAX all performed \u201creasonably well\u201d and DAI got credit for being by far the most successful crypto-collateralized stablecoin to date and for maintaining its value with ETH collateral despite the ETH\u2019s 90% drop in price since DAI launched in 2017. On May 30, Joel Koh conducted another analysis between USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI. Average APY from lending were #1 (USDT, 9.7%, 61.8 billion market cap); #2 (USDC, 9.5%, 22.2 billion market cap); #3 (BUSD, 8.7%, 8.7 billion market cap) and #4 (DAI, 8.4% 4.7 billion market cap). Communicating DAI\u2019s market capitalization of US 4.7 billion and US 432 million daily trading volume and 4.7 billion DAI in circulation demonstrates to audiences and traders, the size, scale, and liquidity DAI provides, and that it is a serious contender for a Tier-1 stablecoin solution. It may be strategically important to position DAI out of the pack of competitors and either with or away from USDT to capture top of mind awareness and be within the \u2018consideration set\u2019 of stable coin users and traders. DAI can be promoted to crypto investors by allows users to store its value without abandoning the crypto space because it is backed by crypto assets.  Since it is not backed by the US Dollar, when there is now rising inflation and a weakening of the dollar, DAI will be immune to this negative volatility. Of course price stability, minimizing variance away from the peg is critically important in the function of the stable coin. However, users, consumers, and traders also may have other reasons for selecting a stablecoin including brand trust, brand affinity (loyalty), a trial of a stablecoin, variety seeking and hedging, etc. and we must systematically analyze, a/b/N test and optimize the messaging and marketing mix to maximize marketing performance and differentiated positioning to deliver a compelling and enduring competitive advantage for DAI. Dai should minimize the negative impact of Levitt\u2019s qualitative analysis, or DAI should try to algorithmically improve its performance over time on these published measures, and systematically find other key measures where DAI outperforms its competitors and publish and communicate its key advantages, particularly as the only serious player backed by cryptocurrency-assets.  Amazix would be pleased to assist in this feature-for-feature competitive research and analysis if selected to undertake this engagement. Finally, Maker should promote that the DAI is a DAO-controlled organization promoting decentralization and autonomy vis-a-vis its centralized competitors.  There is greater transparency and control to users/traders and risks associated with centralized governance. Once this happens, Amazix is in a strong position to effectively communicate these advantages to users, traders, investors, and the general blockchain public. ",

When asked how you\u2019d balance us vs your other clients, this type of non-answer earns only skepticism.     Al_Leong_Amazix_CMO:  Amazix uses best practices project management methodologies and plans each client project with resource allocation, tasks, milestones, and dependencies against the total capacity of the firm.   I also find your response to your past failed project (Safechain) very problematic. You were the CEO and despite all the wonderful credentials you have, you are completely blameless and an incompetent founder is responsible for that catastrophe? Okay then\u2026 And as for pricing, some of your team\u2019s posts such as the one here still says 1 month, not 4-6 months. Being detail oriented apparently isn\u2019t too important when asking for $850k. What takes the cake is the post that\u2019s now been edited 39 times (and counting). First you tell us that the pricing makes sense.  As for the pricing, we have 2 university PhDs\u2026 and professors along with 4 senior strategy consultants and marketing agency executives/partners assigned to deliver market and global strategy for the Maker Dao Team. This team of very senior agency and academic advisors does not come inexpensively.  Then you edit and claim it is a typo in the duration to make the per-month cost lower but the total cost and work done is the same. So, same work but just done more slowly? Honestly, there\u2019s so many problems here that it\u2019s hard to know where to even begin. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this thread has convinced me that Amazix is not who want marketing for us.

                    "content": "    AstronautThis:  And as for pricing, some of your team\u2019s posts such as the one here still says 1 month, not 4-6 months. Being detail oriented apparently isn\u2019t too important when asking for $850k. What takes the cake is the post that\u2019s now been edited 39 times (and counting). First you tell us that the pricing makes sense.   Why would you make an assumption the work is the same? It was stated we would reduce the # of consultants and the scope of work would be reduced accordingly because of your budget constraints.  The range to be provided with Mitchell, is $250k-500k depending on the # of consultants and scope of work. It will be modified soon in the proposal. This will be the last time I address S4FEChain because it is an ongoing project and subject to confidentiality. \u201c, you are completely blameless and an incompetent founder is responsible for that catastrophe\u201d - I cannot comment about the inner workings of this organization, nor that the project is a catrastophe. I have resigned and sit only as an Advisor to the founder. If the founder listens to me and takes my advice he can, and if he does not take my advice he doesn\u2019t have to. I took on the role to help this young gentleman out for 3 months. My other credentials speak for themselves.  If my experience is being attacked then I will defend my experience, simply by stating facts and to provide evidence and client testimonials that demonstrate otherwise. That is all. In any event, I am not the only person on the team.  What is missing is your analysis of the rest of the Amazix team who would consider working on the project.  They are also well-qualified professionals. Third-party quantitative analysis showed DAI underperformed in all categories of a stablecoin compared to USDT and at least 4 other major competitors. I would argue calling DAI a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 is by analogy relative to USDT is \u2018not helpful.\u2019 because that does not find a solution to your issues/challenges\u2026 which is DAI has in its 4 year history, still has only 0.0285% share of market trading volume ($190 MM as at today/last 24 hours) for a stable coin compared to USDT\u2019s 96% trading volume ($666 Billion) as of today.  This is very far from MKR/DAI\u2019s current marketing material\u2019s statement and vision to \u201cdominate\u201d the market, say, in the eyes of a major shareholder like Andreessen Horowitz.  This obvious failure is not a \u201ccatastrophy\u201d but what is needed is a real solution and a discussion on that.  You need to inspire your community, users/traders to want to join you, not be alienated by you.  You don\u2019t want Andreesen Horowitz dumping your stablecoin because Maker alienates its community (or perhaps you do if you\u2019re an implant or agent from Tether or Binance, are you?)  From personal example, take this for what you will,\u2026 with limited knowledge on Stablecoins, I trust the biggest names and statistically, and rigously, by closeness to the peg. For that I always use USDT because that is what the majority use and what rigorous analytic qualitative evaluation has shown. I am a DAI holder as well.  Without getting into my \u2018personal\u2019 reasons, I do suggest you survey the market and understand, statistically speaking (99% confidence +/- 5% error at a minimum) what the blockchain community thinks about DAI and why they choose or choose not to use your stablecoin, as a start. That is objective, unbiased sentiment that would help you in guiding your governance decisions.  Power lays in the hands of the majority, not the few in a community-based/decentralized organization. Last, it is not automatic that Amazix would, if offered, work for MakerDao. Amazix undertakes a thorough due diligence process (either DD or EDD on the major shareholders, partners of an organization before any engagement, including PEP Sanctions, AML, terrorist financing and criminal records in our global database) and our bylaws require a consultation with our Partners on whether we accept the offer and engagement.  There may be reasons where we do not, and I cannot comment what those reasons are, at this time. I hope you understand. ",

The DAO is not a legal entity, we have no register of members, there\u2019s no way to identify anyone who doesn\u2019t offer it, and there\u2019s no address. I don\u2019t think anyone has >25% of Maker, though.   One of the topics we\u2019d discuss is strategy and strategic marketing communications. And, \u201cstrategic communications\u201d takes a whole new turn in a DAO. One issue I see right now is in the marketing materials published to the public (and anyone, including competitors can join the DAO, buy being a coinholder, and voting\u2026 an assumption I\u2019ve made\u2013buy their way into votes). The language in Maker\u2019s states it wants to \u201cdominate\u201d the market.  Now, if Binance (BUSD) and your other competitors and saw that, they could act, not act or ignore this mandate.  Strategy is not well-constructed in a public/open way for several reason.  Actions against competitors can be seen by the competitors and they can take pre-emptive action\u2026 (in this case, by buying MKR tokens and affecting the proposals and votes). How does MakerDao deal with this disadvantage of publicly voting on strategy where this is seen by potentially competitors?  Or is the DAO altruistic in nature, as imagined by the founders vision, mission as espoused one of the videos (\u201cto do public good\u201d)?  Or does MakerDao really want to dominate, and arguably take out its competitors?  Now, if MakerDao is altruistic, must it therefore act, behave and communicate in this way to honor and abide by its founding constitution? Typically, in non-militaristic societies, collaboration and alliances outperform conflict (GDP, wealth creation because of network effects, and game-theory costs associated with conflict). Is the vision of MakerDao to be combative, collaborative or a hybrid? Or does it not have this mandate?   If lets say Binance were knowing that your strategy is to dominate, and thus to dominate them. CZ, a tactic he may use is to implant an agent in MakerDao, or \u2018buy\u2019 their way in to get enough votes to affect MakerDao\u2019s success as a defensive or aggressive attack posture.  They have billions.  Does MakerDao have a solution for this to avoid voting for dissolution or demise, from an hostile competitive enemy? (e.g., hostile takeover)?  This is part of strategic management. Has Maker thought about these tactics and issues given it is publicly promoting domination of others (bigger, more well-funded stablecoin organizations)? And, do you know, now, in the past, or in the future, Binance won\u2019t buy up $500 million MKR and control the DAO, and then dump the coin immediately once self-destruct proposals and decisions are passed?  It may be costly for them, but war is costly for survival. Thus is seems clear that strategy formation with a competitive approach through a publicly accessible DAO for the world to see, is not necessarily to Maker\u2019s strategic advantage, or perhaps even its constitutional mission (\u201cto do public good\u201d). Would really like to know your opinions and thoughts. ",

This is an example of a governance attack, which been discussed and gamed out extensively.  Obtaining enough MKR to create and vote in a malicious executive spell (a contract which updates MakerDAO) would be difficult even for a well resourced actor. At present, over 70,000 MKR would be required. I do not believe any DEX aggregator can currently source this much MKR.  Furthermore, there is a delay period after an executive vote passes during which MKR holders can cancel it with another executive vote of a larger number of MKR.  MKR holders who do not ordinarily vote would likely be motivated to do so if the system were under attack.     Al_Leong_Amazix_CMO:  Does MakerDao have a solution for this to avoid voting for dissolution or demise, from an hostile competitive enemy?   Anyone can shut down the protocol by burning 50,000 MKR. See Introduction to Emergency Shutdown in Multi-Collateral Dai. If Emergency Shutdown is ever initiated for a legitimate reason, it is expected that the root cause of the shutdown would be fixed and the burned MKR restored to those who protected the system upon re-deployment. In the event that Emergency Shutdown is initiated as a system attack, it is expected that the system would be re-deployed and the attacker would have achieved a very expensive but temporary disruption.

Your credibility is sketchy and your comment that you won\u2019t address Safechain anymore is the opposite of the kind of transparency Maker stands for. Your proposal is full of empty and vaguely impressive sounding buzzwords instead of clear language and ideas. By your own admission, your rushed a proposal with basic errors about pricing and duration in it. What\u2019s more, you try to paint voices against you as \u201cprovocative\u201d or even make paranoid statements like the one below     Al_Leong_Amazix_CMO:  or perhaps you do if you\u2019re an implant or agent from Tether or Binance, are you?   You are the CMO of a \u201cleading blockchain company\u201d with those credentials and experience that you endlessly tout and expecting business worth $850,000. Then you go around asking users on the forum personal and deeply unprofessional questions like     Al_Leong_Amazix_CMO:  How much DAI or MKR do you hold?   I think your posts reveal enough to anyone who cares to read them. So to answer your original question, no I don\u2019t you constitute a resource that will help MakerDAO. ",

I am not at liberty to disclose further for breaching an NDA.  This is not an issue of transparency (and not voluntary disclosure in the case of Doo_Nam), but of legal obligation. Second, \u2018deeply unprofessional\u2019 seems to be arguably a subjective and non-qualitative term used. These are serious questions about anyone\u2019s alliance due to the fact that anyone can join the DAO, purchase DAI or MKR and vote.  It is neither unprofessional but a strategic question that  must be answered. How does anybody know who is in this forum?  An agent of Binance, Tether or Andreesen Horowitz, or other allied or competitive organization?  So what makes it, specifically, \u201cunprofessional\u201d to ask this question of anyone in the group, to qualify the respondent or questioner, who is masked by anonymity and cannot be challenged otherwise?  The person, from my understanding, is that anyone in this forum may a random person off the street with no interest in the DAO. As for your statement about \u2018credentials endlessly touting\u2019 - there is an entire team of professionals including adjunct and distinguished tier-1 and 2 university professors.  These are statements of fact. We defend our expertise and the price charged for them: between $250-500k for a strategic engagement.  That is the value that is proposed.  The DAO obviously can vote to accept or reject this proposal.  If a member challenges the credibility, it is well within our right or obligation to provide evidence contrary to the attacker.  We are not attacking the DAO, its members, but only defending against the attack of an forum member.  You and anyone else can maintain your right to your \u2018opinion\u2019 about our history and body of work. Thank you for your passion and commitment to this community.  Without it, there would no meaningful discussion. ",

While we have engaged in discussion about some of these items, we have taken all of this feedback seriously and are in the process of making significant modifications to our original proposal. We expect to release that proposal early next week. But we want to take this opportunity to provide a preview of some of the enhancements you will see soon. Instead of focusing on historic accomplishments, our revised proposal will focus more on the future of MakerDAO and DAI and its strategic objectives:  Increase awareness of DAI in the broad market beyond the Cryptocurrency community Educate the broad market on the merits of cryptocurrency and stablecoin Convince the broad market that DAI and its DAO structure are the logical choices for strategic financial success  We will begin with a detailed discovery process. During this process, we will meet with MakerDAO members, the cryptocurrency community, and various financial markets. We will assemble all of the collective insights into a detailed plan. We anticipate that the plan will include guidance on market segmentation, messaging, branding, customer acquisition, influencer marketing, and more, but will need to wait until the completion of the discovery process to finalize these plans. We plan to target the following primary communities:  Users who want to conduct local and global financial transactions with speed, flexibility and security while leveraging a currency with solid stability. Developers who want to leverage a global network for rapid and secure execution of emerging digital instruments like smart contracts.  Much of this work will be based on the unique advantages of DAI. We will explain how the DAO\u2019s unique combination of privacy and transparency makes it the best platform for financial transactions in an increasingly connected and insecure world. Bringing DAI to the general population will be as revolutionary as the establishment of central banks and commercial clearing houses. We look forward to working with MakerDAO to add DAI to this history of critical financial infrastructure advances. ",

                    "content": "Dear all, we would like to spend few words regarding AML provisions in a decentralized context. Who\u2019s writing had the chance to work in DAO and blockchain since 2012. We personally followed THE DAO case and the mayhem originated by \u201cThe Attacker\u201d and the ensuing Ethereum hard fork. As probably already highlighted in this chat and well known, the whole architecture of decentralized organization and cryptocurrencies is intended to remove middle man and make transactions permissionless. Governments are inherently opposite to that, they are centralized and permissioned. Therefore, decentralized cryptocurrencies are fundamentally incompatible with traditional financial system which is full of middle men and regulations (i.e. permissions). This create short circuit with current regulation on AML and Privacy (GDPR). Who is the client to be identified in accordance with AML provisions? Who is the controller of personal data? Even if for you these questions could be considered silly in a DAO context, for player like Amazix (which is a registered company tied to specific rules including KYC provisions) this is an issue. There are various papers and talks ongoing since 2018/2019 on how you correctly identify your client if this client is a decentralized organization and how you manage AML and GDPR rules in this context. European Data Protection Board promised to issue clarifications on data controller in a decentralized context and we are expecting an answer within 2021. We sincerely doubt that we will see a clear answer within this year and this for one simple reason: decentralised organizational, on one hand, and AML and Gdpr, on the other hand, live in parallel worlds Having said that, Amazix is a centralized entity and we have to respect AML and GDPR regulation otherwise we are subject to fines. We will be happy to support MakerDAO first of all because we believe in the DAO revolution. We cannot do this revolution launching molotov to the system otherwise we will be blocked immediately without possibility to grow. Now: the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent towards Crypto. We understand that while it\u2019s imperative to comply with KYC/AML regulations, it\u2019s of equal importance that decentralized authority is sustained. Therefore, we are currently analysing the available options in order to  comply with AML and Gdpr rules while being consistent with a DAO structure and functioning.

I\u2019m going through some of the due diligence process rather later than I\u2019d prefer, but it\u2019s been pretty busy lately. In the interests of saving some time and landing on the correct answers, is there any chance y\u2019all could help me out with a few things? Thank you in advance \u2013 I\u2019ve still got quite a bit to do and tidying up these minor bits will save me some time.     Mitchell_AmaZix:  and the CMO of BitCover   I cannot seem to find much on BitCover, and it appears to be defunct since 2018 judging from the social media for it and that the home page for it does not load for me. Do you have someone I can contact to confirm Mr. Leong is the CMO of this company?     Mitchell_AmaZix:  Additionally, Kenneth is on the faculty of the University of Alberta and teaches Marketing Strategy and Strategic Management there   Is this actually in reference to Mr. Wong\u2019s position at Queens University where he is on the marketing faculty? I have searched the course offerings at University of Alberta as far back as the 2009 Winter Term and can only find Mr. Wong teaching computer science courses. I assume the marketing courses were meant to be included in the previous sentence, but wanted to clarify.     Mitchell_AmaZix:  He is also a Founder and Director at Hiperwall Inc.   Who can I reach out to in order to confirm Mr. Greenberg is still serving on the board of directors at Hiperwall? I cannot find a list of directors (it is a private company, so no surprise there), but know that Mr. Greenberg left the CEO position a number of years ago and would like to confirm he is still currently involved as a director.     Mitchell_AmaZix:  Further, he is an Entrepreneur in Residence at UCI Applied Innovation and is an Entrepreneurship Ambassador at Cal State Fullerton.   Is there a quick way I can confirm these? I see reference to Mr. Greenberg being an EiR from at least 2010 to 2017, but have not been able to confirm this is a current relationship with UC-Irvine. Also, with Cal State Fullterton, I can find references to Mr. Greenberg being a sponsor of an incubator there in 2019 \u2013 is that the same thing as Entrepreneurship Ambassador?  Screen Shot 2021-07-06 at 1.27.52 PM772\u00d7260 73.6 KB  You may want to retire this graphic from your application. It lists Amazix as a client, as well as 3 companies where Mr. Leong was/is a corporate officer (former CEO of s4fechain, current CMO of OTC Trade, former/current CMO of BitCover). Also, OIO Holdings and Moonstake are the same company. On a final note, do you have any customer references that I or others could directly contact? Thanks! ",

This is because the original proposal focused on the planning process and only included 2 months of ongoing marketing activities. We realized that a proper campaign needed to run longer than that, so we expanded the service to run for a full year. This is what you now see in the revised proposal, which will allow for more time to execute the plan and deliver the market changes summarized in the objectives. We recognize that the final total could be subject to changes based on the outcomes of the discovery phase: it will be the result of our ongoing discussions and mutual efforts to outline a strategy that most accurately reflects the expectations and objectives of the whole MakerDAO community. In case you have not had the opportunity to listen to the community call from this past Wednesday, we really think it was very informative. We invite you and the rest of the community to take the time to listen to it at the following link: Core Unit Launch Pod Sessions - Session #13: AmaZix Marketing Core Unit AMZX-001 Best Regards, The AmaZix Team ",
