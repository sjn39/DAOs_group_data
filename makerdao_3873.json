                    "content": "In preparation for the launch of the Aave Direct Deposit Dai Module (D3M), I want to run a signal request to see how the community wants to set the rates relative to Maker\u2019s own rates. Since Maker has variable SFs it makes sense for the community to provide general guidance to the Maker Open Market Committee rather than pick a particular number. I see three options and we will compare against ETH-A as it is our flagship offering:  Match the ETH-A rate. This means we will target a variable borrow rate on Aave to be equal to the ETH-A stability fee. Aim for slightly above the ETH-A rate. This would be something like a 1-2% spread on the rates between Aave and Maker. Aim for a large spread. This would be something like 3-6% spread on the rates between Aave and Maker.  I will take a go at pros/cons of each choice:  Option 1 - 0% Spread  Pros  Maximize the amount of DAI generated by the module. DAI becomes a very attractive stablecoin to borrow against on Aave compared with USDC.   Cons  People may choose to borrow from Aave instead of Maker which loses us revenue overall (part of their fees go to AAVE holders) Revenue earned will be lower per unit of DAI minted as we are giving them a lower rate.   Option 2 - 1-2% Spread  Pros  Middle-ground approach retains Maker as the primary market to borrow from while still giving fairly strong guarantees at Aave (which helps with borrowers choosing DAI to borrow against instead of USDC).   Cons  Even a 1-2% spread may not be low enough to get any serious supply generated especially during a bear market.   Option 3 - 3-6% Spread  Pros  Maker retains status as the best place to borrow against by far. Module is only activated during excessive demand for borrowing which gives us a high return Having even a high upper bound may be enough to convince users to choose DAI instead of USDC for fear of excessive rates (15%+ surges).   Cons  Periods of excessive borrowing may be few and far between - diminishing the value of this module.   AAVE Rewards The D3M targets the borrow rate on Aave ignoring the AAVE token farming rewards. There is an additional question of whether we should be factoring in the rewards to determining the spread. For example, borrowing DAI backed by ETH currently has a borrow rate of around 3.5% if you ignore rewards, but if you factor the rewards in the rate is more like 1.5%. What this means in practise is if we were to factor in the rewards (approximately) then we would run the D3M at a target rate of 4% in the 0% spread scenario with current market conditions. This is calculated by taking the 2% SF for ETH-A and adding 2% which Aave produces in rewards.  Some General Thoughts I\u2019ve been changing my thinking on how to view the D3M over the past few weeks. At first options 2 and 3 seemed like the obvious choice. Why would we want to give Aave a competitive advantage over Maker in terms of rates? But this space is not like traditional finance. Aave the brand doesn\u2019t really own the smart contracts. You could make the argument that Aave governance owns the contracts, but over time Maker should become a larger voting share of that governance process because we will be earning rewards like everyone else. Smart contracts by their nature are just neutral pieces of code. Whether we mint DAI from Maker or Aave it shouldn\u2019t really matter all that much all else being equal. There are trade offs in terms of revenue, but we also get a lot of benefit by giving them a cut of the SFs. We get access to a team that has shown that they are capable of moving quickly and promoting themselves effectively. We also are paying for insurance that stkAAVE holders provide. This is not me advocating for running the spread at 0%, but I think it\u2019s something to keep in mind.    How should the MOMC target the spread?  0% Spread Small Spread (~1-2%) Large Spread (~3-6%) Abstain     0 voters        Should we factor the rewards into the rates calculus?  Yes, take the rewards into account No, only take the vanilla rates into account Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run until Thursday July 15th, 2021 after which any options which garner >= 50% of the vote will move to an on-chain poll. If all three options for the spread are over 50% then a ranked choice poll will be used. ",

                    "content": "We are still working on D3M risk assessment but I can share few insights because they are relevant to this topic. Because Aave v2 DAI borrow rates are based on specific formula where rates are pretty much flat between 0% and 80% utilization (0% to 4% borrow rate range) and start increasing very fast after 80% utilization, any Target Borrow Rate below 4% of D3M could likely cause very high exposures of D3M to Aave. Of course the debt ceiling of D3M will protect against this, but then the Target Borrow rate won\u2019t be maintained. Here is a snapshot of how much debt exposure would D3M have historically at different Borrow Target Rates (simulated range from 3% to 6%).  Screenshot 2021-07-04 at 15.37.111956\u00d71212 213 KB   Screenshot 2021-07-04 at 15.45.061960\u00d71216 331 KB  For instance if 3% target borrow rate was picked today, D3M would need to mint 322m DAI to Aave to reduce current borrow rate of 3.6% to 3.0%. Share of DAI deposits of D3M at Aave could reach between 20% and 30%, which is a high number considering liquidity/bank run risks of these platforms. If for instance D3M debt ceiling was lower 100m, rate would drop by only 0.2% to 3.4%. TL:DR What I want to say is that any target rate below 4% will be hard to maintain unless community really wants to risk of having high exposure to Aave in hundreds of millions. More on credit risk and other risks will be addressed in our upcoming evaluation. Personally I think it is better to \u201ccap\u201d the rate at 4% or higher if the aim is to signal to Aave borrowers that DAI is preferred market to borrow versus other stables. Otherwise the module won\u2019t be effectively capping it below 4% if it has debt ceiling limits. Also note that these dynamics are very much dependent on liquidity mining. Rate has been stable and at around 3.5% range because DAI market is in large majority represented by recursive leverage stablecoin farming where people build max leverage 75% LTV DAI positions. This is why the utilization is always around 75% which implies 3.5 - 4.0% borrow rates. As soon as liquidity farming ends, rates should spike, market size will drop by at least 5x and D3M becomes an efficient tool for fixing rates at lower exposures. ",

Aave handing Maker the keys to the DAI borrow rate also hands it the responsibility that come with it, and one should be mindful of how differently Aave rate changes \u2018imposed by Maker\u2019 could be perceived. To expand a little on target rate spread, what I find strange is that suppose you match 0% spread with ETH-A borrowing (taking into account the Aave ETH-A lending APY, lending rewards, and borrow rewards). Your net borrow rates for people who supplied something other than WETH to Aave will be downstream of that. And for collateral types that are also available at Maker, DAI borrowing may be cheaper and/or more expensive. I\u2019m really not clear on why singling out ETH-A just because it is the \u2018flagship offering\u2019 makes sense. ",

It\u2019s more like do we want to give them as good a deal as borrowing at Maker, slightly less of a good deal, or a large spread between borrowing rates.
