Example:   Wonderful Things You Can Do To Help Out  Operations Ring Tasks Contact: @jpitts Mini Project: \u201cGather Rings and Contacts from Prague\u201d In a HackMD, list out all Rings and other groups who gathered in Prague, see if any are not listed in the Scrolls or in the Forum under Working Groups. Reach out to those involved in unrepresented Rings from Prague and see if they want to keep it going here on the Forum or organize in upcoming events. Help these Rings get formed. Council of Paris Tasks Contact: @tomislavmamic Mini Project: \u201cRings In Paris\u201d Reach out to each of the Ring contacts listed in the wiki and see who is likely to gather in Paris, and what they might need. Create a wiki topic on the Forum listing these Rings and Contacts out. See notes from a recent call: Council of Paris meeting notes - HackMD ",
