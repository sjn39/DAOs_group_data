                    "content": "I\u2019ve generally taken the crypto-native approach with MakerDAO and have advocated against taking on collateral that exposes us to unnecessary or existential legal risk. I want to elaborate on some thoughts regarding the implementation of Real World Assets (RWA) at Maker that I believe not only harms Dai in the long-run, but potentially leeches much of the value away from crypto. Contrary to scaling our protocol, RWA\u2019s as implemented draw value from Dai holders and return it to the TradFi industries we\u2019re trying to disrupt. First we should discuss the mechanics behind a RWA collateral type at MakerDAO. When a new RWA is onboarded to the protocol, a single new ERC20 token is minted to represent the outstanding value of the loan and then collateralized into the system. In the event of an emergency shutdown, this token is distributed to Dai holders in proportion to the amount of Dai being backed by the debt. You can think of this token, therefore, as a receipt or IOU for the RWA loan that was issued. If the system is re-launched afterward, the idea is that users would be able to either deposit this token into the new system and await repayment, or a secondary market may develop for those wishing to collect the outstanding debt through other means. In either case, it\u2019s important to remember that Dai backed by RWA\u2019s is effectively backed by debt represented by IOUs and subject to whatever legal environment and agreements that they are a party to. The value of this collateral is therefore based only on the speculative value that it will be repaid with interest. I\u2019ve made an attempt to demonstrate the mechanics of a RWA transaction in the following illustration, but the general idea is that a borrower will approach MakerDAO with a borrow request, as an example, for 100 million Dai. That request is evaluated and, if approved, is onboarded as a new collateral type. As mentioned above, that collateral is effectively an IOU to Dai holders representing the obligation of the borrower to repay the loan. This leaves an IOU for 100m Dai that is held as backing for the 100m new Dai that is minted and sent to the borrower. In this example, we\u2019ll assume that the borrower is using the PSM to convert their Dai into USDC, they\u2019ll pass the newly minted Dai through the PSM, which burns 100m Dai from circulation and sends 100m USDC to their wallet. At this point there\u2019s effectively no change in aggregate Dai supply and there\u2019s 100m less USDC in the PSM. The USDC will ultimately be passed through Coinbase/Circle, where the net result is that there\u2019s 100m less USDC in existence and 100m additional dollars in the bank. At the end of this cycle, the net result is that the RWA borrower is ahead 100m Dai and Dai holders retain an IOU with a face value of 100m, there is no net change to total Dai supply as a result of this operation.  Screenshot from 2022-08-27 14-21-191402\u00d7720 130 KB  At this point, Dai holders and Maker governors are completely at the mercy of various and often hostile jurisdictions to effectuate repayment of the IOU\u2019s. MakerDAO is not a bank but would need to explain it\u2019s lending practice in jurisdictions where banking and lending is potentially highly regulated and traditional institutions are favored. The recent and tiring saga of Real World Finance at MakerDAO should give MKR holders some hesitation that aggressive collection would be available to it when push comes to shove. Furthermore, a large institution that is able to successfully convert an IOU to dollars is strongly incentivized to work with and encourage authorities to have Dai added to international sanction lists, which would effectively discharge their debt by precluding them from transacting in Dai. Pardon the Dumb and Dumber metaphor here, but Maker holders are sitting on a suitcase full of bearer assets with their own liquidity and value within the crypto ecosystem. Maker holders should avoid allowing Dai to become too heavily backed by RWA loans lest they, like Lloyd Christmas, end up replacing all of the real value with spurious IOU\u2019s of questionable long-term value. Since net Dai is neither created nor destroyed with RWA transactions, they do not scale the protocol as many have promised. We need to see them for what they are, which are vehicles for transferring value away from cryptoassets and back to the TradFi institutions that are borrowing from the protocol. When the time is right, these borrowers will not hesitate to pull the rug from MKR and Dai holders by seeking sanctions and booking a profit in the real world while leaving Dai holders undercollateralized and unable to liquidate IOU\u2019s. This will set the industry back for years, if it recovers at all.  ",

And there is clearly talk of the United States market, which is quite detailed, but there are many countries that need loans or companies from different countries that are not directly governed by the rules of the American Treasury, in the same way it is still quite difficult to reach an agreement and it is an uncertain future, but it should at least be taken into consideration ",

I agree on all key ideas and the general skepticism (as of now 2022, things might change in 3-4 years) on RWAs within Maker.     brianmcmichael:  At the end of this cycle, the net result is that the RWA borrower is ahead 100m Dai and Dai holders retain an IOU with a face value of 100m, there is no net change to total Dai supply as a result of this operation.   This seems correct to me.     brianmcmichael:  Since net Dai is neither created nor destroyed with RWA transactions, they do not scale the protocol as many have promised.   I am less sure about this conclusion though. If Maker becomes an attractive lender (forget for a sec that this is a bad idea for MakerDAO), then there will be a natural market incentive to fuel the system by converting USDC to DAI, by PSM. This would increase the total amount of DAI in the market. As in your discussion, what really gets sucked out from crypto at each loan is the USDC. In other words: for each 100m USD loan, we have:  100m DAI generated  (+100m DAI)  100m DAI converted to USDC using PSM  (-100m DAI)  100m USDC going to coinbase and getting converted to USD  (-100m USDC)   For (2) to work, we need a constant influx of USDC into the PSM => creation of DAI => growth of DAI. Remark: if this \u2018creation of DAI\u2019 with USDC/PSM can be considered an actual \u2018growth of the protocol\u2019 is another topic of discussion, of course. ",

There\u2019s definitely some yuck factor having this pass through traditional bank systems that can be fairly corrupt, but I don\u2019t think this means we should restrict credit flows to only leveraging crypto.

I think this type of thinking is counter-intuitive to executing on the latter part of this post. To actually \u201cbuild something better\u201d requires a cathedral building mindset, as in you\u2019re building something that you may never see the completion of. To address an unpredictable event as large as the failure of the nation-state seems a step too far. I think what you\u2019re saying is that you want to account for it as a risk, build the foundational platform necessary to mitigate such an event, and then monitor closely. The counter-proposal to this doesn\u2019t dismiss this, but simply would say that other approaches can be taken simultaneously, without having to focus the entire project on only this event. Especially when considering this could be a 100-year timeline before the event realized. EDIT: Adding a more substantive response. You\u2019re placing the entire emphasis of the protocol on a world that doesn\u2019t exist today. If not broad payments usage, what is the underlying value Dai can anchor upon? This is more succinctly addressed in the other post, around the path to making Dai a usable currency. To bet purely on decentralized economies is as risky as relying on adversarial legal systems IMO. The net positive of Dai loans, wherever the end product goes, is in the earned revenue and the growing asset side of the balance sheet. Swapping DAI for USDC via the PSM is a mechanism for reducing net liabilities; is  this really any different from the DSR, other staking proposals, or any monetary policy that encourages negative Dai cashflows for savers? I view the PSM as a tool akin to FX reserves, which is obviously useful with a tight exchange rate. RWA \u201ctokens\u201d are much more than Lloyd Christmas IOUs (although we\u2019re definitely at the \u201cour pets heads are falling off\u201d stage of the industry). Enforcement and responsibility can be incredibly complex - legacy institutions, offshore financial centers, and international participants have been playing these games for years before crypto has. You could even avoid legal claims in US jurisdictions and denominated in US dollars all-together if you really wanted too. It\u2019s not a one size fits all and there\u2019s a lot more here that we as a community haven\u2019t dug into yet. Its worth mentioning, that even with zero RWA, Maker would not be immune to the blacklist fallout that sanctions can bring. @elidco says it better than I. \u201cWhat if he shot me in the face?\u201d does come to mind\u2026 ",

This construct allows us to use the legal system to recoup defaulting investments.

Additionally since the total addressable market is very large and deep expertise is required for each deal, instead of being open to all markets and opportunities there needs to be a clear market niche and vision to go after. E.g. It could be ESG related initiatives (i.e. clean money) initiative starting in a target region or country (that views crypto favorably). That way the team can be built around in a much more structured manner, develop market knowledge and reduce existential risks. At this point, given the recent team struggles in RWA and lack of strategic vision, it might be best to place it in the back burner before it disrupts other priorities. ",

As having supported the integration of RWA with Maker since March 2021, I can say, with all honesty, that the current RWA program does nothing too interesting. I mean, the Delaware statutory trust is not, in any way, a new invention and real estate lending and loan participations are fairly standard. Even Wall Street has gotten into the \u201cClean Money\u201d thesis. Sure, I am proud of what we have accomplished with HVB and others, but it is not yet  transformative. I think, however, that the above discussions truly miss a key feature of what Maker can achieve in the RWA space when combined with blockchain. IMHO - Maker should leverage its privileged position as the issuer of DAI to promote the digitization, financialization, and commoditization of new real world assets - assets that start digitally native, are tied to oracles (internet of things), and can, as a result of the first two, be more fungible. With DAI pegged to the US dollar, Maker can most assuredly create value on a geographically broad and inclusive basis given the wide-spread acceptance of the dollar. MKR should not be viewed as a low-cost source of capital. Frankly, that is the source of many of the issues surrounding RWAs - many projects view Maker as a low-cost of capital and as their ticket to start-up success or continuation as a business. I know this as a fact as I had, late in 2021, proposed MD Irradiance as a MIP6 applicant for construction-only solar finance (long-since put into hibernation since I thought I could add more value by supporting Maker directly). Maker has a privileged position in the crypto-space. It can choose to remain a niche-crypto product. Or it can leverage its position and create new value. I cannot conclude that new value creation equates to a \u201cvampire attack on crypto\u201d. And as President Franklin D. Roosevelt said during his first inaugural address in 1933 - [L]et me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is . . . fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\" We should harness Maker\u2019s position to advance . . . not retreat.

If DAI usage was decentralized and widely distributed, and the core was unable to be shut down, then maybe. Bitcoin and Ethereum have survived bans (for now) because of their censorship resistance and large global liquidity. I think by now they\u2019re both too entrenched that the US is unlikely to ban them entirely at this point because it would be very unfavourable. Remember that both the protocols and native assets have been used by criminals and sanctioned entities, and OFAC has not sanctioned every Bitcoin or Ethereum address. Only specific ones. Importantly, this is because illicit funds can be tracked on those networks and blocked at on/off ramps effectively. DAI is no different in this regard for now.

In the early stages of the Endgame, it incentivizes systemic reslience and economic revenue, above all else. The tangible changes to the Endgame come down to the narrative that is communicated and prioritizing diverse high-value market opportunities over arbitrary target allocations. Compliance doesn\u2019t need to occur within the core protocol The Endgame structure allows us to make these assumptions about Maker:  Maker is a low-level protocol that exerts control over the core components of Dai, a stable value price instrument. The core principles of the protocol - permissionless, credibly-neutral, decentralized - are also the core value offerings in enabling a high-degree of efficiency and reliability. Higher-level usage of Dai that operates at the level of intermediary suppliers or end-users are distinctly separate entities from the core protocol. Any interface between higher-level entities and the core protocol is objectively and transparently managed, with as much separation as possible.  As long as these assumptions are adhered too, there is no reason to adopt compliance or regulatory mechanisms into the core of the protocol. The only relevant scrutiny would be in the interface with the MetaDAOs, but it\u2019s fairly easy to imagine how any potential impact could be minimized. To maintain this requires narrative support more than anything, but it supports almost all existing models of software and technology policy that exist. MetaDAOs who oeprate in poltiically relevant areas are still subject to compliance, but given the economic incentives, they\u2019d have every reason to avoid this. More on this later. The path to political adoption is the path to economic adoption Because Ethereum is decentralized infrastructure, Dai is inherently competing as an international currency. You can use a currency competition framework to understand how to exert influence over other political economies. The principles I\u2019m describing here are mostly adapted from Benjamin Cohen\u2019s work, Currency Power. Being as brief as possible, Dai\u2019s prospective value as an international currency is based on it\u2019s usage in financial markets, trade, and as an international reserve. The latter obviously being the king prize of currencies, the pathway to royalty is in progressively establishing Dai as a principle vehicle for economic activity. As with any currency, this is ultimately based on how domestic and international markets perceive it\u2019s reliability and accessibility. Most people here have a good understanding of how the protocol supports these two characteristics (and an understanding why the core principles previously mentioned do so as well), so it\u2019s more important to discuss how a currency climbs the pyramid from niche to negotiated. The key emphasis is on the ability for Dai to facilitate \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d economic activity with other markets. You can\u2019t necessarily coerce adoption within foreign systems, but you can incentivize it. By continuing to provide efficiency and usability, across a wide spectrum of valued activity, there is little reason to cut off Dai usage and flows. The Endgame can simply prioritize market value and allow the politics to play itself out Irrationality is abundant at all levels of politics, so you can\u2019t rule out the possibility of a ban, but you can hedge your bets. Pro-active narrative control, strong use cases, and a timeline of consistent reliability and accessibility makes it really hard to imagine how Dai would somehow be devoid of economic value and face a coordinated global ban. The history of international politics, especially international finance, is that of opportunitistic market dynamics and if Dai simply can provide, it will find favor somewhere. That somewhere can serve as the foothold to strive for larger currency status, but that will be for a future conversation\u2026 On the dollar peg\u2026today\u2019s market place is ruled by the US dollar, and despite good reasons otherwise, there is no way to avoid this in the short-term. This may preclude a MetaDAO based exclusively in North Korea or objectively pursuing active debasement of the United States, but I find it hard to believe these will be the only use cases worth pursuing. Especially if the incentives are hardcoded into the tokenomics correctly, there will be no game-theoretic reason for MetaDAOs to pursue anything but the most valuable use cases, and certainly not the ones most likely to face an OFAC sanction. As this climate changes, MetaDAOs will adapt too. The politics requires that the exchange rate to the dollar must be considered. There is simply no way around the global dollar system. But given a few years of effective revenue generating activity, continued growth in the decentralized economy, and further political development - there is no reason Dai and crypto aren\u2019t seen more favorably in open account countries than not. In light of this perspective, the current proposal on the Endgame places arbitrary limits on the type of collateral pursued outside of decentralized collateral. The number of 25% of the balance sheet in politically-exposed collateral is probably correct, but the limit should probably end there. Given appropriate incentives and skin in the game, MetaDAOs can manage their own issues, including liquidity and compliance, in order to succeed best. If it goes the other way, then mitigate the losses best you can and advance to whatever the next Bird Stance is. But to avoid the primary opportunities in the market because of a perceived vampire attack is essentially cementing Dai\u2019s status as a niche currency. If that\u2019s the decision to make, so be it, but I\u2019m genuinely glad we had this discussion first\u2026 I think @christiancdpetersen said it best.     christiancdpetersen:  We should harness Maker\u2019s position to advance . . . not retreat.

While I don\u2019t think you can rule out irrationality anywhere, I think this is a very pessimistic stance. If this were the case, why haven\u2019t Tether\u2019s banks done this with the DOJ all over their ass? Answer: because they can make more money by being complicit and are in jurisdictions where they have more flexibility on complying with US reach. They want to avoid killing the golden goose. The banks are incentivized to have those deposits, especially if they are sticky. It enables them to make more money while taking on less risk. No doubt there could be some shady banks. Counterparty risk is a thing and Tether has seen this too. But this is why you\u2019d want to work with banks in countries that have a good legal system, ensure that the incentives are aligned, and that the use of the RWA proceeds are compliant with regulations. As @Khan said above you\u2019d \u201chedge your bets\u201d and diversify the counterparties. One thing I\u2019ve learned the hard way when navigating banking and crypto over the years is money talks. Banks are in the business of money and the more you have, the more they\u2019re your friend. The bigger risk to RWA is by far assessing deals and ensuring borrowers don\u2019t default, or recovering assets of they do. Not that a proper sized bank in a good jurisdiction confiscates the $100M. Even in the extreme case you illustrate, in Canada and the US, you have a right to due process in court and if the sanction was incorrectly applied you can get your name stricken from the sanctions list and assets released. Not sure about other jurisdictions but I would assume there are more where this is also the case. I echo everything @Khan said above.  ",

I mean\u2026 this is where I sit.  The counter argument is that by playing along and conforming to existing regulations DAI would become corrupted and/or too engrained to change to be more censorship resistant. I personally think this is less likely if you\u2019re too big to fail vs. being banned when you\u2019re small and under more scrutiny for enabling sanctions avoidance. But it\u2019s pretty hard to put a probability to either scenario right now. ",

Feels like a good time to revisit the reply above by @khan to @rune asking:     rune:  Do you think it\u2019s realistic that Maker can convince american politicians that we should be subject to special rules that means we would be allowed to both scale our reliance and dependence on the american legal and financial system as the backend to a product we provide (for profit, but with major public good upside such as Clean Money) to any end users anywhere in the world that needs it, even e.g. north korea or iran if they decide to use it, without being subject to sanctions or countermeasures? That is, Maker would be treated like a kind of global utility like linux rather than like a financial institution.   in light of:    MIP55c3-SP16: Phoenix Labs-Spark Lend launch   Spark Lend will bring to Maker a new decentralized application that will integrate with Maker\u2019s strategic services (D3M, PSM, and DSR) into one front end to attract more crypto users and help to bootstrap the creation of the SubDAO communities. As presented in our roadmap, we want to start with a simple front-end that will allow the Maker Community to evaluate the growth of the product and according to it and based on the Community feedback, we could launch new features and products in the future. If MIP55c3-SP15, MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend , and this SPF are approved, we will be ready to launch Spark Lend by April 2023 and maintain it for up to one year. All products created by Phoenix Labs will belong to MakerDAO, including the smart contracts, the Front End, and all intellectual property.   and hard knocks MakerDAO is taking for being tossed up with the Oasis/Jump situation:   coindesk.com \u2013 24 Feb 23    Oasis Exploits Its Own Wallet Software to Seize Crypto Stolen in Wormhole Hack The High Court of England and Wales ordered the crypto platform to reclaim the stolen funds.      We believe there is absolutely a path for Maker Core to be treated like a global utility rather than a financial institution. We agree with @Khan that this path is not one of convincing U.S. politicians or paying lobbyists. Success depends on smart moves which we think the Endgame Constitution outline very well. Proceeding with the current fully integrated thrust and timeline for Phoenix Labs in direct conflict with such prudent design and processes in place as outlined in the Endgame plan, would be a terrible mistake.
