The conversation happened during our weekly Gitcoin Community Call(formerly, \u201cDAO Vibes\u201d). Up to this point, the Public Goods workstream has decided what rounds are Gitcoin-led. We recognize that, to effectively scale our program, we need to continue to decentralize. Our goal is to find ways to achieve long-term financial sustainability with the help of the broader Gitcoin community. The PGF team asked some key questions on the call, and received feedback from community members on the realities of fundraising for public goods. Three key questions:  How many rounds does it make sense for the Gitcoin program to support initially and why? What do you think these rounds should look like? Which services would be most helpful for Gitcoin to provide in order to help fund public goods? This could include funding, operating grants rounds, marketing grants rounds, and grant review. What outcomes should we track to measure our success as a decentralized grants program?  Protocol adoption is also a core focus. For Gitcoin to effectively decentralize its grants program, we need to get ecosystems to use, adopt, and run their own, self-hosted grants rounds on Gitcoin Grants protocols. Here\u2019s a link to the call recording, and notes from the call. Join us for the next Gitcoin Community Call(12p ET in the #dao-citizens channel in the Discord), which will be led by MMM brand strategist, Alexa Lombardo! Alexa will moderate a discussion on the Gitcoin brand, and how we are evolving it to meet the needs of a decentralized Gitcoin Grants program.
