The fact that it didn\u2019t pass could indicate either:  MKR Token Holders do not think that activating the GSM at this time is a good idea. MKR Token Holders were not paying attention to the executive vote and did not move their MKR from the previous executive to the GSM activation.  ",

Guys introduced a bug while fixing another one found previously, It have led to 250 mln locked. This is kind of risk You fall into when not enough eyes is watching and that is exacly what darkfix is by design. Code seen before by as few eyes as possible. But I agree that if it will allow to enable GSM it is woth it especially that dark fix is a tool of a last resort to an existing bug, hopefully will be never used. Does not change the fact that it is dangerous as hell. ",
