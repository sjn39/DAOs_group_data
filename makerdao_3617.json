Importantly, disagreements are healthy and lead the DAO forward. At the same time, we should strive to establish and protect mutual respect and merit-driven discussion as the foundations of our community. In dialectics, the principle of charity poses that to reach an agreement, all participants of a discussion should aim to interpret each other\u2019s arguments in the most \u201ccharitable\u201d way. Imagine a debate in which one side assumes that a premise is clear and doesn\u2019t need to be elaborated on, skipping it over. The opposing side can then make a choice: apply the principle of charity and ask for clarification, trying to find the strongest version of the argument, or alternatively use that gap in argumentation to undermine all premises indiscriminately. The first option is the only way to reach consensus, while at the same time letting your opponent know you care for what they have to say, even when you still disagree at the end. We\u2019re not a corporation. There\u2019s no one entity deciding on the \u201cright\u201d interpretation of facts. We have on-chain tools to discover the will of the voters, but the off-chain discussion and consensus-seeking is the only tool to keep our community aligned. I\u2019d also argue that there are tangible risks and opportunities directly relating to what I\u2019m saying here. If we can foster a culture of respectful, merit-driven, and good-faith discussions, we can at worst find out the points where we disagree and at best reach consensus around them. On the other hand, if we lose the ability to communicate efficiently, we might end up facing a fork from a vector we often don\u2019t consider, the human one. ",
