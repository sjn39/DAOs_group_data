                    "content": " Grant Announcement: KYC/AML Compliance Research MakerDAO SES welcomes Patrizia Crespi in support of navigating MakerDAO\u2019s know-your-customer / anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) compliance obligations.  Background Patrizia joins MakerDAO with 16 years of experience working as a legal and compliance professional in the banking industry. She holds an Upper-Second Class Honors bachelor\u2019s degree in Law and a postgraduate degree in Law obtained at the University of Law in London. In addition to these TradFi accolades, Patrizia also holds a certificate in advanced studies in Blockchain from the University of Zurich. Leveraging her years of experience in senior compliance roles for global banking institutions in London, Frankfurt, and Zurich, Patrizia is utilizing the MakerDAO SES Grants program to begin researching risks and solutions for KYC/AML regulatory management. The grant focuses on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF) updated guidance for Virtual Assets (VA) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) published in October 2021. FATF is an independent, inter-governmental organization. Their purpose is to set policies to protect international financial systems against money laundering and terror financing. FATF\u2019s guidance and recommendations are recognized as the global standard governments should aim for when creating laws and regulations. It\u2019s important to highlight that the guidance published by FATF is not law. However, more than 200 countries adhere to FATF\u2019s guidance. The October 2021 report introduced 6 key areas MakerDAO needs to be mindful of when tackling growth this year. Estimates assume nations will soon act on this guidance and enact laws that will impact MakerDAO in the next 12 months.  Grant Details Three deliverables are defined within the scope of this grant. They are:  A Feasibility Study advising on the impact of potential new laws and regulations based on FATF\u2019s guidance on DeFi and stable coins. The selection of AML tool(s) for MakerDAO with a demo conducted for the community to review. Serve as a point of contact for external compliance relations and queries for MakerDAO.  The estimated timeline for this initial grant was scoped at 3 months, starting in January with a budget of 1,500 Dai/month. Today we\u2019re excited to announce that Patrizia\u2019s scope of work will already be increasing as she plays a pivotal role in building out the compliance track for SES\u2019s Legal Core Unit incubator cohort.  SES Incubator Season 1: Legal Cohort In Q2 2022, MakerDAO SES will restructure its Incubator and Grants program to enable the incubation of up to 5 candidate facilitators per educational track. This means instead of incubating at most 6 core units at a time, the focus will be on preparing potentially 10-15 facilitators to run individual core units across 3 unique education tracks. Patrizia will help ensure the legal incubation track accomplishes the goal of setting up the critical legal infrastructure for MakerDAO. The SES Legal tracks will focus on:  RWA Legal Regulatory Compliance Advocacy & Public Policy Legal Entity Incorporation Services Legal Proxy / Legal advice coordination (TBD) Insurance  Patrizia\u2019s grant will continue into March of 2022, with a final report delivered to the MakerDAO community covering the deliverables above. With SES\u2019s incubator restructuring, an additional deliverable of defining the mandate for a Regulatory Compliance Core Unit is in scope. Her grant is planned to evolve into incubating this core unit, alongside several other legal core units also entering the inaugural season of SES\u2019s cohort incubator.  Meet Patrizia SES Legal introduced Patrizia on January 28th\u2019s Weekly Status Update call. SES Legal previewed the plan to incubate critical legal infrastructure in a new cohort education model for the SES Incubator. Watch the recording here to meet Patrizia and learn about ways to support MakerDAO\u2019s initiative of legal fortification at the DAO. ",

This, and the video call is framed more around falling in line with compliance and researching how best to accept the burden. Discussing blacklists, and \u201cleaders in compliance\u201d is framing out of line with the ethos of DAI imo. DAI should be aiming to be a leader in uncompliance. How a particular issuer deals with regulations is not our burden. Being aware of the resources needed to suitably issue an asset inline with regulations is something I could see being valuable research as this maintains offloading that responsibility to each asset issuer rather than leaving the burden on Maker. But this will be different in each region making it quite a hefty task. Imo better to support regional efforts to learn, integrate, and issue, than centralized that process as the dapps responsibility. ",

If the solution is: they have an identity NFT in their wallet so they can use Maker but it\u2019s not required for other users\u2026 is that an issue? This is a hypothetical KYC solution that doesn\u2019t enforce anything on anyone. As is always the case with research, let\u2019s see what the outcome is, first. And let\u2019s then make up our minds. Research assumes an open mind otherwise it\u2019s quite pointless. And the last point I want to make: education goes in both directions.

It doesn\u2019t even have to be autocratic states, if you have states or companies that are very centrally run, you only need a few corrupt people to abuse these sytsems. Even with all the KYC and AML, it seems that for one group all these rules do not apply. It is a high requirement to be allowed to work in this field at all. I don\u2019t know how we will implement or enforce all these rules for individual wallets/vault users, however, I see a great opportunity with institutional wallets/users to enforce these rules. But concretely this will be shown with this work. I hope with the research maybe also all the prejudices will be cleared up. It must also be clearly said that MakerDao has the largest growth of enterprises and other protocols, so the recent development has also clearly been on the business side, it is relatively unattractive for individuals to use the protocol or manage a vault. Therefore, little to hardly any individuals are encouraged to deal with the protocol. Thats why the DAO moved more corporate friendly, it\u2019s highly professional otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have had the recent great developments. I would like to see more vaults or projects from individuals, maybe we will see a revival in the L2 if the protocol is implemented there, to attract them, so that these users can join the discussion, so there is no longer 100 % buissness oriented governance, but a mixed form.

All funds and energy spend on this should be directly stopped and converted into a nation state recistance working group.   I sympathize with your concerns, I have a very similar vision when it comes to the protocol being neutral territory. However, when it comes to execution, it cannot work in the way you\u2019re describing. \u201cMaker DAO core groups\u201d (Core Units) span everything from Protocol Engineering to finance to growth to people management to, yes, legal. Outsourcing our key challenges because we don\u2019t like to deal with them is not smart. It merely relinquishes control over a key strategic area. I want to remind people of a post I made a while ago:    [Discussion] The DAO needs a serious discussion about legal structure   Agreed with @PaperImperium that we need to step up our legal strategy efforts. The discussion is obviously heating up in the US and I\u2019m not going to speculate with hypotheses here, but, for me there is one important thing we should keep in mind when considering these matters: Any path that leads to legal AML/KYC requirements on the Dai token itself, should be a non-starter. The Dai token is of course fully permissionless and cannot be changed in its current form. But it\u2019s not unthinkable that the wrong strategic choices on the legal front could lead to a future where the current ERC20 token, under legal pressure, is decoupled from the core protocol and a new, permissioned version is deployed. If that happens, we should just trigger emergency shutdown, call Dai a failed experiment and give up. Free and borderless transactions with Dai, accessible to the unbanked, high inflation economies, etc. is the core of our value proposition. Any taxation and even liability considerations should be secondary to that. In a world where CBDCs will be the official legal tender and every individual value transaction will be up for scrutiny by law enforcement, Dai has to be the free alternative or it should not exist. Because the digital age makes absolute surveillance an option, this will become an issue as important as free speech.   I still stand by every word of this. Yes, we need to double down on MakerDAO being the alternative to the CBDC surveillance scenario. Doing legal research into the challenges is not in contradiction to that; it is a critical element in ensuring that Maker will succeed in its ambition.

                    "content": "There seems to be some misunderstandings around the scope of this research grant. Let me share some comments. First of all: The purpose of the research grant is NOT to implement KYC on DAI transactions or on any of the core features of the protocol (i.e. permissionless vaults / auction services / governance, etc.). Nothing in this research will be  an endorsement/plan of any kind to make KYC mandatory in Maker. As we have always said, DAI should always be  freely accessible and fungible and the features of the protocol must remain permissionless. However, there is a real regulatory and sanction risk that we can not ignore, and it can affect any one of us. We can not wait until the regulations are implemented at a national level and forces us into a reactive mode. The purpose of this grant is to investigate how the emerging international AML regulatory framework can impact Maker and how we could mitigate this risk. One of the risk mitigation strategies is to research technological solutions that are compatible with Maker\u2019s values . They can include Decentralized Identity (DIDs), zero-knowledge-proofs, etc. compatible with a decentralized, permissionless, public protocol like MakerDAO. It is not only about regulatory risk mitigation. It is about turning risks into opportunities and competitive advantages. The main one is an unrestricted compromise to decentralization. Decentralization is our  main regulatory risk mitigation strategy. Entities like the FATF or SEC have explicitly recognized that projects with \u201csufficient decentralisation\u201d can be excluded from regulatory scrutiny. Although we don\u2019t always know what  exactly regulators understand under \u201csufficient decentralization\u201d we do know that MakerDAO is extremely committed to decentralization, and therefore built a considerable competitive advantage, as well as regulatory resilience. But this is not enough. There are still centralization points to address, and each one of them is a regulatory access point. This important aspect will also be analyzed in the research grant. As always, we invite the community to give constructive feedback on how Maker should address legal and regulatory risks. ",

Will the team commit that producing a vault which generates wrapped DAI will never be produced by the Maker team? Will the team commit the compliance research is help institutions use Maker products but not impact Maker products. Because ya keep saying it wont impact them, but also keep saying we have a competitive advantage of being leader in compliance. ",

GovAlpha (the team of which I\u2019m a part) is focused on making governance as effective as possible and ensuring that proposals follow the governance processes as agreed by Governance and laid out in the MIPs. Any proposal that would impact the permissionless nature of Maker and/or DAI would require discussion and debate and would only be implemented if MKR Holders voted in favour (same as any other proposal.) tldr: The team can\u2019t commit to anything, because there isn\u2019t a central team. Individual Core Units will do their jobs  as laid out in their mandates. Any proposals they make are put to MKR Holders to decide. If you want to help ensure that no decisions are made that impact the permissionless nature of Maker and/or DAI, delegate your MKR to a Recognized Delegate, or otherwise engage with governance. ",

So as an example, I could commit to leaving the DAO if MKR Holders approve a proposal which results in DAI becoming permissioned (to be clear, I\u2019m not committing to that right now, I take my commitments seriously and would need to think more about it). But I will not commit to trying to prevent such a proposal from entering the governance process, because that\u2019s directly contradictory to GovAlpha\u2019s mandate. Other Core Units are in a position where their mandates don\u2019t really have any relation to such a proposal, and wouldn\u2019t be any position to do anything about it either way (other than commit to leaving if such a thing was approved.) The point is that if MKR Holders want something, there is ultimately nothing anyone in the Core Units can do to stop it in the long term. We can refuse or resign, but MKR Holders can find other employees that are willing to implement such proposals. So to reiterate, if you want to affect the direction which Maker takes, the best way to do that is to engage with governance either through delegation, or by continuing to engage in this forum. ",

That said I don\u2019t necessarily see it as unacceptable or disastrous to fund 3 months of exploratory work on these subjects. Simply that that needs to be put in a context of how to subvert rather than what sounds like happy submission.

Weakening that in any way breaks not only the project\u2019s core values but also its long-term prospects. Note that there exist faster cheaper centralized entities with different stabilisation mechanisms that offer usd stable tokens. b) permissionless DAI creation (with nontrivial DCs, on major assets) is also a core part of Maker. No matter what gets built around it, losing this is a bit like losing permissionless DAI. You end up with the worst of the centralized and decentralized worlds.

You just need to find the right tools \u2014 such as DID and zero-knowledge proof \u2014 then you can get the best part from both worlds.   The thing is of course that privacy is not the same as openness and permissionlessness, and they should definitely not be confused. If I\u2019m a protester in Belarus and I try to use DAI, it\u2019s good that the system won\u2019t try to identify me, but it can still exclude me altogether, if I don\u2019t have the right access pass that shows I\u2019m government-approved. I am not a lawyer, but I would assume that any legal defense for permissionless usage has to come from the angle of the rights of individuals, constitutional rights, or human rights. Basically any section of the law that fundamentally curtails government power. Which is why, in countries that call themselves democratic, there is an argument to be made. Privacy is part of that same space and very important too, but it is not synonymous. This is why I have a hard time seeing how privacy solutions can fundamentally fix the issue. The solution has to come from immutability (no one can revoke access) or decentralization (control is so diversified that it\u2019s unfeasible any government can successfully manipulate it), hardened as much as possible with legal protection. For this legal protection we need research, because ultimately MakerDAO involves people. (Rights of corporations as opposed to individuals is a very different matter, which relates to institutional vaults and RWAs.) ",

Basically any section of the law that fundamentally curtails government power. Which is why, in countries that call themselves democratic, there is an argument to be made. Privacy is part of that same space and very important too, but it is not synonymous. This is why I have a hard time seeing how privacy solutions can fundamentally fix the issue. The solution has to come from immutability (no one can revoke access) or decentralization (control is so diversified that it\u2019s unfeasible any government can successfully manipulate it), hardened as much as possible with legal protection. For this legal protection we need research, because ultimately MakerDAO involves people. (Rights of corporations as opposed to individuals is a very different matter, which relates to institutional vaults and RWAs.)   We understand what you said. Permissionlessness is definitely a virtue of crypto and we value that. However, we are not living in a bubble. There are governments, courts and armies around us, in the real life. We are somehow afraid that, without doing what we are doing right now, we won\u2019t get permissionless blockchain. Instead, we will get permissioned blockchain with no user privacy\u2014the end of crypto basically. So you see we are trying to explore a middle ground here, because landing in the middle ground is still better than landing at \u201ctheir side\u201d. We hope this makes sense to you. ",

                    "content": "I have so many thoughts on this proposal and the community\u2019s reaction to the propsal. At the broadest level, the visceral reaction we witnessed at just the mention of looking into the implications of compliance and how it could be implemented seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how truly decentralized protocols work. The situation brings the Uniswap delisting controversy to mind for a similiar reason. First, the front end most people are familiar with is run by the Oasis team, which is independent of MakerDAO (as far as I\u2019m aware). Other independent front ends are also popular, such as DefiSaver. Each of those could choose to implement or not implement compliance checks on their own. Second, even if MakerDAO were to somehow force these front ends to implement KYC and AML checks, new ones would spring up and the contracts can also be used on a command line level by anyone. Third, no one has suggested DAI would be subject to compliance checks. From what I can tell, this was primarily designed as a scoping exercise to determine what the risks are, what the benefits are, and how could any compliance be implemented at the edges of the system to enable easier integration with RWA and large financial or enterprise institutions. For example, could a core unit create a specific front end and platform where only KYC/AMLed persons interact with each other? Could certain entities be setup outside the DAO to facilitate interactions with the smart contract system while enabling counterparties to use that entity as a compliance check? There is a real value in seeing where bridges can be built to traditional finance, and those bridges don\u2019t necessarily require abandoning the principles that so many people came in here to defend. I wish that we had the trust of the community to explore that opportunity without fear of being cancelled. ",

The fact is that transactions for RWA have to be done under the auspices of central authorities that can in a moment\u2019s notice change or break contractual agreements.  If MKR were to expand exposure in these areas, it does seem prudent to explore the risks involved.  Though some here have advocated sectioning off RWA as it\u2019s own area for compliance, a growing portfolio of RWA could be an attack vector for authorities to target in order to coerce changes in other areas of the protocol.  What would be the impact of collateral seizures, fines to partners, legal action against core contributors?  What level of noncompliance might lead to such actions and in what locales?  If possible, how could loss from such actions be mitigated or prevented?  What levels of compliance cede too much power to authorities and undermine the MKR community?  When is it the right time to address or attempt to influence rapidly changing regulations?  What would be the costs?  Those are a few questions off the top of my head that I have.  I\u2019m sure there is many more I haven\u2019t thought of.  As Maker has chosen to grow in the direction of bridging virtual and real world assets, answering these questions is going to matter more and more.  The alternative is to stay completely in the virtual world. ",

Thank you for your comments. Excellent questions for us all to engage with and answer thoroughly and thoughtfully. My Poll vote in favor of this Declaration of Intent was an unfortunate result of user error MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds. I\u2019ll go into more detail on why I intended to vote NO in my March month-end Delegate Platform summary post. But let me mention here that in addition to disfavoring US Federal Reserve counterparty risk generally, I have a visceral objection to taking our beautiful permissionless assets off-chain and parking them in the very assets everyone should be getting out of. @Herbalremidy also raised the point recently that directly holding US Treasuries through regulated TradFi institutions could be viewed as compromising strong arguments we now have in our favor that distinguish MakerDAO from market participants within reach of current KYC/AML regulations.

Best to then maybe do this via a different DAO structure etc with a completely separate and transparent budget and let the community decide? If we go down the route Maker DAO is now taking I think the work DAO is at that stage just a hype word. Would love to see Maker DAO just as a core stable protocol and not a political multi DAO workgroup forest. Overall I am a big supporter and user and hope to see more cool products soon. ",
