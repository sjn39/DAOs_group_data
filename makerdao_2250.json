                    "content": " TL;DR In our previous update, we covered the fifth iteration of the dashboard, featuring Expense Report Auditing as a major improvement in reporting accuracy:  Core Unit Auditors; Expense report status tracking; Expense report audit trails.  In this status update, we are covering the work done through January and February. We are pleased to announce the following new features and improvements:   Delegates Compensation Data is now available through monthly expense reports, similar to the Core Unit expense reports.   Quarterly and Annual Expense Charts are now available on our new Finances homepage. This feature is just the first of many aggregated reports that we have planned.   Improved Core Unit Expense Reports, featuring:  MKR vesting tables; Monthly and quarterly budget caps.    Introduction of the Reporting API, allowing researchers to easily define which expense data they would like to retrieve, and how it should be aggregated: by Core Unit or expense category, on monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, etc.   Various UX Improvements such as:  Easier log-in for core unit administrators and auditors; Making it easier to open links in new browser tabs; Grouping the offboarded core units at the bottom of the overview table.    Try it out  Visit our dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/. The GraphQL API can be accessed using the API Explorer. Download the latest budget tool here.    SES in Denver: team offsite and ETHDenver attendance The SES team met in Denver for an offsite ahead of the ETHDenver conference. Among other things, our agenda included:   Modeling and formalizing various Endgame-related processes, such as the application process for Constitutional Voter Committees (CVCs), onboarding stage for the Legal Defense Fund, and reporting on Project Progress.   Covering the Endgame Constitution and conducting retrospective sessions to review our past efforts and identified action items that can further improve our work.   Meet-up with the DUX Core Unit to discuss their Easy Governance Frontend design and aligned our efforts towards common goals.   Looking ahead, we have planned for the future of Endgame Operational Support and created a feature roadmap for 2023.   The rest of the week, the team attended ETHDenver to connect with the broader MakerDAO and Ethereum community.   Dashboard v0.7 Release Version 0.7 of the dashboard is now available at https://expenses.makerdao.network/.  1. Delegates Compensation Data Monthly expense reports for delegate compensation, similar to our Core Unit expense reports.  1440\u00d7720 108 KB    With our new Delegate Expense Reports, the Maker Governance community, and other stakeholders, can easily see how each Delegate was compensated in a given month.   The reported data comes from the submission of expense reports by a newly introduced role: the Delegates Administrator (currently performed by SES).   The delegates compensation data is the first operational expenses data that does apply to Core Units. Future releases will also include other budget categories such as Special Purpose Funds (SPFs).    2. Quarterly and Annual Expense Charts A brand-new Finances homepage with the first aggregated views of all collected data.  1440\u00d7720 113 KB  The Maker Governance community and other stakeholders now have access to a dedicated Finances page with aggregated data on all Core Unit and Delegates Expenses. This new homepage includes:   Quarterly expense cards with actuals, prediction numbers, and budget caps. The prediction numbers are defined as the reported forecasts only when actuals are unavailable.   Total reported expenses for the selected year, covering both actuals and prediction numbers.   Annual reported expenses per month with active actuals, discontinued actuals, and prediction numbers. The discontinued actuals are reported expenses from budgets that have been discontinued since, currently reflecting the offboarded Core Unit budgets.   The Recognized Delegates compensation numbers are included in all the aggregated data views. At the bottom of the page, we have made it easy to navigate to the familiar Core Units overview page, as well as the new Recognized Delegates expense reports.  3. Improved Core Unit Expense Reports View MKR vesting schedules and budget caps.  1440\u00d7720 107 KB    The MKR vesting data of all Core Units that report on them, have been uploaded to the dashboard. The MKR numbers are available for the previous and current month. If there is a difference between them, the reason(s) are indicated.   The data are available under the reenabled \u201cMKR Vesting\u201d tab in the Core Unit Expense Reports.   Monthly and quarterly budget cap data has also been collected. The monthly numbers are already uploaded, and the quarterly numbers will follow soon.    4. Introduction of the Reporting API Aggregate Core Unit and Delegates expense data as monthly, quarterly or annual numbers. As always, we made sure that all the data used on the dashboard is available for developers and data analysts through our API as well. With this release, we are introducing a new Reporting API query for aggregated data.  1440\u00d7720 186 KB  The query allows users to fetch actuals, budgetCap, prediction, and discontinued actuals for any available budget. Four input parameters can be set, so far:   The granularity parameter instructs the reporting engine to group the numbers on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The total option is available too, to aggregate all data as a single, total amount.   The budgets parameter allows users to define exactly which data should be included, ranging from the total set of all data including Delegates and Core Unit budgets, to very specific sets such as a specific Core Unit wallet. While we\u2019re finalizing the documentation of this feature, a few examples of budget selections:   makerdao/* for all Delegates and Core Units budget data combined.  makerdao/core-units:* or makerdao/delegates:* for Core Units or Delegates data only.  makerdao/core-units:*/SES-001:* for the data of a specific Core Unit, in this case SES.  makerdao/core-units:*/SES-001:*/*:* for the SES data grouped by wallet    The start and end parameters define the time range that should be included in the aggregate data. They can be left empty for selection of the total available range, or filled out with a specific month using the notation YYYY/MM, such as 2023/01.   Feel free to reach out if you\u2019re interested in using these queries while the feature is still in beta.  5. Various UX Improvements Next to the changes that were mentioned above, a host of smaller UX improvements have been included in the release:   It is now easier to log in for Core Unit administrators and auditors, who can directly click on the account icon in the top menu.   We have made it easier to open links in new browser tabs, ensuring that all internal links now support middle-mouse button clicks, or the \u201cOpen in new tab\u201d option in the browser\u2019s context menu.   The offboarded Core Units are now grouped together at the bottom of the Core Units overview table, giving the user a better overview of the current situation.   We cleaned up the header of the expense reports, giving immediate access to the numbers without having to scroll.   In the overview table for Core Units, the \u201cLatest 3 months\u201d expense graphs now have an indication of the months for a quicker understanding of how recent the data is.     What\u2019s next The focus for upcoming releases is in three areas:   Get 100% protocol expense coverage by adding the remaining budget categories:  With Core Units and Delegate Compensation, the most important budget categories have already been covered; We are working to include Special Purpose Funds, Direct Dai Transfers, and potentially smaller budget categories to get 100% coverage of protocol operational expenses.    More aggregated data views with different levels of detail   Releases 0.6 and 0.7 have introduced the first aggregated data in the form of the new home page with quarterly and annual totals;   This is only the beginning as we\u2019re planning to have a total of 4 levels of detail:   Key figures on a protocol level: high-level numbers and charts without a lot of detail that capture the big picture for users that don\u2019t have time to dig deep. The new home page is a starting point for this. Upcoming release will add cost breakdown tables by budget (e.g. Core Unit) and expense categories (e.g. headcount vs. non-headcount costs).   Detailed finance view on a protocol level: for users that want to dig deeper, a more detailed view of all the protocol expenses covering all the budget categories such as Core Units, Delegates, SPFs, etc. with powerful filtering capabilities.   Budget category view: for an overview of the expense categories over time, within a specific budget category. For Core Units, this overview will provide charts and tables that capture Core Unit spending throughout their lifetime, an overview of the current reserves, etc.   Monthly expense reports: already implemented, our most granular view on the reported data for budget administrators and auditors.       Reconciling reported numbers with on-chain data   For the expense data to come full circle, the reported numbers need to be compared with the on-chain transaction data;   SES started collaborating with the Data Insights Core Unit to collect this on-chain data, and we will bring this data to the dashboard in the coming releases;   On-chain, operational reserves for all budgets will be made available, from unclaimed funds in the DssVest streams, to the runway reserves in operational and auditor wallets;   Last but not least, the on-chain transfer amounts will be compared to the reported expenses so that any gaps in the reported numbers can be automatically detected.     Reconciliation with the on-chain data will provide the final check on the completeness and accuracy of the reported numbers. With this quality control mechanism in place, the status of MakerDAO as the most transparent DAO in the industry will once again be confirmed.  Feedback?
