More relevantly though, it would be great to have a system to ensure that the key oracle information remained public and up to date. I think the main elements we want to be public and up to date are:  The list of feeds (obviously without identifying information for the darkfeeds) The list of oracles we\u2019re actively supporting and their status (I think some are on slowly update cycles to save gas? We should have this written up somewhere.) The list of whitelisted entities. The list and details of datamodels being used.  I assume these are all still meant to be public information? It is possible I\u2019m just missing some docs or some dashboard somewhere, if they are up to date and public somewhere, a link would be appreciated. What would be ideal is not just getting updated docs, but implementing some sort of process via which they can stay up to date. ",
