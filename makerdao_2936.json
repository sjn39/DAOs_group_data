                    "content": "This is a Pre-MIP discussion and poll to gauge interest\u2026 I have posted elsewhere the core concepts of this basic idea which is pretty simple.     PSM, Flashmint, MKR tokenomics and MakerDAO security Governance       I am advocating the protocol just take the underwater vaults now and drop them with DAI onto curve (as per others suggestions) to earn LP fees at least.   I realized something here btw in that rather than liquidating to get DAI the protocol should have just confescated the underwater USDC vaults immediately and paired it with DAI to earn this return.   Tokenomics can be significantly improved.   I think I will have to make a separate post on this but for now Maker is not earning 30MM/yr it is e\u2026     Take some portion of the MKR slated to burn via a flap and use it as an additional reward to align interests of those doing the hard work of Maker with shareholders around improving MKR burn. The mechanics of the idea are straightfoward.  Determine some percentage of the MKR flap to set aside in another account via a MIP14_subMKR transfer to an account accumulate this over a time period T Determine the reward metric and distribution(s): Examples:  A% to be divided and go with sourceCred xDAI rewards during the monthly payout over the timeperiod T.  I\u2019d like to see github perhaps included in sourceCred on this btw and have the grain go 1/3 to forums 2/3 to github.  (NOTE:  I want core people who get a lot of cred to be the key receivers of this bonus but others who are not to as well.  It may be their job to be here but they should also get some MKR tokens to vest for their work) B% to be divided between domain groups to be distributed as they see fit internally C% for a monthly or quarterly Maker exceptional contributor/contribution award(s) D% to be divided for other interesting possible stuff  rewards for vault holder participation rewards for top MKR governance participation closing out a large vault after paying at least M DAI in interest. a general Maker Vault lottery system (say for vaults over some active borrow amount or interest paid amount) a Maker bug bounty or contract error finder reward. other stuff others think of.     Mechanics so all of these rewards end up in  DSSChief with their respective MKR delegated to the owners wallet vested for at least 1-3 years where anyone can execute a vesting release once it becomes executable.    I believe doing something like the above will better align the interest of people working at Maker with the interest of MKR holders.   The vast majority of good companies offer employees or people working for the company stock rewards or stock options.   Here rewarding people for positive contributions beyond a monetary value and including all the people now who are under salary from sourcecred rewards to actually earn some well deserved MKR bonus adds positive incentive.  Making this reward tied exclusively to MKR burning aligns incentives to increase burn for everyone working to improve Maker. The bonus of this suggestion is that as MKR burns we end up with more MKR in DSSChief with people that are the MOST likely to vote with it and the people who, other than MKR holders, may have the most to lose if Maker doesn\u2019t succeed.   We potentially get more people into governance directly.  In fact we can even reward these people for voting, and have that MKR vest just like the rest.  There will be a reason to vote again but it won\u2019t be because they will get DAI immediately but because they get MKR that in 1-3 years they can withdraw and put in their warchest or sell for DAI. I almost can\u2019t count the reasons to do this. The few I can think of against is that it decreases the total burn by A% MKR is too precious to use as a reward - force everyone to buy it like everyone else.  Others I am sure will think of more. As this is a pre-MIP discussion I am only going to put up a simple poll.    Do you think Maker should persue diverting some portion(to be determined later) of MKR to be burned, and use it as an extra reward for Maker Contributions and work?

The difference here is the MKR vests for 1-3 years and ends up immediately in DSSChief connected to people who are known contributors. I completely agree we should make the surplus infinite.  I have another post I am working on about taking that capital in the surplus - grouping with USDC that we are going to liquiditate - drop it on curve to provide liquidity for stablecoin trading and then just pull a piece of the LP profits to use as the slated funds for MKR burn.   This way literally we build up a massive treasury that burns MKR with the return say everytime when network tx costs to do a Uniswap MKR-DAI or MKR-USDC or whatever are <.1% of the total value of the MKR that is to be burned. This would make for a very tiny burn relative to cash flows though but I like it conceptually.  IMO I think this whole hoard MKR idea to make it valuable is kind of flawed.  What we want is a healthy MKR flow and an amount that steadily declines.  Make MKR valuable by what you can do with it and what it is earning in revenue, not because you just sit on it doing nothing. In general I agree with you (I often do) that right now we should just be building a surplus to heaven.   If I was going to change anything I would say to put it so that we flap at a rate of 1% of surplus over 1% of DAI outstanding. So right now with 1B 1% is 10M DAI.  I would not even try to flap until we are over 10M DAI and even then I would only flap when the price of 50MKR is 1% of the amount OVER the 10M which currently would be around 11M. I also would like to see us pull money from surplus into a treasury.  But for now I want to see surplus larger and growing.   If i have my numbers right we are going to flap again here in what 4-5 days with a profit coming into the system of 1.25M/month give or take. ",

Governance could decide to sell, to people with enough cred, MKR1Y tokens at a particularly good (i.e., discounted wrt current MKR value) price.

This gives us more flexibility in how much MKR we can pay out rather than waiting for it to be collected as part of the flap process and reduces implementation complexity. Personally I think the flap auction mechanism is core to giving MKR monetary value, and as the value of MKR is critical to the security and insurance of the protocol, I am strongly opposed to seeing them cancelled or drastically changed. Re: MKR1Y, I don\u2019t see this as being priced much differently from MKR unless you are assuming the protocol won\u2019t be around in one year. Especially if it is a fungible and tradable token. I don\u2019t think this really helps compared to simply distributing MKR directly. ",

Everyone is happy when MKR burns.  The whole point here was to completely avoid minting MKR but only diverting MKR coming from a burn cycle into the reward hopper.

Aaron_Bartsch:  We\u2019ve had this discussion before, but how would this differ from paying for those things with DAI from the surplus buffer instead of waiting for FLAP auctions. It\u2019s essentially the same thing but allows users the choice to convert to MKR if they wish.   I\u2019ve heard this argument a lot. And while it is \u2018essentially the same thing\u2019 in terms of transferring value, distributing value in MKR sends a different message to those involved in the protocol. The question boils down to whether you want those working on the protocol to have a monetary stake in its success. If the answer is yes, then distributing value in MKR is a great way to achieve that. Even without vesting, it changes the default from \u2018get paid to work on Maker\u2019 to \u2018earn ownership of Maker when you work on Maker.\u2019 The second is far more powerful, and as much as you can argue that \u2018it\u2019s the same\u2019 (or even slightly less) value being transferred, it feels different to people.     Akiva:  I think this should only be done if the MKR is locked and they cannot unlock it for a number of years. Otherwise some will just sell immediately.   I\u2019m not sure this is a good argument against doing it. Under the current system, all of the MKR is sold immediately, if even some of the distributed MKR remains in the hands of those that have been working on the project, that\u2019s a win. It actually might turn out better for MKR price as well. If you are distributing 10% DAI to participants, you are only using 90% of it to buy MKR from keepers. If you spend 100% of the DAI buying MKR, and only 5% of the MKR is actually sold by the recipients, then you should have provided more upwards pressure on the MKR price.

I agree. My biggest concern here is being able to pass something like this through existing MKR holders. My assumption is that most whales are not currently active in governance and so they will see any attempts to subvert MKR burn to other actors as an attack on their value accrual. I think we will have to find a compromising position to allow for everyone to win or else we may never be able to pass these types of policies. I wish and hope that these people will see that implementing these types of proposals will actually accrue them more value in the long term but I don\u2019t have that much faith in humans being able to think outside of themselves for the most part.

Hello @Tosh9.0 People want to be paid what theu need to live, cover bills etc (and perhaps a bit more if they can of) in DAI but any \u2018incentives\u2019 as a bonus to their pay (think stock options or stock here folks) as MKR.   The key point on this proposal is that the MKR vests with a lockup.   You can vote with it, but you can\u2019t sell it for 1-3 years.  Another key point is that I want everyone to get some of this.  Not just people who are not working the hardest (everyone being paid under Foundation/Maker grants etc.) I want people like @amyjung and @LongForWisdom and yes even @s_ben etc. to have a chance even if is through a MKR bonus edition sourceCred to earn MKR they can\u2019t sell but can vote with as well as everyone else.  Long is going to earn the lions share of this - he and everyone else deserve to have some small bonus in MKR that they can and will use in governance to get skin in the game. People can buy MKR and use it in governance at any time, and then just take it away and sell it.  This is MKR that is locked up for 1-3 years minimum.  It simply doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t hit the markets until 1-3 years has passed. MKR building in governance for people working positively for the system that can\u2019t sell or got to LP and can vote in governance by these same people. Hmm.  What a concept! ",

But beyond that - I hope you will co-author the MIP with me if this finds support. The details we all can work on and talk about (like the % to start with and implementation).

You\u2019re right, it is a concern, but I think that the solution to that is solid moderation. We can combat people trying to game the system to take advantage of incentives. If someone is doing such a good job of gaming that they\u2019re actually providing value, then there is nothing to combat, that\u2019s what we want to encourage with the incentives. People doing things for the money works well enough for most of the world. I agree that in a perfect world you want people who care deeply about the Protocol to be the ones working on it and governing it, but that isn\u2019t a hard requirement in my eyes. ",

But the core incentives have to originate from actions taken or not taken with the MKR token.  If the core incentive system is off-chain actions then what exactly is the MKR system?  It would not have elegant tokenomics.  The MKR token would be even less attractive than it is now (for whatever reason that currently is lol, I for one can\u2019t put my finger on it) and in which case I would advise just sticking with the tried and true buy and burn as boring as it is\u2026 ",
