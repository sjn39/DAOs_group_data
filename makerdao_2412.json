Therefore, the token adapter for TUSD was fixed to a specific implementation of the code. This morning, TUSD underwent 3 upgrades (an upgrade that was missing some safe math checks, then a downgrade back to the old one, then the one that\u2019s currently active). Token Adapters are some of the most powerful contracts in the Maker Protocol. They have access to the system core and require extensive auditing and vetting. We put this implementation whitelist in place to protect the system. Glad to see that it\u2019s working! Personally, I don\u2019t see any malice here, but we are going to need another round of verification for the new implementation. We can discuss more here or in chat and I\u2019ll be in touch with Rich and LFW and others to see how we proceed. Thank you! ",

We have not reviewed any other implementation so the circuit-breaker was triggered that blocks new Joins and Exits.   TUSD can revert their implementation to the original contract and the adapter will immediately resume joining and exiting.   The Smart Contracts team can review the new implementation and present it for approval in a future executive spell.   The adapter supports multiple whitelisted implementations, so if TUSD or other tokens using the UpgradeabilityProxy would like to upgrade in the future, we can preemptively add a new implementation to the adapter whitelist to avoid any disruption in service.

This means that deposits or withdrawals of TUSD are currently blocked. The actual change in the new implementation contract is to block using it from an old version of a TUSD proxy contract. Initial analysis from our team shows that although the current motivation for this change is not yet clear, this new restriction is not a security issue on its own. We expect that supporting the new implementation contract will be included in one of the upcoming executive votes. It should also be done in order to allow the TUSD offboarding process to complete.
