                    "content": "Now that we are putting the PSM on hold. It makes sense to move to our next best option to restore the peg - lowering the Liquidation Ratio on USDC-A. Lowering the Liquidation Ratio to near 100% will effectively give us a mechanism similar to the the PSM for the purposes of this short term farming demand. One thing to note is that, since USDC auctions are currently disabled, we need to take care to make sure there is enough of a buffer that we do not end up with unbacked Dai due to accumulating Stability Fees. It is for this reason I am also suggesting we  consider lowering the USDC-A Risk Premium as well. As an example, if we maintain the current rate of a 4% Risk Premium and the Base Rate stays at 0%, then we give ourselves a little over 1 year of buffer at a liquidation ratio of 105%. If we were to set the Risk Premium to 0% then we would effectively have no time limit to get the auctions in at any liquidation ratio. In terms of timelines - I\u2019m hearing from Rune anything above 6 months is a conservative estimate to delivery for the USDC auction support. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong on that. Update (July 23rd): I\u2019ve extended the deadline to next Wednesday, and added pros/cons for lowering the Liquidation Ratio.  Pros  Approaching a Liquidation Ratio of 100% will allow stablecoin farmers a method to get into Dai that is more attractive than market buying at a premium. Allows for higher leverage shorting of the peg vs USDC. In general it improves capital efficiency not having to hold 20% extra USDC doing nothing.   Cons  Higher leverage allows a single actor to more easily max out the debt ceiling. This makes Maker more prone to \u201ctrolling\u201d behaviour where one or two actors squeezes legitimate actors out. Lowering the Liquidation Ratio decreases the amount of time the auctions team has to turn on the auctions. This is because the accumulating Stability Fees may put the collateral value under 100% of the Dai value.   Poll 1 - Lower the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio     Keep the Liquidation Ratio at 120% Lower the Liquidation Ratio to 115% Lower the Liquidation Ratio to 110% Lower the Liquidation Ratio to 105% Lower the Liquidation Ratio to 101% Abstain     0 voters      Poll 2 - Lower the USDC-A Risk Premium     Keep the Risk Premium at 4% Lower the Risk Premium to 3% Lower the Risk Premium to 2% Lower the Risk Premium to 1% Lower the Risk Premium to 0% Abstain     0 voters     This poll is being extended to Wednesday July 29th as the risk team does not believe this to be an emergency.

At the same time it is still limited by the USDC-A debt ceiling. (So no point of a very low CR if we\u2019re still constrained by the DC) I do agree that the USDC-A CR could be lowered. But I don\u2019t think we need to make drastic moves to lower it to 101%. Once you lower the CR, it\u2019s much harder to ever raise the CR. ",

Not saying that everyone is thinking like me, but let\u2019s assume that\u2019s the case, what do you think the situation will become in the following scenario : A. No actions taken. B. Liquidation ratio 101% and risk premium 0% C. PSM 1 USDC == 1 DAI (-+ fee) To me, A. means DAI won\u2019t get back to 1 == 1, or maybe just for arbitrageurs. B almost creates a binding between DAI and USDC, but I will still close my CDP and my DAI with my USDC from the secondary market when peg gets back to 1 == 1, because of the risk of the parameters to change in the future and being liquidated and having the manage things proactively. C definitely creates a binding between DAI and USDC. I guess it would restore the peg, but I am not sure about the consequences in what the nature of DAI becomes (will a DAI be just a USDC-minus-fee coin ?). Overall, once again, I don\u2019t have full understanding of the system, but I feel like I am not the only one, hence my behavior might be more or less an indicator of a general trend (?). I guess people don\u2019t always try to answer questions when there are too many, so I\u2019ll try to summarize then in one :  If I know DAI is cool, that the goal is to have 1 DAI == USD, that it costs risks or interest to generate DAI, what is the long-term incentive generate DAI from a CDP vs. buying them at 1 == 1 (when restored) ?
