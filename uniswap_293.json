I would like to ask / offer what do you think the chances are that Uniswap, can become something more than an exchange and liquidity pool. Why wouldn\u2019t Uniswap offer lending and borrowing or insurance services? With a flexible management model, perfect reputation, and such a team, I think Uniswap would do the job of Compund, AAve and others just as well. What do you think uniswap could become more than just Swap/Pools?   And the second question, we know that Uniswap v3 will appear soon. Does this mean that the \u201cUNI\u201d token will be the native token of the third version?  ",

The market seems to be favoring strong parts that can be mixed and swapped and added on to form more complex parts. Unitrade and a couple others are trying to add a limit book on top of uniswap, 1inch and the other aggregators drive volume through uniswap. Projects bootstrap their token through uniswap and plenty of the stuff for those trying to maximize yields include uniswap. Aave\u2019s uniswap market hasnt worked out yet, but they still went and built a tool for lending LP tokens. So you can either be the perfect part for everyone else to integrate, or you can compete with them all and they\u2019ll all swap to the second best dex. ",
