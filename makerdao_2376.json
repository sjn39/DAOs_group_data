                    "content": "Replaced by Guide to the Signaling Process    Previous Content It\u2019s been a while since the signalling guidelines were last iterated on, and in their initial form, they were rather rough ideals, rather than practical instructions on how to create a good signal. This post aims to act more as a how-to and best practices guide that signals should follow. It is divided into sections of what a signal thread must do, and what a signal thread should do. I may add more things to this list as they occur to me. Any objections or comments, feel free to leave them as replies and I\u2019ll update.  A signal thread must\u2026 Use the correct category The #governance:signal-requests category should be used for all signal requests. Using the same category for signal requests allows them to be accessed separately from the rest of the governance threads and helps keep everything organised. It also allows a custom post template which can help point people in the direction of the Signal Request resources.  Have the correct tags Using the same tag across the forum makes it easy to find all the signaling topics, it helps keep everything organised, it helps the community see if there are things to signal on, etc etc. The two tags that should be attached to a new signal are sig-status-active and signaling.  Be limited to a single issue This keeps the topic from becoming a confused mess of different conversations. This is not to say that there must be only one poll, only that all the polls should seek signals on the same issue.  Be run and kept up to date by the thread owner A party needs to both maintain and push a signalling thread to its conclusion. This responsibility falls on the original poster of the polling thread. The original poster does not have to remain neutral on the issue, but  does need to run the process in good faith to its conclusion.  Have clear lines of progress provided by the thread owner The next steps of a signal thread should be communicated by the thread owner whenever anything changes. This can be as simple as a one-line comment explaining what will next happen, and when it will next happen.  Have a title in the form of a neutral question Giving the topic an appropriate title makes it easy to see what the signal is about. Neutral framing is to ensure that you do not prejudice other community members into voting a particular way. This is vitally important no matter how strongly the author feels about the topic.  Use the following settings for any polls:   Results: Visible On Vote  Show who voted: Enabled  Automatically Close Poll: Disabled  People are susceptible to voting with the majority. Conformity bias is a real thing, hiding the results until after someone votes provides an extra incentive for voters to think critically about the issue for themselves. Making votes public after a vote has been cast allows the thread owner to prod dissenting signals to provide reasons for disagreement. Polls should not be automatically closed as it reduces flexibility.  Include an 'Abstain option There are several advantages to including an abstain option in a signal request. Firstly, it allows voters to signal ambivalence or protest in a active way. It also allows the Governance Facilitators to check the results of the vote in-progress while remaining neutral.  Have a completed template for the on-chain poll posted by the thread owner This allows the governance facilitator(s) to post it on-chain without having to re-write or summarize the issue in a way that may induce bias. This avoids the possibility of misinterpretation and allows the debate participants the chance to vet the wording of the poll. PR\u2019s are preferred for those who are familiar with git. The deadline for submitting a PR for a on-chain poll on any given Monday is end of day on the prior Wednesday.  Be summarized by the owner This step should only occur after all off-chain polls have been completed and the on-chain poll has been completed. At this point the thread should be considered finished. The active-signal tag should be removed, and a moderator should be pinged to set the thread to close 7 days after the last reply.  A signal thread should...  Last at least two weeks Anything less than two weeks does not give governance participants a decent chance to signal on the issue. Many participants do not frequent the forum every day, or even every week. In some situations however, the issue is urgent and some signal is better than no signal at all. In these cases, this two week length should be ignored.  Use the following poll settings:   Type: Multiple Choice  Min: 1  Max: Total Number of polling options   Using multiple choice makes it easier to find consensus on options, as everyone can vote for whichever set of options they would be willing to vote for on-chain. It should be used wherever possible. The exception to this is where the polling options are obviously mutually exclusive.  Begin with a summary of the essential information This should take the form of a advantages/disadvantages, pros/cons, positives/negatives to the area being discussed and should be kept up-to-date as the thread progresses. In order to signal, the community should not need to read through the entire discussion, only the initial post. It is the thread owners responsibility to keep this summary as balanced and succinct as possible.  Aim to create consensus When you create a signalling thread, you are trying to gather consensus around a specific proposal, be aware that the proposal may need to compromise to suit as much of the community as possible. The aim is consensus rather than majority-rule, if there is irreconcilable disagreement, the proposal needs to change.  Aim to follow the process laid out here This process is not always fully applicable, but it provides a start-to-end set of suggested steps for going from \u2018We have no information about consensus on this issue\u2019 to \u2018We know exactly where consensus lies on this issue.\u2019  Not move on-chain until there is a majority for a polling option The aim of the signalling process is to gather consensus, if it fails to do so then it has not achieved its aim. That said, it is difficult to argue against the poll moving on-chain if a polling option has a majority voting for it. Garnering significantly greater than a 50% majority should always be an aim for the thread owner. The closer the thread is to consensus in the polling stage, the more likely it will pass on-chain. In rare cases a plurality may be sufficient for a poll to move on-chain, however this should only be done if there is a clear reason of urgency   ",
