For this episode, we will host the Cofounder and Head of Partnerships from Wonderverse to explore this platform\u2019s collaborative capabilities for project building.  Problem Space Maintaining project collaboration amongst different groups in a DAO can be a challenge due to it\u2019s decentralized nature. The completion of Pregame and Endgame requires input from multiple teams within Maker; dependent on each team\u2019s own unique abilities. Current collaboration interfaces focus more on social interactions, rather than project building. These existing interfaces also tend to stand alone and have limited integrations with other software platforms.  What is Wonderverse? Wonderverse is an interface software that coordinates workflow for decentralized teams. It is a proactive hub that can integrate with other source types and people could yield higher productivity and saved time for core unit facilitators.  Within the software, one is able to:  Prioritize and manage multiple projects. Interface with commonly used tools such as Discord and Notion. Configure token transactions with multiple wallets. Initiate and manage on-chain voting. Access web3 features such as token gating. Enable contributors to build and share a native web3 resume.
