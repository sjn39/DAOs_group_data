Several recently discussed EIPs (ERC-4671 Non-Tradable Tokens, ERC-4824 DAOs, and perhaps my proposed EXP) may allow groups to decentralize decision-making and incentivize efforts without becoming financially-driven. Doing so with Ethereum Magicians could serve as a test case for future community governance structures in the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond. Since Ethereum is creating the ecosystem for new organizations to work this way, should the group that manages Ethereum contributions \u201cdogfood\u201d our efforts? Is that something worth aspiring towards in the governing documents? I\u2019m not sure, and generally curious how others think about this. ",
