                    "content": "Function: Assay community sentiment toward programmatically adjusting existing RWA vault structure and reporting to reflect and defend against market conditions. Summary: Macroeconomic conditions, geopolitics, and Maker have changed drastically since most existing RWA vaults were launched. On the macro front, interest rates have risen substantially while inflation has finally arrived. As capital flees risk assets for cash, riskier assets including bonds, equities, and crypto suffer, reducing demand for leverage and thus reducing stability fees on crypto-lending vaults. On the other hand, with regard to Maker, our conservative business model has been battle tested to great effect. Key stablecoin competitors have unwound, highlighting Maker\u2019s relative strength. MakerDAO currently boasts the highest TVL for any DeFi protocol. In short, over the past year, while capital markets have weakened significantly, reflected in higher rates, Maker has grown in relative legitimacy and strength. Proposed Actions: To reflect these changes, we are seeking community approval to increase protections, as appropriate, on existing (and yet to be launched) RWA vaults. These upgrades will fall along two dimensions:  A) Risk Monitoring B) Re-Pricing  Enhance Risk Monitoring: Enhance reporting requirements by vault operators.  RWF will require from all operators an in-depth monthly surveillance/remittance report on an asset-by-asset and portfolio basis. Raw reports will be provided to RWF and reports scrubbed for confidentiality will be made available on the Maker forum.   The report will include not only payments and delinquencies by end-borrower/asset but also a projection of borrowers\u2019 origination volume, financial health and liquidity for the coming months. The report will further include an analysis at a portfolio level. This report will provide a concentration analysis by geography, single borrower, industry, etc. RWF will require a monthly industry outlook from each originator. This will be attached to the monthly remittance report and also be available on the Maker Forum. The industry outlook shall be updated regularly to reflect current market dynamics   RWF will require from all operators a corporate solvency/liquidity report. (This, of course, will not be made available on the Maker Forum). RWF will require all vault operators to notify Maker immediately of any changes to the creditworthiness of any end-borrowers. (Public credit rating or other)   Example: A small business borrower on the other side of an HVB C&I loan loses a contract worth 20% of historical annual revenue. Maker must be informed of the concomitant credit downgrade. Example B: O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, having signed a triple-net lease agreement for a fully delivered outparcel with 6S Development, defaults on a large invoice contract with a key supplier, forcing a downgrade from BBB+. Maker must be informed of this credit downgrade.  Re-Pricing: Update vaults\u2019 structural qualities (e.g. stability fees) to more closely reflect upward movement in international risk-free rates and risk premia.  Upon systematic review by RWF of all vaults, with attention towards idiosyncratic asset class risk, credit spreads, originator\u2019s performance history, originator\u2019s skin in the game, performance projections of industries, and all other relevant characteristics, we expect structural changes to certain vaults.  To minimize business disruption and support Maker\u2019s partners, we aim to compromise by adjusting to the reality of the market while continuing to provide an opportunistic and flexible source of liquidity.   With these two upgrades, @williamr can more effectively monitor Real World Asset risk going forward. As we professionalize with the addition of Socgen/HVB as assets, a comprehensive monthly RWA report will be critical. Such a report will roll-up all RWA exposures into a cogent reporting package for the benefit of MKR token holders. We believe that radical transparency into the collateral that backs DAI is an appropriate antidote to the havoc that opaque leverage profiles have wrought on the crypto market over the past few days. PROS  Increased protections and transparency for Maker as a senior lender Increased visibility for the market into the collateral the backs DAI Increased yield for Maker  CONS  (Likely) Rising cost of capital for vault operators Increased operational lift for vault operators   Poll Please note this is a poll with multiple options. Please select ALL options that you agree with.    Do you agree with the changes suggested above?  YES to Enhancing Risk Monitoring, NO to Re-Pricing Vaults NO to Enhancing Risk Monitoring, YES to Re-Pricing Vaults NO to both YES to both Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will run for 1 week until 2022-06-23T20:30:00Z. If the result is in favour, an on-chain poll will follow. If more than one option receives > 50% of the non-abstain votes, this will take the form of an IRV poll. Next steps with regard to \u201cEnhancing Risk Monitoring\u201d will entail RWF liaising with counter-parties and pushing for compliance with the three components. Next steps with regard to \u201cRe-Pricing\u201d will entail an RWF analysis on a vault-by-vault basis followed by a recommendation to change vault terms accordingly. ",

Apologies that this is coming so close to the end of the off-chain poll, but we felt starting the initiative on the right foot was important.  This is a valid Signal Request that seeks community input on RWF-001\u2019s reaction to recent market shifts. The Signal seeks community input on two new possible directions that can be taken with RWA vaults (both current and future), detailed below.  Enhance Risk Monitoring detailed in the OP would require 1) an in-depth monthly remittance report from all RWA vault operators, on an asset-by-asset basis, 2) a corporate solvency and liquidity report be made available to RWF-001, but not published on the forum, and 3) notification from operators at any change of creditworthiness.  Repricing detailed in OP would require 1) RWF to perform a systemic review of all vaults, likely resulting in some structural changes to existing vaults, and 2) repricing of stability fees based on this review. The options for the signal allow the Maker community to pick any combination of adding these two changes, including implementing none. Voters should submit their support for ALL options they would support on a later on-chain poll. Any option receiving more than 50% of non-abstaining votes will move on-chain at the conclusion of this poll (estimated polling date - 2022/06/27). Note that any onchain poll with include a no change option. If the onchain poll is successful (a status change receiving more votes than the option to do nothing), RWF will be authorized to pursue the resulting change. If that change requires an executive vote to be implemented, it will be polled separately and included in a later Executive Proposal if passed. This proposal has been assigned Medium-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

So perhaps since Maker hasn\u2019t gotten going it is a great time to add more requirements. Since these changes are being made after the fact of MIP proposals going through one has to wonder whether/how this will be amended contractually.  (i.e. if there is a trust manager how is this going to change their contracts)   Increases in reporting costs (I can\u2019t even imagine how this is going to be handled). In general, if it is possible without dramatically increasing cost overheads and reducing net I would always support increasing transparency requirements.  I think without hearing one single word from one of the players here on how such changes would affect them @Allan_Pedersen and @mrabino1, Centrifuge, HVB, SocGen, I can\u2019t support such dramatic change that both would have new requirements, punishments if requirements aren\u2019t meant without hearing from our RWA AOs. As to repricing vaults - Maker can and should adjust market rates but no option to abstain from adjusting rates and say no to enhanced risk monitoring so I will stick with NO to both.   I think a very serious discussion regarding RWA rate changes needs to happen as well as it was not clear to me what the terms on rates were with all of our RWA AOs here in terms of size of rate changes and frequency.

                    "content": "In general, what I would prefer is to limit blanket requirements for all potential vault operators.  Not every vault will be the same in size and scope and different types of reports/requirements may make sense.  RWA is not so simple and I can imagine this effort becoming a sinkhole of time and effort which will require more full time employees to negotiate rules then monitor and enforce.  This seems like it could become a centralizing action. I think a better alternative is to simply express suggested or desired metrics to include and to emphasize that transparency is important to us and more is expected as debt ceiling increases are approved.  But otherwise, I\u2019d lean toward leaving room for creativity and flexibility based on vault type/size and the capacity an operator might have.  New Silver is a perfect example of transparency and they have modified their own borrower requirements based on market conditions.  We should be able to trust our vault operators to navigate difficult markets and if we get the sense that they aren\u2019t performing well, we can offload them.  But I don\u2019t want RWF\u2019s hands more and more involved in the day to day decisions made by every vault.  That won\u2019t scale and will quickly become expensive. In regards to repricing, I\u2019m wondering how much time analyzing vaults would take, how frequently we would want to do it and whether this is something that can be pushed to vault operators as well.  If they are incentivized to increase margins when the demand is there, they may have better insight into the correct rates.  But when we have so much DAI sitting in PSMs, wouldn\u2019t we want to increase loan demand rather than raise rates?  I also question the value of MKR spending time and money to reprice now when our RWA vaults are so limited and debt ceilings are so small.  Do it if it\u2019s a simple analysis but what\u2019s a few percentage points of 20 mil if you have to renegotiate with operators and think about how it might compromise demand?  Our RWA vaults are just starting out\u2026maybe we should keep our attractive rates and grow our footprint first? ",

We saw in 2018 the Fed aggressively hike, to only lower rates in 2019.   Right. If rate re-pricing is relevant to a given vault (evaluation done on a vault by vault basis), the new structure will not necessarily be fixed. The idea is to look at A) the risk/nature of the vaults themselves, how such innate properties have changed since initial onboarding and B) how the external world has changed \u2192 re-configure our exposures accordingly, if needed.     flipflopflapdelegate:   What are the consequences for RWA growth (desperately needed), if we start hiking rates at par with the Federal Reserve? Do we have any data models showing that our current borrowers can operate at higher rates? Was there any back testing done by RWF?

How will RWF increase visibility\u2013will it create a dataset that reports daily, monthly, quarterly the health of each loan (please provide more color)?     We aren\u2019t necessarily going to be hiking rates on par with the Fed. Again, the idea is to evaluate and adapt accordingly. An important consideration in this is balancing A) the need for adaptation with B) affect on demand for financing.  It\u2019s also important to understand how constraints on RWA growth have changed since a year ago. We are no longer constrained by demand to fund RWAs via DAI: the origination pipeline is robust and will only grow as traditional capital markets contract. Instead, we are constrained by core unit resources needed to evaluate, negotiate, and structure risk. This answer will be a function of unit economics analysis, which we\u2019ve already requested from key operators. This exercise is meant to go beyond an excess spread calculation and understand the fixed/variable costs of the business. In general, if operators were able to conduct business profitably when vaults were launched, they should be able to palate a bump in cost of capital, as surely they\u2019ll have passed on rate rises to customers. If they have not, likely for the purpose of accruing market share, this is something we will have to consider. Back testing on what? Again, this signal request seeks to gauge sentiment around increasing reporting transparency/depth and evaluating vaults of structural updates. We are at collection rather than execution stage. Given our skillsets, Eric, CP, and I will continue to focus doggedly on growing RWA revenue. i.e. evaluating, structuring, and negotiating bigger and better deals (such as SocGen + HVB as well as on-chain implementations like CFG). @williamr has shown an appetite for data management, risk monitoring, and getting RWA collateral on par with crypto-native transparency. I think he\u2019d be keen to build out the functions this SR alludes to. Not sure yet. But will look to put much of the reporting lift on operators. I\u2019d imagine @williamr has some ideas on how to tie the disparate operator reporting into a comprehensive portfolio report for the benefit of MKR holders.  ",

But just want to note that counterparties sending confidential information to core units, that the core unit then confidentially retains and processes internally, sharing only a part of it with the community might be private entanglement   @rune Agreed here with the principle of distributed data management and access control. I take this topic very seriously. It\u2019s a matter of resilience for the DAO, at the end of the day. By default and as much as physically possible, offchain data, whether unstructured (e.g. contracts, deeds, resolutions) or structured (e.g. remittances, performance reporting) should be hosted in decentralised storage that is queryable by the community e.g. open IPFS or similar solutions. There might be instances, however, where a counter-party might not be comfortable with public hosting. In that case, the preferred option is that the counter-parties themselves be the access control gatekeepers for private information, not the core unit(s). This also mitigates risks of confidentiality leakage and puts the onus on consenting access to information on the counter-party primarily, not the core unit(s). In practical terms, many counterparties might not be sophisticated enough to host data in decentralised data environments familiar to the Maker Community. So, we may need to guide or train them how to do so. Hope this provides flavour into how we\u2019re thinking about data management and access issues for RWAs. ",

I am fully behind independent, experienced third parties processing and sharing the information. As @Eumenes and I have have consistently argued since the beginning of the year, public, highly structured, investment-grade securitizations are the best model for Maker as independent, third parties (not the bondholders) process information. We have sought to implement this approach with HVB utilizing an independent, experienced third party (i.e., Calculation Agent and Crypto Servicer) to process the remittances, etc. from HVB. @rune - May I please suggest that we not use the phrase \u201cprivate entanglement\u201d every time that the Core Units use their best efforts to execute on a transaction approved by the Maker community. I fully appreciate the concern that you are identifying, but \u201cprivate entanglement\u201d is inaccurate. As a core unit contributor to @Real-World-Finance, I have zero incentive or interest to receive and not distribute confidential information. The phrase private entanglement implies an incentive . . . there is none. You have correctly challenged us to improve the process vis-a-vis use of independent, third parties and promoting decentralization. I think we are getting there and improving as we going along. ",
