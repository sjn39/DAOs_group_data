Peg issues are largely attributed to yield farming and the recent boom in defi activity. It has been difficult to find adequate levers that governance can pull to improve the peg, but recently the community has rallied around some variant of lowering the USDC LR. At the moment the DC is full for USDC. Any lowering of the LR will be moot unless we raise the USDC debt ceiling as well. Since we also recently onboarded the PAX stablecoin, we will be able to diversify our stablecoin custodial risk by applying similar DC and LR to PAX. I propose we create an emergency executive vote for Monday with one of the following emergency actions: Option 1: 1.01 LR USDC-A LR: 101% USDC-A DC: 200 million PAX LR: 101% PAX DC: 100 million Option 2: 1.05 LR USDC-A LR: 105% USDC-A DC: 200 million PAX LR: 105% PAX DC: 100 million Should we take Emergency action to fix the peg?     Yes, ranked vote of LR Yes, Option 1 (1.01 LR) Yes, Option 2 (1.05 LR) No Abstain     0 voters     More discussion on this topic here: [Signal Request] Dai is at 1.04, going towards 1.05. Should we fix the peg with an emergency vote to lower stablecoin LR and increase stablecoin DC? - #32 by befitsandpiper  In order for this to be put into the executive on Monday, we will need at least 40 voters, and at least a 50% majority in favor of the action as per the emergency process here: Emergency / Urgent Governance Process ",

The solution could have been better and smarter but the more we debate and wait, the less we create value for customers and token holders. We are now behind Synthetix in market cap. Unacceptable.

The future of DAI is the balanced ratio of RWA + stable assets + volatile assets and diverse assets. Currently, volatile assets account for more than 90% of the DAI quota.

I also am wondering if people are putting USDC into a vault at 1.01 isn\u2019t the point here is that risk is zero from a pricing standpoint to take on the 1DAI for 1.01USDC short/long term short bet\u2026 I think what happens is everyone dumps on USDC-A at LR 101 until the PEG drops to or just below 1.01 and how much liquidity (DC) it will take in that facility to do it and keep it there. Also realize you are kind of bound then to make sure RWA comes on line to buy up that USDC - which I know they are ready to do. So lets say I switch here and go for 101 what stablecoin ala USDC DC are people even thinking about when they say they want a 101 LR? One other thing I wanted to add. EDIT ADD: I DO NOT consider this an \u2018emergency\u2019.  Nothing fails in the protocol up here.  A high PEG hurts business.  I don\u2019t know enough about Maker business in total to make a call if 1.03 is an emergency but nothing breaks in the protocol itself.   When I think about a possible emergency is a PEG that is 1.1 and climbing fast - no liqudity - then maybe yeah - a liquidity emergency\u2026 Which in principle can be filled by a USDC 101LR vault as long as there is DC there.  There is PEG control as long as there is DC.  Without DC zero control.    So if we were going to sit here and really think about it there should be no DC on such a facility.  Take the bet - with as much USDC as the market wants to give.   Then this protocol will have at its highest a 1.01 DAI price.   Then consider lowering the LR to 100.5.   If one has in effect an reasonably (controlled by something like this     Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module: Pre-MIP Discussion Proposal Ideas       Hi all,  The purpose of this forum post is to revisit the discussion on how a Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module could work. This work builds upon the thoughts generated in MIP17 and the subsequent community discussions such as the Working Group Call and the 30th July G&R Call, which describes MIP17 as laying the groundwork for a future Instant Access Module (IAM) to help automate such functions.  This post, therefore, illustrates exploratory work done by the Smart Contracts Team for how an IAM \u2026     one just accordions liquidity out as markets need it, and accordion it back in as system grows (particularly through RWA over time). Have to ask if we are at 1.03 might we want to start with a LR of 102 or 102.5 and say 50-100M DC and see what happens vs. going straight to 101?! ",

If goal is to make a price cap on DAI at $1.01 by using 101% LR and pushing debt ceiling on stablecoins as high to achieve $1.01 price goal, we might need to increase exposure to stablecoins to about 200m or probably even more, about half of portfolio exposure minimum. Here you can see how much DAI needs to be traded on DEX into USDC alone to reach $1.01. But that\u2019s only DAI USDC pair so you need to perform calculation for USDT and TUSD pairs as well and assume some equilibrium on those AMM, plus include CEX pairs. Screenshot 2020-09-12 at 09.22.541820\u00d71166 139 KB The most disturbing part is that Maker is essentially competing with all other stablecoins deposits on AMM such as Curve or Swerve. So if a large institutional whale deposits 100m USDT to Curve, Maker essentially needs to mint proportional amount of DAI in order make DAI stable. And there is this vote happening on Curve, that will change A parameter from 2000 to 1000 and will probably move the DAI price higher, because currently it is kept artificially low. ",

We do know that lowering LR to 101% is a high risk move both in just pure numbers and both on the philosophical level. Additional 60M USDC-A DC will be available soon, I think we should first observe the outcome of this increase before doing other changes. This request equates PAX with USDC, which is clearly not the case by any means. PAX was added very recently and due to the fact that PAX holders did not interact with DeFi historically, I think we should give them more time. There is only 150M PAX effectively in circulation (130M is held by PAX treasury), I dont think we need a 100M DC. Do we expect that the majority of PAX in circulation will go into Maker as collateral, I dont think this is something Maker should allow. Reversing the 101% change is very hard in a non capital distorting way for some stakeholder of the system or creating high pressure on dai. Current DeFi financial markets have new dynamics which are not present in traditional fin markets due to AMMs. Due to several different liquidity mining schemes (Curve, Swerve, Sushi + other food tokens), AMMs are highly liquid, which means actual circulation of units has a heavy impact on the price (there is 2B USDC and almost 9B USDT on Ethereum). The effect is clearly visible across \u201cdomestic stablecoins to Ethereum\u201d, which all trade with a high premium relative to \u201cforeign stablecoins\u201d. Good example is sUSD from Synthetix (~98M units in circulation) which traded at $1.05 just hours ago.  ",

How about set it to current DAI/USDC price plus 0.5 and reduce 0.5 every week until it reaches to 1.01? Suppose DAI/USDC is 1.02, we set it to 1.025, then price can\u2019t beyond 1.025 or it will be eaten by the arbitrage bot and people will realize the DAI/USDC can\u2019t beyond the price; Then we reduce 1.025 to 1.02 after one week.

If 101% gets a lot of support and publicity, we can expect the market to go to 1.01 just before the executive is executed. Knowing that there will be a vault to backstop them, they can use Compound to short DAI (150M DAI there). You can also expect DAI farmers to profit from it. We have an opportunity to solve (somewhat until RWA) the problem and focus on innovation instead of dealing with something that should have been fixed 3 months ago. Each day we are messing with this problem cost us at least 1M$ of market cap (compare MKR evolution/market cap with the rest of DeFi space). Our inaction may have just cost us 90M$. What\u2019s your deadline? How much more value do you want to destroy? 101% LR is not perfect but will not cost us anything and is currently the winning option. If Maker creator thinks it\u2019s the good option, I tend to agree. I no longer want to talk about the peg. Let\u2019s fix that. Let\u2019s talk about RWA and how to increase MKR value. ",
