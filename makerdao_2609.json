It also seems that DAI will become something like BTC - a protocol that doesn\u2019t change (improve) much / a store of value that you hodl and don\u2019t use for payments. For payments and trading you will use L2 solutions and other coins referencing DAI. The peg will be influenced mostly by MCap and the market sentiment - the rates that the governance defines will become more and more useless. We saw with the yield farming how easy is to (at least temporarily) disrupt the market leaders. I\u2019m not sure DAI can survive as \u201cBTC\u201d in the ethereum DeFi ecosystem. ",

There is a difference between not moving as fast as someone else, and moving slowly. What I think we\u2019re seeing with Maker is that protocol-level changes happen slowly. This is good, because every change introduces additional smart contract risk to a protocol with over 1.5 Billion dollars worth of value locked inside it. However, use of the current protocol is actually pretty fast. Even if we only onboard 2 collateral types a month, that averages to one every two weeks. That\u2019s quick compared to almost anything other than the insanity that is DeFi right now. It\u2019s only going to ramp up further as the processes become more efficient and the budget and personnel directed towards onboarding increases. ",
