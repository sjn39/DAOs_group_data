We\u2019re accomplishing this goal by onboarding our community to web3 through social and environmental impact events we call \u201cImpact Onboarding\u201d. As a result, we have created a crypto economy on the island with almost 30 businesses accepting crypto - mostly DAI on Arbitrum. The DAI comes from the Gitcoin GR15 round we recently participated in. We\u2019d like to connect with other projects or community members doing the same to learn about your experiences and get feedback for improving our strategies. This is a recent example of our education efforts including a transparency report with the DAI tx to pay for the meals we bought for all the attendees. https://twitter.com/web3beach/status/1592969376051105792 This is also a new program we launched: MINI GRANTS! By participating in our Public Goods events, community members earn proposal power. They are now eligible to make proposals for other public goods initiatives we may not have considered ourselves. It\u2019s a small steps towards turning our island into a living DAO. https://twitter.com/web3beach/status/1596121359842955266 If you are working on a similar project or know of others, please let us know so we can connect and bounce ideas.
