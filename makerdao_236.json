                    "content": "The New Silver AO pool on Tinlake has been live for ~10 months and approved as the first RWA with MakerDAO for ~6 months. Total pool value is ~17mm DAI and MakerDAO\u2019s debt is ~9.3mm DAI at the time of writing. Maker currently holds ~72% of the DROP share. There have not been any defaults or re-payment issues since the start of the pool, and this is currently the largest RWA pool. Our current covenants call for a 105% overcollateralization and a minimum of 15% TIN (junior) tranche. The AO is using technology and improved process to become a market leader in the short-term real estate lending space in the U.S. ($50-100b per year market), and is 100% focused on its\u2019 partnerships with Centrifuge and MakerDAO to continue to originate high-quality debt, while adhering to strict underwriting guidelines. The AO is also putting additional efforts into bringing in various institutional and HNWI investors into the pool, educating the wider community and spreading the word about MakerDAO. Therefore, given the seniority of the MakerDAO debt and many other protections, including borrowers\u2019 equity on every loan, we hope the community would consider adjusting the maximum share of DROP tokens that the DAO is holding. We would like to propose increasing the maximum share from 75% to 85%, with the covenant that the AO will have 50% or more capital exposure in the TIN (junior) tranche. Currently, the AO has ~2mm out of ~3.2mm total TIN. If the exposure falls below 50% in the future, the covenant will revert to a maximum 75% DROP share.  Pros:  Ability to add additional loans to the pool Decreases risk impact of potential individual loan defaults with larger vault size Increase MakerDAO revenue Remove constraints while the outside investor base is being built up   Cons:  Potential increased risk in case multiple loans defaults   Next Steps This signal request poll will run for the next 2 weeks, until Thursday, November 4th. If a majority of forum voters (excluding abstain votes) are in favor, the proposed changes will be submitted for an on-chain governance poll the following week.

Is it that you\u2019re having difficulty attracting other investors on Tinlake as quickly as you would like, or just a better cost of capital? Or both? Or something else? If it\u2019s speed of scaling, are you finding qualified borrowers who you must turn away? If it\u2019s cost of capital, wouldn\u2019t a willingness to hold a majority of the TIN tranche suggest we aren\u2019t charging enough? With NS holding the majority of TIN and Maker already with majority of DROP, do we even need to do this on the Tinlake platform since it\u2019s approaching a two-party agreement rather than a big pool?

We are doing this to give us some agility to move forward in case (and we are not certain if this will ever happen or not) we have larger loans or a volume that exceeds the current inflow of Drop. New Drop investors are coming in almost daily, and as expected, there are some withdrawals, so I suppose the best answer is that this would be a potential short term solution, in case its needed. We do not anticipate having challenges raising additional Drop, as you may have seen in my last update, we are hiring a capital markets person, and new investors are coming in on their own. Of course a (slightly) better cost of capital does not hurt either. We have shifted gears recently to focus on institutional investors, as our pool gets larger, smaller retail investments move the needle less, and the investment minimum was lowered to 5k in order to give as many people who want to participate in this opportunity. We are viewing this request as a short term solution in case our pace exceeds ability to scale these institutional Drop investors. In terms of TIN, we took on the additional risk because we want to show the community that we have strong conviction in what we do and are willing to risk a significant amount of our own capital in efforts to grow this together. We did not view the goal of that as primarily for financial gain. Hope this provides some clarity, thank you. ",

The 25% of co-investor was to protect the legal arrangement. The number was quite arbitrary and I suggest MakerDAO members (as some have) to co-invest in the pool to defend MakerDAO if need be. I have a meeting with Shearman & Sterling next week to study how to use the Cayman Foundation to own the DROP and solve this problem (discussed and approved last year). Regarding DROP co-investors, all the future deals are with MakerDAO as the sole senior lender. Individual not really move the needle (I mean you need to KYC, easier to just ape into Klima and get rekkt) and it\u2019s still early for institutions (especially no DROP custody support right now). Tinlake allows us to be fully on-chain and not to have to deal with DAI conversion and custody it also brings some hard constraints on the waterfall. But you are right @PaperImperium , I think we should push toward having a real securitization ecosystem in DeFi, that will create competition for MakerDAO but also some huge wins (liquidity for instance). But we are really super far from there. It is the same problem with SocGen, we might join the ecosystem but unlikely that it will be a big one for years. ",

The part I\u2019m the most excited about is really to have the legal ownership of DROP to an RWA Foundation (or whatever structure). Then asking for a security interest in the SPV membership. This would allow the RWA Foundation to take ownership of the SPV if things turn bad. This is a new idea taken from the SolarX deal. BTW, maybe we can get the DAI Foundation to invest at least a bit (a few DAI) in those DROP (ping @sorenpeter ). This is another value of securitization, we can decentralize ownership easily. ",

Governance Problem Today: Delegates need to vote on complex proposals (new CUs, budgets, collaterals, etc). Recognised delegates (even if paid a lot) have:   limited time available, and limited knowledge on technical topics.
