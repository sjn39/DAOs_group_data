The fees that UNISWAP generates from the LP of 0.25% tax  and the additional 0.05% UNI token incentive was a way to entice LP to UNISWAP? Yes but perhaps a balance must be reached to avoid dumps of UNI because otherwise without the right tokenomics a loss of real value will be faced by uni as opportunity cost. It is not clear as several replies above show that a BB&B is enough to stabilize UNI value let alone provide any real increase in value. If the UNI token doesn\u2019t do anything, and is not even enticing to LP, then it is effectively useless.

Also, the UNI token isn\u2019t money and does not claim to be. It\u2019s more a kind of share. Diminish UNI token supply has little or null impact in long term price.
