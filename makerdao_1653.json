Look, I\u2019ll be blunt  Maker has the best governance apparatus in the world Maker\u2019s community & core teams know more about finance, stables, holding a peg, etc., then I\u2019ll ever know yet, Maker\u2019s execution excellence and my relative financial ignorance have no bearing whatsoever on the observation that Maker\u2019s strategy has been fundamentally all over the place for a couple years, at least since Black Thursday.  I\u2019ll add that I\u2019ve tried to address pieces of these issues in the past, including during the early weeks after Black Thursday, and have never received substantial engagement from Maker leadership. tbh in my perception, there\u2019s an aspect of elitism here, and its track record of it has started to speak for itself. I was a huge DAI customer, I loved DAI, DAI\u2019s reputational asset is significant, and I hope to be able to be a big customer of DAI in the future. But rn for years, I don\u2019t even know what DAI is doing. It doesn\u2019t give me censorship resistance or general risk minimization, and I can\u2019t use my house as real-world collateral to borrow against, so there\u2019s just no fit there, and that\u2019s too bad. Regardless of what the Maker community decides to do here, wishing you success. Best, Ryan ",
