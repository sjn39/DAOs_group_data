                    "content": "I\u2019ve talked for a long time about writing a blog post called \u201cTokens live in your wallet and other lies\u201d. ERC20 and ERC721 NFTs are centrally deployed and controlled contracts that store how many tokens are in each user address, centrally. There was a post:   twitter.com          Boris Mann (bmann)     @spencernoon part of it is the current permissioned design.  We\u2019re stuck on ERC20, when we _could_ design with them being fully \u201cowned by individual accounts.   That gets us closer to bearer instruments. Then we just need @leashless\u2019s legal ownership framework.\u201d  2:35 PM - 4 Apr 2019     8            And then there were MANY follow up posts and short Twitter misunderstandings. But also lots of interest! Also, @expede was on a plane #whenDoesBrooke land.   twitter.com          MuteDialog (MuteDialog)     @bmann @spencernoon @leashless So you mean that accounts could have n token balances in the same way they have an Eth balance today or something different?  2:35 PM - 4 Apr 2019     1            But we think that yes, we can have tokens and NFTs that are more directly \u201cowned\u201d by individual accounts.   twitter.com          Brooklyn Zelenka \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc6d (expede)     @maurelian_ @bmann @MuteDialog @spencernoon @leashless We can absolutely do this on ETH1. If we drop backwards compatibility, we can do this in a very straightforward manner that also works with state fees. Comparability requires a bit of bookkeeping, but nothing too wild  2:35 PM - 4 Apr 2019     4              twitter.com          Brooklyn Zelenka \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc6d (expede)     @maurelian_ @bmann @MuteDialog @spencernoon @leashless No protocol upgrade required for the interface, state management, and control. (ie only contract changes.) Having state stored under your address or not is fully inconsequential IMO. Ethereum is fundamentally an event stream, not a reified DB aggregate  2:35 PM - 4 Apr 2019     3          2             \u201cEthereum is fundamentally an event stream, not a reified DB aggregate\u201d  Some of this thinking may cause us to make different choices about how to construct accounts and tokens in ETH2. Some of them may evolve on ETH1 because of state fees, where we can learn and make some use cases easier / better / more secure in ETH2 \u2013 either at the VM layer or elsewhere within the protocol. Now, there is this long form thread. And eventually #BrookeWillLand. Please do continue to share links and info. @Arachnid @fubuloubu @maurelian ",
