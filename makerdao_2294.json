We are making changes that specifically incentivise the creation of more DAI  (though admittedly not from ETH) We want the price of DAI to drop. The ETH price has been moving upward which tends to drive demand for DAI minted with ETH. The ETH-A SF is set to 0% which is a large incentive to mint DAI from ETH. We are shutting down SCD soon, which may result in more demand for leverage using ETH on MCD.  Cons:  Risk in the case of large ETH crash due to the OSM attack vector.

But realistically, the executive is tomorrow. Is it technically possible to put a on-chain poll in tonight and have it finish tomorrow morning? Yes. Is it warranted? In this case, I don\u2019t think it is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted in this case because this is a very one-sided issue. I\u2019m willing to go out on a limb and say that there is no valid argument for opposing a 10M raise as against no raise at all. The one con I could think of (the OSM attack vector  mentioned above) is always a risk, and increasing the ceiling by 10M is a relatively small increase in risk that is entirely justified. To be completely frank, I would have been happy if Cyrus or the Smart Contracts team just announced they were including it in the executive. One can argue that rights or freedoms are being trampled on by doing governance in this way, but the thing to ultimately remember is that MKR Holders have the final say. Nothing we say or do here can change that. If MKR Holders HATED the idea of a 10M debt ceiling rise, then they could elect not to vote for the latest executive. I am literally the first person in line to oppose bundling, and I\u2019ll happy spend hours trying to convince anyone who thinks it is a good idea that there are better solutions, but in this case it doesn\u2019t matter, as this change is utterly non-controversial. In conclusion I expected this to be a complete non-issue, the current result of the poll 21 for, and 1 against essentially shows that it is a complete non-issue. To be completely honest, I\u2019m annoyed we spent so much time talking about it in the governance call, and I\u2019m annoyed I had to make this poll. We are literally doing everything we can to increase the amount of DAI in circulation, there is no possible world in which we do a bunch of stuff to incentivise DAI minting and then decide not to increase the debt ceiling on ETH. As to increasing it by more than 10M, well, sure we could have done that, but given the late hour, and the fact that everyone would rather see 10M raise than nothing at all, I think this is fine. Increasing it too heavily does meaningfully increase the OSM attack risk, so it makes sense to aim to keep this ~10-20mil over the current amount. ",

It would reduce continuos voting on the matter and focus on other matters like black thursday (analysis, compensation to vault owners) and onboarding new collaterals (a ton of collaterals were proposed that\u2019s amazing!!). SF and DSR I don\u2019t mention since it\u2019s cero so my focus is elsewhere. ",

Any other criteria that should be added or removed from the list above? ",

For example, raise/lower the eth dai debt ceiling every 48 hours so it is 10% above the current dai supply rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 milion. This way the dai supply could grow more continuously. I agree that this should only be implemented for eth in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, since automation will take some time, we should vote along the lines of some fixed policy like this, with regular votes/polling as we do with the stability fees. As mkr policy votes are starting to grow to a critical level of complexity though, with additional collateral in the works as well, I think we need to start automating away processes that we have a good consensus on, and saving government votes for novel circumstances.
