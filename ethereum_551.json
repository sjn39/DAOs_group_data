This is part of a wider effort to improve standards and specifications, including finding maintainers for major parts of the Ethereum stack, and collecting interested stakeholders who want to work on these tasks.

                    "content": "Thanks to everyone on the call today. Full transcript is on HackMD https://hackmd.io/FUE13Uh_Rj2qLoJOnHILqw?both It is clear that there are two inter-related concerns. One is the production and maintenance of a well-specified JSON-RPC standard. The other is testing and interop of implementations. Boris is volunteering to put some time in to project manage and coordinate efforts, mainly on the spec side and bridging to the EEA. The testing process is something that @pipermerriam\u2019s team at the EF is taking some responsibility for, and as noted below, there are others wanting to collaborate. Action Items / High Level Notes Everyone review the PR of the spec  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1474 Chris L volunteered to be a maintainer let\u2019s push for Last Call so this can get nailed down  Boris to setup separate repo, it may be easier to collaborate there than just in a single PR thread  https://github.com/spadebuilders/ethereum-json-rpc-spec made Chris L a maintainer of that repo  Should there be a separate process for proposing JSON-RPC extensions?  breaking changes and/or major additions to the spec should likely be filed as EIPs for convenience, working group have a separate repo need to start working and see how it evolves RFC process has new RFCs which supersede \u2013 in essence, we are on \u201cversion\u201d 1474 of the spec once approved  Stakeholders include:  client devs, those looking to build a new, compatible client middleware \u2013 web3js, ethers.js --> definitely need devops / people looking to run many nodes miners  Middleware Flags for Debug  many dapp developers don\u2019t know that JSON-RPC exists \u2013 blame middleware for errors talk to middleware about a debug flag or common approach to get at underlying responses  Testing  INFURA has released compatibility / interop testing https://github.com/INFURA/rpc_sanity_test  Bob pointed to Casey\u2019s tests here http://cdetr.io/eth-compat-table/ \u2013 which is an RPC test suite https://github.com/cdetrio/interfaces/tree/0fcb796440dea702e308710457346d29b051f365/rpc-specs-tests \u2013 part of Hive https://github.com/ethereum/hive  INFURA can be involved Dave said he\u2019d be interested in testing loop back with Piper these tests need to get setup again and updated  EEA  Boris to coordinate with Ron / Chaals / Alex at EEA Loop in Ben Burns as EEA technical lead? How will EEA contribute? Likely next step is an internal EEA call with interested members & clients - Block Apps, Quorum, Clearmatics, Pegasys, etc.  ",
