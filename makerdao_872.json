I think what @aburban90 is thinking here is that it might be good to re-engage with them, reconcile the situation with these clients, whoever they can. Unfortunately, my experience is that the negative impact of angry and frustrated customers on overall trust is a mistake to underestimate. Unfortunately it is an unmeasurable impact and therefore we tend to ignore it.     aburban90:  It might not bring everyone back, but at least we show good faith on our part. I think it\u2019s worth revisiting this topic.   It is not a question of who is right, but whether there is still a solution that can bring back the trust of some old customers.

But our attitude is important, because the way we have handled this is going to qualify us in the future. DeFi has given many new, unqualified small investors the opportunity to invest directly in businesses that previously could only be traded through qualified financial intermediaries. This is all well and good, but it is what is causing these problems. We all know they made a mistake then, but it is important that we look after them now, because they could be our future customers.

Nothing in particular, just was thinking about our public image, and this sorta popped into my head as something we kinda brushed under the rug.     Doo_StableLab:  And that extreme day was the same situation. You shouldn\u2019t open a margin position without understanding its potential risk and return   I agree, there is obviously onus on the risk takers, who are taking on leverage. They accept the risk, and deserve to lose when the trade goes against them. However, that day was exceptional because while they did deserve to lose for taking a bad bet, our protocol also failed to execute effectively. They should have lost, but not all. We bear some blame (and we did pay for it, in minting MKR).     purrfection:  It is not a question of who is right, but whether there is still a solution that can bring back the trust of some old customers.

It\u2019s easy to just dismiss the issue, absolve ourselves of blame, call it resolved or whatever\u2026 but, the reality is\u2026 we have lost the trust of some unquantifiable portion of the crypto community. Whether or not we\u2019re justified to not comp, I don\u2019t think it matters. A genuine gesture, even two years later, to \u201cmake it right\u201d or whatever\u2026 is just a good look for our community, our image. It demonstrates our values. Maybe we don\u2019t have the bandwidth for it right now\u2026 sure\u2026 but actually addressing it at some point sooner than later would go miles in unquantifiable ways to reclaiming a customer base, and in defending our reputation.

                    "content": "Black Thursday was a mistake and it is acknowledged as such.  There was a promise of fair liquidation that did not occur and it was massively consequential.  The losses were felt far and wide and the protocol itself was hurt badly in needing to cover the surplus buffer gap at supremely low prices. But I believe the subject of compensation should be put to rest.  This subject is always going to be difficult because those who had losses are going to feel the severity of those losses and desire to be made whole.  However, we must also recognize that the losses are great and compensation would come at a cost.  It would come at the expense of growth potential and at the expense of those who came later with no idea about Black Thursday and simply saw a great idea that is lucrative, useful, and efficient if it works properly. Black Thursday was a software mistake.  Those happen to young projects.  Unfortunately it was a costly mistake that hit MKR\u2019s reputation and its own financial security.  But the world moves on and we have to keep up.  We can spend our time stewing over our losses or contribute toward building something better.  In that sense, MKR is stronger and more bulletproof with things like the emergency shutdown module and liquidations 2.0.  Hopefully something like Black Thursday never happens again.  We are sorry that this happened and we know it hurts.  It hurts and it\u2019s not fair.  But this is the world we live in and the cost of being an early adopter.  From what I\u2019ve seen, the community here is actually very compassionate.  I think I remember a SR to make someone whole for their mistake in accidentally burning their money.  But this is just a different type of request and really the only fair scenario would be for the guy who exploited the bug and took all the collateral to give it back.  Unfortunately, that does not seem like it\u2019s going to happen.  Again, very sorry for those who lost large amounts.  At least you were in the crypto world before the massive spike in growth and hopefully your other holdings have done very well and at least you still had a portion of your collateral in the Dai that you borrowed at higher prices.

The risk is part of the whole system, and on that basis, Ethereum poor performance could be held responsible for that. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. We defended ourselves against irrational claims, we fixed the code, we took all rationally justifiable, reasonable and necessary steps. Indeed, we are unlikely to bring back those lost early adopters, and those who say that any further steps would have very little quantifiable benefit are probably right. But is that really all we can do? The kind of cold professionalism that characterises the current protocol changes is an important and inevitable part of progress and desirable for our future.  As time goes on, the old, sentimental \u2018let\u2019s completely rewrite the world\u2019s financial system\u2019 attitude will inevitably have to take a more rational form, but the question is: are we really rewriting the system or are we just copying the way it works? This can be measured, for example, by how we deal with problems, whether we only treat deposits as financial capital, or whether we see the people behind them when its needed. The ability to act with compassion can be an important financial innovation, because the current financial system is totally inadequate for this. You are right that it would be very hard to do it well, and I have no idea how to do it well. But just because something is difficult does not mean it is impossible. One thing is for sure, if we close the issue and stop talking about it, the problem will slowly disappear and some people will be happy about it. For example, those who were \u201clucky\u201d enough to take advantage of what happened. ",

I just generally believe it\u2019s a good look to accept some part of the blame and offer some kind of plan for compensation, even if it\u2019s years later. We won\u2019t reclaim most of the lost customers, but it\u2019s still the right thing to do, imo. That said, looking back at some of the previous posts on this topic, some of my views:  There is no \u201cattacker\u201d to go after, even if we know who they may be. Whoever did the zero bids was playing by the rules. It would have been right of him to return the ETH as a white hat, but by no means was there an obligation to. Lawyers and judges should not be involved in any compensation we ultimately may or may not offer. There is no strong/defensible case for MakerDAO to be liable for the losses borrowers suffered that day. It was/is a nascent technology and user beware. Compensation is purely a goodwill gesture, which admits that our protocol could have functioned better that day.  I\u2019ll leave this here for now, as I know bandwidth is thin. I do believe it would be a good look for our brand and reputation, but I\u2019m not married to pressing this any further. ",
