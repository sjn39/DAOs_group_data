With that in mind\u2013I\u2019m going to take a different route here and report my Delegated Vote Choices via the Flip Flop Flap Delegate YouTube Channel. I hope to get better at not only recording Vids, but also reporting wisely and thoroughly on why and how do I decide to vote for a pending Poll, and/or Executive. Bare with me, it can only get better\u2026 at least I hope       EDIT:  Ratification Poll for DAI Foundation Core Unit\u2013I wanted to add that I also voted YES, based on the principle that MKR token holders need to protect the protocol incase somebody uses the software developed for the Maker Protocol for negative purposes that will hamper the progress, and more importantly the core principles of MakerDAO. EDIT: MOMC Proposal, August Core Unit Budgets, Housekeeping\u2013I failed to mention that I also support the MOMC proposal and the much needed housekeeping items. And last but not least, please don\u2019t forget to Vote. ",
