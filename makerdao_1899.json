This Amendment removes the eligibility for compensation if a Recognized Delegate fails to meet a threshold of non-abstaining votes.

A different scenario is where a voter is not okay with \u201cyes,\u201d and not okay with \u201cno\u201d and has other valid reasons for not participating in a vote\u2026 then this view can only be expressed today by not casting a vote. Not voting is a very legitimate means of participation, and to the extent the reasons are clearly communicated it is one way a minority view can gain visibility through a form of principled non-cooperation. Other legitimate reasons for not casting a vote include caution in the current environment of regulatory uncertainty, especially for an organization that does not have a legal entity structure in which it is operating. If a delegate or MKR holder has specific concerns about a particular governance action or group of actions, declining to support Executives that sustain an unsustainable status quo should also be understood to provide a kind of good resistance to the tyranny of the majority. If compensation is meant to attract and incentivize a diversity of quality participants with a healthy amount of adversarial views to protect a decentralized project from capture and exploitation, then the provision of compensation should not be narrowly tailored to favor only those who will behave according to the comfort of the ruling powers.

This Amendment removes the eligibility for compensation if a Recognized Delegate fails to meet a threshold of non-abstaining votes.   While the motivation for this amendment is understandable, in my view it creates a worse set of incentives for recognized delegates and Maker governance. The question about whether delegates should be compensated even where they cast a lot of abstain votes was canvassed in the discussion of the proposed MIP 78 (RIP): MIP78: Recognized Delegate DAI Compensation. As I pointed out in that thread, my chief concern is that penalising delegates who vote \u2018abstain\u2019 means they will just start voting \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 etc instead, to avoid the penalty. There will be no easy way of determining whether delegates are solely doing this to avoid the abstention penalty (it would be easy to just make up a false rationale or copy what another delegate has said). This leads to worse governance as voters who would otherwise \u2018abstain\u2019 could vote in a random direction and tilt a result simply for the purpose of claiming compensation. Surely it is better that delegates who want to vote \u2018abstain\u2019 can feel free to express that position, and then that position can be openly criticised and/or debated. Otherwise, we create a malign incentive for those delegates to vote at random and cover up the fact that they would have preferred to abstain. The only real \u2018solution\u2019 as such seems to be Maker\u2019s social layer, with the encouragement of a norm that delegates stake out clear positions when voting. If a delegate can earn the support of some MKR holders with a compelling argument for abstaining on most polls, it seems antidemocratic to forestall that option altogether.     ultraschuppi:  Higher Participation Requirements and Weighting for Executive Votes For security and operational issues surrounding Executive Votes, participation on these should have a higher weight compared to onchain polls and more strict requirements on timing.   On the other hand, I am on board with this amendment. ",

This MIP aims to amend MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation  by introducing the following modification to delegate compensation criteria:  Abstain votes: Recognized Delegates who vote Abstain in over 40% of the Governance Polls they vote on in a given month will be ineligible for delegate compensation in that month.   It also introduces the following modifications to delegate compensation criteria:  Participation score: Recognized Delegates must vote on Executive Proposals or voice their explicit opposition or abstention within 72 hours of them being posted to the voting portal in order for that vote to count towards their participation score. Communication score: In order for a vote to count towards their communication score, Recognized Delegates have one week to communicate their reasoning if they support the Executive, and 72 hours to communicate their decision if they decide not to support it. Executive Votes are weighted by a factor of five compared to Governance Polls when calculating the participation score.   This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth.

ACREInvest raises an important point here. Abstaining can be a form of protest. In any governance framework, protest is a signal. The DAO might not want to discard the signal as long as MKR holders feel the protester is still worth the delegation. I don\u2019t know if a simple Abstain threshold is the right solution. It\u2019s pretty easily gameable, too. I\u2019d suggest a kind of hearing or town hall once a delegate exceeds a certain threshold of Abstaining (say 66%) for more than a defined time (say three months). The abstaining delegate could then clarify their reasons for their stance in more detail than what the voting rationales allow. This way, dissenting opinions or tensions could surface, and the underlying signal could be amplified. Or MKR holders decide that protest, while valuable, should not be compensated for longer than a certain period of time. Then an Abstain threshold in combination with a time-lock is the best solution. Say 66% Abstain over longer than three months. I find the one-month threshold in the PR a bit too short for my personal taste. ",

In the case of MakerDAO governance, an ABSTAIN vote cast means the voter is OKAY with the item either passing or failing. Since our concerns (frequently stated and specified in both Forum comments and summarized on our Delegate Platform thread) involve rather high-level threshold issues, it has not been appropriate to vote at all. We discuss our views with some specificity here in discussion with community members who inquired about and showed an interest in our voting practices of late: ACREinvest Delegate Platform - #80 by ACREinvest    ACREinvest Delegate Platform   The rules for Recognized Delegates are very clear, so the appropriate pay of compensation has been decided by MKR holders and is not a subject open for debate as to what is appropriate. You will find some details set forth here: https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP24#changes That said, we may have been the inspiration for an amendment to these rules now in RFC MIP4c2-SP29: Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics The above reflects the proper way for altering the behavior of participants through a governance designed and approved process that can implement incentive changes. There should be a healthy amount of respect by all community members regarding the rules all agree to participate under. When it comes to disagreeing with the manner in which someone chooses to engage, this is absolutely fine and encouraged, but your disapproval should not be conflated with that someone having taken improper or inappropriate action. Any compensation paid to ACREinvest is compensation earned no matter how anyone feels about it. You will note that compensation requires participation in voting and communicating reasons for voting, and is tied to the amount of MKR delegated. Our decisions regarding voting are understood to have an impact on compensation, whereas participation in the community and governance can still occur whilst NOT voting.   ",
