Yes, Tooling committee Project description (please explain how your project works): Rebel is an Optimism-native web3 content publishing and community engagement platform. Creators and community managers build their own websites on Rebel and activate features like User Profiles, Forums, Blogs, Podcasts, Ranks, Events, Courses and more. Features like Token Gating, Reputation Tokens, Push Messages, Newsletters and Contests help keep members engaged and increase the value participating in web3 projects, especially on Optimism. Project links:  Website: https://rebel.fun/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/rebeldotfun  Discord/Discourse/Community: Rebel  Github: Rebel \u00b7 GitHub   Additional team member info:  ZAlexSnyder  Contributors / advisors:  facesOfEth leann_abad  Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:  Dope Wars (https://dopewars.gg) Mad Realities (https://madrealities.xyz) Beers (https://beers.fun)  Relevant usage metrics: Communities created: 16 Member user accounts created: 4,569  Rebel is a rearchitected version of our previous web2 creator platform. The old version achieved the following KPIs:  $531,617 in ticket sales 83,573 product orders $8,696,066 in gross product sales 360,558 registered users  (note: we wound down our previous company but we\u2019re happy to share access to the old database with the tooling committee to verify this data) Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Web3: Mirror, Showtime, Bonfire, Tellie Web2: Tumblr, Patreon, Substack, OnlyFans Is/will this project be open sourced? In Future Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment: Contracts: August, 2022 Software: September 2022 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Optimism doesn\u2019t have a native social media / community engagement platform. We have an amazing native NFT marketplace with Quix, but once people have acquired their NFTs there aren\u2019t many places to do interesting things with them. Projects mostly use Discord or Discourse which aren\u2019t web3 native and have many shortcomings. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Rebel fills this toolset gap by making it possible for projects and creators to spin up their own branded web3-native social networking spaces and create content and awesome experiences, many of which are only made possible on Optimism. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Having a breakthrough native social app on Optimism gives creators and users a great reason to engage with this ecosystem over competing chains like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Solana. Rebel deploys contracts like community reputation and reward tokens exclusively to Optimism. By providing world-class tools on Optimism we will draw in top creators and their most engaged members which will dramatically expand the number of consumer-oriented users of Optimism. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 100,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? Rebel will match incentives with our utility token, $REBEL How will the OP tokens be distributed? Creator Rewards - 60% - 60,000 Partnership incentives: 20% - 20,000 Developer incentives: 20% - 20,000 Creator Incentives We will track user data and engagement and reward creators for facilitating valuable activity. By establishing value-added behaviors and analyzing end-user wallets, we will distribute rewards for activity like bringing new end users into the Optimism ecosystem. Additionally we will provide OP bonuses for value-added community member contributions like NFT mints and governance participation. We plan to distribute 10,000 OP per month to creators over six months. Partnership Incentives We will approach creative agencies, talent managers, incubators, and similar organizations that can onboard creators and projects they work with and offer them rewards for new communities they activate on Rebel and Optimism. Developer incentives Developer incentives will be used to develop Optimism-specific software and features. In order to distribute rewards in the manner outlined above we\u2019ll need to build open-source wallet analysis tools and referral/affiliate software. Additionally, we\u2019re working on an open-source extension to ERC721s to facilitate the creation of subscription NFTs. If we receive a grant, Optimism will be the exclusive chain that Rebel will allow creators to launch these types of NFT projects on. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? We expect to distribute this initial allocation over the course of the next six months, ending at the beginning of Q2 2023. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative Our goal is to onboard 60 optimism-native projects and creators over the next six months. Our primary focus will be on new projects/creators but we also hope to welcome many existing Optimism projects to Rebel. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? We\u2019re distributing rewards to creators and community managers based on their creating durable communities with members that are engaging and adding measurable value back. Creators and NFT projects who successfully leverage Rebel\u2019s tools will have created communities with very sticky memberships. Content feeds, spaces to socialize, reputation and rewards\u2013these are all membership flywheels that keep users engaged with projects and services they love. OP incentives will be icing on the cake for many but the real reward will be  deeper connection to people and community experiences facilitated by the Rebel platform. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:  Welcome to Rebel Rebel membership NFTs on Quix Misfits NFT Contract Trouble Reputation contract  ",

Web3 native engagement platforms are definitely lacking so I do see a need for Rebel to thrive. My feedback to you is on the following points:  Metrics      mboyle:  Rebel is brand new but under different names and in the context of web2, previous versions of the platform accomplished:   From my understanding of reading this phrase is that you have a current user-base and sales happening, but that you are operating under a different brand. I might be wrong, but I believe you might want to rephrase this to clarify that those were different platforms, and linking those platform if possible as well. You are asking for incentives to attract more creators and developers, but the proposal does lack the numbers to support the current engagement that you have achieved so far. I understand a social network is very hard to start because you need to solve the chicken and egg problem (who comes first, users or creators). My advice is to show that you are able to gain some traction by on-boarding a percentage your stated goal without the incentives: strong active creators and a strong active user base.  Distribution  Clarify the current distribution among the creators. Will all creators receive an equal allocation on signup? how about on engagement? or how much users they attract to Rebet?     mboyle:  aforementioned wallet analysis tools, new smart contracts, and creator referral/affiliate programs with agencies and talent managers.   Clarify the current distribution for devs and partners. This part is not so clear. Why does Rebel want to incentive wallet analysis tools and smart contract wallets?  Co-incentives      mboyle:  How much will your project match in co-incentives? Rebel will match incentives with our utility token, $REBEL   Is the token launched? Will you match 1:1 USD or OP value? What\u2019s the utility of the token for Rebel, its creators and users?   Why the incentives will last Improve your current paragraph on why the incentivizing creators to join Rebel will increase adoption and usage on Optimism. You will need to make a more solid case on why users only if the creators join. Maybe there\u2019s something more than just providing tools to produce engagement and meaningful content. I look forward to seeing what Rebel is capable of doing  ",

Will all creators receive an equal allocation on signup? how about on engagement? or how much users they attract to Rebet?   Distribution will be based entirely on performance. To your question about the need to build wallet analysis tools, the reason for this is because we want to measure community member activity and reward creators based on how much network value their members create in aggregate. For example, if Creator A brings 500 measurably new users (wallets) to their Optimism project they will get 500 units of rewards for having done that, if Creator B signs up 500 existing optimism wallets, they would not receive \u201cnew user\u201d bonus rewards. This goes for all measurable activity like members participating in governance, subsequently minting new OP stuff, creating engaging content, and anything else we can measure that adds value to the optimism ecosystem. Creators and project leaders will only earn OP rewards for value they create, so it will not be equal distributions among creators. The same is true for partnerships\u2013the same rewards will apply and be distributed to partners based on the performance of the communities that they refer / onboard.     marc:  Is the token launched? Will you match 1:1 USD or OP value? What\u2019s the utility of the token for Rebel, its creators and users?   The token contract is launched but we haven\u2019t created a liquidity pool or anything like that yet to support it. It\u2019s still early on the details of how our REBEL token will work and on reflection I\u2019d clarify by saying our intention is to eventually distribute REBEL alongside of the OP rewards but until we have our ducks in a row on how that works, we\u2019d be happy to match the dollar value with our access pass NFTs, which seems  to have been established as an accepted method of co-incentives.
