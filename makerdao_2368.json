Paxos Trust Company (the entity behind Paxos Standard (\u201cPAX\u201d))   Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. PAX is a fully regulated USD-backed stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company with approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). PAX is fully-collateralized (1:1) with USD.   Provide a brief history of the project. Paxos Trust Company (then itBit) received its trust charter on October 5, 2015 making the company the first regulated trust company in the digital asset space. PAX was approved by the NYDFS on September 10, 2018 and launched the same day   Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Whitepaper Source Code Ethereum Address - Note that this uses the OpenZeppelin proxy pattern Blog post   Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. The PAX smart contracts are audited by Nomic Labs, ChainSecurity, and Trail of Bits. Full audit reports are available at our GitHub repository. The contract has been upgraded with additional functionality that was reviewed as part of the PAX Gold contract audits. Additionally, Paxos Trust Company has engaged Withum, a nationally top-ranking auditing firm, to independently verify at specific points in time that the entire supply of Paxos Standard tokens is consistent with USD in reserve accounts at U.S. banks held and managed by Paxos. Withum performs month-end attestations of these accounts using standards established by the AICPA. Every attestation report that has been published since the launch of Paxos Standard can be viewed here.   Link to any active communities relating to your project. https://twitter.com/PaxosGlobal    How is the applying collateral type currently used? Today, Paxos Standard can be used to limit exposure to crypto-asset volatility, to remove cross-border transaction fees and to move between crypto-assets with ease or as payment for other blockchain-based assets. While the largest demand today is being driven by the first use case above, we are seeing a significant wave of building and interest in the non-crypto trading use cases.   Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Paxos Trust Company, a New York limited purpose trust company domiciled and headquartered in New York, manages the smart contracts and issuance of PAX. Paxos Trust Company is a qualified custodian under New York law, and in that capacity bears full legal responsibility for custodying the US dollar reserves underlying PAX.   Where does exchange for the asset occur? Many exchanges support PAX trades including Binance, Huobi, Kyber, Okex, itBit, gate.io and many more. Link to Coinmarketcap.   Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Paxos has obtained legal memoranda from two major international law firms, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, regarding the regulatory standing of PAX as it relates to US and UK jurisdiction, respectively. The UK memo, in turn, commented upon broader trends in EU law. Consistent with standard industry practice in these jurisdictions, the firms require that Paxos not share these memoranda with third parties without certain non-disclosure/non-reliance agreements. However, Paxos can disclose that based on the legal advice provided in these memoranda from US and UK counsel, Paxos has concluded that PAX is operating consistent with the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions.   Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Paxos is a Limited Purpose Trust Company chartered since 2015 by the NYDFS. NYDFS approved the issuance of PAX on September 10, 2018, making PAX the first fully regulated digital asset. Both Paxos and its affiliate, Paxos Global Pte. Ltd. (\u201cPaxos Global\u201d), are registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d). And Paxos Global is currently applying for licensing with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (\u201cMAS\u201d) under Singapore\u2019s Payment Services Act.   List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. As Paxos Standard is always redeemable 1:1 with a US dollar, it can be treated the same as USDC and be pegged 1:1 to Dai.   ",

                    "content": "[PAXG] - PAX Gold MIP6 collateral application This is a MIP6 Proposal  for the addition of Paxos\u2019  tokenized gold to MCD. PAXG is a standard erc20 token with approximately $43 million market cap compared to dgx market cap of around $6.5 million. there is a previous discussion thread here for context: [PAXG] - PAX Gold as MCD collateral 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? A member of the makerdao community. Perhaps the makerdao community in general is interested as PAXG is a high market cap, low volatility token which represents a well established asset, namely gold, to help stabilize the dai peg and collateralization levels in the maker ecosystem. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. PAX Gold (PAXG) is an erc20 token. Each token is backed by one fine troy ounce (t oz) of a 400 oz London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in Brink\u2019s vaults. If you own PAXG, you own the underlying physical gold, held in custody by Paxos Trust Company. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Since its founding in 2012, Paxos has always sought to enable the movement of assets, starting with the launch of the itBit exchange in Singapore. In 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services granted Paxos a limited-purpose trust charter, thus establishing it as the first company approved and regulated to offer crypto products and services. By seeking the highest forms of regulation and compliance, Paxos has distinguished itself within the blockchain industry and earned the trust of discerning institutional and individual investors. Paxos has since continued to operate within established regulatory frameworks while creating innovative new products. This includes workstreams in the tokenization of securities, precious metals and commodities, such as the Paxos Standard token, a digital dollar launched in 2018. Along the way, Paxos has raised over $93M in venture funding, added distinguished luminaries including Sheila Bair and Senator Bill Bradley to the board, and grown to 110 employees in three global offices. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Link to any active communities relating to your project. paxos is not decentralized/community driven, but has a blog: https://www.paxos.com/blog/ 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? collateral is used as a cryptocurrency representation of gold which is redeemable for 400 oz gold bars directly through PAX (in 400 token increments) or for smaller amounts through a network of physical gold retailers around the world 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Yes, PAX has headquarters in New York City, Singapore, and London 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Kraken is the largest exchange for PAXG at the moment, although there is also some volume on other exchanges as well as a uniswap pair (with minimal volume): https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pax-gold#markets  The rest of these questions should be answered by @ilan or someone else who is better positioned to answer them than me:  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.

Looking at coinmarketcap it looks like there are 2 USD denominated markets (recognized by them) that total up to about $330K in terms of 24 hour trade volume. Worried that given the low volume we could be susceptible to market manipulation on the oracle front. Curious what people would think about pricing this token based on some spot price of the troy ounce instead of actually relying on market prices for PAXG itself. Similar to how we price WBTC. Could also be convinced that a combination of the two are the best thing to feed into the medianizer. What do people think? Use actual gold price? Don\u2019t use the actual gold price? Why? Why not?

Our legal and compliance team has put together an official response to the MIP questions 10 & 11 which you\u2019ll find attached. As far as fees go, we unfortunately cannot reduce or waive them. Unlike stablecoins (PAX, BUSD, USDC, etc) that generate interest from the underlying USD, PAX Gold has an inherent cost (vault fees) from storing the underlying physical gold. Other gold tokens charge a demurrage fee to the token holders over time to offset these costs, but Paxos does not. Instead Paxos charges a creation fee, a redemption fee and a small on-chain transaction fee of .02% to generate revenue and offset the costs. You can read more on the PAX Gold fees here.

A risk evaluation update was posted in April 2021 and again in April 2022 in which such verbiage were included: \u201cThe Growth team recently learned that further DAI integration is not being prioritised by Paxos. This will likely not be prioritised until the end of 2022.\u201d On May 23rd, an update was posted by Growth Core Unit on the Paxos PSM, stating: \u201cWe had been told DAI would be listed in Q1 2022 but that target has shifted two times and now the ETA is possibly end of Q3, yet with no guarantee.\u201d At the June 6th CMON Stakeholder Alignment Meeting, multiple CUs, including Growth, Risk and CES, agreed that due to Paxos\u2019 reprioritization needs, we would change the status to \u201cWill Not Do\u201d. When Paxos is ready to move forward, a new MIP6 application form should be submitted to restart the onboarding process.  Based on the above, we are proceeding to move the status to \u201cWill Not Do\u201d in the CSI sheet. GROWTH will continue to work with Paxos to pursue new opportunities of integration. ",

                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? MakerDAO community in conjunction with the Ren community. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. renBTC is a tokenized representation of BTC on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an ERC20, and backed 1:1 with real BTC locked in RenVM, a decentralized custodian. It is redeemable at any time for real BTC. RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that provides ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC. What makes RenVM unique is that it does all key management and rotation using its sMPC based protocol that the team has pioneered. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs (e.g. ECDSA private keys) are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it. This allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets, making it possible to mint or burn tokenized representations of these assets on external blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized manner. One of the core features of RenVM is bringing BTC to Ethereum (i.e renBTC). renBTC serving as collateral within the MakerDAO ecosystem is the sole focus of this application, although RenVM also supports renBCH and renZEC. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Q1 2018 - Decentralized Darkpools Ren (Republic Protocol at the time) sold out a $35mm ICO. The original mandate was to build darkpools for digital assets - a way to prevent front-running and price slippage by trading large amounts in a private, decentralized manner. This idea placed the project in the \u2018interface\u2019 layer of the stack. Rather than just building a single darkpool,  the intention was to provide infrastructure for third parties to build multiple dark pools, pooling liquidity and providing a better end-user experience. RenEx and SwapperD were built and delivered (Q4 2018) Q1 2019 - Republic Protocol Evolves to Ren Ren team realizes that what they have built applies to much more than Darkpools, pivots down the stack to an \u2018interoperability (+ privacy) protocol\u2019 and RenVM is born. Rather than operating a single darkpool, or allowing multiple dark pools to build and connect, the protocol will now provide key interoperability infrastructure for DEXs, OTC desks, loan & leverage platforms, liquidity pools, NFTs, dApps, etc. Q3 2019 - Formal RenVM Testnet: August 2019 - Present  This is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. The RenVM Mainnet Rollout Plan articulates the steps for testing and gradual decentralization of the protocol. Follows the recommendation of Progressive Decentralization from Andreessen Horowitz. (Published September 2019) Q4 2019 - RenVM Chaosnet | RenVM Mainnet Unaudited  Formal RenVM Chaosnet: November 2019 - Present The sole purpose of this was to put RenVM Mainnet through as many stress tests as possible prior to Mainnet release. The Ren team believes this prudent approach (a 6 month testing period) to RenVM\u2019s security (in addition to formal verification from security auditors) has been crucial for its robustness and subsequent success. Chaosnet is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. (Published November 2019) Q2 2020 - RenVM Mainnet | Subzero  RenVM Mainnet is released May 27th, 2020. RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) Q3 2020 - Open-Sourcing RZL MPC  One of the most important technical goals for the project is getting to a stage where the team is comfortable open-sourcing the implementation of the RZL MPC algorithm. Over the last month, the Ren dev team has begun decoupling the MPC implementation from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to iterate, test, and understand. As a part of this, they have been implementing new optimizations, building multiple versions of some parts of the codebase to gain even more confidence in its correctness, and moving to a new design centered around easy-to-understand state machines. All of this comes together to make a codebase that is simpler, safer, faster, and easier for everyone to test/review/audit. An overview of this logic, can be found here. The Ren team has engaged with several auditing teams to review these changes, and once they are completed, will be ready to make the codebase available under the GNU GPL v3 license. This is planned for release by the end of Q3 2020, depending on the timeframes of these audits. 4.

Link to any active communities relating to your project. Telegram Twitter Reddit Medium 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? renBTC is a one for one representation of BTC on Ethereum via RenVM. As an ERC20, it is/can be utilized in a variety of capacities within the DeFi ecosystem; lending, leveraging, trading, etc. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No, decentralized protocol 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Individuals can acquire renBTC by minting it with real BTC via the RenBridge. The same minting process can be achieved on 3rd party platforms such as Curve Finance, and others who choose to integrate RenVM (as its SDKs are permissionless). Further, renBTC is an ERC20 and can be found throughout the DeFi AMM ecosystem. 10. Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Yes, legal opinion can be distributed individually upon request. 11. Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Existing MakerDAO BTC/USD oracle. Median BTCUSD OSM Setzer BTC model Prior BTC/USD feed forum discussion Note: RenVM (and its ERC20 based assets) itself does not utilize oracles, renBTC is a 1:1 peg to BTC. 13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. An existing keeper has informally indicated they will take part in liquidations. ",

Ren is constrained by the marketcap of the Ren token. It is best if the locked value is less than a third of the bonded value, or at the very least, the locked value needs to be less than the bonded value. Ren darknodes mainly profit from minting and burning fees. But they can also add a continuous fee on holdings if there\u2019s too much demand for renBTC. So you just need to keep in mind that there\u2019s some constraint to the amount of BTC that can be locked on the renVM. And if it gets too popular there\u2019ll be continuous fees charged. Currently $10m Value Locked. $14m Value Bonded. https://mainnet.renproject.io/ ",

                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @Planet_X. Thanks to @tbone for the majority of content. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. RenVM is an open protocol that enables the permissionless and private transfer of value between any blockchain. The REN token is used as a bond in order to operate darknodes on the RenVM network. RenVM has already brought renBTC, renBCH and renZEC to the Ethereum network as part of the ongoing effort to connect different blockchains. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Q1 2018 - Decentralized Darkpools Ren (Republic Protocol at the time) sold out a USD35 million ICO. The original mandate was to build darkpools for digital assets - a way to prevent front-running and price slippage by trading large amounts in a private, decentralized manner. This idea placed the project in the \u2018interface\u2019 layer of the stack. Rather than just building a single darkpool, the intention was to provide infrastructure for third parties to build multiple dark pools, pooling liquidity and providing a better end-user experience. RenEx and SwapperD were built and delivered (Q4 2018) Q1 2019 - Republic Protocol Evolves to Ren Ren team realizes that what they have built applies to much more than Darkpools, pivots down the stack to an \u2018interoperability (+ privacy) protocol\u2019 and RenVM is born. Rather than operating a single darkpool, or allowing multiple dark pools to build and connect, the protocol will now provide key interoperability infrastructure for DEXs, OTC desks, loan & leverage platforms, liquidity pools, NFTs, dApps, etc. Q3 2019 - Formal RenVM Testnet: August 2019 - Present  This is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. The RenVM Mainnet Rollout Plan 3 articulates the steps for testing and gradual decentralization of the protocol. Follows the recommendation of Progressive Decentralization from Andreessen Horowitz. (Published September 2019) Q4 2019 - RenVM Chaosnet | RenVM Mainnet Unaudited  Formal RenVM Chaosnet: November 2019 - Present The sole purpose of this was to put RenVM Mainnet through as many stress tests as possible prior to Mainnet release. The Ren team believes this prudent approach (a 6 month testing period) to RenVM\u2019s security (in addition to formal verification from security auditors) has been crucial for its robustness and subsequent success. Chaosnet is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. (Published November 2019) Q2 2020 - RenVM Mainnet | Subzero  RenVM Mainnet is released May 27th, 2020. RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) 3 Q3 2020 - Open-Sourcing RZL MPC 4  One of the most important technical goals for the project is getting to a stage where the team is comfortable open-sourcing the implementation of the RZL MPC algorithm. Over the last month, the Ren dev team has begun decoupling the MPC implementation from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to iterate, test, and understand. As a part of this, they have been implementing new optimizations, building multiple versions of some parts of the codebase to gain even more confidence in its correctness, and moving to a new design centered around easy-to-understand state machines. All of this comes together to make a codebase that is simpler, safer, faster, and easier for everyone to test/review/audit. An overview of this logic, can be found here 4. The Ren team has engaged with several auditing teams to review these changes, and once they are completed, will be ready to make the codebase available under the GNU GPL v3 license. This is planned for release by the end of Q3 2020, depending on the timeframes of these audits. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? The REN token is used as a bond to run Darknodes, which power the RenVM network. REN has a one billion token fixed total supply, ERC-20 based. 100,000 REN are required to operate a REN node. REN\u2019s only purpose is to serve as bond for Darknodes, which generate income based on network fees. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? RenVM is a decentralized protocol and so does not bear responsibility for the collateral. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Centralized exchanges: mostly Binance (60% of volume). Further listed on exchanges such as Huobi, Bilaxi and Poloniex. Decentralized exchanges: Uniswap, Kyber Network. 10. Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Presently I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token. 11. Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. At the time of writing I am not aware of any regulatory registrations for the token. 12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. API\u2019s of centralized and decentralized exchanges. 13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. Not known. Most likely we would have to rely on markets. ",

Take a look at the RenVM command center https://mainnet.renproject.io/ Daily volume is about USD1.0 million, this is however not broken down into the individual ren tokens such as renBTC, renZEC etc, but as renBTC is about 99% of total volume it most likely has about the same share of daily volume.     MakerMan:  I am also curious if there are any direct renBTC DAI pairs.   Looks as if https://www.curve.fi/ is busy setting up the renBTC/DAI pair. Do note that this has no direct influence on the REN MIP6 application, this could however impact the renBTC MIP6 application (which is separate).

I think for liquidations having a renBTC/DAI market would be really beneficial.   I wonder abo.ut whether pricing oracles could be easily manipulated given the low volume.    I saw people talking about wBTC pricing oracle on compound using BTC and not wBTC.  I keep wondering if we need to utilize multiple pricing oracles to determine whether to liquidate or not.  BTC has pretty large volume, but renBTC doesn\u2019t so perhaps on some of these low volume tokens that have a high volume underlying we need to think about using some kind of volume weighted oracle price between the high volume underlying and the low volume primary.   I guess that is something for the risk/oracle groups to mull over. I also agree this may not affect the ren MIP6 collateral application but the renBTC specific implementation. ",

For the third time, thanks to @tbone for the majority of the content in this application.  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. renBCH is a tokenized representation of BCH on the Ethereum blockchain. It is an ERC20, and backed 1:1 with BCH locked in RenVM, a decentralized custodian. It is redeemable at any time for real BCH. RenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that provides ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC. What makes RenVM unique is that it does all key management and rotation using its sMPC based protocol that the team has pioneered. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs (e.g. ECDSA private keys) are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it. This allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets, making it possible to mint or burn tokenized representations of these assets on external blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized manner. Presently, renBCH has a market cap of only USD110,000. However, BCH is the fifth largest market cap cryptocurrency at around USD 5.5 billion making renBCH potentially a large source of Dai. By including renBCH the Maker community can attempt to make the path of BCH into DeFi go through Dai instead of having all the various DeFi projects integrate renBCH separately. This should be a win for all parties involved.  Provide a brief history of the project.   Q1 2018 - Decentralized Darkpools Ren (Republic Protocol at the time) sold out a USD35 million ICO. The original mandate was to build darkpools for digital assets - a way to prevent front-running and price slippage by trading large amounts in a private, decentralized manner. This idea placed the project in the \u2018interface\u2019 layer of the stack. Rather than just building a single darkpool, the intention was to provide infrastructure for third parties to build multiple dark pools, pooling liquidity and providing a better end-user experience. RenEx and SwapperD were built and delivered (Q4 2018).  Q1 2019 - Republic Protocol Evolves to Ren Ren team realizes that what they have built applies to much more than Darkpools, pivots down the stack to an \u2018interoperability (+ privacy) protocol\u2019 and RenVM is born. Rather than operating a single darkpool, or allowing multiple dark pools to build and connect, the protocol will now provide key interoperability infrastructure for DEXs, OTC desks, loan & leverage platforms, liquidity pools, NFTs, dApps, etc.  Q3 2019 - Formal RenVM Testnet: August 2019 - Present  This is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. The RenVM Mainnet Rollout Plan 3 articulates the steps for testing and gradual decentralization of the protocol. Follows the recommendation of Progressive Decentralization from Andreessen Horowitz. (Published September 2019)  Q4 2019 - RenVM Chaosnet | RenVM Mainnet Unaudited  Formal RenVM Chaosnet: November 2019 - Present The sole purpose of this was to put RenVM Mainnet through as many stress tests as possible prior to Mainnet release. The Ren team believes this prudent approach (a 6 month testing period) to RenVM\u2019s security (in addition to formal verification from security auditors) has been crucial for its robustness and subsequent success. Chaosnet is still utilized to test features prior to implementation on Mainnet. (Published November 2019)  Q2 2020 - RenVM Mainnet | Subzero  RenVM Mainnet is released May 27th, 2020. RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) 3  Q3 2020 - Open-Sourcing RZL MPC 4  One of the most important technical goals for the project is getting to a stage where the team is comfortable open-sourcing the implementation of the RZL MPC algorithm. Over the last month, the Ren dev team has begun decoupling the MPC implementation from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to iterate, test, and understand. As a part of this, they have been implementing new optimizations, building multiple versions of some parts of the codebase to gain even more confidence in its correctness, and moving to a new design centered around easy-to-understand state machines. All of this comes together to make a codebase that is simpler, safer, faster, and easier for everyone to test/review/audit. An overview of this logic, can be found here 4. The Ren team has engaged with several auditing teams to review these changes, and once they are completed, will be ready to make the codebase available under the GNU GPL v3 license. This is planned for release by the end of Q3 2020, depending on the timeframes of these audits.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. renBCH token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x459086f2376525bdceba5bdda135e4e9d3fef5bf RenVM 101 1 RenVM Technical Overview | Wiki RZL sMPC Whitepaper PDF Fees & Economics 2 Safety and Liveness Github Developer Documentation RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) 3 Ren Resource Center Contract Index  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. RenVM Audit Homepage 1 Smart Contracts by ChainSecurity, November 2019 Hyperdrive by ChainSecurity, May 2020 RZL MPC by Consensys Diligence May 2020 3  6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? renBCH is a one for one representation of BCH on Ethereum via RenVM. As an ERC20 it has a wide range of possible uses, perhaps mostly within the defi space.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? RenVM is a decentralized protocol and so does not bear responsibility for the collateral.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? At the time of writing renBCH does not trade on centralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges: Uniswap V2.  10. Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Presently I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token.  11. Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. At the time of writing I am not aware of any regulatory registrations for the token.  12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. API\u2019 s of Uniswap and other dexes that will list it.  13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. Not known. Most likely we would have to rely on markets. ",

I might be very wrong about this but I feel the REN team simply feels too-cool-for-marketing. Just relying on sexier tech and the \u201cyeah - but we are decentralized\u201d argument is not going to win the bridging wars. The BCH community appears totally uninterested in either defi or stablecoins. It is not a topic being discussed to any serious degree on either r/btc or bitcointalk. When the topic does comes up defi is often heavily dissed by the more senior community members. This implies that renBCH growth will come from whales and exchanges not bothering with community interaction and younger members that are not chronically damaged in the seating area from the bitcoin scaling debate. This is highly ironic as BCH in the form of renBCH and subsequently Dai collateral is likely to be the only useful application this coin will ever have. Reading up on this community is like listening to a bunch of dinosaurs arguing about who went extinct first. ",

It does, precisely because the defi integration of the renZEC token is not yet mainstream. In order to participate in the growth of defi, ZEC holders will have the option to go the path of ZEC->renZEC->DAI, instead of waiting for each and every defi project to integrate renZEC directly.

RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) 3  Q3 2020 - Open-Sourcing RZL MPC 4  One of the most important technical goals for the project is getting to a stage where the team is comfortable open-sourcing the implementation of the RZL MPC algorithm. Over the last month, the Ren dev team has begun decoupling the MPC implementation from the rest of the codebase, making it easier to iterate, test, and understand. As a part of this, they have been implementing new optimizations, building multiple versions of some parts of the codebase to gain even more confidence in its correctness, and moving to a new design centered around easy-to-understand state machines. All of this comes together to make a codebase that is simpler, safer, faster, and easier for everyone to test/review/audit. An overview of this logic, can be found here 4. The Ren team has engaged with several auditing teams to review these changes, and once they are completed, will be ready to make the codebase available under the GNU GPL v3 license. This is planned for release by the end of Q3 2020, depending on the timeframes of these audits.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. renZEC token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c5db575e2ff833e46a2e9864c22f4b22e0b37c2 RenVM 101 1 RenVM Technical Overview | Wiki RZL sMPC Whitepaper PDF Fees & Economics 2 Safety and Liveness Github Developer Documentation RenVM Mainnet Dashboard (Network Stats) 3 Ren Resource Center Contract Index  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? renZEC is a one for one representation of ZEC on Ethereum via RenVM. As an ERC20 it has a wide range of possible uses, perhaps mostly within the defi space.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? RenVM is a decentralized protocol and so does not bear responsibility for the collateral.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? At the time of writing renZEC does not trade on centralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges: Uniswap V2.  10. Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Presently I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token.  11. Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. At the time of writing I am not aware of any regulatory registrations for the token.  12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. API\u2019 s of Uniswap and other dexes that will list it.  13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. Not known. Most likely we would have to rely on markets. ",
