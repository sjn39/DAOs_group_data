Paragraph Summary MIP41c5-SP7 voluntarily offboards @LongForWisdom, one of the active Facilitators of the GovAlpha Core Unit (GOV-001). This leaves GovAlpha facilitation in the hands of @prose11 until/if MIP41c4-SP37 passes (which would onboard @Patrick_J).  Specification  Motivation As part of my original Governance Facilitator Onboarding Proposal, I stated the following:  Once we have other Facilitators in place, I may re-evaluate (holding the position) and either decide to step down or aim to move into a different role.  - Onboarding Thread At the time of my posting this, we have one very capable Governance Facilitator in Prose, and a proposal up for a vote to onboard Patrick, who I expect to become equally capable very quickly. Given the current state of GovAlpha, I feel comfortable stepping down from the facilitator role. Thanks to all of you for your hard work and dedication to Governance in the DAO while I was a facilitator. I knew when I took on the role that it didn\u2019t particularly play to my strengths, and that I would eventually become frustrated with it. As GovAlpha (and the DAO as a whole) has grown, the role has become more about managing and directing other people versus working directly. In the near term, I plan to continue to do Governance work with GovAlpha as a contributor (though perhaps after a short break away from Maker). I want to stress that I\u2019ll be staying out of any decision-making or governance-procedural work within GovAlpha, and highlight that this will put me outside of the neutrality mandate of GovAlpha Facilitators. In the medium-long term, I\u2019d like to continue to contribute to MakerDAO, potentially in other positions or on discrete initiatives that don\u2019t involve committing to ongoing responsibilities. If you are working on anything that has a well-defined end-point and you think it might interest me or would benefit from having my input, please let me know. I have no plans to work for any other DAO at this time. After all, Maker is where the action is.  Core Unit ID GOV-001 ",

He was one of a handful of people that took me under their wing when I came to Maker bright-eyed and blissfully ignorant. He has helped me grow, as a Governance Facilitator certainly, but even more so as an adult. It\u2019s hard for even me to envision a MakerDAO without Long as a Governance Facilitator, but I admire how intentional he was with training and building GovAlpha to become a group that can live far beyond any individual contributor. Long could have stepped down far earlier but wanted to make sure the Core Unit and I were fully supported before doing so. He has time and time again put GovAlpha and Maker above his interests. I am relieved to see him release the burden of the position in such a measured way, and I am sure we will only see his contribution to Maker grow as a result of this decision. I am happy to see him free from the cage of neutrality and genuinely excited to see what his next chapter brings. Thank you Long, you did so much more than I ever could have asked. I look forward to having you around as a contributor, as much as I am prepared for you to be poached away  PS:     LongForWisdom:  In the medium-long term, I\u2019d like to continue to contribute to MakerDAO, potentially in other positions or on discrete initiatives that don\u2019t involve committing to ongoing responsibilities. If you are working on anything that has a well-defined end-point and you think it might interest me or would benefit from having my input, please let me know.   Don\u2019t sleep on this Maker community. You will be humbled by Long\u2019s dedication, strive for excellence, and general work ethic. Ensuring Long has a place to keep contributing his talents and motivations will be a great test for our organization, as our growth will be severely capped if we cannot accommodate and nurture our contributors as they evolve and shift interests.

I would echo Payton\u2019s comments that you have handled your off-boarding professionally. In addition, you displayed a sense of duty to the Core Unit and the Maker Protocol by staying on longer than you would otherwise have liked to ensure a smooth transition. After you have had a well-earned break, I look forward to continuing to work with you as part of the Core Unit. I am excited to see your contributions to the discussions within the Maker Protocol without the constraints of a neutrality mandate. I am reminded of a recent call with you and Payton where eventually exasperated, you announced, \u201cYou\u2019re both wrong, and here\u2019s why.\u201d before explaining in great deal why we were indeed both wrong.

                    "content": "@LongForWisdom You\u2019ve been an absolute star in the role. Those that were around at Foundation times know how tough it must have been to take on that role following Rich Brown, another star I have lots of respect for, right at a time where the Foundation to the CU framework was picking up in steam. You had a crucial role in that transition and driving the shape of what the DAO is right now. We wouldn\u2019t be nowhere near where we are without folks like you, @prose11 and other governance contributors. The DAO has changed a lot under your oversight and dedication over this period. I think sometimes this is under appreciated how difficult it must have been to be in the position you are in. Having to referee and be a neutral governance party in a multi-stakeholder and multi-interest environment is not a job for the faint-hearted. It requires an immense amount of resilience and calm. Thanks a lot for that, truly. I\u2019d like to wish @prose11, @Patrick_J  & other folks in the GovAlpha team a lot of resilience and best endeavours. The journey we might be about to embark on will be just as challenging (and hopefully exciting too  ). Please feel welcome! Kind regards, Will ",
