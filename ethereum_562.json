We agreed we should begin conversations around such matters and provide an forum for meaningful discussion. Hence the creation of ETHProduct. Topics:  Distributed product management Open source web3 product management Attitudes towards PM roles within the community Organisational structures  We have had two video calls so far: Community call #0 (Aidan, Pet3rpan) Community call #1 (Aidan, Pet3rpan, Tim Beiko, Yalor Mewn, Chris Remus, Cem F, Chris Seifert, Greg Wong)     Ways of Self Organization in Decentralized Development Cycles Product Management Ring       Thank you everyone for today\u2019s conversation, excited to see where this all goes.  Please add your notes and comments here        #1 ETHProduct Community Call (Video + Notes) Product Management Ring       Nice!  I am planning to do this myself too! Calls already scheduled for next week - looking forward to what you learn as well   Will create some sort of repo to collect this\u2026     ",

Crypto\u2019s matured to a point where execution will emerge as a key differentiator. A white paper and prototype aren\u2019t enough any longer. Crypto projects that execute will make a difference in our world Those that don\u2019t, won\u2019t. An effective PM guides that execution and increases the chances that it happens. ",

The fact that there is such clear aversion to the terms that you mentioned means that we have to care about our language. We can say semantics don\u2019t matter but because people care about them I will go along with it. Yet this does not actually change our actions even if we call ourselves coordinators. I have never managed one of our projects, I have worked with people to make sure they are able to manage themselves. Human beings are perfectly capable of self organization, we just need to make sure that entrenched systems, processes and language does not stop them from being able to achieve their defined goals. That is why I think this ring should be more focused on studying development cycles as I voiced at the council of Prague when @cosmosys organized the ring.  However if I am the only one that feels this way, I am not looking to cause any trouble. Just reflecting on lessons learned during my brief stint in university about how important semiotics are within the context of communication. ",

How are you going to fulfill their decisions in decentralized community?   Sorry, can you elaborate on your question here, I am not sure by what you are trying to ask.     ChainSafe:  I absolutely agree, but at the end of the day it all starts with the language we use.   While I agree that on a practical note, it doesn\u2019t matter. However with Aidan\u2019s point on language, I definitely agree that language matters a lot, especially with dealing with all sorts of backgrounds, esp. with those who may not understand the role of product managers and don\u2019t understand how PMs don\u2019t really \u2018manage\u2019 people. (well product managers do and they don\u2019t in MANY ways.) But on the other hand, I personally think people need to be managed/guided and a lot of people also WANT to be managed/guided (if you have experienced great management, you know what I am talking about ~ great product leadership makes the whole team happy and productive - and most importantly WIN together as a team) We shouldn\u2019t shy away from calling it product management just because there are aversions to not wanting to feel to be \u2018managed\u2019. (In many cases, my hypothesis is that these aversions are the result of extremely poor management and sometimes complete lack of product management in some cases). But yes, happy to put this aside for the great good so we can share more of the PM love.  I think such aversions can be remedied and also part of our effort to improve the coordination of various teams in the space (which potentially starts with the conversation of \u201cSo\u2026 What is product management? What is it not?\u201d my guess is that many are not aware, PMship can be arcane at times). For those reasons, I can see both sides to why we should keep and also change the name. I lean towards keeping the name but I also agree that a different name could provide significant social advantages. Happy to keep the name but also happy to align with a new one if there is rough consensus. ",

Recent history - In Feb 2013 the Swedish pirate party shared it\u2019s \u201cswarm\u201d organisation method, there was a ted talk on this too. Some links\u2026  https://falkvinge.net/2013/02/14/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-one/  http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Swarm_Organization I hope people will find it very insightful.  A few points mentioned in the thread that I\u2019d like to further:   Naming is important Starting by clarifying PM is product management (not project management). Both are important, but starting with defining terms like: product, management, and users. Then defining what problem PMs would like to solve   Decentralised management Can come across as an oxymoron, so roles like motivator/coordination-assistant might work better. In this space I feel that managers can serve projects well with \u201cmanagement suggestions\u201d that are backed by data/experience, and then it is up to the developers to opt-in to one   Coming from several angles here (Engineer, educator, and PM) my 2c cents with points of value: leadership through doing, encouraging an open-environment with autonomy, and creating a roadmap that is backed with experience and data. Lastly, is the Telegram group intentionally hidden, or can a link be shared? ",

The reason why we use product management is because there is much more to it than just project management - it\u2019s important to make that distinction - it\u2019s not just development cycles, it\u2019s not just coordination And yes, I am intentionally not sharing the link out into the public because public join links kill telegram groups (seen too many groups go down this path + admin a few other telegram groups). Rather have it stay high quality and grow organically. ",

Then we should try to adopt this classical role to our reality without reinventing the wheel. From other side: there are bigger projects in opensource community releasing products based on work of many SODCs. For example, there are linux distributors, like Canonical with Ubuntu. Do we missing that part in our ecosystem? I would prefer to find and adopt existing experience instead of reinventing the wheel.   Would love to hear from long-established open-source projects and how they guide products, and thoughts on possible differences with web3 products. Also making the distinction between consumer products (user = layman), vs protocol \u201cproducts\u201d (user = developer). ",
