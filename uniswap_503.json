Here are some significant roles in my mind: 1. Speculator Mostly focus on short term prices moving. Only vote for the proposal that can incentive the UNI prices raise. 2.Long term investor Hold UNI for a long team personal investment. 3.HOLD Have faith on Uniswap that it will be the cornerstone of the whole DeFi world. 4.Whale Hold more than 500K UNI and look for a delegate that can represent my interests. 5.Others I haven\u2019t mentioned above.
