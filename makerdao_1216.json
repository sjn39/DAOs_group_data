The purpose of this signal request is to bring this recurring systemic issue to the attention of the MKR governance to request creation of a general funds recovery policy for the MKR token address.  Main Text Over the last 4.5 years there has been numerous transfers to the MKR token address both large and small. And as long as any wallet / exchange / 3rd party service displays this token address individuals and organizations will continue to unbeknownst to them grab the MKR token address address that is displayed and continue to send transfers, \u2018test\u2019 or otherwise. I am proposing that a general funds recovery policy be created for the MKR token address that would either prevent the acceptance of transfers to the MKR token address (without burning the tokens) or would set up a formal process for individuals / organizations to appeal to that would occur on a routine basis (once a quarter etc.) to request tokens are returned that are over a predetermined amount (to eliminate small \u2018test\u2019 transfer amounts). [Preventing the acceptance of transfer would be preferred if technologically possible due to the seamless interaction for the user.] Having a general funds recovery policy in place would have a positive impact on its users by helping keep them active within MKR and the crypto space as a whole whenever the worst happens. I believe it would be a good example for other cryptos to look to as well in order to do away with one of the known negatives of the crypto space.

The purpose of this signal request is to notify the governance authority of the transaction and request the tokens be returned to the sender.   Main Text On 2022-05-15 at 7:15:05 UTC, 3.1994 MKR were sent to MKR Governance Address 0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2 from Coinbase.

The purpose of this signal request is to notify the governance of the transaction and request new tokens be minted and returned to the sender, since the existing tokens are inaccessible.   Main Text A prior signal request was submitted on May 16th. This is a follow on signal request. The prior signal request clarified that the tokens in the MKR token address are inaccessible and therefore effectively burned. There were also\u2026      Polls    Should a general funds recovery policy be created for the MKR token address?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Signal Request will run from 2022-06-08T05:00:00Z\u21922022-06-22T05:00:00Z If signal request poll passes, then the poll will go onchain, asking MKR holders if they wish to pursue creating a general funds recovery policy for the MKR token address. If signal request poll fails then no further action will be taken. ",

A Signal Request isn\u2019t the right format for this topic because there isn\u2019t an actionable outcome for MKR holders to vote on. Please refer to the Governance Process Selector flowchart in the Maker Operational Manual. This indicates that this type of proposal should be submitted as a MIP13c3 subproposal, otherwise called a Declaration of Intent. Consequently, I am re-formatting this as an informal poll. You are welcome to continue the poll to gauge community sentiment, but it will not be eligible to proceed to an on-chain vote. If you have any questions or concerns about this decision please reach out to me or @prose11 and we can discuss it further. If you have questions about the formatting of a MIP13c3 subproposal, please reach out to one of the MIPs team (@blimpa, @gala, or @Sebix). ",

It\u2019s something I think the whole crypto industry needs to figure out and maybe when something like ENS gets more standardized and widely adopted, these types of issues will go away.
