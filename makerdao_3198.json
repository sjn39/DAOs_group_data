I guess we can all agree that driving stability fees to 20% and increasing the stability buffer to infinity is not a sustainable way, so I was trying to find a possible help on that topic for some time and I would like to bounce around this idea with all of you. In case of a sharp dip, our biggest risk is that too much DAI needs to get flipped because vault-owners don\u2019t pay enough attention and cannot deleverage quick enough. What if we could offer a safety net for those who want to stay heavily overcollateralized: We could offer a vault-type with a quite high CR (let\u2019s say 300%) but keep the LR a lot lower (for example 150%) so vault-owners would not be able to mint DAI so close to getting liquidated on the next (small) dip. I guess a lot of the risks by liquidations can be mitigated (if LR is 2x the CR, we would need a 50% dip for the vaults going underwater), those vaults can benefit from a much lower stability as well. I don\u2019t know what that would imply smart contract wise, maybe this can be handled in the flipper, maybe a new JoinAdapter? WDYT? ",

There is another way to encourage maintenance of high CRs - a rebate on SF.    Honestly could just drip back a Rebate_DAI to vaults based on their CRs relative to LR that can be periodically exchanged for DAI via a market mechanism (reverse auctions of DAI for Rebate_DAI). Really what one wants is the way to \u2018declump\u2019 risk and the only way to address this was to have multiple vaults with staggered LRs, DCs and SFs. Not simple though and something governance at the time seemed unwilling to do.  But we now have ETH-A and ETH-B and are considering ETH-C so I stand by my statement that having multiple vaults on each collateral with different parameters may be a better way to manage risk.  It also requires no change to any of the contracts simply an addition of more vaults which is easy. ",

Sure you can enforce them to put in a certain amount of collateral initially but what happens when the price goes down and the vault ends up below the CR? My guess is that overtime the CRs trend down to the LR anyway and you have the same situation as today, but that is just me hypothesizing. You could maybe start charging an \u201cundercollaterlized fee\u201d or something, but it seems like more contract work.   ",

Although, Higher C.R & Lower L.R with a difference you suggested 150% & 300% feels a little problematic as a user in the range of 150-300% won\u2019t be able to pay back some of his debt with collateral if the end ratio is going to be 150-300%.
