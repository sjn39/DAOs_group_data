                    "content": "BACKGROUND The recent forum discussion pertaining to the Proposal to Reform Maker\u2019s RWF CU has brought some interesting thoughts and debates including but not limited to:  Splitting the RWF CU into two (2) entities @PaperImperium  Framework of basic expectations by MakerDAO ( ex. standardised agreement) @christiancdpetersen  Adopt traditional banks structured frameworks across various \u201clines of defence\u201d to underwrite and manage credit risk. @luca_pro  More decentralization and creation of more RWA CU @SebVentures  MakerDAO needs to ask itself if it wants to be a defi protocol or a bank @jameskmccall 6.And any other good observations by others (please read the Post for more colour)  MOTIVATION This informal poll/discussion is based on an interesting strategy being applied currently by up and coming RWA lender Goldfinch and brought up by @prankstr25  image712\u00d7199 7.73 KB  And by @brettlyons  image780\u00d7133 11 KB  Goldfinch whitepaper states:  Proposed (Informal) that Asset Originators (AO) be Required to Stake MKR All AOs provides a leverage up to a maximum total that is calculated as the leverage ratio multiplied by the total value of MKR staked. For example, if the AO Stakes $1M worth of MKR, then MakerDAO provides a 4.0X leverage ratio. Hence, Maker allocates up to $4M total leverage.  This can be adjusted higher with creditworthiness/repayment history. The Staked MKR serves as collateral against potential defaults. When an AO defaults, the MKR staked is sent to the flapper as a surplus auction. AO Creditworthiness = rewards? To reward AOs for staking MKR, Brett Lyons ask if we reward AOs with favorable terms, such as 10 BPs? INFORMAL POLL    Should MakerDAO Require Real World Asset Originators to Stake MKR?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Upon AO Default \u2013 Staked MKR Should be Sent to the Flapper  Yes No I have a better idea\u2013see my comments below Abstain     0 voters        What is a good starting point for the AOs MKR Staked Leverage Ratio?  2x 3x 4x 5x to 10x My suggestion is written below Dumb idea this can be gamed Abstain     0 voters        Asset Originator Rewards For Establishing Excellent Creditworthiness  10bp 25bp More, see my comment below Dude this can be gamed Abstain     0 voters     Please ADD any ideas, or suggestions regarding Staking MKR.

AOs want to convert illiquid assets into cash. Your idea, with reverse temporal order, is that the AO locks some assets (e.g., a car), receives DAI, and buys & stakes MKR. Arguably, this is an illiquid asset swap. AO and Maker swapped some car for some MKR, reducing the net amount of DAI received by the AO. If the AO defaults (e.g., car is stolen) and the staked MKR is forfeit then the loss to Maker is reduced only because the amount of DAI received by the AO was less than it would have been. The fact that MKR was staked seems irrelevant. ",

In my opinion, \u201crequiring\u201d staking on the part of AOs could unfavorably affect business growth in an area where it is most needed. While some may see this as an opportunity, many could see it as another complication in a process which is already much more obtuse than the alternatives.

Economicaly is seems weird as you\u2019d be requiring AOs to back their loans with an asset that is positively correlated with the health of Maker.

For sure, and thank you for your thoughts and ideas\u2013much appreciated. I think looking at the Goldfinch, you can kind of get an idea of how they\u2019re thinking about having \u201cBorrowers\u201d stake the Goldfinch Governance Token as a signal to Liquidity Providers that the Borrower are serious, and provide the Governance Token to pay for the first \u201cAuditor\u201d approval. All-in-all interesting concept when it comes to showcasing \u201cskin in the game\u201d, by Goldfinch\u2013IMO.     swakya:  \u201cWhen an AO defaults, the MKR staked is sent to the flapper as a surplus auction.\u201d).   Ya\u2013good point Swakya\u2013as much as I would like to introduce another way of Burning MKR. it would be better to Hold the Stake MKR until the RWA Property is liquidated and Maker can recover its loan (or at least some of it). The idea of sending MKR to the flapper is based on a concept called Slashing in Proof of Stake Networks (soon on Eth 2.0). IF a Borrower defaults on a loan, the Staked MKR is then Owned by the Maker Treasury. Not sure if that makes sense. Regardless I always appreciate your input Swakya!     swakya:  Also the Goldfinch examples uses staking not as loan protection but as spam protection / operational cover. So I think the purpose of this staking should come first. Is it economic protection (seems weird to me)? Or a \u201cshow of good faith\u201d   Totally\u2013If I understood it correctly the Goldfinch Governance Token can be staked by people like you and I as well\u2013if we are adamant that the Borrower will pay back the loan\u2013we can Stake on their behalf. And yes\u2013IMO it is both an extra layer of protection and as you say, \u201cshow of good faith\u201d. The top economic protection will be the Trust set up on behalf of Maker (assuming we eventually figure-out which one works best for MakerDAO). Time will tell. Regardless I always appreciate your input Swakya! TY Ser. ",

It was a no-go:  if AO stakes insignificant amount the stake will have no effect. if AO stakes substantial amount they basically don\u2019t need the required capital their internal procedures might prevent them from holding any crypto  So while staking is a very interesting idea right now it is not workable. Or rather - it is not workable with AOs like we have now. If we could convince RW capital management companies to come to crypto it would be another matter entirely. ",

But the concept you wrote in January 2020 is different from the concept here. Here I am asking if AOs should have skin in the game by staking MKR in a Locked Contract. This concept works well for Staking Facilities who participate in a Proof of Stake consensus. It includes \u201cslashing\u201d for bad behavior and its currently being  showcased in Ethereum\u2019s Beacon chain. But you already know that  And I don\u2019t have all the right answers.

In order for Maker to attract high quality RWA borrowers, it needs to be competitive with existing lending relationships. Asking an originator to purchase and stake MKR is either going to be (a) a large enough amount to represent a monetary deal breaker; i.e. it ruins their capital efficiency (b) a conceptual hurdle with little monetary benefit to MakerDAO; i.e. it cannot get past their board/equity holders and/or scares them away from engaging while not even materially helping Maker\u2019s bottom line (c) both In my opinion the best way to ensure RWA borrowers are aligned with the DAO is to maximize transparency in a mutually productive way.
