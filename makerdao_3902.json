UPDATE:  We\u2019ve heard from Peter on Twitter, and have learned a few things:   Teams funded by the Ethereum Foundation (EF) have, in the past, lost their EF funding by accepting external funding. The Geth team is worried that by accepting funding from...      Could be interesting to check if Maker DAO is also interested in collaborating with, not only Geth, but other projects, in order to have more variety of software implementations of ethereum nodes, in case some of them get bugged. The more the merrier. Maybe we can use this thread to collect some information about what could be interesting to fund, what other projects are critical pieces for Maker and Ethereum future and how much would be a sensible amount to invest, in the case the community likes the idea. Please, take also some time to read the Uniswap thread and how it progresses. ",

The proposal should also address the fears of them being cut off the EF funding. A long-term lockup contract sounds like a good solution to this, but it might not be enough with the donation coming in the form of a volatile token, leaving the team at mercy of UNI price.\u201d I don\u2019t know much about G-Eth as I am no developer, but it would be nice to see additional financial specifications. Looking forward to following the UNI thread and thanks for bringing this to attention. ",

If we did choose to fund something like this, I\u2019d rather see it in the form of cheap financing or loan guarantees rather than outright donation, since those can be substantially cheaper to provide but also still be impactful. There\u2019s also just the matter of precedent. We have a bag of cash, but we\u2019re already straining under the weight of growing expenses. Without a dedicated revenue stream to provide for this kind of project, I don\u2019t want to see us get in the habit of large donations. ",
