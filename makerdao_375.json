Partially, the standard GemJoin adapter works if you ignore rewards. A custom gem join adapter is required to distribute LDO or CRV rewards.   Risk Summary   Does the contract implement the ERC20 token standards? Yes.  Risk analysis: HIGH.   Technical Information   Compiler version : vyper:0.2.8   Decimals : 18  Overflow checks : Yes. (Vyper comes with built-in integer overflow checks)  Mitigation against allowance race-condition : Yes. increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance functions are implemented.  Upgradeable contract patterns : No.  Access control or restriction lists : Yes. set_name access restricted to StableSwapSTETH.owner and mint, burnFrom, set_minter access restricted to StableSwapSTETH    Formal Verification Considerations:   Does transfer have simple semantics? Yes.  Does transferFrom have simple semantics? Yes.   Can balances be arbitrarily modified by some actor? No.    Are there any external calls? No.   Testnet Information N/A  Contract Logic Summary Administrative Addresses ownership_admin,future_ownership_admin:0x40907540d8a6c65c637785e8f8b742ae6b0b9968 parameter_admin,future_parameter_admin: 0x4eeb3ba4f221ca16ed4a0cc7254e2e32df948c5f emergency_admin,future_emergency_admin: 0x467947ee34af926cf1dcac093870f613c96b1e0c This is ERC20 compliant token with mint and burnFrom functions which are controlled by minter, an immutable contract, StableSwapSTETH, that has no logic to call set_minter, it can\u2019t be changed, it also has a permissionless logic to add/remove liquidity. The set_name function, to set token name and symbol can be called only by the minter.owner, which is controlled by the listed admin addresses above.  Contract Risk Summary This is a High Risk contract. The ERC20 functions are implemented to industry standard, there are built-in checks in Vyper to prevent over/underflows, and the contract is non-upgradeable. Curve Smart Contracts have been audited by Trail of Bits and Quantstamp. The Risk comes from the underlying tokens. ETH is safe, but stETH has centralized access controls. Overall the technical risk is derived from the risk of stETH.
