Please submit a Pull Request to our Awesome MakerDao resource repository with any changes and additions you\u2019ve come up with. Criteria The section should include anything that is important and useful to the MKR voter. This includes:  Important forum threads Foundation-produced resources Links to important votes that occurred etc\u2026  Feel free to play around with the subheading structure of this section. This might include:  The addition of a \u201cKey Votes\u201d section The addition of an \u201cImportant Forum Threads\u201d section etc\u2026  Tips  Contact me, @Davidutro, with any questions. I am happy to advise on whether something makes sense or not. Searching through old Governance Polls may help surface the most important resources. Process-specific information is very important (Guidelines for signaling on the forums, for example.)  Interested? If you are interested in taking on this task feel free to go ahead and submit a PR. Please feel free to ask questions in this thread, reach out to me(@Davidutro) on Rockechat in the #community-development channel.
