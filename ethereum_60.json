I want to make it very clear that I do see a non-zero value in having refundable tokens, but I don\u2019t believe the idea is general enough to be put in an EIP.  Greater Compliance with EU \u201cDistance Selling Regulations,\u201d which require a 14-day refund period for goods (such as tokens) purchased online  Presumably any token sale in the EU\u2014and not just the initial purchase\u2014needs to have the 14 day return policy?   NFT marketplaces could place a badge indicating that the NFT is still refundable on listings, and offer to refund NFTs instead of listing them on the marketplace   I fear this will cause more trouble than its worth. If the badge is automated, a malicious contract could claim to support ERC-5507, but not actually allow users to refund. If the badge is manual, only high profile (or high paying) tokens will get the verification on marketplaces.  DExes could offer to refund tokens if doing so would give a higher yield  If possible, this one seems like a point in favour of standardizing. I\u2019d like to see some comments from an exchange developer to see what their thoughts on this are.  Better wallet confirmation dialogs  I\u2019m not sure I understand this one. Would this just be a notice on the transaction signing screen that says \u201cthis token might be refundable\u201d? If so, how would a wallet decide to show it? Heuristics on mint functions?  All of that aside, I have a few more technical-ish questions:  What differentiates a refund from a collateral-backed loan with an expiry date? Are there existing standards/libraries that handle these loans we could take inspiration from? Why does this need to be an extension on the token itself, and not in a separate escrow contract? Could an attacker mint large amounts of the token, dump it on the market while the token is hot, buy it back once the token price drops and refund it?   Further:  in terms of the smallest divisible unit  Should that be \u201cindivisible\u201d unit? ",

I do think it\u2019s good to add refund policy and contact somewhere, but I don\u2019t think it can work on-chain, for various reasons:  Not everyone buys using a wallet. You can buy using credit card and expect refunds to happen to your bank account. Any company doing off-ramp will redirect you to the seller\u2019s websit if you ask them about refund policy. calling refund has a tx cost. There is nothing to stop a company to make fees to ask the refund so expensive that people will just never call it. ETH price varies way too much. It will require an oracle to do the refund (to store $/\u20ac price at buy time or to retrieve it at refund time), which again will be very expensive both in term of fees for the buyer/refund asker & the seller. People are (righlty) using more and more hot wallet to buy stuff and then send to cold wallet. This would void the policy since there is no way to know if this was a sale or not.  I would like to add: European refund policy has exceptions. Concert Tickets, digital content considered \u201copen\u201d after start of use etc\u2026 NFTs are still young, but I have little to no doubts the ones with high speculative values will enter these exceptions. Especially because NFTs do not have the same status everywhere in Europe. So for sure we need these for the future, when NFTs will be more than just jpegs, but on-chain is not sustainable. ",

There is a bigger picture to look at here for something supposed to target laws. And if as a consumer I buy with a CC, I want my refund to my CC. Each tx cost. An on-chain refund system will have a hard time to work at scale. Both because of tokens volatility and cost of tx. ",

My point was that this functionality is a subset of a more general primitive, and probably shouldn\u2019t exist on its own.     Pandapip1:      SamWilsn:   Why does this need to be an extension on the token itself, and not in a separate escrow contract?    Easier introspection by DApps, and avoiding extra gas fees through unnecessary CALLs.   On the other hand: this proposal wouldn\u2019t work for existing tokens, and would require re-implementing the same logic in every new compatible token. Since there\u2019s no shared implementation, every token would have to be vetted independently.     Pandapip1:      SamWilsn:   Could an attacker mint large amounts of the token, dump it on the market while the token is hot, buy it back once the token price drops and refund it?    Yes.

In fact, before this proposal came into being, that is, before it became impossible to refund, many projects were designing various schemes to prevent such things from happening. So in practice, we don\u2019t need to worry about the lack of mature solutions to prevent more robots. In addition, the interface is flexible. For example, it can be set to refund at a certain discount, or there can be no sales activity before the refund, etc. This proposal is  effective in protecting consumers. The problem that consumers face is project teams running away or making excessive promises, or consumers making impulsive purchases due to artificially created FOMO. ",

This is a two-way selection process, where developers can formulate different refund policies, and potential consumers or users can vote with their feet by choosing not to accept refund policies that do not protect their interests. The best refund policy is determined by the theory of free market.     5cent-AI:  This proposal is effective in protecting consumers.
