Address 0xda0fab060e6cc7b1C0AA105d29Bd50D71f036711 is an EOA (and in particular is not controlled by the governance, it seems to be connected to Maker Deployer 5, maybe it is the 6th Maker Deployer address?). This address can set a malicious value to MCD_VAT, and as a result either revert any attempt to the execution of the spell, or cause only part of the spell to get executed. It does not seem a real damage could be done beside forcing only partial execution, but idk if e.g., raising YFI-A line without raising Line will have any side effects. From my side, I have a smart contract (B.Protocol) who relies on CHAIN_LOG, and it would be nice if in the long term only the governance (ds-pause) would control it. ",

Since the on-chain changelog is a very new feature we kept control of this contract while we populated it and to manage any non-governance related contracts that are missing (I think we realized this weekend that the vote proxy is not in the changelog and should be added). The Foundation currently maintains changelog.makerdao.com and it\u2019s our goal to keep them in sync. If the community is ready to take this on exclusively we can either, (1) remove the auth using the deployer itself right now, or (2) remove the auth in an upcoming exec. Either way will have an on-chain record. ",
