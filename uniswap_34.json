In my opinion, all the answers are yes. I hope many have the same opinion. I await your comments A hug to all ",

There\u2019s a lotta ways to do this, and not just like how eth and gas work either. Compounding 2 tokens almost always works well when they\u2019re designed that way right? ",

I mean, those funds are to help build UNI, and I don\u2019t think many collecting another drop would benefit, unless the drop didn\u2019t take anything from treasury. Hence why my suggestion. I feel like UNI is going to need something huge to overcome other competing decentralized exchanges that are making waves currently and I\u2019m unsure what capability the UNI token can provide to overcome this but I do know that can be fixed with a combination effect. Funny enough, after making this idea I heard about Pancakeswaps tokens and about how cake works with syrup and LP, which is kinda like what I\u2019m getting at but I don\u2019t want UNI to straight up copy it. I think we can do better, also I don\u2019t like/trust pancake or sushi so there\u2019s that too lol ",

The 400 UNI airdrop help expand the Uniswap Brand, now you could have paid a marketing firm out of NY or LA to fake the brand into existence or reward those who would tell ten people, who would tell 1000 people, and who would tell 10000 people, I think every one is getting my point! -  I recommend you keep rewards those who come and use the UNISWAP platform, and after all, it\u2019s all fake money no different than the fiat we avoid and yet need to use!

Although many of those who received UNI, moved their funds towards the competition, many of us believe in the project and take it as our own. In my opinion this airdrops was a success. It has managed to retain the users who initially bet on this project and that is very positive. From here, I think it should be handled like any publicly traded company that distributes part of its profits to investors. In this case, the investors are those users / clients who have promoted the project from its inception. This does not imply leaving aside the new users of the application, on the contrary, it should favor the adoption and purchase of our token and its use on our platform. I believe that this distribution of benefits must be carried out on our platform and those that make it grow. ",
