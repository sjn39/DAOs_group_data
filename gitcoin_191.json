                    "content": "Part of the assumption of selfishness (or pairwise selfishness in later works) in Buterin, Hitzig, Weyl (2018) is that a project which receives many donations is one which benefits many people: \u201cIndividuals make public goods contributions to projects of value to them.\u201d GoFundMe\u2019s discover page shows more or less the opposite effect. These fundraisers all have many donations from a very diverse audience, and hence would dominate the QF subsidy, but they pretty much all exclusively benefit one person/family. It\u2019s wonderful that these people are getting help, and I would never suggest changing that, but it\u2019s undeniably quite different from the picture of the constituency presented in BHW2018. Is there anything to be learned from this (Gitcoin Grants hasn\u2019t reached this point yet, but it could happen in the future)? Maybe some ideas, not fully fleshed out:  de-emphasize the \u201cdonation\u201d aspect of QF and play up the \u201cvoting\u201d and \u201cgovernance aspects\u201d clearly explain that the \u201cmatch\u201d (maybe \u201cmatch\u201d doesn\u2019t evoke the right images, see previous point - is something along the lines of \u201cre-allocation\u201d more appropriate?) that the project you\u2019re donating to is getting comes out of the match that other projects would get pol.is at the top level of the round, and discussion sections on each project\u2019s page, to orient people into a decision-making mindset in a similar vein to above, decentralized curation (search algos, feed algos, recommendations, etc all transparent and community-built)  Thoughts?
