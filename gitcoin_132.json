                    "content": " MVP Comp Proposal This proposal aims to solve many issues that stem from haywire compensation in GitcoinDAO, and be an interim state until we have a solid comp framework around the end of S14. TL;DR Community ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, we\u2019ll use the same comp logic for all core contributor offers (incl using US market rates for any contributor), and all GTC pay will be denominated in stables.  1. Transparency What: We state that our default is salary transparency. Each Workstream will arrive at internal transparency by S15. No [name=salary] connections will be externally published outright but we recognize at minimum that salaries are discoverable by DAO contributors. Why: It narrows the wage gap between identity groups & increases worker solidarity. It is the DAO way & is required by stewards. Stating we have salary transparency matches the reality of crypto pay which is that salaries can be found out by researching docs & block explorers.  2. Global Salary Benchmark What: We will use the US market rates as a starting point for salary suggestions. We\u2019ll use the 50th percentile based on data from OpenComp, and add a 30% increase from that 50th percentile rate. Why: Market data provided is base comp, not including healthcare, 401k matching, vesting or equity that is typical outside web3. We have assessed the value of Gitcoin Holdings\u2019 benefits as well as other web2 companies and it\u2019s clear that 30% is a minimum add on to be competitive with web2 jobs. Using this framework also increases equity between workstreams as well as between Holdings & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that Holdings folks may have.  3. Saf & Loie are the Compensation Committee What: This process is followed to arrive at any salary offers for core contributors (20+ hr/wk)  An initial rate is suggested (by contributor, the person hiring them, or CC) If not suggested by CC, the rate is submitted as a request for approval from CC A CC member will claim the request, research & confer with committee members, and return a suggested offer within 2 biz days.  Why: Salary offers that were determined using one cohesive process are more fair. Without a legitimate process for arriving at salary offers, salary transparency could wreak havoc culturally in our teams. Salary has been yolo\u2019d across the DAO. We don\u2019t currently have a compensation machine that can be driven by just anybody. (More to say later, but this includes: our own competency leveling framework & better data on dao-space market rates) As we develop that self-driving machine over the course of S14, it makes the most sense for experienced People Operations folks with a view across the whole DAO to be giving these recommendations.  4. Denomination in stables What: All core contributor pay should be denominated in DAI, as in: You are paid 5000 DAI/month. On payday*, 1GTC=5DAI, so you are paid 1000 GTC *or the 20 or 30 day moving average your WS uses Why: We will lose out on essential contributors if we cannot provide pay that is at least equal at the moment of payout to what was promised in pay negotiations. This relates heavily to DEI in the workplace: societally marginalized folks (who we KNOW are necessary team mates to accomplish our mission) are far more likely to need stable income.  Where is this going in the future? This is an MVP - let\u2019s think of it as a minimum viable policy. These are actions we can take now. By the start of S15 we intend to have a Gitcoin-specific competency leveling framework and better market data on crypto industry salary levels, which will enable others outside the Compensation Committee to draft salary offers that are cohesive with the rest of the DAO. (This is something the People Ops team can deliver) We intend also to have a treasury strategy that allows for more creative comp arrangements including percentages paid out in stables, incentives for GTC pay, etc. (This will require a big lift from Treasury Management) We intend also to have a clearer framework for sharing salary data openly - either pay bands or something even more transparent. (This will require the participation of workstreams to arrive at defensible comp for all their contributors) With a competency leveling framework & pay bands it will be clear to contributors how to level up & what skills Gitcoin values folks improving on the most.  How to approach this proposal What we\u2019re asking for in this proposal is for folks to get on board this voyage to compensation legitimacy. We have mapped out the territory. Most of it is People Ops work but there are pieces (named above) that will only succeed with the dedication of others in the DAO. As you read this proposal you may ask yourself \u201cWhat would need to be true in my domain to reach these 4 states?\u201d Saying yes to this proposal is saying yes to taking whatever actions are in your domain to achieve what needs to be true.

                    "content": "Hey Loie, Great to see this written out here, and thank you for all the time you\u2019ve already invested in this. Some thoughts that pop up while reading. This document contains some solid arguments on why we need to be more consistent on how we pay DAO contributors. However, I don\u2019t think this needs to be a proposal of any kind at this point, but I think it\u2019s a great start for a framework and it will help establish the people ops team in DAO Ops as the team to consult for any hire. DAO Ops is the workstream that services the rest of the DAO in its operational needs and I hope everyone will come to you & saf for support and advice. So to me this is not a proposal, this is just part of your mandate and domain. Workstreams should follow the advice process when it comes to the topic of compensation, but we can and should not impose any guidance imo. As a reminder for anyone reading this, this is how the advice process works:   It comes in many forms, but the essence is consistent: any person can make any decision after seeking advice from 1) everyone who will be meaningfully affected, and 2) people with expertise in the matter. Advice received must be taken into consideration. The point is not to create a watered-down compromise that accommodates everybody\u2019s wishes. It is about accessing collective wisdom in pursuit of a sound decision. With all the advice and perspectives the decision maker has received, they choose what they believe to be the best course of action. Advice is simply advice. No colleague, whatever their importance, can tell a decision-maker what to decide.   I think people will happily seek out your advice but not trying to pass a policy or guidance as a proposal will avoid any unnecessary friction or extra overhead, as this guidance will evolve anyway. Some thoughts on the 4 points:  Transparency, all for it. I think we\u2019re already moving this in this direction and hopefully People Ops can discuss with workstreams to already get to this point by the end of this season. In half of the workstreams this info is readily available, in the other half it is not.      loietaylor:  Without a legitimate process for arriving at salary offers, salary transparency could wreak havoc culturally in our teams. Salary has been yolo\u2019d across the DAO.   I strongly agree with this and tbh I think this is already very much the case. Most salaries are transparent already within the DAO, so I think it\u2019s good to have clearer guidance and a strong advice process. However the big issue at hand is with this proposal not tackled, how do we deal with the current compensation, for existing contributors, as this is already causing tensions?  I shared some of my thoughts on this here and would love to continue this discussion. The idea of bands of payments makes total sense to me, but it seems more pressing to give some clear guidance here, especially in the context of the bear market, as we probably also won\u2019t hire that many people in the near future. We have to however deal now with the internal tensions because of salary inequalities and the existing (partlal) opaqueness of the salaries & logic.   Global salary benchmark: this makes sense to me, but I see this as an advice process, so I appreciate that there are some benchmarks available.   Compensation committee: yes!   Denomination in stables: hell yes. I think except for FDD all workstreams do this. I hope a conversation can be started with FDD to move to this simpler model, until we have some more DAO-wide guidance in place. This reduces complexity in accounting, which also means less overhead for FDD (so more focus) and more transparency across the board. (@DisruptionJoe)   So tl;dr - loving all of this, hope this can be the start of a living document in the people ops hub and that all workstreams will seek out the help of this committee for future hires. Looking forward to more input on current compensation across the DAO. ",

To me, this is a crucial step towards developing procedural fairness in whatever a future cohesive DAO-wide compensation policy could look like. In addition to the reasons you\u2019ve listed, I think these are both also very important for building trust among contributors and better coordination. Studies show that greater pay transparency makes it more comfortable for people to ask for help from their co-contributors. A next step once these core principles have been established could be developing and agreeing on what the guiding principles would be for a more fleshed-out framework with greater flexibility, optionality, and leveling up strategies for contributors.

                    "content": "Thank you so much Loie for surfacing this idea. Comp is an extremely important and complicated topic across DAOs, and I\u2019m very grateful to see all your thoughtfulness surrounding compensation within People Ops and GitcoinDAO. The amount of research and care you and Saf have put into this proposal is beyond clear, and I feel extremely fortunate to work alongside you both. Since this is my first gov post, I\u2019ll give a quick intro. My name is Maxwell and I joined PGF full-time last month as a Talent Lead to help with hiring, onboarding, and contributor experience. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about comp since I came onboard, and I\u2019m both supportive and cautious about this proposal. My support comes from the fact that it is an extremely important problem, and one that needs immediate attention. I\u2019m also supportive because I very much trust you and Saf and your respective expertise in this area. As you write,     loietaylor:  Community ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy.   I couldn\u2019t agree more, and this is the North Star in my mind for thinking through how we might create more effective and equitable compensation policies. My caution is that this process might create a bottleneck, whereby you, Saf and Loie, need to approve all hires from other workstreams. This bottleneck could create unnecessary friction, and impede on workstream agency. That being said, I do appreciate this framing as a S14 policy, with the goal of having a framework by S15 that would allow workstreams to \u2018regain control\u2019 in setting compensation. I very much appreciate Kris\u2019s framing here as well.     krrisis:  This document contains some solid arguments on why we need to be more consistency on how we pay DAO contributors. However, I don\u2019t think this needs to be a proposal of any kind at this point, but I think it\u2019s a great start for a framework and it will help establish the people ops team in DAO Ops as the team to consult for any hire.   I agree that these solid arguments may be better implemented as a framework that offers evidence-based advice, rather than a policy or mandate. My other caution with this sort of policy is that it\u2019s essentially a top-down decision made by People Ops. I do, however, appreciate that this is well-within the domain of authority of People Ops. An alternative I might propose is that a compensation commitment be the result of all the \u2018hiring\u2019 folks from DAO Ops, MC, PGF, MMM, and FDD coming together to form a collective framework in a \u2018bottom up\u2019 way, based on their unique and contextual experience. I worry that any policy or proposal around compensation or contributor experience that doesn\u2019t take into account the unique context of each workstream will struggle to receive mass-adoption across all the workstreams in GitcoinDAO. I\u2019m curious about the ways in which this proposal has been co-designed with other workstreams, or alternatively how this proposal could be collectively revised by the relevant folks in each workstream? I also wonder how we might think of comp variability across GitcoinDAO as a feature, not a bug. There may be legitimate and valuable reasons why compensation has historically been variable between workstreams. I\u2019d love to hear anyone\u2019s thoughts or pushback here. Ultimately, I think we, as GitcoinDAO, need to do a better job making sure all of our contributors feel taken care of. I\u2019m immensely supportive of any initiative in this direction. Thank you, again, Loie and Saf, for your hard work here! ",

I think we now have more than enough people on the team to get things signed quickly and adapt numbers if a payment gets stuck. It increases transparency and we don\u2019t need insurance models or moving averages. We just pay everyone in the same way and stewards understand budgets and payments better because we reduce complexity within workstreams to a maximum. ",

Spot price really only works if you can pay out day of. (please correct me if i\u2019m wrong here but i feel like this hasn\u2019t been addressed and is a crucial definition) ",

A few things to clear up:     Maxwell:  My caution is that this process might create a bottleneck, whereby you, Saf and Loie, need to approve all hires from other workstreams. This bottleneck could create unnecessary friction, and impede on workstream agency.   This is a fair point, and I want to make clear that the intention isn\u2019t for Loie and I to work in a silo and provide mandates other workstreams need to follow. I think this could have been clearer in the original post but for this initial framework, the suggestion is that we will work with the Workstream Lead/Talent Coordinator who is doing the hiring for the role - not \u201capproving hires\u201d but offering a service as People Ops \u201cexperts\u201d and providing a suggested comp that may or may not be taken up. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for all workstreams to be part of the comp determination process for another workstream\u2019s hire, but we do intend on sharing the process and suggested comp details for all workstreams\u2019 benefit.

Yes, a more fleshed-out compensation framework that each WS can fork and adjust for their own needs will be built together with the Talent Coordinators/Leads of each WS. Again, this is a Minimum Viable Product proposal to align on values and offer an interim solution that at least has some coherent logic, which we think is an important step on our way from yolo\u2019ing all comp within the DAO to having a more robust framework that we can point to when making future compensation decisions.

                    "content": "Kris, thank you for the wonderfully thoughtful comment! i\u2019ll address a couple points:     krrisis:  DAO Ops is the workstream that services the rest of the DAO in its operational needs and I hope everyone will come to you & saf for support and advice. So to me this is not a proposal, this is just part of your mandate and domain. Workstreams should follow the advice process when it comes to the topic of compensation   I super agree with this ideal state you describe. Unfortunately this is not at all the case. Despite talking with workstream leads for months about having more logical comp, and People Ops holding the domain of compensation the whole time, any attempts at guidance around comp have been left behind and workstreams have not been seeking advice. Now, we have ALL had a lot on our plates and a lot of this is due to just trying to move as quickly as possible on what is most essential. (myself included! i know I even have an unsent comment open on @seanmac\u2019s proposal on MMM contributor levels ) However I don\u2019t think that simply making suggestions will result in there being legitimate compensation across the DAO. Evidence: I made a DAO Hiring Process Guide (including a section on making a salary offer) back in November and circulated it a few times, and afaik no workstreams used it.  the big issue at hand is with this proposal not tackled, how do we deal with the current compensation, for existing contributors, as this is already causing tensions?  Indeed this is a big issue - and I propose that we create a skills/competency leveling matrix that is custom to gitcoin. Such matrixes usually look something like this:  Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 5.37.52 PM2192\u00d71076 355 KB  Ours however would be customized to our own DAO and might include such verticals as: self-management, ecosystem expertise, and MAYBE even proximity to our essential intent. But in the vein of trying to make sure our work is efficient & useful, it\u2019s important to get workstreams on board with actually using this stuff. A custom competency matrix like this would allow:  anyone to score a new job candidate into a salary band, independently folks to evaluate salary levels in a fair way if we DO need to go into a period of leveling inequal/unjustifiable pay  contributors to self-assess what skills are the most important to gitcoin, therefor seeing what they should improve upon to become more valuable to (and valued by) the organization. great for using professional development resources in a smart way.  It\u2019s hard to know though whether we should embark on this work when workstreams are still arguing against having a shared comp logic. I really don\u2019t want this to become a piece of work that People Ops produces and doesn\u2019t end up getting used by workstreams. People Ops is in an interesting position. MMM can produce content, run events, etc. GPC and Moonshot can code & release changes to our products. DAO Ops tooling can make changes to our discord structure. FDD can change our grants eligibility enforcement. But when People Ops produces work, folks across the DAO have to agree to use it, otherwise it just sits & gathers dust while the people problems tend to persist. I\u2019m not complaining (i love people operations work & this interdependency has always been an inherent truth of it in every flat org I\u2019ve been in ), but I am trying to draw attention to how and why it\u2019s crucial to get agreement on these things.

We tried to do it this way various times over the course of January-April. But nobody sunk their teeth in. I\u2019m trying to get to a realistic deliverable, and so far a taskforce approach has failed. We\u2019ve also collected a ton of signaling so far already - surveyed folks on comp in the DAO and done a lot of advice process by listening to how workstreams feel. I don\u2019t think we are 100% there with the participatory nature of it but I\u2019m trying to prioritize delivering something. If like you suggest, the talent coordinators from each workstream wanted to commit 5 hours/week to this for the next 6 weeks, I think we could do it. (More cooks in the kitchen takes longer). I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the best use of everybody\u2019s time since folks will want to customize a bit anyways, but if ppl felt really strongly this is the way to do it, and 110% committed to that time investment, I\u2019d be down to try!  I also wonder how we might think of comp variability across GitcoinDAO as a feature, not a bug. There may be legitimate and valuable reasons why compensation has historically been variable between workstreams.  There\u2019s a lot of merit to this! I think if we do land on it being okay for some workstreams to pay way better than others, it will likely be related to those experimental verticals (proximity to essential intent) I mentioned above when talking about the competency leveling matrix. The way we determine those: interviews with workstream leads/hiring ppl asking why a certain contributor was paid more than another. We are already starting these conversations & they\u2019ll be very important over the next 6 weeks. In some of those decisions we will find our legitimate logic for why one role is more valuable than another, and we can then put that into a competency leveling framework. ",

Starting only with the knowledge of my own address that I receive my pay at, I was able to find out the salary amounts of several contributors in multiple workstreams. One workstream in particular that statedly DOES NOT have salary transparency, I was able to find out the exact salary attached to names of 15 of their contributors. Including the highest paid ones. Including the 6 that did not have a direct ENS name. I\u2019m no block explorer genius, and this was not my own workstream. I wasn\u2019t signed into Notion, or looking at google docs, nothing just etherscan. The fact is that we already have salary transparency. We are just not facing it.

General Thoughts  Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 8.17.46 PM1738\u00d7748 95.5 KB  Generally i think a comp policy could aim for :  More performance for network More sovereignty for workstreams (or people) More entitlements for people (note I make no judgement about entitlements being legitimate or not here, there are many moral and competitive reasons to have various entitlements for people.  There are many entitlements (healthcare, benefits, live-able and competitive wages to start) that I personally think are extremely legitimate.   A good proposal should transcend and include these 3 criteria.  I think a balance of these things could be achieved (this is the green dot in the diagram above) and is the target for me personally.   Major Items My major worries with this policy:  This proposal doesn\u2019t tie contributor comp to dao success.  Where is the shared sacrifice in a bad market and shared success in a good one?   Missing the financial analysis to know how much comp the DAO can support.  The policy is doing a massive disservice to the DAO if it commits to entitlements beyond what the economic model of the DAO can support.   A perfectly level + fair compensation policy that will only lasts 3 months does no good for anyone. I know the DAO has not hired its finance lead yet, but it does have llamas already - who posts a monthly financial report and solicits feedback about what people need on it.  A very basic analysis could be done just using S14 numbers. The market is hemorrhaging value right now, and given how much the DAOs success is tied to the crypto markets, I think survival of the DAO should be everyone\u2019s top priority right now.  So this is a big showstopper for the DAO ratifying the proposal IMO.      Minor Items Less major (but not insignificant) worries:  Is it very above market to do us base + 30%  base should be comparable should be seed stage startups not mature web2 companies. (I\u2019m not convinced it is right to tie all global compensation to US salaries).   Missing parts to the comp policy.  This proposal offers no consideration for grandfathered in ppl. no consideration for project work. no consideration for sovereignty of workstreams.  I worry that having a centralized compensation committee approving rates violates the sovereignty of the workstreams to hire who they want, how they want.  I share Maxwells concern here. If the past hiring guides have not been useful for DAO workstream leads, I think that is an opportunity to figure out how People Ops can solve the problems that are in demand from workstream leads - making policies mandatory is not the solution.   I have seen a major demand for accountability in each of the surveys we\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m concerned that our comp policy does not seem to speak to accountability at all.   On salary transparency:  I am not strongly pro or against salary transparency, but I also haven\u2019t seen any demand for salary transparency being voiced organically - which makes me think it\u2019s not much of a priority.  It\u2019s not been on the top 3 list of concerns from in the surveys about people problems to fix that I\u2019ve seen (though Kyle did ask for a compensation policy in his answer to the latest \u201cPeople Success - Problems\u201d doc).   IMO There should be a broad consensus about salary transparency or individuals should be given an opportunity to consent to disclose salaries should be given before doxing anyone\u2019s salaries.   Stating that there is already an implicit policy of salary transparency just because people are careless about not doxing their addresses (or not using ZK tools to achieve privacy) is not a good argument for salary transparency IMO.     Thanks for allowing me to list out these constructive criticisms.  I will support whatever the DAO decides to ratify here! ",

Global Salary Benchmark I strongly disagree with the proposed policy. US Base + 30% ? This doesn\u2019t make any sense in general IMO\u2026 If you are hiring a strategic expert solidity dev, you might need to pay a lot more than US base + 30%, or if you are hiring an admin from the Philippines there is no reason to triple their expected salary. For an Impact DAO going into a bear market, especially given the current state of GTC, we should consider trying to reduce our number one expense, salaries. What are we doing to create the demand that will balance out this issuance? I am going to rally hard against large workstream proposals next round. We have to get scrapier, and start hiring talent that live in less expensive countries. We are a global impact DAO with the opportunity to hire people from all over the world that are ideologically motivated. We should allow workstream leaders to minimize their budget and handycapping them to US wages + 30% is unnecessary.  Saf & Loie are the Compensation Committee I love this as a concept, but I generally like what @krrisis brought up with it being more advice than control. The workstream lead has a budget and goals, they should have the agency to make the necessary budget decisions to satisfy their requirements.  Denomination in stables Definitely, whole heartedly agree, GTC is a horrible unit of account. I would denominate pay in Stables and use the GTC exchange rate at the time of transfer (not moving average).  General Thoughts I love @owocki\u2019s triangle above, and added my own placements:  Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 4.54.05 PM1920\u00d7817 47 KB  The big thing missing here is Vesting in GTC\u2026There should be some vested interest in the DAO\u2019s success. People being paid a salary should also get some future GTC to align their personal best interests with the GitcoinDAO\u2019s best interest. Maybe the lower the salary, the more GTC they get, but it is locked for ~3 years (when we will hopefully be for sure into the next market cycle). I think this policy is trying to over prescribe payments for the good of the individuals working in GitcoinDAO but at the expense of (or in complete ignorance of) the actual GitcoinDAO reality. We need to fund projects that will bring economic stability to the economy and make reasonable budget cuts until we can do that. Spending millions of GTC when there is so little demand and liquidity for the token is irresponsible. Let\u2019s approve high level budgets for work streams, and support work stream leads in salary negotiations, but let\u2019s consider also what is in our means and not tank the value of GTC by overspending it. Major Companies are cutting their costs by 20%, sadly we should follow suit\u2026 we don\u2019t have nearly the same income streams that they do, and grew too fast beyond our means. Our budgets are not balanced, we cannot lock ourselves into US base + 30%.    CNBC \u2013 2 Jun 22    Winklevoss twins' Gemini cutting 10% of its staff, saying 'crypto winter' is...

                    "content": "Thanks for the thoughtful responses @owocki and @griff! A couple personal takeaways from the conversation so far:  We may have brought this discussion to the wider community too early or framed it incorrectly; as I\u2019ve repeated, this was by no means meant to be a  long-term or even medium-term policy - just an interim solution to align on before a more thorough framework that takes into account many of the concerns that have been raised. Currently, there isn\u2019t any coherent process for determining comp in any workstream that I\u2019ve come across. We figured that this could serve as a prerequisite MVP before launching into wider comp discussion, but looks like we\u2019ve opened up that Pandora\u2019s box anyways, and there isn\u2019t much appetite for anything less than a complete and long-term solution to this problem. The compensation conversation is clearly top of mind for many in the DAO, and there is a need for People Ops to develop such a solution ASAP with the respective workstreams\u2019 Talent Coordinators (People Ops representatives for each WS).  The Challenge The comp conversation is simultaneously urgent and also one that keeps getting skirted around. My theory is that many contributors are getting paid generous bull market salaries and want to delay the effects of the uncomfortable bear market reality we find ourselves in for as long as possible. It\u2019s a scary time to be in the most precarious of industries, so I don\u2019t blame them. To make a comp restructuring as painless as possible, transparency will be a requirement imo, not an option, as will a consistent and coherent logic to who gets paid what. What we don\u2019t want is a web2 scenario of contributors getting laid off/receiving pay cuts while people at the top of the food chain remain immune - some form of transparency will be required to ensure that this doesn\u2019t happen.     owocki:  has any research been done on other DAOs in comparable vertical\u2019s (DAOs, ImpactDAOs, any other way to slice it) compensation policies? that might be useful to ground this discussion in what\u2019s working elsewhere.   Yes, I\u2019ve compiled my research here. This will be used to develop a wider compensation model for the DAO. On US-Based Compensation For me, the reason we use the US as a benchmark for salaries is because:  This is where most of our existing contributors are. This is where our largest market is, where most grants originate, and where we raise funds. This is where regen-crypto/value-aligned contributors mostly originate, due to the US and western ideals-based marketing approach of the space.  The logic from \u201cUS+30%\u201d comes from the fact that at almost any other tech company in the US, you would receive several benefits (health insurace/bonuses/401k matching/etc) on top of your salary that are generally worth approx. 25% of salary. The other 5% is \u201cDAO hazard pay\u201d which is meant to cover the increased risk/costs associated with DAO work. While I generally agree that there may be a need to reevaluate this approach and realign everyone\u2019s salaries with a more reasonable benchmark, and that this could lead to some cost savings, I disagree that salaries should be location-based. The power dynamics created by hiring future workers from low cost-of-living regions and paying them significantly less would be pretty alarming imo, on top of the already existing global power structures that disadvantage those populations to begin with. Not a recipe for a healthy workplace, and not very regen. Looking forward to continuing this conversation with the community and working on a Gitcoin DAO comp structures that feels fair, sustainable, and transparent. ",

Where does the DAO get income? What is creating demand for GTC? Is giving someone 2000 GTC some how, at least indirectly creating 2000 GTC worth of demand to balance out the cost? I don\u2019t think GitcoinDAO is in a stable place where we can take the agency away from work stream leads to make the tough decisions they are going to need to in the upcoming year.

                    "content": "These 2 concerns from Owocki and Griff are in the same vein.  Missing the financial analysis to know how much comp the DAO can support.   What are we doing to create the demand that will balance out this issuance?  And it is exactly right that this policy guidance doesn\u2019t include this! This policy asks for folks to look at it and decide what would need to be true to follow this guidance, and the forum discussion is doing a great job of serving this purpose. So, we know that financial strategy is an important foundation for a comp policy to stand on. Financial strategy is not within the domain of People Ops. It is within the domain of DAO Ops however, and folks like @kyle and @ChrisDean have been working on securing financial sustainability thru partnerships while other ppl are working on token utility. I would really like to hear these folks chime in here on what they are doing to reach financial stability upon which a compensation policy could stand. I\u2019m glad this conversation has shone a light on this need, because as soon as we have financial stability we really need to have the equitable pay systems in place so we can continue to make hiring decisions in a way that\u2019s sustainable, and makes contributors want to stick around. In the meantime I think we can absolutely shoot towards fair & sustainable comp standards, in fact, agreeing on those will help us use the financial resources properly.  we should perhaps consider going back to aligning on what GOALS the comp model should have. what are the MAJOR design criteria  We mapped out this design criteria over the course of several conversations in the winter. A good outline of the criteria can be found here in the notes from our Compensation Round Table The main criteria in question were:  transparency pay equality btwn workstreams pay equality btwn holdings & the DAO type of experience/competency that calls for higher salary location based pay tokens, vesting, and \u201ctotal comp\u201d packages  You can see more criteria as well as ppl\u2019s sentiment towards them in the notes. (The notes aren\u2019t amazingly thorough but give you a taste for the conversation) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely accurate to say \u201cthis comp model convo skipped the process of aligning on goals for the comp policy.\u201d The biggest thing that has changed between then and now is that the market has tanked. So it\u2019s good that we are identifying financial strategy as another important criteria! But the other goals for comp policy were very much arrived at together with DAO members. ",

Europe says hi. This is where ethereum was actually built, with people being paid normal European salaries. The world is really not centered around the US and the salaries of a global DAO should reflect that. I think this matter is quite more contentious than people think and we really should first align on the goals for the compensation model. I will bring it up on the steward council call today. ",

                    "content": "    safder:  Hm I\u2019m not sure I understand what you\u2019re suggesting. We\u2019re not going from a place of \u201cno salary/contributors are working for free\u201d to \u201cUS rates\u201d. We already have US-based contributors making US rates. The goal with the comp framework is to ensure existing pay structures in the DAO (there currently are none) make sense, for existing DAO contributors before any future ones.   I\u2019ll be clearer, I think we are over paying people across the board, and we need to completely shift gears and start to do more global hiring with smaller salary expectations, and the proposed policy goes against that strategy. Giveth, TEC & Commons Stack are very aligned with Gitcoin\u2019s mission, but have a lot less money so we hire a lot of people in Brazil, Pakistan, Philippines, etc etc to achieve our goals. They are very competent and our \u201cbelow minimum wage\u201d pay is competitive, especially when you consider the learning opportunities. I hired one person off upwork and for less than $13/hr and now they are a leader in the organization. They have received many raises but still do not make US+30%.     safder:  Workstreams are already spending much more than this with minimal slippage. Not sure where you\u2019re getting your data, but as demonstrated here , workstreams making these payments has no measurable effect on GTC spot price.   You\u2019re right, Gitcoin Price in USD: GTC Live Price Chart & News | CoinGecko there is a lot more liquidity in centralized exchanges. I was looking at uniswap and cowswap (added screenshots), but there is a lot more liquidity on centralized exchanges\u2026 I forget those exist sometimes (I avoid them) and was living off my own experience of the lack of liquidity GTC has in dex\u2019s. This does help a lot! Liquidity isn\u2019t a problem right now (well done!). That said, Supply and Demand are a thing, and I still don\u2019t think that a policy to standardize pay at high levels for everyone in the DAO makes sense when we are entering a downturn and are not generating demand for GTC in any way I can see.     safder:  I feel like what you\u2019re suggesting here is a state of chaos/free-for-all, and bear market or not, nothing useful is going to get built that way - not to mention the fact that this won\u2019t actually change anything about our current burn rate. As a DAO Ops contributor, I\u2019m going to continue championing clarity and consistency in how we operate.   No, I am not suggesting chaos. We need order but not from granular salary impositions. We need to have a budget recommendation for S15\u2026 like we will not spend more than 1 Million dollars\" and then, yes, we should let entrepreneurial leads have the freedom to be scrappy to make their work stream fit within that budget. We had the first round of denials for work streams in S14, and in S15, I think/hope every work stream will adjust to the new reality. The suggestion of US pay + 30% is a step in the wrong direction in this resource scarce environment. Their budgets should be reduced and to live within that, US + 30% rate may not make sense for a lot of work streams if they want to fit within a budget. ",

However, this does not mean things have not been moving forward. @safder and @Jodi_GitcoinDAO have been working on a comp leveling matrix, of which a version has been implemented by MMM, FDD and finishing up later this season with DAO Ops. Compensation is a tough conversation, so we have taken all the great insights shared here and are now testing out what works within the reality of our DAO context. We will definitely report back, ao. in our S16 budget request, which will include learnings of the past season.     nett:  Some payroll management tools that might be helpful are Coinshift \u2013 they recently integrated with Superfluid, so Stewards can fully automate payroll via real-time salary streams.   We\u2019ve definitely thought about this, and are using Utopia Labs at the moment to do payroll. Haven\u2019t personally looked into coinshift but definitely will. Thanks for commenting & sharing!
