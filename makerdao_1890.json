Immunefi keeps tweaking the security settings and causing things to break. Immunefi Security CU plans to move the DNS to point at their own independent Google Workspace instance so as not to be at the mercy of the zealous Immunefi sysadmins.  CC: @TravinImmunefi ",

Immunefi Security CU plans to move the DNS to point at their own independent Google Workspace instance so as not to be at the mercy of the zealous Immunefi sysadmins.    To clarify here, these security tweaks are meant to enhance security. However, there are some nuances that causes issues within is.makerdao.network to break (i.e become inaccessible), so there have been some issues every now and then. Though there is good effort from the relevant Immunefi department to remedy the issue, it is best to prevent further issues. ",
