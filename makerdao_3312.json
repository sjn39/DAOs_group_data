Status: Formal Submission Date Applied: 2021-02-24 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Specification  Motivation As the Growth Core Unit, our focus is to bring more distribution channels to the Maker Protocol. In that sense, we will need a quarterly budget for paying for: salaries, incentives for the Growth team, and any initiative that we plan with our partners to foster Dai demand and absorb the capacity generated by the organic growth of the protocol. At the moment, there are 2B Dai in the market, and we are expecting 300M Dai at the end of this year from RWA. From those 2B Dai, more than 50% are inside DeFi protocols, and we think that if the market keeps its bullish sentiment, we can expect this behavior could continue. If not, we have to find other distribution channels for the Dai in the market.  Core Unit Name Growth  Quarterly Focus - May, June, July 2021 LatAm For LatAm, due to the financial crisis in different countries of the region, we want to propose Dai as a savings currency. During this quarter, we will focus our efforts on Colombia. Colombia\u2019s crypto sandbox will allow us to work with different financial players in the country, creating new services powered by Dai: credit cards, loans, point of sales in various merchants. We also will be focused on expanding the merchants\u2019 network to accept Dai to prepare Colombia for Devcon. This is an ongoing effort with the Ethereum Foundation. Asia Financial companies are starting to accept crypto into their systems, which gives us the signal to start conversations with them, pushing Dai into the traditional world. In this region, we continuously see the development and growth of different DeFi projects and other Blockchains to position Dai. Africa In this region, we will focus on developing infrastructure, finding foundational integrations that help us make Dai available in that market. Nigeria has increased the usage of crypto because of the difficulty they have with their local currency. It\u2019s a similar case of what we experienced in Argentina and Venezuela. Our goal here is to replicate the strategy we implemented in LatAm and grow Dai demand in Nigeria. Europe We will maintain the work we are doing with different DeFi protocols, CeFi solutions, and other blockchains. We also want to propose Dai as the currency for donations in the NGOs, and we are working on a model that any NGO could adopt and start managing their treasury with a multisig with the only decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin: Dai. North America We want to focus our efforts on getting more RWA collateral types and also maintain the work we are doing with different DeFi protocols, CeFi solutions, other blockchains, and the NFT space.  Team Members The Growth Core Unit will consist of the following members in the May/June/July budget period.         Quarterly Budget  Team remuneration The Business Development contributors should feel persuaded toward behaviors that will support the Maker Protocol strategy. That\u2019s why besides a base pay, each one of our BD persons will be under a compensation structure, a proactive process that forms goals around the account planning process, and accounts for past performance/growth. The compensation structure follows these rules:   Two-quarters of goal achievement constitutes a 10% raise in base pay.   Not meeting goals results in base pay stagnation.   Less than 50% of goal number achieved results in 0 bonus for the quarter.   Bonus pay is determined as a percentage of base pay and is relative to the goal number\u2019s achievement.   Bonus is capped at 100% of base pay.   Budget for Integrations. When we are working with a future partner, part of our job is to create a way to help that partner give more visibility to the new solution supported by the Maker Protocol. Sometimes the execution of that idea requires a budget for different purposes:   Educational purposes: When a partner wants to explain to their user/customer base about the new product, usually this is for creating content in a particular language oriented to a defined audience.   Marketing purposes: Budget for the execution of a marketing campaign to help our partner expose the usage of the new solution.   Technical purposes: Some partners who are not part of the crypto ecosystem need specialized help to integrate the Maker protocol with their systems.   Operations. Once we start our core unit, we have to think about:   Enabling support systems, such as business productivity and collaboration tools and a CRM   Hiring a legal advisor to create an LLC   Admin expenses   Travels   Opportunities. This line of the budget is in case of any contingency or opportunity that could appear, like a tier one partner looking to execute a strategic action. Budget Breakdown.

Bitcoin has been creeping into both transactions and \u2014 after yesterday\u2019s announcement \u2014 paying rent. DAI would appear really well-placed to move into this market as people don\u2019t want to part with their BTC but may want to access their value. I think this has the least friction for N Am growth, as it\u2019s users who are already familiar with crypto and also high net worth and able to spend on these large transactions (so things like dust and gas aren\u2019t an issue). Perhaps approach the actual realtors or real estate companies that already deal with BTC and let them do the educating of clients? ",
