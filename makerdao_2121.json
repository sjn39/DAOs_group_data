This is our second and last MIP14 subproposal before the full budget will be resubmitted for voting in March.  Reason Details This amount is a monthly cap of TechOps CU\u2019s new revised NewBase DAI budget. After submitting our 2023 budget to the community it was rejected for a number of reasons, including:  Very high budget overall \u2014 bad time for new hires and TechOps CU failing to judge the community\u2019s sentiment for cost cutting. Not giving Bear market vote options \u2014 as per MIP40 (only if the budget is higher) and as the new expected standard. Our role in Endgame \u2014 transitioning to Ecosystem Actor and/or Tribunal.  We\u2019ve taken this feedback onboard and have revised our new budget significantly which will be up for voting in March 2023. Due to budgeting cycle happening quarterly we\u2019re left without funding for February and March 2023. This amount will cover our expenses for the month of March. The first MIP14 subproposal has passed, now this is the second and last MIP14 subproposal that will sustain us for the month of March. Any excess funds as always will be promptly returned to the protocol.  Surplus Analysis Proposed transfer can be taken from the current surplus.  DAI Transfer Ceiling Analysis The transfer ceiling was removed during January 2023 voting period.  Targets Recipient is TechOps CU Auditor Multi-sig Wallet. Recipient Address: 0x2dC0420A736D1F40893B9481D8968E4D7424bC0B Amount To Transfer: 138,894 DAI   Relevant Information:  2023 Revised DAI Budget MIP TechOps CU Mandate  ",
