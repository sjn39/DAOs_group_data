I know you are trying to strike a balance to ensure the miner community accepts the mining reward changes and difficulty bomb. I have a solution that I think would make this a lot easier. To be quite honest most GPU miners are now barely breaking even after electricity costs due to the current state of the market and increased ASIC mining pushing up difficulty. Any reduction in rewards without a likewise reduction in difficulty would leave only ASICs on your network. I think I can speak for the mining community by saying we would be extremely open to outright reductions in rewards with the difficulty bomb reward removal if you were to include an anti ASIC POW mining algorithm change simultaneously. We know once ASICs are off the network we will again be on equal footing with other fellow GPU miners and profits should resume to where we are not mining for a loss. I realize Anti ASIC POW change was part of an EIP a few months back but you never finished the work but did agree it would need to be part of a fork with other EIPs. It seems this would be the best time to implement a POW algorithm change along side the reward reduction and difficulty bomb removal. I know you would hands down win over the mining community if you finally took serious the amount of profits ASICs are costing the community and forked them off. One last thought. I participate in a lot of wall street conference calls and your hesitation and lack of urgency to roll out PoW/PoS with Casper FFG ahead of Devcon 4 curtailed a lot investment enthusiasm. It is at this moment in time that your team should double down and pour every last scrap of energy into ensuring Ethereum can complete the goals they have committed to this year. Since the 7/13 call when you talked about delaying until 2019, the ETH/BTC pair has lost 40%. It is now that the community needs to hear your enthusiasm and commitment to work day and night to accomplish your goals this year even if it means DEVCON 4 gets missed by your team. ",

The hobbyist are less efficient and become less profitable first, ETH was started to appeal to the hobbyist miners. The professionals have a longer term outlook and will mine for a period of time at a loss if there is continued progress in the community for the coin they are mining. The question though about GPU miner profitability vs ASIC is difficult to answer without knowing the number of ASICs on the network. Most of us that have large operations feel the numbers could be as high as 30% of the hash rate are ASICs. If we are correct Ethereum should want to protect the GPU miners at 70% of the hash versus the minority at 30% of the hash. The GPU miners are at a tipping point and once they leave the project, ASIC miners will be impossible to get rid of as their economies of scale will never let GPUs back in at a profitable rate. ",

However, the pressing concern is the Innosilicon A10, fabricated using Samsung 10nm process with a spec of 485mhs at 850w - about 150% more efficient than even the best tuned GPU mining rig. These ASICs are already in deployment, and would begin mass shipping first week of September. The worst part is, these ASICs are priced competitively relative to GPU rigs - $3,000 USD. Effectively, an A10 ASIC is equivalent to the performance of 2.6 best-tuned GPU rigs, at the price of 2 GPU rigs, and at 50% of the operating costs. I may not speak for my fellow miners, but a reduction in issuance is an understood and welcomed development direction, provided that we also have a solution to the ASIC problem. All we need is a stop-gap solution to bar ASICs out, even if temporarily, as long as the solution lasts long enough to propel us through the issuance reduction, into Shasper. My greatest fear is that if we don\u2019t have an answer to the ASIC problem, come issuance reduction time, we\u2019ll lose a significant number of GPU miners, be left with a less secured (less overall hash rate) chain, and very centralized hash rate sources. Coupled with deteriorating overall price sentiments, we might be opening doors to potentially hostile counterparty actions, such as 51% double spend attack on prominent exchanges, or worst, a direct 51% attack to topple everything we love and built atop of us. I hope my doomsday scenario never come to be. ",

That\u2019s just the way this works - there\u2019s never a risk of the network going offline due to lack of miners because it will always be profitable at some point. Additionally, development does not depend on the market. At all.  Changes to the protocol will happen when they are ready, no sooner, and you\u2019re never going to convince core devs to work faster/harder than they already are by pointing at the price of Ether. If you want to make a compelling argument to devs, you need to talk about the security of the blockchain and have actual data to back up your claims.  Is there a legitimate threat of 51% attack right now?  Will there be at some point in the future if we let ASICs continue to dominate mining?  There is a lot of historical evidence on the Bitcoin side of things, as well as a lot of economic/game theory, that would suggest that this is not an issue for anybody except you as a GPU miner.  Personally, I consider ASIC mining to be against the elusive \u201cEthereum Philosophy\u201d because anti-ASIC efforts were part of the original spec of the protocol.  It still is, and it still works.  However, it would be naive to ignore the fact that better hardware is coming out and it is not as accessible as a GPU, which ultimately leads to the same effects as having ASICs on your network. Here\u2019s the real issue though, there are too many possible solutions. Do we: \u2022 Work on the transition to PoS to eliminate ASIC and GPU miner problems \u2022 Work on anti-ASIC mining protocols in conjunction to issuance/difficulty bomb changes \u2022 Try to ignore \u201cASICs\u201d because they aren\u2019t actually ASICS, just better hardware than GPUs, in order to maintain that the current algorithm is indeed ASIC resistant Each of these have about 3-5 sub-options to them, and there will never be a 100% consensus on which to do.  IMO, if the network isn\u2019t under threat of immediate 51% attack, then efforts should be only towards scaling/PoS, not worrying about whether or not miners are making money. That really isn\u2019t very important to the network. ",

However their contributions and delivery on foundation milestones play key roles into shaping the perceived value of the coin. These perceptions can directly influence the value of the coin, whether they are real or imagined. This is why I included the final thought above. We are at a crossroads in crypto where perceived value is out of flux with actual value in a lot of coins, most are wrong and too high and some are too low.

That inherently increases the actual value of the platform/coin. It is not the job of developers to increase the market value of a coin though, but they are free to do that if they want. This means that developers have zero obligation to miners, whose costs are very much real and paid for in fiat currency.  Miners by definition liquidate their mined tokens to fiat immediately, and those who choose to hold the token are still miners, but they are now also investors/traders and it is their responsibility to remain profitable in that situation - just like every other investor/trader. As long as the block reward * fiat value of coin is high enough for enough GPU miners to be profitable (not all, just enough to meet the minimum required to secure the network, it\u2019s impossible to create a static inflation rate that always guarantees all miners are profitable because that is a function of difficulty too), then there is no need to increase the inflation rate.

In April they did not want to do a separate fork to remove ASICs due to Constantinople being released this year. If the developers delay Constantinople like they talked about then they will have no reason not to get this small fork done by December. Surely they can get this done with the pressure off the table to get Constantinople released. ",

If the signal to noise ratio degrades here as it has on reddit, i would expect nothing other than for these discussions (and ultimately decisions about the protocol) to be made more and more in private. I would even consider this response I\u2019m making right now to be noise because it contributes nothing to the topic at hand, but it is at least in an effort to cut down on future noise and be a net positive.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on this here.  @atlanticcrypto Maybe I\u2019m the only one, but I really dislike URL shorteners. They just force me to go to checkshorturl.com to see where the link is going to redirect to, which is much more of a hassle than dealing with a long url (which could\u2019ve just been embedded in text to make it shorter). Here is the long link. The slides are a little noisy for me, particularly the background graphic.  I\u2019m sure if somebody was presenting them it would be fine, but reading them on my own they are very congested. It mentions that this proposal is \u201cin line with Draft Casper FFG\u2019s Year 1 Issuance\u201d.  Is this a meaningful/valuable target?  I don\u2019t think using a line out of a draft as your goal is particularly worthwhile if that\u2019s the only support. What is the motivation behind reducing issuance?  That may seem like a silly question, but the follow-up questions to the response tend to point out nuances that bring into question why reducing issuance really matters. You mention \u201ctop line incentives\u201d a few times, but never really define it.  Are you just talking about block rewards that aren\u2019t ommer related? The fact that the top 15 pools have 90% of the hashrate is irrelevant.  Those pools don\u2019t own the hashpower.  Pools are decentralized.  Lines like \u201cUncle rates are driven by latency - a product of centralization\u201d are patently false.  I find the motivation and \u201cevidence\u201d extremely suspect, but I\u2019m not going to spend too much time breaking down every little thing in this when I haven\u2019t seen it being referenced by anyone else.

I will address your claim that \u201cUncle rates are driven by latency - a product of centralization\u201d is patently false. Latency is the single driver of Uncles. With centralization of work package distribution (mining pools), there is latency introduced that can be otherwise avoided when solo mining. Hence, latency is a product of centralization. Mining nodes are hit with three levels of latency: Latency with the Ethereum node network \u2014 the time it takes for the mining node to receive notification that a new pending block is available. Latency with the miners \u2014 the time it takes for the mining pool to send new work packages to its miners + the time it takes for a miner to send a potential solution back to the mining pool. Latency in propagating a \u201csolved\u201d block \u2014 the time it takes for a mining pool to distribute its valid block solution to 51pct of the Ethereum network.  There are some areas where a mining pool/node CAN minimize latency: Invest in low-latency fiber connectivity. Invest in best-in-class compute servers (including SSD storage). Increase their exposure to the Ethereum network (connect to more peers). Trim their transaction queue size to minimize computing requirements.  There are some areas where a mining pool/node CANNOT manage latency: **The latency of its miners to the pool itself (think home internet latency).** The latency of network peer connections. The block propagation advantage larger pools have to their own miners.  Let\u2019s quantify some of the latency: Mining node block propagation \u2014 200ms to 500ms Block Import / Transaction Processing \u2014 100ms to 150ms Mining pool to miner latency \u2014 100ms to 500ms Miner to mining pool latency \u2014 100ms to 500ms  This puts our aggregate range of latency from 400ms to 1650ms. If a target block round is 15sec, it\u2019s possible a valid block may not be propagated for 1.65sec!!! That\u2019s an 11pct delay under normal operating conditions! That also defines the lower boundary of the network wide uncle rates. ",
