For the promotion of DeFi and Uniswap\u2019s brand awareness, I think that Uniswap DAO should start focussing on promoting across platforms such as TikTok, Tiktok has over 1 billion users and has been downloaded over 200 million times in the United States alone. IMO, Hayden Adams; Inventor of the Uniswap Protocol would be the perfect person for creating brand awareness. To get a rough opinion of the community, I\u2019m creating a poll. Vote on \u201cYes\u201d - if you support hayden doing tiktok dances for UniSwap marketing, Vote on \u201cNo\u201d - if you don\u2019t support Hayden doing tiktok dances. Should Hayden do TikTok dances for Uniswap marketing?     Yes No     0 voters     ",
