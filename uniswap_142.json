                    "content": " Basic Summary The following is a proposal to invest $1M-$5M into the Bankless BED Index in an effort to diversify the Uniswap DAO\u2019s treasury. The long-term goal of diversification is to provide financial balance to the organization\u2019s balance sheets, enabling more security and potentially less volatility for the DAO\u2019s overall financial well-being. The BED is an index, created by Bankless and Index Coop, that represents crypto\u2019s most investable assets, 33.3% BTC, 33.3% ETH, and 33.3% DeFi Pulse Index (DPI).  Motivation The main purpose for purchasing BED is to help diversify Uniswap\u2019s treasury, which is almost entirely held in UNI, while also helping drive Uniswap\u2019s adoption through the marketing campaign highlighted below. Buying the BED index can strengthen the partnership between Uniswap, Index Coop, and Bankless DAO. In return Bankless DAO, recognized for their educational content and their cultural influence over the industry, will manage a marketing campaign with Uniswap to help the community understand the insides and out of the Uniswap Protocol. The partnership with Bankless could increase Uniswap awareness and adoption in the DeFi ecosystem. Bankless DAO is an inventive and leading edge DAO, mixing on-chain and off-chain initiatives. By holding BED Token, Uniswap\u2019s treasury can have diversified exposure to DeFi (DPI), the lowest risk crypto asset (BTC), and the upside in the broader Ethereum ecosystem (ETH). BED is a vehicle that captures equal-weighted upside from the most promising use cases and themes in crypto: store of value, programmable money, and decentralized finance. It also automatically rebalances to keep an even exposure ratio over the long term. Bankless DAO is proposing a small initial amount ($1-5M) that could be increased in the future as the community becomes more comfortable with holding this asset.  How it works The BED index is rebalanced on the first Friday of each calendar month, using the most liquid trading pairs. To date, this has been primarily through Uniswap V3. The fund is rebalanced in accordance with its underlying index. The BED Index is maintained monthly in two phases:   Determination Phase: Takes place during the fourth week of the month. It is the phase when the changes needed for the next reconstitution are determined.   Reconstitution Phase: Following publication of the determination phase outcome, the index composition will change to the new weights on the first Friday of the following month. I.e components will be added or removed.    Risk Analysis Smart Contract Risk: BED uses Set Protocol smart contracts that were audited by OpenZeppelin in September, 2020. Despite its recent launch on 07/21/2021, BED has fewer smart contract risks because it uses the contracts from Set Protocol. Counterparty Risk: BED holders have no governance influence on Index Coop or the protocol within the index. The BED Index utilizes the TokenSets V2 smart contract that has privileged roles in many of the contracts. There is a multisig responsible for initiating rebalances, performing meta-governance, and adding or removing new protocol functionality. The index does not have the ability to arbitrarily move underlying assets, mint tokens, etc. The signers are currently members of the Set team with the intention to add Index Coop community signers over time. While the multisig can\u2019t arbitrarily move assets, it theoretically could rebalance assets into a fake token. The mitigating factors for these risks are the Set Labs, Bankless and individuals personal reputation. Liquidity Risk: Minting and redeeming BED represent the primary market of the indices (ie BTC, ETH, and DPI), but many users can buy and sell indices on the secondary markets. The price on the secondary markets are kept at Net Asset Value (the market value of all the underlying components) through a network of market makers that redeem the tokens when price is below NAV and vice versa. However, as BED holders have the option to mint/redeem the underlying tokens within BED, it draws on the liquidity of the underlying assets and also allows for any deviation from NAV to be arbitraged away by traders. So liquidity goes beyond the secondary market for BED. Market Risk: As BED is a basket of tokens, it is likely to have less volatility than the component assets by themselves.We recommend reducing exposure to market risk by investing a small amount of 1 million USD to 5 million USD to begin.  Specification BED can be purchased via Set Protocol. There is the potential for a joint Bankless, Index Coop and Uniswap deployment on Uniswap rewards and potentially other opportunities. More on this as information comes to hand. Additionally, Bankless DAO can execute on a marketing campaign on Twitter and other means not limited to a potential giveaway such as the gleam campaign, CTAs in the Bankless DAO newsletter dedicated to the approval of the BED Index and a podcast episode on Crypto Sapiens dedicated to Uniswap.  Seeking Feedback We would like to gather feedback from the community about this post and invite the community to discuss how BED purchase could benefit Uniswap. We firmly believe that treasury diversification is becoming increasingly important for DAOs, Uniswap being one of them. By purchasing BED for the Uniswap treasury, the DAO gets broader exposure to growth in the crypto ecosystem and minimizes their downside risk of the UNI token.

Will this proposal increase engagement with UNI governance, or uniswap as a protocol? My main concern is that UNI is a governance token; which has seen very low participation and utility.

Bankless dao\u2019s only benefit is a streaming of .125% annualized over a year. As an example lets say uniswap buys 1 million usd worth of bed index, the revenue going to bankless is $1,250 over a span of a year. Buying the baskets of the index like a balancer pool is a less feasible option. For 2 main reasons:  Trading fees Manual rebalancing - the BED Index is rebalanced monthly. An excellent post done by crypto texan from index coop takes an in depth look as to why balancer is less effective compared to the bed Index link:https://twitter.com/Crypto_Texan/status/1442280400559095818?s=20   For the marketing campaign aspect yes, Uniswap is the largest defi protocol out there so we want drive more consumers to the defi community. Community engagement does increase for a protocol if the bed index is purchased. UMA Protocol whom purchase 1m dollars worth of the bed index back in September have mentioned a significant increase in community engagement.

                    "content": "True, UNI is generally correlated with the underlying assets in the BED Index. But diversifying your treasury is like adding ballast to your ship. You have your propulsion systems \u2013 let\u2019s say the nuclear reactor that powers the aircraft carrier \u2013 and you have your ballast that keeps the ship upright. Your propulsion systems are all the creative energy that goes into making UNI great. The ballast in the hull is made up of the admittedly boring strategic governance moves you make to create a bulwork of defenses, such as diversifying the treasury. If UNI somehow tanks, even for a day, the ballast you\u2019ve created through a diversified treasury will help keep the ship upright in the storm.  This is what I would call the defensive motivation, which is clearlly wise. Now, BED is still small, so we can\u2019t provide you with truly enterprise class ballast systems yet. We\u2019re working on that. Which brings me to point #2. Your supoprt of the BED Index allows it to grow. As BED grows, so does our ability to provide UNI with a much deeper, and potentially more diversified, pool of capital and assets as ballast for your ship.  This is what I would call the solidarity motivation, which is also highly valid. Finally, Airbayer is right about the vlaue we can bring as a trusted marketing and media org. I believe this is a very real near-term value that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Back to the correlation question: by choosing the BED as part of its diversification strategy, UNI would be banking some coin against the chance that there may be a disruption in the marketplace in UNI\u2019s disfavor. IMO it\u2019s a wise call, and in this case a pretty small allocation. ",

If the UNI treasury would diversify, it would make more sense to diversify into tokens which are not correlated at all. Like @Naught said, the UNI token is a fleeting hull as of now as it is. Selling it further down the line just to achieve little (or next to none) diversification/marketing effect is probably not the most efficient use of 1-5 million USD in UNI tokens. I remain unconvinced. If the whole purpose is marketing, then I\u00b4d advise doing 100K worth of buying and market it around as much as possible. ",

Its a gargantuous task which requires research to see what is truly worth the opportunity cost. I do not believe the answer is as simple as divesting into the majors + DeFi index. Let\u00b4s take a theoretical scenario in regards to the opportunity cost: Imagine the UNI treasury has two options to choose from when it comes down to spending 1-5M worth of UNI tokens - either diversify into the majors + DeFi Index or Run its own VC team using the funds from the treasury and participate in seed rounds of other upcoming protocols. Whats better for the UNI token holders, Uniswap protocol, and the other stakeholders? This is just a trivial example of illustrating opportunity costs. Both represent a divestment from the native token in the treasury into other coins/tokens. Both have price implications for the token itself. Marketing is also included in both of them. Do you see what Im trying to say? It\u00b4s not a simple problem to solve. Now, Im not saying the idea to diversify is wrong. It\u00b4s quite needed in fact, but it needs to be true diversification. Something which is not correlated to the UNI token, is worth the price impact, and has a marketing potential as well. Despite the best efforts, and I DO believe Airbayer has honest intentions, this proposal arguably ticks only one of the things on the list. ",

As you may know Index is behind the DPI component of BED and helps facilitate the Bankless Vision on BED. Some great points have already been made on the diversification benefits of BED and the marketing potential of the partnership with Bankless. Also, this would further the relationship with Index. Index and Uniswap already have a great relationship as UNI is the largest holding in DPI and Uniswap V3 is our primary liquidity provider for our strategies. In TVL of Uniswap pools, ETH2x-FLI is 16th and DPI is 37th. Index is one of the largest and most active communities in the ecosystem. We are excited at the potential prospect of strengthening our ties through BED as well as leveraging our expertise in other treasury areas. I\u2019ll try to address a couple of your excellent points as best I can. It looks like the main three are: Correlation, implementation (selling/buying), and benefit to the community. Correlation/Diversification: You make a great point that \u201cDiversification\u2026(is) a gargantuous task.\u201d It\u2019s something that as we speak to more and more treasuries, we are learning just how big a task it is. These conversations will be the foundations of building stronger protocols and a healthy environment for all. Obviously \u2013 UNI is highly Correlated to ETH, WBTC and DPI. But that\u2019s a good thing. We believe, as I think you do, that Web3 is just now hitting its stride. The aim is not to diversify those returns away with true \u201cnon-correlating assets.\u201d The goal is to provide the Uniswap treasury with broader diversification, non-native holdings that can be used as needed, and participation in other protocols. Broader diversification comes from two areas.   Exposure to WBTC \u2013 Uniswap is heavily dependent on revenue generated from the Ethereum ecosystem. Exposure to an alternative protocol could limit volatility if there was an Ethereum specific negative event.   Exposure to ETH and DPI \u2013 Like many treasuries Uniswap is largely composed of native tokens. Replacing a small portion of UNI with ETH and DPI could be a benefit in the event of a Uniswap specific downturn. However, if that unlikely event never occurs, the correlation to UNI pays off because you continue to have a growth asset that performs like UNI. It was mentioned in one of your responses about purchasing (addressed later) that if the treasury had to:   \u201cSELL 1M worth of UNI tokens. This means that the token itself will lose value - the entire treasury will lose value as a direct result of the action. Despite the treasury being large, the liquidity is not equal. 1-5M purchases can have more price impact than you think.\u201d This highlights a need for all treasuries. What would be sold if funds were needed quickly? If Uniswap had an issue and needed to sell treasury funds, its likely UNI is already down. A further large sale from the treasury could potentially have a large and likely negative impact. Think of BED as your UNI proxy token that can be the first thing sold when needed. And feel free to sell when needed! It won\u2019t hurt our feelings, or the price. BED is new and as such currently has limited liquidity, however, like DPI, it can be broken down to its base components which have deep liquidity and can be sold with minimal slippage. Lastly, it was brought up if Uniswap would be better off \u201cRun its own VC team using the funds from the treasury and participate in seed rounds of other upcoming protocols\u201d The DPI component allows you to participate in 17 protocols. Some \u201cestablished\u201d (in crypto time) and some more up and coming, all curated by the DeFi authority Defi Pulse. Implementation: The concern about price impact to UNI to sell and buy BED is a common one \u2013 even if the benefits make sense, how do you limit token price impact? This is also a benefit of partnering with Index. We have accomplished several large buys and have the experience and connections to assist in this process. If we get this process further down the line. We will make sure to have an implementation process that will cause minimal impact. In the past we have done Bonded Curves (requires Chainlink), used our market-making partners, direct swaps, paired with outside investors, or have done smaller systematic buys. What I hope the outcome of this dialog is to determine if diversification is wise, and if so, how much would be meaningful to your community? From there, we will work together to find the best way to implement. We would only go ahead once we have a solution to your wanted amount that would have minimal impact on UNI. Lets continue to conversation, please let us know how we can help! ",

                    "content": "Its not a good thing that they are all highly correlated. It beats the purpose of diversification.  If you diversify into highly correlated assets, your diversification impact is low at best; however, you DID sell your own token it weakening it further. That\u00b4s why diversifying into non-correlated assets should be the primary task\u2026Otherwise, its borderline pointless and harmful. We can see it live in this year\u00b4s fall of the \u201cbalanced portfolio\u201d which went from a negative correlation to a highly positive correlation. The result was that the returns went negative. Diversification into the majors and the DPI is almost bound to underperform due to the costs of selling your own token, having high correlation, and incurring costs. Anybody with basic statistics knowledge knows that this is not a good idea. You said yourself the web3 was just hitting its stride. Why should not the UNI Treasury form a VC team to achieve diversification? Its true, its not correlated, and the returns are highly above what the majors could ever give. The failure rate is higher, but it makes more sense for the alllocation of 1-5M USD. Its nice that the DPI has some, but of course, this is not enough on its own and could never compete against full blown allocated seed rounds. The opportunity costs of buying majors are just too high mainly this late in the cycle. The DeFi Fund deal was OTC btw with minimal price impact yet it moved the token down. It\u00b4s psychology\u2026people will sell it if they know somebody else is going to sell it before them. Now, there is no way to prevent it from happening if such a highly inefficient proposal ever saw the light of day. Its human behavior. Overall, this proposal\u00b4s spirit is nice, but it works only in a dreamworld. In reality, its bound to do more harm than good. Like I have said, diversification is a major major task. You need to have an edge to achieve the desired results. There is a reason why many funds in both TradFi and Crypto world fail at it. This is just an unnecessary middleman trying to get you to sell your own token and buy into majors for no reason at all. All the shill posts do not help either. It\u00b4s almost as if you guys came here solely to troll and ask for money. I am an open minded person though. Show me the data proving me wrong stating that majors and DPI would meaningfully outperform the alternatives (a Uniswap VC team) and I will change my mind. Until then: I will vote NO on this proposal. ",

I don\u2019t understand the point of the BED Index: Why would you want an index that constantly rebalances the weights of multiple assets (e.g. ETH and BTC)? This is the same as having a liquidity position in the Uniswap v2 ETH-BTC pool, but instead of earning trading fees you need to pay them (each time you rebalance). So you get the downside (\u201cimpermanent loss\u201d) without the upside (fees).   ",
