Currently only for Ethereum and Bitcoin. Perhaps @webmaster128\u2026 can chime in how to best do it for Cosmos and @soc1c for polkadot parachains. Input welcome! Also wondering if IPFS could be a target. It is not a BlockChain - but e.g. for IN3 it gets assigned a chainId (0x7d0 https://github.com/slockit/in3#ipfs) which seems quite odd. Giving it a prefix in CAIP-2 could work around this a bit cc @CJentzsch @simon-jentzsch       ",

I don\u2019t understand why Ethereum addresses are labeled as eip155.  EIP-155 didn\u2019t change the addressing scheme for Ethereum in any way, it only changed the signing scheme and it is opt-in for every transaction and not something that is set per account.  An Ethereum address may sign one transaction without a chain ID and the next with a chain ID and then the next without again. I think that ethereum should be the term used, or maybe ethereum1 if you want some form of versioning. ",

The only thing EIP-155 did was integrate it into signatures (but not all signatures!) which made it part of consensus rather than just part of gossip. As I mentioned in the linked issue, an account can sign a mix of EIP-155 transactions, pre-155 transactions, type 2 (1559) transactions, etc.  Calling this address a \u201ceip155 address\u201d just doesn\u2019t make sense.  This is different (IIUC) from Bitcoin\u2019 segwit, where addresses were actually backward incompatible (my understanding of Segwit is very limited, so this may be incorrect).  ethereum: is already used by ERC681  If the intent is to make CAIP-2 compatible with other payment URLs, then it should pick a standard schema prefix (protocol) for everything that clearly delineates that it is a CAIP-2 address.  For example, caip2:ethereum:0xabcd... or whatever.  Having a separate schema namespace for every single blockchain out there is untenable because you will eventually run into conflicts.  On the other hand, if the assumption is that someone is pasting an address into a box, I believe that CAIP-2 are compatible with 681 addresses because they both would end up being ethereum:<address>, unless you include the chain ID (which I don\u2019t think you should), in which case they would not match each other and you don\u2019t have a problem.

The same as I don\u2019t think Polygon should be called \u201cEthereum\u201d or Binance Chain should be called \u201cEthereum\u201d.

I think the source of the confusion is that prior to the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split, Network ID == Chain ID, so there was functionally a single number.  However, after the split we now had two networks with the same network ID but different chain IDs, so we (community) had to come up with a new name for one of them.  Thus, \u201cNetwork ID\u201d turned into \u201cNetwork ID + Chain ID\u201d.  I\u2019ll concede that EIP-155 was perhaps the first place that Chain ID (as a term) came up in any documentation/consensus protocol stuff, so I can appreciate the confusion.  However, the test networks have always had a different \u201cchain ID\u201d, its just that it was called network ID previously because in all cases the two were the same so we didn\u2019t need two names.

As testnets received the London upgrade, they became signature incompatible with Ethereum if you signed using a type 2 transaction.  Similarly, Ethereum Classic slowly drifts away from Ethereum compatibility with time, and some chains migrated to type 2 transactions before Ethereum did, while others are migrating after. With the introduction of Proof of Stake and eventually state expiry, we may see more and more subtle differences between chains that makes it more and more challenging to maintain a consistent interface that works regardless of what blockchain you are talking to. Something to keep in mind is that address space extension is currently under research which will likely break this grouping as different chains adopt that feature at different points in time.  Circling back to the original topic, if we do group by \u201cEthereum like\u201d then I still think we should prefix the name with ethereum:<chain_id>:address or ethereum:<chain_name>:address.  chain_name is more user friendly, but I don\u2019t think there is a JSON-RPC endpoint that exposes this at the moment.

                    "content": "EIP-155 support by a particular chain doesn\u2019t imply any sort of compatibility other than signing mechanism for a subset of transactions.  Even now, there are Ethereum spin-off chains that have relatively few EIP-155 transactions submitted, and Ethereum Mainnet has an ever dwindling number of eip-155 transaction signatures. Using eip-155 as the prefix feels similar to using any other EIP number as the prefix like EIP-2718 or EIP-55.  You can very easily (and we may already at this point) have two Ethereum-like chains that have a chain-id but one of them doesn\u2019t support EIP-155 transactions at all (in fact, there was talk just today about deprecating EIP-155 transactions in Ethereum). I think the core of my argument here is that the eip155 prefix doesn\u2019t provide any additional value to the user or developer that ethereum wouldn\u2019t similarly provide.  I still argue that we should have a prefix per chain rather than trying to draw arbitrary lines around chain groups because that gives you real actionable information, but even if we ignore that and try to do a bucket-prefix, EIP-155 doesn\u2019t tell the reader anything useful that a random number or word would.

                    "content": "Since this is a standard, we should have very strictly/well defined terms.  What exactly are the requirements for a chain being considered for the \u201cethereum\u201d (or eip155) group of chains?  If the requirement is just \u201chas implemented eip155\u201d, then many Ethereum compatible chains wouldn\u2019t meet this criteria because they simply launched with chain ID support with no EIP155 hardfork.  Also, any new chains that launch with only type 2 transactions (my recommendation to any new ethereum-like chain) would not qualify.  Similarly, if we eventually deprecate eip-155 transactions (something being explored for Mainnet), then Ethereum itself wouldn\u2019t qualify as an eip155 chain in the future.  Meanwhile, any chain that doesn\u2019t support EIP-155 would still be fully compatible with this specification by using the network ID as the middle delimiter. I am personally unable to come up with any strong boundaries for what qualifies as an Ethereum-like chain and what qualifies as different enough to warrant its own name, which is why I think we should just have a root name for every blockchain.  I don\u2019t think we have run into any real problem with namespace collisions in public blockchain names, and we can create a namespace reserved for private blockchains. I\u2019m very strongly against drafting a standard that isn\u2019t clearly defined, and right now this eip155 prefix is not nearly defined well enough to know exactly what it covers. ",

Networks with a \u201cnetwork ID\u201d (which functions identically to chain ID in this context) don\u2019t count and should get their own top level name (like Morden)?  What about when we have two networks that have a chain ID but collide with each other (there is no guarantee that chain IDs don\u2019t collide, you only need to avoid collisions when you have multiple chains that share a network protocol)? Could we achieve the same goal by saying \u201cany network that has a numeric identifier\u201d?  This would at least be a bit more consistent and useful, because it allows us to do some grouping without having to set such an arbitrary group boundary and ensure that the second field is a number.
