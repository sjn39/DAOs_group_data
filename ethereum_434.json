Abstract LDGRToken facilitates the recording of ownership and transfer of securities sold under the new Securities Act Regulations. The issuance and trading of securities is subject to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and specific U.S. state blue sky laws and regulations. LDGRToken manages securities ownership during issuance and trading. The Issuer is the only role that should create a LDGRToken and assign the RTA. The RTA is the only role that is allowed to execute LDGRToken\u2019s mint, burnFrom, and transferFrom functions. No role is allowed to execute LDGRToken\u2019s transfer function. We welcome all feedback, commentary, and discussions. Here is our ERC proposal: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1450 ",
