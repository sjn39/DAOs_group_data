                    "content": " Overview With the base rate potentially being changed to -4% soon, we have the unique opportunity to adjust risk premiums on many collateral types without dramatically changing stability fees. There have been some concerns voiced on the forums, in community calls, and rocket chat that BAT, WBTC, USDC, ETH may have current RPs that do not accurate reflect their risk. In particular I want to bring to attention that USDC currently has a RP of 4% and WBTC has a RP of only 2%. Both of these assets have custodial/centralization risk, whereas WBTC has both custodial risk and price volatility risk. There has been some limited discussion on thinking about collateral risk within this framework of risk categories here. Although, more discussion on this topic is certainly welcome. Some community members have also mentioned that while BAT has a similar risk profile to a few other collateral types we recently onboarded(namely KNC and ZRX), its risk premium remains at 0%. Likewise Ethereum is a volatile asset and so not a riskless collateral type, so it is possible a 0% RP is not appropriate. Up until this point the adjustment of collateral risk premiums have been used as strategic levers to fix the peg, and not solely to compensate mkr holders for collateral risk. The assumption made with this poll is that this strategic lever should largely be the role of the base rate, rather than individual risk premiums. If there are arguments against this assumption, input is welcome. Let me know if there are additional collateral types of interest that we want to adjust risk premiums on, and I will add a poll for them.  Should we change the risk premiums for BAT, WBTC, USDC, and/or ETH?     abstain Yes No     0 voters      BAT risk premium     abstain 0%(unchanged) 1% 2% 3% 4% higher than 4%     0 voters      WBTC risk premium     abstain 0% 1% 2%(unchanged) 3% 4% 5% 6% higher than 6%     0 voters      ETH risk premium     abstain 0%(unchanged) 1% 2% 3% 4% higher than 4%     0 voters      USDC risk premium     abstain 0% 1% 2% 3% 4%(unchanged) 5% 6% higher than 6%     0 voters      Next steps Poll will run for two weeks and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Also we could study on it the risks (like running those \u201cworst case scenarios\u201d  we think about). We\u2019re right now using social-intelligence to get the best RP combination, but I should agree that this is not an efficient methodology, and we\u2019re spending many voting polls, weeks (and GAS) to test what this \u201csocial intelligence\u201d considers the best. Please note, that I\u2019m not saying such simulation should tell us which the values will be, but if correctly tested with the past (and I\u2019m aware the past is not indicator of the future), it could give us clear signals of how bad or good some configuration of RP should be, and we could have even a base to prepare our polls (I\u2019m not sure that polls with values: 0%, 1%, 4%\u2026 makes always sense, for some assets, maybe something like 1%, 1.25%, 1.5% is the best thing to vote on, but it is very hard for us to see these differences right now).

Setting 4% RP for USDC is like saying there is a 4% chance USDC goes bankrupt per year (losing keys, being frozen by the US gov whatever). Maybe a little less if you put risk remuneration here. The loss when a risk arise doesn\u2019t have to be 100%, but it\u2019s not impossible here. Let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s a 1% risk (100% loss). Currently, the equity part of the MakerDAO balance sheet is the surplus buffer (0.3M$, max 0.5M$). We in have 50M DAI backed by USDC. MakerDAO will become insolvent in such case and will have to raise 49.5M DAI. Sure it can work, there is a lot of immaterial value in MakerDAO but can also fail. In any case, it wouldn\u2019t be unfair to wipe all current MKR holders. 4% RP for USDC-A mean risk about 2M DAI per year. With a surplus buffer of 500k, you are expressing that you expect to lose 4x the surplus buffer each year. As nothing happened with USDC for some time, you expect to lose way more than the buffer with one issue leading to MKR issuance. Either there are other reserves in the system that\u2019 I\u2019m not aware, that\u2019s not risk management, that\u2019s YOLO. From my perspective you can\u2019t discuss risk premium without have a framework to manage risk. With BR @ -4%, the peg in its state, and the lack of diversification we don\u2019t have to move fast as it\u2019s not something that can be solved in the next few months. That\u2019s why we have time to discuss the framework before moving in action. ",

Please be sure to signal if you can. Thanks.     Signal Request: Increase ETH-A Risk Premium Governance       Overview MKR holders have been subsidizing the risk of ETH collapse since Black Thursday in order to bootstrap and encourage DAI supply growth as the peg has stayed above $1. With the ratification and creation of the base rate, we should begin to look at that as the lever to use to encourage DAI supply growth/retraction. Therefore I am asking the community whether it is time to re-add/add a risk premium to ETH-A to insure the Maker system against future ETH collapse. I look forward to your feedb\u2026     ",

That\u2019s unheard of in TradFi but why not. The issue is that such expected earnings also have a risk premium on them, or a discount rate. If MakerDAO need $50M, a bidder can provide it to resolve the insolvency issue or copy/paste MakerDAO code in a MakerDAO2 with a better solvency. You don\u2019t need to have correct RP or even generate fees for that to work. Expectation is all that matter. If you know the supply rate in Compound/Aave is around 5%, it seems okay to charge 2% on the whole DAI supply. You don\u2019t have to do that to be counted in your MKR valuation. You are hopping that there will be buyers of last resort, that MakerDAO will be too big to fail and that they will be nice/fair to existing MKR holders. I wouldn\u2019t bet on that. PS : Not saying that BAT at RP 0% makes sense, just saying it\u2019s the least of MakerDAO problems right now\u2026 ",
