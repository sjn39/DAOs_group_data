                    "content": " Overview We have had some interesting weeks regarding the System Surplus Buffer and before going into the details of this Signal Request I would like to give a brief overview of the events:  In late November, an executive passed to slowly increase the Surplus Buffer from 60MM to 90MM by 1MM a week with the intention to burn a bit of the revenues while constantly increasing the System Surplus. You can find the corresponding onchain poll here, and the previous Signal Request here  On 2022-01-21T23:00:00Z a large market downturn led to a lot of vault liquidations resulting in a lot of Flap auctions as the System Surplus exceeded the configured Surplus Buffer. Maker collected ~15 MM DAI in penalty fees, over 400 Flap auctions have been triggered - most of them running in parallel. A lot of them ended with a huge discount, resulting in an estimated inefficiency of 2.1 MM. A more detailed deep dive can be found here. On 2022-01-23T23:00:00Z I posted an Urgent Signal Request to discontinue the slow increase of the Surplus Buffer and replace it with directly setting it to 250 MM to prevent any further burning of MKR. On the same day, @Protocol-Engineering  and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit  placed an out-of-schedule executive into the voting portal reflecting the changes by the Urgent Signal Request This passed within 16 minutes and the spell got cast on 2022-01-25T23:00:00Z  On 2022-01-24T23:00:00Z I posted another Signal Request with an option to go back to the previous setting, with the addition to include a Rate Limiting into the Flapper-Module, which would limit the amount of parallel Flap-Auctions. The Signal Request passed with a majority in favor of introducing the Rate-Limited Flapper and returning to MKR burning.  While the overview section of the Signal Request explicitly stated the intention of going back to the same lerp mechanics as before, the details on the voting option did not. We ended up with an onchain-poll that will just add the Rate Limiter to the Flapper Module, but not going back to the same Surplus Buffer configuration. This Signal Request is to decide if we want to return to the configuration we had before (see corresponding executive) - lerping up from 60 MM to 90 MM with 1MM/week If we want to return to the old config, there are a couple of prerequisites that need to be met before the change can get executed:  the Rate Limiter needs to get installed in mainnet - this will take a couple of weeks we need an initial configuration for the Rate Limiter  Please note that in any case we are not going to see any MKR burning in the next weeks, as returning to the previous configuration will restart with a Surplus Buffer well above (> 10 MM) the current System Surplus. There is no need to rush this decision, so I would like to run this Signal Request longer than usual.  Shall we return to the previous partial burning as agreed in November? This will restore the IAM we set up for slowly increasing the Surplus Buffer in November 2021 from 60MM to 90MM (backdated start date 2021-11-28T23:00:00Z) over the course of 210 days but only after  the Rate Limiter has been installed in mainnet - this will take a couple of weeks an initial configuration for the Rate Limiter has been set   Pros  we will continue with the partial burning as soon as the System Surplus is back exceeding the Surplus Buffer - returning to the state we all agreed on before partial burning will increase the buy-pressure on the illiquid MKR market on a huge market decline a lot of MKR will get bought (we cannot configure the Rate Limiting below 1.44MM/day)   Cons  Some of the profit will not get directed into growing our product but instead towards MKR holders      Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Polls will run until 2022-03-03T23:00:00Z ; its outcome will either result in an on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate result is going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive. PS: thanks to @PaperImperium @MakerMan and @JustinCase  for collaboration on this Signal Request.  A little personal note here I have been (silently) advocating for no MKR burn for a couple of months, but I accepted and was fine with the decision to have at least some partial burning. But my opinion doesn\u2019t matter a lot here - I have a different point to make: We should not use an urgent adjustment made to the protocol\u2019s configuration to justify switching directions. We shall not abandon established processes around decision making. If the community wants to stop MKR burning at all - that\u2019s fine. But this needs to be a structured decision. As I have been the guy pushing for the urgent-change, I feel responsibility to follow up on the path of moving out of it. ",

But this needs to be a structured decision.   and:     JustinCase:  After the big debate back in November where a compromise was reach and a common ground were found, I had hoped the community would stand by its earlier promises. Failure to deliver on earlier compromises bodes ill for our ability to reach new meaningful compromises. Doubly so when they are built on a foundation of an urgent executive.   and:     SebVentures:  To me, the poll is about MakerDAO governance credibility. Let\u2019s burn MKR, or not, but for sure not credibility.   To this:     MadShills:  Less haste, less waste. Turn on the burn when there is a proper design and clearly defined objectives.

Either we deploy the capital now, in a less efficient manner as we have been, or wait and deploy it in a potentially more efficient manner. There is risk and reward on both sides. We can not say for certain we will have a more efficient mechanism acutely. IIRC there was haste to turn the burn back on. It was not thought out as part of a broader strategy and may have just been in response to a bull market and other competitors. Some of those competitors have fallen face down with the change in the markets. It may be nice to use this opportunity to regroup rather than simply continue ahead business as usual. Also, a larger surplus buffer also protects MKR holders so it is a win-win for MKR holders in either case. ",

The community rallied and did it in record time with overwhelming support, even from the folks who voted in November that they wanted to burn and keep the SB at 90M (and who won that vote). In the future, if people have to think twice about urgent actions (maybe the \u201closers\u201d of a previous vote are trying to bypass debate/consensus and get their way, using the urgent action as a cover?), then it will be harder to get broad, immediate support for urgent actions. As I said, I\u2019m all for a larger SB and modifying the burn mechanism, but any changes should be decoupled from the flapper issue. The hearts and minds of the community need to be won first. Until then, we should return to the previously voted upon state ASAP. ",

I\u2019m surprised at all the posts basically supporting a complete doing away of burning.  At this point, the SB limit would be around 71 million upon return to the previous format.  We\u2019re nowhere near that and with expenses continuing to be taken out, we probably won\u2019t return to burning until that limit is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 million (total guesstimate).  Even so, I, for one, find comfort in knowing there is at least potential for a near term burn and I mention this to remind everyone that the SB does continue to increase even if we allow for this potential for near term burn. I joined this board purely because of the SB issue and had a desire to give a little more voice to the frustration that I\u2019ve felt and have seen in many who are less involved with governance.  Burning feels like an afterthought sometimes and the fact that an emergency fix is being seen by some as an opportunity to completely get rid of it is deeply discouraging.  I do appreciate the last few posts addressing the way this vote might affect trust in governance.  This is an important issue that I hope continues to be considered. ",

A lot has changed but it\u2019s worth looking back because even then there were smart people working here: \u201cIt\u2019s the existence of the buyback and burn model that will create MKR appreciation, not the actual buybacks themselves.\u201d  SB vs. Burn: I think there are very important truths to both. Rather than telling partial truths, we need to combine them to create a new, evolved model that works in the evolving market, while respecting the original social contract.  For the reasons mentioned in the article above, I have been keeping a small amount of MKR for almost 5 years.  I know the game is changing, but it is still a \u201cwaiting game\u201d for some of us. Playing the waiting game in such a fast-moving market like crypto requires a lot of faith in the project. Is continuity still important?  Maybe not anymore.  But if you are so focused on the new goals that you completely ignore the old ones, I think that\u2019s a mistake. But time will tell. ",

This is a single-purpose burner contract that allows governance to set a lot and a hop value, then governance can suck some amount of Dai from the surplus buffer to the kiln where it will be burned off over time by making direct swaps against an AMM contract. For example, MKR governors might set the lot at 30,000 Dai and the hop at 6 hours. Some amount can be sucked from the surplus buffer to the kiln contract where a keeper can call the fire() function every 6 hours to sell 30,000 Dai on an AMM and burn the resulting MKR. This allows governance to strategically burn Dai over time and ensure that the trades execute at market instead of OTC. The current (unaudited please don\u2019t use) prototype includes code for trading on Uniswap V2 and on Uniswap V3. In the case of the former, liquidity on the MKR/DAI pair is very thin and would need to be reinforced by the protocol, but in the case of V3 if there\u2019s not enough liquidity to sell the entire lot without slippage a partial trade is made, the remaining balance would be retained until the hop period has passed. As long as the amounts are kept within reasonable ranges the price protections in Uniswap should make frontrunning attacks financially infeasible, so the protocol would be able to get close to market price on burns and they\u2019d be on a predictable cadence. Again, this is an early prototype and needs team reviews and audits, but might offer a solution that allows for setting the surplus buffer at a high value while still getting controlled burns. ",

                    "content": "I stayed out of this thread until now except to vote NO. Reasoning as follows: First I understand that for many people the flop/flap mechanics had and HAVE an appeal and are part of the whitepaper design.  But if you look back at the scientific data here perhaps I can change your view that the existing flop/flap mechanics are not just inefficient but growingly flawed from a existential perspective.   Maker early on started off with a 1B cap while only having what < 100M DAI in existence.  The thinking here Maker could lose a chunk of this 100M and still have adequate MKR market cap to fill this hole.   This proved to be true except during and after Black Thursday.   Maker with a 600M Market cap at the time and 150M DAI outstanding ended up with a surplus hole of 6M and DAI liquidity so terribly bad that governance halted flops leaving DAI holders with a more than 6% hole in the collateral backing of the existing DAI for a week putting DAI holders at risk of loss during that time.   Once a USDC vault was opened up and sufficient bidders for MKR came on line we flopped what 20K+ MKR to raise 6M DAI at a rough average (off top of my head numbers here btw) price of 280DAI/MKR which we have been buying back with flaps at roughly 2500DAI/MKR.   The cost to the MKR market cap on a 6M Surplus hole was about 320M (price decrease from 600-280) or over a 50% hit to the total market cap to fill a 6% surplus buffer loss.   The final tab for Black Thursday to MKR holders (6M-50M) or about 44M DAI profit lost due to flopping low and flapping high.   This isn\u2019t just terrible performance - it is almost non-existent performance of the market cap to fill any sort of hole in the SB.   Maker would have done far better selling 5-10K MKR to raise 5-10M to fill the surplus buffer before hand.     Even better would have been to float a fixed term bond at 10%/yr for 6M because we could have paid it off in months and not diluted at all. What this event showed us was that even in the best of times MKR market cap is going to get crushed trying to fill a DAI surplus buffer gap and that the flap/flop mechanics are guaranteed to buy high and sell lower\u2026 At this time the MKR market cap is barely 2B and DAI floated is ~10B.   The market cap of Maker is 20% of the entire DAI supply now vs. before Black Thursday when it was 400% the DAI supply.    Based on past experience even a 100M surplus loss (which would lead to flopping for 40M) would cost the protocol over 1B in market cap. The above DATA then means that Maker should be looking to enact a better model to sell MKR high and buy it low. FYI while a MKRDAI v2 does this over the entire price range.   So does a Uniswap v3 contract. Literally Maker could provide market liquidity over a price band which basically will buy MKR low and sell it high.  These AMMs would buy low sell higher over and over again earning fees and at lesat with the v2 autocompounding.   A v3 contract concentrates liquidity so you get a much better return over a v2, but a v2 has liquidity over the entire range of price.   The whole point of these AMMs is if they are funded in a set and forget mode - they are by definition programmed to buy low and sell high.    Also in the v2 contract there is a price low that can\u2019t be exceeded that there will always be liquidity at all price points, and the only price high is the limit on DAI that could exist in the contract at the time. Frankly if it comes to a choice.   flap for MKR or just take the DAI and pair it with MKR to stick into a v2 or v3 Uniswap or burn the MKR I\u2019d rather put MKR and DAI it in a v2 or a v3 every time. Why?  Because if left alone these contracts earn fees providing return to the DAO based on treasury assets (which btw the 84K MKR sitting there is earning us nothing).   Secondly, they always buy low and sell high doing exactly what the DAO needs them to do for proper liquidity expansion and contraction. The DAO can take both MKR and DAI and earn return, but instead we choose to effectively drain DAI from the surplus to extinguish MKR via a flawed flap/buy mechanism only to feel good when we know the flop mechanism is not just seriously flawed but an existential threat.   This is like cutting off your arm and your foot while trying to build a house.   Why not keep and use the ARM and the FOOT and build a better house using them together. Last note.  Everyone is focused on fixing the flapper,  is the flopper rate limited? ",

From what I understand, the factors causing Black Thursday have been somewhat mitigated with modified liquidation mechanics and the emergency shutdown module.  Theoretically if you have liquidation ratios set correctly, an event like Black Thursday shouldn\u2019t happen right?  Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the only way to have a gap is if prices drop quickly enough that collateral can\u2019t be liquidated quickly enough? I understand the wariness based on history and so I\u2019m not arguing against completely stopping the flow of funds toward the surplus buffer.  I\u2019m just asking for some kind of partial burn as we have been doing.  I\u2019m also not happy with the fact that the SB doubles as a slush fund for ever increasing expenses.

Look debate what might cause a hole in the Surplus (lots of ways btw).   My main point is we already have data based on a real market event that showed us - even in a well capitalized situation - how horrible flopping MKR was.   Maker had to pause auctions and co-ordinate players with liquidity just to make sure there were MKR bids for 6M to feed those flop auctions and it crushed the MKR price by ~50% causing a 300M cap loss. Look I came to Maker because I thought the flop/flap model in the whitepaper was novel.  Now after seeing it function, and how these markets react, I think Maker can do much better.  Surplus here isn\u2019t even 1% the total DAI in circulation and barely over 2% of the MKR paying stability fees.   My point is that if we look at the (yes single data point) flopping to cover losses it is really, REALLY bad for Maker and flapping really appears to have no correlation to MKR price. Honestly better if we throw MKR and DAI at v2 or v3 LP and earn fees while setting up liquidity backstops for people to sell (or buy) than to burn here because we need liquidity to have any hope of selling MKR if we ever needed to flop.     Traster_Tray:  I\u2019m also not happy with the fact that the SB doubles as a slush fund for ever increasing expenses.   Totally agree with the \u2018increasing expenses\u2019 part.     Traster_Tray:  I worry that a larger SB discourages fiscal restraint.   Given the great returns this year and the formal switch out from Foundation to a real DAO I expected this.  But I also expected, and I am already beginning the reign in on these rapidly growing expenses. . Rest assured I and other delegates are paying attention to this.     Traster_Tray:  As for throwing funds toward an AMM, the method @brianmcmichael is proposing seems to be similar except it doesn\u2019t try to play the other side of selling mkr low. This is more in line with the burn philosophy which says I am always buying because I believe that I will continue growing and be worth more in the future.   IMHO.  I am more for putting up liquidity generally and earning the DAO fees doing it.  MakerDAO and MKR holders need to get over this love affair with removing MKR supply and not putting our hard earned DAI to work in such a way as to provide a real backstop to the system via accumulation of assets we can borrow against.   Once the DAO is well positioned with various backstops and we have sufficient capital to fund continuing operations and really grow this thing we can get back to burning MKR.    Today we are burning MKR with DAI that we really need to backstop risk on growth Frankly this whole discussion is moot because unless we start burning up via liquidations our users collateral to earn liquidation fees even turning on lerping isn\u2019t going to do much and it basically is a waste of DAI.  I want to be clear here.  In my own view Maker by throwing away DAI to burn some MKR is shooting itself in the growth foot forcing Maker to limp along for a few DAI wasting time losing market share    Right now it might not be obvious that exchanging 40M DAI for 20K MKR might make the difference between Maker being 100B in 2 years vs. 20B, but this is exactly how fast growing companies grow they put every piece of cash on hand to grow business now, so that later after 10x or 100x growth they will have more than ample revenues to reward shareholders with dividends or buybacks. I hope in short order for us to see why 5-10 or even 20M DAI can really make a difference to how to supercharge Maker\u2019s growth path. ",

If enough voices are ignored when decisions are made, people will question whether the DAO is truly as decentralized as it is presented to be.  Based on the comments on this thread, the 8% of mkr voting yes just doesn\u2019t feel representative.  I\u2019m trying hard not to insinuate anything but could there be a bias toward a larger surplus buffer, the more integrated and involved one is with governance? ",

Now after seeing it function, and how these markets react, I think Maker can do much better.   Indeed, that\u2019s how I see it. The Maker can develop a better mechanism than the original, but it must be seriously discussed and well communicated. Switching the burner on and off is not a long term solution, it creates uncertainty. Currently, the burner is the only mechanism by which the MKR owners are rewarded by the protocol, because burning the MKR increases their share of the protocol. Everyone seems to agree that MKR has been underperforming for quite some time, while revenues are riding a roller coaster these days, which doesn\u2019t really support the price of MKR.

Although many users joined because Maker pioneered the burn mechanic, it is time to focus on growing the SB so that MakerDAO can once again be a pioneer in DeFi. For example, as the Starknet CU already recommended, we need to enlarge the surplus buffer to deploy on Starknet and other L2s. It\u2019s currently too small to do that efficiently:  starkware1652\u00d7324 90.9 KB  Deploying these scaling solutions is inevitable, and we\u2019d be wise to prioritize doing this quickly and safely as the ecosystem continues to grow in this direction. It also goes for alternative L1s such as Avalanche, which recently passed 1B DAI because of the high demand for DAI there. That\u2019s just one aspect, which a larger SB can provide fuel for all types of growth ventures that is in dire need at Maker. Take it from Ox; let\u2019s stop burning and beef up that buffer. ",

                    "content": " Overview With the executive vote that got scheduled yesterday we are going to have the Surplus Buffer set to 250 MM so no further burning will happen anytime soon (discussion). This has been done as a counteraction of the events of last friday and is meant as a short term fix. @hexonaut from the Protocol Engineering Team already has drafted a more sustainable solution that has the potential to be activated on mainnet soon. This will introduce rate limiting into the flapper, limiting the number of parallel auctions. However, multiple ideas of how to replace the current Flapper have been floating around in the past. This Signal Request is about to find out if we  want to keep the Surplus Buffer at a level that prevents MKR burning and come up and implement a totally different solution (dutch auctions, other adjustments to the Flapper like adding a minimum price\u2026) before going back to burning (Do Nothing) want to get back to the previous decided path of lerping up the Surplus Buffer to 90 MM by 1 MM every week (discussion) - but also adding the above patch to the Flapper (Apply Rate Limiting and get back to burning asap)   Option 1: Do Nothing - Prevent Burning This would be done by just keeping the Surplus Buffer at a really high level, making it highly unlikely that the System Surplus spilling over the Surplus Buffer. No actions need to be taken, but we might need to increase the Surplus Buffer in the future. This is the option if you don\u2019t want a short term fix to be applied on the current MKR burn mechanics but instead wait for a more long term solution (dutch auctions, replacing the mechanism entirely with something totally different, \u2026.)  Pros  Avoid auctioning MKR with the potential for high slippage. all income will flow into the System Surplus, pilling up a high buffer for bad debt on the protocol   Cons  No more MKR burning until we have a replacement implementation in place During a market decline, the burn feature causes demand on buying MKR (and destroying MKR) to support the price. Indirectly this protects the hat as the economic price for a governance attack is elevated. suspending the MKR burn for a long term will also return less value for MKR holders as there is no intrinsic MKR-demand by protocol   Option 2: Introduce Rate Limiting to the Flapper This would modify the Flapper-Contract by introducing a rate limit so we can control the amount of parallel running flap-auctions. If we generate a lot of unforseen income (through e.g. liquidations), we will still have the same amount of flap-auctions, but they would be spread over a longer time instead of happening simultaneously. The likelihood for 0-bids is thereby reduced. There is already a Pull Request on the Flapper open by @hexonaut - the changes are pretty simple. After the changes have been applied to the mainnet contracts, we would reactivate the previously installed SB-lerp so we would continue with the path we took before the urgency exec. This option does not limit our future options to go for dutch auctions or other improvements in the long run.  Pros  can bring the burning back online rather soon compared to other solutions while mitigating the 0-bid problems we encountered in the past if we run into a large wave of liquidations, the System Surplus will get large and not get melted down instantly - providing a larger buffer in case we run into bad debt for the protocol   Cons  we will still keep a decent amount of discount for keepers (historically between 3-4%) as the Flapper cannot be as efficient as e.g. dutch auctions   How shall we move on with the deactivated Flapper?     Do nothing - let\u2019s not burn any more MKR until we have a long term solution in place Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper and bring back MKR burning asap Abstain     0 voters      Next steps The Polls will run until 2022-02-04T14:00:00Z; its outcomes will either result in an on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results is going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

I honestly want to see some fraction of DAI going to MKR flapping go to building an oracle ETH treasury which can be drawn on by Oracle team or any other team that needs ETH for expenses.   If the ETH treasury fills up just send the DAI to the MKR flapper.   MKR flapping should also have a % burn component.  Meaning we should not burn ALL the MKR flapped.  We need to start saving this for vesting.   While I want to see the flap return.   I want to see us taking DAI to manage known expenses.  ETH for oracles is a high expense that isn\u2019t going to go away.   Right now I would be happy to return to a rate limited dutch auction flapping model IF it basically takes E% to buy ETH for protocol use MV% to buy MKR for vesting MB% to burn MKR E+MV+MB = 1 Everyone wants to get back to some burning.  Personally I would rather take the MKR slated for burn (MB) and add another component MU% which takes some percentage of MKR slated for burn and pairs it with DAI and drops it into the Uniswap v2 MKR-DAI contract.  This would start building a liquidity base for MKR-DAI trading on uniswap and earn governance a return based on fees.  More on the importance of this MKR-DAI liquidity to the protocol at another time. ",

From a technical perspective I don\u2019t think this is really related.     ultraschuppi:  This option does not limit our future options to go for dutch auctions or other improvements in the long run.   For sure the pressure on Liq2 for flap will be higher if we do not burn at all - but the real question is: do we want to invest engineering capacity on this topic now or later. We do not have any idea on a potential timeline for dutch auctions or even an idea on the effort side for additions like proposed by @MakerMan . Those are key information needed to make a decision. Also one of the key factors is initiative:     So is someone going to say anything about yesterday's FLAP auctions? Miscellaneous       There should probably be an org-wide postmortem on the process failures that led to this, and I don\u2019t want to jump the gun too much with my own perspective here. But since I\u2019m apparently writing this post anyway: the risk of this sort of event has been known for a long time and repeatedly brought up, particularly but not exclusively by members of the Risk and PE teams. We got into a \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d scenario where a subset MKR holders strongly wished to continue burning in the short term, \u2026     Nobody has been pushing really really hard on doing something about the current state of MKR-buyback. At least not hard enough to really enforce a change of direction or to clarify we are not changing it. This consensus building is hard work, and even if multiple people say something needs to be done initiatives tend to fizzle out. Over the course of all the Surplus Buffer increases multiple parties have been complaining about governance overhead and we need to fix that - but the preMIP discussion on setting up an IAM for it did not get a lot of traction. I really cannot emphasize this more: Initiative is key and since we are navigating in a complex system it is hard to fight all the fires at once. This Signal Request is explicitly not about a long term discussion. I just want to push an initiative that a lot of people have been asking for: lets continue the burn, but reduce the risk of high discounts or even 0-bids. I do believe we can have this with Option 2.

                    "content": "I am voting do nothing because I think a robust long term solution is more valuable than short term burn, even at great prices. Getting carried awat by burn FOMO can lead to poor decision making. Particularly, I think if we go back to burning, we are unlikely to address improving the burner in the future, and this will be a lost opportunity. Firstly, I don\u2019t believe there is much point in trying to speculate about the market price or the best timings to burn, since markets are impossible to predict. There is just as much potential upside as there is downside with burning a little bit later down the line, as far as price movement goes. The current system, as well as the dutch auction system is not a good fit for a burn mechanism is my opinion for the following reasons:  Unnecessary excess gas costs (both for protocol and for network) Unnecessary keeper overhead Unnecessary oracle overhead Unnecessary slippage risk  Excess surplus can be lerped into a continous DAI liquidity pool that offers swaps at a fixed price. The price can be automated by targeting market price periodically, or decided manually by executive vote. This already greatly reduces oracle usage. Instead of having to kick and deal for every 30K dai lot, an arbitrageur can take bites off the liquidity pool at any size, by calling a single function. This reduces keeper overhead and removes time sensitivity in upkeep of the burn mechanism. This also allows market makers to burn MKR as fast as possible when the price is right, giving the protocol more efficient access to capital. The currently proposed fix slows things down considerably. This would be even faste rthan dutch auctions. English auctions have a built in slippage of 3-4%, while dutch auctions have a timer that increases the slippage the longer keepers take to act. This is important for vault liquidations because we need to offload risky debt as fast as possible. For burning surplus cash, this is completely unnecesary complexity that introduces systematic risk for no good reason. If we pick a fixed price close to market periodically, then of course volatility can deal against us and carry virtual slippage too, but there is symetric upside to this downside, and for all practical purposes, these outcomes will always be random in aggregate. The built in slippage on both auction mechanisms on the othe hand is systematic negative slippage. Paying oracles on a per lot basis to give the most up to date price does not really provide us with any protection to these random market movements thus it is a waste of gas and bad for the whole Ethereum ecosystem. Let\u2019s try to be more focused on the long term approach! ",

This was last proposed a couple of months ago and my opinion on why we should not do it is here.   I agree with you if the ETH price rises - maybe (provided we don\u2019t liquidate all the rest of our collateral) the protocol will be earning more DAI, but with that same DAI would be buying less ETH for gas.   The model proposed above doesn\u2019t speculate on prices it takes part of the burn profits and automatically uses them to buy something Maker is going to need probably forever, gas for operations.  IF for any reason Maker doesn\u2019t have DAI it could have the above ETH as a emergency treasury buffer for operations. The above model if implemented would be automatic and only use excess profits - just like the burn does.   It would be fully automated as well with flow control. I can understand the lash back that we don\u2019t have engineering to do this currently.   Honestly when liq2.0 was being discussed it was my assumption this would be applied to the flap and flop.  It hasn\u2019t and looks like probably won\u2019t be.   Maker lost $2M by estimates that value alone could have funded another small engineering team for 1/2-1 year. Frankly we could avoid this all together and simply have the TechOps team have a market operations group that has DAI they get via governance slated for ETH and MKR buyback and then we don\u2019t have to do one thing except raise the SB to infinity and turn off the flapper and flopper permanently. If the issue here is expediency and simplicity (which I would hazard isn\u2019t the real issue) then just switch the management of DAI profits to governance to allot DAI profits out of the SB for various buy strategies and then let a market Techops team execute the strategy.  We will be paying for them to man operations 24/7/365 and the SB itself will be a permanent DAI war chest that has no holes in it and we never have to worry about the flapper or flopper ever again. I mean if it is cheaper to have people do things than to write good smart contracts, lets pay people to act like software since it is cheaper and easier.   I thought the point here was to have a real discussion of the issues and to solve them once and for all.  If the dominant issue here is manpower well hell we can solve that, if the issue is software we can solve that too.   But whenever anyone suggest an idea that might make some sense to have push back because of lack of technical manpower.  AS a current operations specialist in EVERY operation I have ever witnessed (hundreds now) we ALWAYS have then put people in charge of process, even if it means every hour they have to empty the water buckets on leaks just to keep operations going. The reasons a operating facility couldn\u2019t properly fix the problem, lack of supplies, manpower, inability to access didn\u2019t matter.  We still looked at what the real solution could look like and then threw what we could at the time at that problem and simultaneously sought the best, most efficient and robust long term solutions that could be implemented when resources permitted. I voted NO on this because if manpower is the real issue lets just raise the SB to infinity, effectively disabling the flapper since governance can always take DAI assign TechOps to the problem of buy back and let them go at it via a defined strategy later.   We don\u2019t need to apply one single manhour of tech to this problem at this time. ",

Yes, but if ETH price falls, you\u2019d have overpaid for ETH that has been stockpiled. Buying now instead of buying in the future is profitable if future prices are higher and loss-making if the future prices are lower. We won\u2019t know which way it will play out  - hence my characterization of this as equivalent to speculating on ETH prices in the future. We don\u2019t need to make these bets because our profit model doesn\u2019t require us to.     MakerMan:  IF for any reason Maker doesn\u2019t have DAI it could have the above ETH as a emergency treasury buffer for operations.   This is effectively partitioning the surplus buffer into two parts and storing the emergency part in ETH. You may as well leave the \u201cemergency buffer\u201d in DAI. If the price of ETH sharply goes up, we will not be in any trouble - quite the opposite actually, we\u2019d see the SB grow more quickly due to increasing revenues even if we spend more on gas! On the other hand, if ETH crashes to $90 or something ridiculous again, leaving the emergency funds in DAI ensures that operations run without problems because we pay our salaries in DAI, not ETH, and gas costs for the oracles are cheaper if we keep our funds in DAI while ETH is crashing.     MakerMan:  I can understand the lash back that we don\u2019t have engineering   Sorry, maybe my post above wasn\u2019t clear but I meant to say that this doesn\u2019t make sense to do, even if we could implement this without additional engineering cost.

                    "content": "I\u2019m deeply troubled by the reluctance shown by some in this thread to quickly implement a solution and return the surplus buffer to where it was prior to enacting the urgent executive. My first concern is that this sets the precedent that any urgent or emergency executive will not only have to be evaluated on the merits of if it can fix the immediate situation, but it must also be evaluated with an assumption that this represents a permanent change. It is also hard to see how this will not slow down the process due to the need to more stringent evaluate the proposal put forth. How this does not run contrary to the very idea of having urgent or emergency executives is beyond me. My second concern is how this will affect MKR holder confidence in MakerDAO. We have already rattled that confidence by needing to enact an urgent measure. If we now fail to quickly normalize the situation that is bound to further erode that confidence. As an illustration I present the following picture:  Confidence loss965\u00d7307 23.5 KB  I would also ask why MKR is the one token not that is not part of the rally that is happening in crypto today.     Derek:   The rate limiter could be in an executive within weeks. A long-term solution that implements a dutch auction-style mechanism would likely be 2-3 months at a minimum (coding>review>audits>economic modelling>governance).    Introducing a rate limiter and restoring the surplus buffer to previously agreed levels is a solution to the immediate problem, that also gives us added protection in a mass liquidation event. Waiting for the perfect solution that is at least several months away is going back on previously signaled intentions, harmful to our reputation and not a good way to show that we\u2019re a reliable partner. To illustrate I refer to the following reddit thread. Here we can see the sentiment are divided between those who are confident we will bring the burn back shortly and those who have given up the protocol in disgust because we delayed or turned off the burn in the past. The following post is a nice summary:  But hey, maybe that\u2019s just the folks over at reddit. They don\u2019t don\u2019t really interact with Maker do they? What about those that are here. What are they passionate about?  Maker passion820\u00d7275 19.2 KB   Maker passion2803\u00d7174 6.34 KB  If we intend to turn MakerDAO into a institutional player, by and for the big boys, turning off the burn is a great way forward. However that doesn\u2019t taste all that much of decentralized finance to me. I think another factor that tends to get overlooked in regards to discussions about burning is that one of the largest MKR holders in existence is MakerDAO itself. Any price appreciation also helps improving our second line of defense. Every $1 of gain on the MKR price increases our ultimate reserve by $83802. In short. Even having the discussion to turn off the burn is harmful to Maker\u2019s reputation and any doubt that it will be turned back shortly will only cause further harm. ",

The emergency executive was very clear that stopping flaps is a temporary measure to prevent another situation with a large number simultaneous surplus auctions. Once that issue is mitigated with a flap rate limiter, the clear implication is to revert back to the previous course. That means returning the surplus buffer to where it would have been, and continue raising it by 1m/wk up to 90m. The emergency action shouldn\u2019t be a backdoor path to pausing flap auction indefinitely. ",

It is neatly put together, well explained, and fun to play around with. I would not be surprised if I am not the only one who is newly interested in this project because of that website. Given that, turning off burn makes the website boring again. A lot of the people in this project are super conservative, responsible, disciplined, etc etc. And while those are extremely valuable traits to have in something as important as a CDP system, just a little bit of sexiness would change a lot in terms of keeping the brand of MKR relevant and popular in DeFi. If nothing else, burn and makerburn.com is just enough sexiness to keep new blood like myself coming in. It\u2019s almost funny how so much else of the MKR system is explicitly anti-hype. The low supply and high token price does not give MKR any unit bias as most other projects benefit from. Very few noobs will ever buy (and followingly learn about) MKR because of its price. Additionally, while I love the burn mechanic, MKR\u2019s market cap actually DROPS as it burns and so it will continually filter down coinmarketcap and coingecko and go further into being forgotten and unknown. Top that off with the relative complexity of how it works, and it is very hard to bring in new interest. Burns and makerburn.com make MKR sexy again. I think it would be helpful if folks in the community give some deference to the fact that the crypto market is still dominated by hype and if your project doesn\u2019t bring the hype, then it could easily be left behind. Too much sexiness and the normal list of DeFi game theory tricks like the ones employed by other projects is not what I\u2019m advocating for. But a little bit of that stuff backed by sober and boring discipline? Yea, that\u2019s a good balance. A lot of the posts in this thread revolve around the efficacy of the burn in economic terms and in risk terms, but an arguably more imporant topic is how the burn impacts interest in this project, garners attention in the DeFi world, and how it may bring in the next generation of Core Members, Delegates, Influencers, Developers, Partnership makers, etc. Two cents from someone who has been outside of the MKR community bubble for the last few years.

And to be honest if 500 MKR would have been sent to the burner this afternoon, I highly doubt such actions would have had an impact positive, or negative on the price of MKR. I believe the price action of MKR is not necessarily dictated by burning tokens. See price action from December 2020 to May 2021 versus the number of tokens burned.   Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post. Regarding your first point about the price action I think that might be a result of looking at the prices at different times of the day. My post was written prior to the Fed scaring the markets. At the time MKR was the only one down. As for sending 500MKR to the burner. I don\u2019t belive the primary price action comes from the act of burning by itself (even though you\u2019d be very hard pressed not to notice that effect on Friday 21.) but rather from the markets expecting a burn. If you look at Friday the 21. you can see the MKR/ETH chart starting to tilt heavily in MKRs favor even before Maker started burning. That is because the market is forward looking. It reacts to information. So when we start to discuss raising the surplus buffer or stopping burning the markets reacts. Similarly they start to anticipate the burn before it happens. The more we disappoint market expectation the harder it will be for good news to raise MKR price and the easier for bad news to tank it. That is why I\u2019m not advocating an uncontrolled burning, but rather a steady, efficient and above all, predictable burn. MKR holders need to be confident that Maker is going to keep their word and return value to the holders. As for the article linked. I agree with its definition of MKR as a captial token. At its core MKR provides two things, a proportional right to influence Maker decisions and a proportional right to the profits of Maker DAO. However, right now, the burn mechanism is the only part that ensures that profit is returned to MKR holders. Once that link is broken all you\u2019re left with is a proportional share of Maker influence and a vague hope that one day value will be returned. With governance being as concentrated as it is, you\u2019re basically putting your faith in a very few individual that they will look after your interests unless you happen to have enough MKR tokens to be able to influence Maker governance yourself. The majority of MKR holders are not interested in governance, they are interested in their share of the profits. A lack of burn makes their shot at that an open question. Finally, Maker can at any time mint more MKR tokens if it chooses to do so. That is one way to raise capital if it is needed. I see a lot of arguments for using the surplus buffer for growth but very little concrete suggestions about what that growth looks like. We have 20+ core units by now. I\u2019ve never seen a core unit suggestion turned down due to a lack of funds. I\u2019ve yet to see a vault denied due to a surplus buffer too low. Right now our growth is not constrained by lack of capital, but lack of manpower. Besides, any investment Maker makes in growth must have an expected return on investment greater than the average Maker does today to make any sense. Otherwise we should return the excess capital to investors. The best way to do so is through the burn mechanic. ",

Now that we have makerburn.com, the anticipation of burn events is becoming much more widely disseminated and known. The price spike on the 21st left MKR as the ONLY green coin in the top 100 on coinmarketcap that day\u2026 it gave MKR potential momentum it hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.

Maker growing in value and utility is ofcourse important but without a mechanism to let the community directly take part of it, less exciting. Any price increase is based on speculation of future burns in such a scenario. The longterm solution should be to go back to burning MKR efficently. While at the same time provide all the funding necessary for further developments and growth. I dont see any problems with how it went, over the past year. Funding was there and the Buffer grew and a bit of MKR were burned. Only the efficency of the burn during mass liquidations is questionable. This should be improved. ",

Please move over here for further discussions:     [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Part II Signal Requests   Overview We have had some interesting weeks regarding the System Surplus Buffer and before going into the details of this Signal Request I would like to give a brief overview of the events:   In late November, an executive passed to slowly increase the Surplus Buffer from 60MM to 90MM by 1MM a week with the intention to burn a bit of the revenues while constantly increasing the System Surplus. You can find the corresponding onchain poll here, and the previous Signal Request here  On 2022-01-21T\u2026     ",
