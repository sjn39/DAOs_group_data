The input from this call can either be turned into CVCs that organize within the long term boundaries of the Maker Constitution, or be turned into MIP102 edit proposals to the Maker Constitution or the Scope Frameworks that can make more impactful changes in the short run. Link to join the call: Launch Meeting - Zoom The call is open for everyone to join, ask questions etc, just like all the other Endgame calls, but the intention is to prioritize regular MKR holders so they have a chance to get heard.

                    "content": "Notes I had going into the meeting. Voter Committee Meetings (covered in meeting)  Maybe not the right person to make this point, haven\u2019t been present. Don\u2019t seem to have involved much debate, back-and-forth, discussion, etc. Usually we trial things before ratifying them. DVCs-as-a-trial haven\u2019t really been what they were planned to be. How can we avoid the same outcome for CVC meetings?  Suggest structures in advance? Ensure they have clear agendas?    Reputation/Numbers/Adoption  (covered in meeting)  Many roles in Endgame are \u2018fire-walled\u2019 and participants in one cannot take part in another. Maker\u2019s reputation might be at an all time low with much of the ecosystem. Even aside from recent bad press, generally speaking, it\u2019s never had a great reputation, or put much effort into changing that. I\u2019m not sure we should be confident that we\u2019ll have enough skilled applicants for all of the positions that are required by the endgame structure. I\u2019m not sure we should be confident that subDAO tokens will be worthwhile to keep given the lack of reputation and confidence held by Maker. To rectify, we should perhaps start:  Producing value for the wider ecosystem where appropriate. Begin working more actively with other members of the ecosystem. Defining and Publicizing roles more actively.    EtherDAI  Is EtherDAI still a thing? If so, how will EtherDAI vaults be incentivized given they are not receiving subDAO token farming rewards, and under most designs, Maker keeps the staking revenue from the underlying liquid staking tokens?  Clarity Around Phases Please try to provide clear explanations of phases such that we can more effectively communicate and spread information.  At one point we had many phases, and it was reasonably clear what happened in which phase. But this has been simplified with the introduction of the Constitution. Not a problem that its changed, but at this point I don\u2019t think the phases and their contents are written down anywhere. This is a problem because whenever information is communicated about the endgame plan, it is extremely difficult to determine to which phase it belongs. This creates confusion and makes it extremely hard to document. Impossible to know what\u2019s supposed to be in place for which phase.  Collaboration In a general sense, this process of implementing endgame can be more collaborative.  If you can provide clear expectations of what is being discussed when (in advance), then you create the opportunity for collaboration around it. If you can provide a written version of what you want to discuss in advance, you give people the chance to read it, think about it, and come to the discussion with useful input. If you can delegate \u2018edit access\u2019 more explicitly, then you can improve the rate at which improvements happen. Stuff like: \u201cI know this scope needs work, I would love to see proposed amendments for cycle x.\u201d If you can focus attention more intentionally and narrowly on a specific topic at a given time, that may invite more useful input.
