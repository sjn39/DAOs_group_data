                    "content": "Hi Everyone, Currently the DSR is set to 0.01% and the protocol has approx. 800MM of USDC / other stablecoins in the system. In parallel, we are seeing significant expansion of the ETH-A/B/C Vaults. Further, we have Real World Assets coming online as a seeming drumbeat of new DAI. While USDC / stablecoins still exist in the system, from my lens, I believe we should start a \u201ctwist\u201d of monetary policy of both increasing the DSR to encourage savings of DAI (and thus reducing the circulating supply) and also routinely increasing it incrementally (probably on a quarterly basis). The net effect of a ratcheting effect (increasing) on the DSR mixed with new DAI from Real-World Asset should cause a new allocation of \u201csavers\u201d that use DAI as an alternative to the banking sector. Further, the more we ratchet up the DSR, the closer we start to rate-match the existing banking sector AND then surpass it. The above \u201ctwist\u201d is a medium-term horizon plan (over the course of the coming months / year) that should ideally continue until the DSR is well above 150bps (maybe even 200bps). Benefits of increasing the DSR: Attract a new sector of DAI savers (and finding a home for all of the new DAI) Start to rate-match the existing banking sector all while having a minimal impact to the surplus buffer To help provide a clear signal, please try to vote in all of the below polls.     Should we increase the DSR (in general)?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters         If you voted yes in the above poll, should we continually ratchet-up the DSR in small increments?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters         If you voted yes to increase the DSR, do you support a current increase to 25bps (so a net increase of 24bps)?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      If you voted no, please reply in the thread below to start the discussion and help identify consensus on when / how much an amount would be (informally) so a substitute signal request may be structured. This poll will run until Monday May 15. If a majority of forum voters (excluding abstain voters) support changing the the DSR, I\u2019ll follow up with an on chain governance poll for the selected parameter update. ",

I would prefer to increase the DSR to 2% directly. Better PR impact and Business Dev have signed some partnerships that kick in when we have a 2% DSR. We need to have a real strategy. i.e. we need to push CHAI. Provide liquidity for that. Interface it on 1inch.  It\u2019s a lot of money.

I\u2019m currently working on thinking about how much liquidity we need (but we have too much that quite sure) and what liquidity means. Then I want to touch on a steablecoin clearinghouse idea that might increase DAI demand and put DAI on the top of the stablecoin hierarchy (because what else?). Actually, DSR is always present. If there is a strong sentiment on increasing DSR, I sure will prioritize accordingly. Fat margins are temporary, we will have to increase the DSR anyway. Doing it preventively might be smart for growth, but maybe not today. ",

Please show me the data that stablecoins are exiting the system because I am not seeing this. PSM still exists and is open.   This is my primary beef here is that the PSM for PEG management completely mucks up the proper behavior between SF and DSR.   I can\u2019t get a clear handle on demand and supply because of this except by looking at other market rates for DAI supply. DAI return >2% can be had elsewhere, compound, AAVE, DYDX, etc. etc\u2026 (which is also driving demand - is even 2% going to compete and even if it did all this is going to do is drive DAI demand upward).  One thing I don\u2019t think people realize and this is because we are basically leaving the PSM DAI price liquidity downside open with full liquidity at a single price is that it might be nice to have some USDC in reserve in case DAI demand dries up over a short period of time and that 500M is eaten overnight. Sure we can raise SF to sop up demand but borrowers have to be able to unwind to take advantage of this.  Once this PSM USDC backing dries up it is a free fall DAI PEG to downside unless people have USDC or other assets they want to sell to buy DAI.    Which is another reason not to SF bully our USDC LP providers - they may end up being a significant backstop to DAI price dropping - where as RWA and other borrowers may not find themselves in positions to significantly sop up DAI liquidity.
