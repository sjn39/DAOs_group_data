We\u2019re going to be creating a custom site design for you that we hope will represent your subject and we want you all to really love it. You\u2019ve been waiting almost 5 years and we really want to do this well. To facilitate this, we\u2019re reaching out now to ask you for what you\u2019d really love to see in the design and logo. [\u2026] As I\u2019ve mentioned already, we need some inspiration from you so that we can get started on this design and create something you\u2019ll really be proud of. So far, I was able to find a couple of older discussions about logos and site designs here on Meta. Feel free to reference them if there are ideas you like already - or give us new ones! We\u2019re really looking for design ideas rather than needing you to design anything for us.  If you feel inspired and also believe that the Stack Exchange community is an important cornerstone of the Ethereum developer community, please assist the Stack Exchange staff brainstorming an amazing Ethereum-based site theme.   ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com       Custom Ethereum design and logo - Information gathering   discussion, featured, design     asked by           Piper      on 07:00PM - 18 May 22 UTC       ",
