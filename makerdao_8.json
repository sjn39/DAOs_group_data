Yes, Maker is the OG in DeFi, but Maker is also continuously innovating, bringing what\u2019s next\u2026 Then why no one is talking about it? Growth follows the partnership strategy created by Greg on the Foundation times, in my opinion, it is the right way to go for a protocol like Maker, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow the natural crypto-path with shitposters everywhere, a CT army, and a broader community creating and propagating content. When working with a partner we can rely on their marketing resources, but we have to follow their guidelines to merge Maker inside their vision. And sometimes Maker needs its own voice. And that\u2019s why from Growth we have been thinking about how to solve it. We will be helping BanklessDAO to create a proposal that will bring to Maker a team that will help us to create and propagate the Maker message.  Collateral offboarding. Our recommendation to the community is to not offboard LRC. Loopring team is using the vault and also during late Q4, they will launch EthPort, which will provide cheap L2-L1 composability. This will allow users to interact with Maker directly from Loopring L2. Once integrated, LRC holders (as well as ETH, USDC, and WBTC) would be able to open a Maker vault and we think this will increase LRC vault usage.  Voting Delegation. We joined forces with the DUX team and started having conversations with the main custodial solutions to integrate the Voting Delegation system to increase participation in the Maker governance.

That\u2019s why (as we have mentioned in the past) other DeFi platforms are pointing their efforts towards the inclusion of Institutions. Implementing Institutional Vaults and Long term Vaults proposal will allow us to attract TradFi companies to the protocol. Still, the problem is that most of them need to KYC an entity. At the moment, we are having conversations with different companies interested in being the entity that uses Maker to give loans to their Institutional users. One of these companies is Nexo, and they will be the first user of the Institutional Vaults, with an implementation that satisfies their compliance requirements. Still, to maintain the decentralized spirit of the DAO, we are inviting others to create their version. It will take time and won\u2019t be as efficient as if we make a unique framework for everyone, but that\u2019s the challenge of all DAOs :).  PAX PSM     Create a PAX PSM Proposal Ideas   @Growth-Core-Unit wants to put this proposal up for a vote on Monday 16th as part of the weekly polls.

The partnership between Buenbit and Maker showed us the power of working with our strategic partners to integrate the Maker Protocol in a way that makes sense for the partner and the market they want to target. After 2 years since we started working with Buenbit, they created the right product for countries (mainly in LatAm for now) that find in Dai a solution for saving their money and in Buenbit a bank-like solution. Without Buenbit it wouldn\u2019t be possible to reach the +500k users that are converting their salary in Dai, keeping their Dai in their Buenbit account earning a 12% APY, and using the BuenBit Mastercard card to pay for their expenses (converting a part of their Dai savings into pesos). To replicate this experience we started to work with imToken, with them, we are thinking in the best product that imToken+Maker can offer to the Chinese market, and from this week to the end of the year we have planned a series of campaigns to increase Dai awareness among their users (+1M).    imToken Fans \u2013 19 Aug 21    #7 AMA| Dai \u4f60\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3 MakerDAO Hello ImToken and Tokenlon users, thanks for joining the AMA session.

Following @ultraschuppi recommendation, they are proposing similar parameters, and they also will add Dai\u2019s support in their platform by the end of Q1 2022 (if not sooner). @Growth-Core-Unit  recommendation for the community is to not include any other stablecoin into the PSM unless they show interest in it and are willing to partner with the protocol. The PSM is a powerful DeFi use case for other stablecoins, and we are confident that after the inclusion of PAX others will be open for agreements with MakerDAO.  Collateral offboarding.
