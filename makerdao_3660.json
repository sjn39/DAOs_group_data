This is the best option in my mind because:  It allows participants to invest in their own decision before seeing the majority opinion. It prevents participants from voting with Foundation employees until after they have made their own decision. It allows participants to delegate if they want to, but it prevents delegation from becoming a default. It allows us to see who is voting against consensus and ask them to explain their point of view. This is essential to scientific governance and consensus seeking. If you are signalling for a thing, you should be able to explain your reasons for signalling for that thing and either convince others, or be convinced yourself.  This debate probably belongs in the Meta thread on signalling, I\u2019ll copy this there. ",

I also believe that, as a voting group, we are probably not going to vote to lower the ceiling unless something drastic happens, so why not be conservative and raise it to $120 (still a significant expansion of 20%).  We can always have another vote to raise when we need the $135-150 limits.  The only potential negative I can see to this strategy is that it does take extra cycles for everyone to vote, so consolidating all these steps into a single signal may be prudent. Either way, I also don\u2019t strongly believe anything bad will happen with a larger ceiling in the short term, just that I think going slower ultimately doesn\u2019t have to prevent us from ending up at the same place, while potentially lowering some risk along the way.

Without knowing/understanding what tasks are needed for dashboard to be finished, you can\u2019t really judge how close to release are we atm i think stability fee hikes will start to affect dai supply or at least significantly slow down the growth, but nevertheless, i don\u2019t think you can really predict any lulls in ether volatility (and consequently dai peg/price). i think mkr voters probably overshoot with the latest hike, but i also think overall ether sentiment is still bullish. I also think mkr whales showed determination to aggressively modify stability fee and they will continue to do so - i don\u2019t believe they will suddenly change their behavior. They will counter any sudden market events with their polling/executive voting.  I am also changing my signaling vote - to 95 mil threshold. I think debt ceiling limit hit likelihood is significantly diminished and priority should be allowing mkr voters to fine tune recent hikes. I expect them to lower the fee pretty quickly. ",
