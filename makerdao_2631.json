                    "content": "Hello! I recently came across snapshotlabs whilst participating in YAM governance  Snapshot allows for off-chain vote signaling.  It is 100% gasless.  Anyone can participate by creating proposals and voting for them. You are able to select start and stop times, as well as a block height which will be used to gather on-chain data for the front end (eg how much MKR you held at a given block).  I thought this could be helpful in giving some weight to forum polling and maybe replace on-chain polling, if the stars align .   High gas fees have been a deterrent for our current polling system, and it would allow for more MKR insight in our casual forum polls. It looks like Balancer and YFI are also using this tool.  So I thought we could start the conversation and see what questions would need answering for the Maker community to adopt off-chain signaling. I\u2019ve been chatting with Fabien in their discord, and invited him to help answer any questions we may have.

                    "content": "@Jtathmann with Snapshot there isn\u2019t any on-chain settlement, it\u2019s what we call soft-voting or vote signaling. The proposals and votes are just signed messages using the eth_sign format and stored on IPFS. The signed messages are made available for the user through the interface so that\u2019s easy for him to verify it. Here is an example of a signed message for vote on a Balancer governance proposal: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmeVwGtp4YxKaCGZM3jPSd7VKXTEAxXj74Xjnn1c8F4ifh You can copy paste the message payload here to verify it:    MyCrypto    MyCrypto MyCrypto is a free, open-source interface for interacting with the blockchain.      There isn\u2019t any smart contract risk because there isn\u2019t any smart contract. The result of the proposal votes is easy to verify and hard to contest. We use a server that we call \u201chub\u201d to upload user signed messages to IPFS. We also use it to store an index of IPFS hashes for all the proposals per tokens and all the votes per proposals on a database to make interface load faster. We plan on making it possible for anyone to run a hub but at the moment i would say that it\u2019s a point of centralization.  Also, am I thinking correctly that this will work even when tokens are deposited into our governance contract?  Currently votes will be considered if the voting address is also the address who hold MKR or a selected token. If the governance contract is holding the token for the users there might need some small change on Snapshot to make it work. ",

But because it\u2019s loaded in serie one by one, it might be very slow and not scale well when loading hundred of votes. B: The other option is to make it possible for anyone to run a hub. The hub db may not need to know ordering, its designed more like a graph database similar than IPFS. The client should have a way to set the hub url (or array of hub url) of his choice, and hubs should be able to talk to each others and stay sync. I could ask few protocols that are using Snapshot to run their own hub to keep some kind of trusted network. I would prefer go for plan B, the project Snapshot is very new there must be others options to explore, i\u2019m confident that with time we will be able to reduce that trust needed, happy to discuss if you have some suggestions or ideas.

If each investor have their own address we can imagine Coinbase custody enabling some kind of delegation to make the fund usable for vote on Snapshot. For multi-sig wallets we can imagine having a strategy that count a vote only if a multi-sig threshold is reached, or a way to delegate this ability to vote to a single address.

So we have a few options when it comes to integration. Paraphrasing from @jparklev :   Link directly to snapshot.page/maker . This however reduces the utility of the governance portal which isn\u2019t ideal as we don\u2019t want to further fragment the polling/exec voting of Maker Governance.  Embed an iFrame in the portal. Also not ideal due to double headers and potential for wallet connection issues.  Link directly to snapshot.page/maker while maintaining a read-only page on our portal. Our read-only page would reference poll statuses allowing users to link to and vote directly on snapshot.  Re-implement all the functionality in our own portal. We could fork and re-implement but would require work to stay up-to-date with enhancements.  Based on this, I feel like option 3, maintaining a read-only site with a link to voting on a poll in snapshot feels like a quality quick win, we would also look to become a hub/db host along with committing ranked choice voting enhancements to the broader community. One important note, we still need to determine if this solution will support custody solutions such as Coinbase and Anchorage, following which, I will respond and let the community decide on whether or not we proceed based on a signal poll. It is also worth mentioning, as you may be aware that internally we have been working on a batched polling solution that is weeks away from completion. Although a big improvement on what we have in production today, it is on-chain, so is not a free voting solution. We will continue to finish this work and have it as a complete but hidden on-chain fallback solution if it is ever needed, but for now with the pain-points around gas costs, the off-chain snapshot solution (with it\u2019s proof/signature solution) seems like a winner. I\u2019m keen to hear community thoughts and appetite. Thanks all. ",

A few points:  Discussion with Coinbase Custody confirmed that the implementation suggested during our discussion with Fabien can be supported. Good news! As you may know, a new portal will shortly be released with on-chain batched polling. This will reduce gas costs but not eliminate them to the degree of Snapshot, so it is reasonable to consider the batched solution an incremental yet temporary improvement in the lead-up to Snapshot. (This will live-on as a background fallback solution if ever needed). In order for Snapshot to function as part of Maker Polling, there is a need to develop ranked choice voting - which doesn\u2019t exist yet.  Therefore, summarising next steps:  If interested, the community should signal their interest to support a Snapshot solution as a replacement for on-chain polling. I would be happy to work with anyone from the community in adding any details required. I believe this should be a poll, but look towards @LongForWisdom for confirmation on this. If the above poll passes, I will work with the community to secure a developer (either in the foundation or externally, TBD) to develop Ranked Choice Voting so we get Snapshot capabilities on-par with current polling. A project would begin to integrate this with the existing Governance Portal*  *Small disclaimer - I can\u2019t commit to a delivery window just yet as the Foundation have a number of pre-existing initiatives like Liquidations2.0 that will require additional prioritisation discussions.
