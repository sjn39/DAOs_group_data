                    "content": "During yesterday\u2019s G&R Call the Community discussed raising the MKR needed to initiate Emergency Shutdown (ES), which is currently 50,000 MKR needed to trigger ES. The Community along with the Governance Facilitator agreed that we should raise that threshold to 75,000 MKR via Community Governance Voting. This morning I woke-up thinking about possible Attack Vectors, and one thought that came to my mind, in traditional financial markets\u2013how many Shares of PLCs are held by insiders in order to maintain control of their company? If Tesla had 1,000,000 outstanding shares, would you say that Elon Musk would only hold 7.5% of TSLA in order to protect his vision and keep the majority control of the company, or would you expect it to be much higher? Obviously the latter\u2013all Founders should maintain control of their companies in the early stages in order to fulfill their vision\u2013IMO. And yes, it feels almost impossible to buy 75,000 MKR in the open market. And yes, VCs, Whales, little fish, currently hold most of the outstanding MKR. I get that. But, what if a powerful intelligence Agency like the NSA wanted to put a dent in Decentralized Finance? With the run-up of MKR to 4,000 DAI, I reckon the NSA can Market Buy 75,000 MKR and drive the price up as high as they need to\u2013maybe at an average cost of 10,000 DAI ($750M). In 2020, the Annual Budget for the NSA was $541 BILLION. Do we think that the NSA can\u2019t use less than 1% of their annual budget to hamper the growth of DeFi and DAI? I pick the NSA because in my opinion regulators from the EU and North America have their plates full and are focus on other/many subject matters\u2013we also have some folks that are on our side (via lobbying) and care about the long-term outlook of this Tech. But for the NSA, protecting the integrity of the United States and the U.S. Dollar is priority #1 IMO. But perhaps I am wrong and spending 1 to 5 Billion to build 1,000 BOTS that will clog the Ethereum Chain and get Gas Fees to 5,000+ Gwei is just a bad nightmare I had\u2026 And maybe sending Notifications to large MKR Whales is as easy as 1, 2, and 3. At the end of the day, we can always Fork\u2013and start all over. But why start all over when we have gotten this far? Why taint such a beautiful painting? How much Insurance would you buy for your $2B painting?  I say, protect MakerDAO and think about if 75,000 MKR is enough to let you sleep well at night and avoid the type of nightmares that perhaps I am imagining\u2026 @Risk-Core-Unit @Protocol-Engineering ",

                    "content": "I have discussed this before.   In fact there was a group that was supposed to work on issues related to ES.  Conditions under which ES is warranted. Whether the ES itself is an attack vector Whether the system could be changed to be able to shut down or pause components.  My whole \u2018attack thesis\u2019 focused on DeFI having sufficient maturity that someone could first establish a sufficiently leveraged position to potentially benefit from ALL the assets in Maker being locked for a minimum of 24hrs and the market chaos that it would create. The point was that at the time it was not felt Maker had enough assets under management and DeFI itself was not robust enough to provide enough a sufficient profit potential.   The point here is that an ES flat out locks all assets within Maker for at least 24hrs AND to re-start the entire system assets have to be withdrawn from the first and put into the second.   If an actor (of any kind) could yield sufficient financial reward from doing this - they will. All of this relates to Maker itself being anti-fragile or not.    I did imagine that one of more governments has sufficient financial wherewithal to do this but I really was considering that any sufficiently financed actors (or group) could pull this off.   The real question is whether they could reap sufficient profits to compensate them for the lost value in MKR.    So far MKR MC is floating around the value of assets (currently around 3.2B MC on 3.x B in DAI or maybe 5B in assets).  50K MKR here is about 170M so someone would have to be able to position to make at least that (and my expectation is it would have to have potential to make 2-10x). It is a prime reason I wanted to make it so that to ES the system it had to be done with \u2018seasoned\u2019 MKR.     MKR seasoning proposal for system control access       Greetings Maker community.  There is a lot going on and my apologies to add but I wanted to get this idea off my plate for risk-governance consideration as well as community consideration.  There has been a lot of discussion about attack vectors in the Maker system.  I have in my own analysis identified two primary attack vectors that I outline quickly below.    General governance attack via obtaining sufficient MKR.   The first line of defense for the MCD here that has been recently enacted is \u2026     The idea was that someone would have to accumulate MKR and hold it in the system for some time before they could even execute this \u2018nuclear option\u2019 the hope being that any positional leveraged \u2018options\u2019 would either expire or be too costly to hold for the 1-4 weeks of \u2018seasoning\u2019 before it could even be executed. The other point here was a thought that Maker could get so large and so intertwined into DeFI that we should think about systemic \u2018halts\u2019 vs. full out locking assets with ES.   I believe we already have some functionality built in to halt the liquidation system for example, and means to throttle DAI generation with the way DC expansion is managed under the IAMs. I personally think some discussion about conditions on MKR to be able to ES the system is warranted as well as conceptually thinking about putting into place a systemic \u2018pause\u2019 vs. \u2018shutdown\u2019 so that once the system problem is corrected it can be \u2018restarted\u2019. Upping the amount of MKR from 50K to 75K imo really doesn\u2019t address the key issue.   All it does is lay on 50% more money someone would have to raise, and just a bit more MKR having to come out to play.   IF ES is necessary does 75K become more of a barrier to do it?    These are all important questions and as far as I can tell any discussions on these issues by the whale MKR holders are all behind the scenes.   Literally what is the minimum number of holders that can ES the system now, and what does this become if the amount is raised to 75K. ",
