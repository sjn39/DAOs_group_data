I couldn\u2019t understand 2 related things about DAI and would like to clarify before continuing my research. 1- Why does Maker Buffer even exist? So as far I read and understand, the sole reason there is a Maker Buffer is that if not enough DAI  raised in a liquidation event, Maker buffer is used to cover the remaining value. I think the reason DAI is selected(and not some other stable coin etc.) for the collateral auction is that, in that case protocol debt would just kept increasing the more unsuccessful auction happens. By using DAI for collateral auctions, you get rid of this problem because using DAI for collateral auctions essentially means \u201cminting DAI\u201d. Because all a liquidation event is unlocking the locked collateral without burning the original DAI that this collateral used to mint. Whoever got the collateral can just use it to mint DAI again. So there is 2 or more minting with the same collateral. And if enough DAI is raised, the DAI goes to the Maker buffer directly. Which just means it doesn\u2019t matter enough DAI raised or not, whatever DAI raised all goes to the Maker Buffer. You don\u2019t need to cover deficit in a liquidation event, because you actually just minting DAI to back the already minted DAI. Now, Maker Buffer has a limit and excess DAI burned after the limit through MKR tokens. So what I don\u2019t understand is, if a liquidation event is just minting DAI event and each minted DAI is more liability to the system, why not just burn the whatever DAI raised(minted) instead of keeping a portion of it in a buffer? 2- Why use MKR token to burn/mint DAI to regulate the Maker Buffer? Given that there is a buffer and excess is being burned, Why not just burn DAI itself instead of doing it through MKR token? ",

If Dai proceeds from auctions and Stability Fee payments exceed the Maker Buffer limit (a number set by Maker Governance), they are sold through a Surplus Auction. The way I understand this that DAI collected from auction goes to the Maker Buffer, and it is used to buy MKR tokens(see 2. question) which then burnt if the Maker Buffer limit exceeded. ",

I dont think what we do here is effective in any way.   I don\u2019t fully disagree with you. One problem is that any oversight powers you give can be a centralization risk. I think a better solution would be to have a unit tasked with oversight that reports regularly and publicly to token holders, that can then choose to act or not act on the provided information. I can\u2019t help you with many of the units, but for what it\u2019s worth, GovAlpha\u2019s expenses are all transparent. There is also an expenses dashboard that is attempting to mitigate the problem. You have to click through a bit to find expense reports, but they are there. I believe strategic finance and SES are attempting to unify the accounting and reporting practices that are used by each core unit. Standardization is a step in the right direction, I believe. To come back to your question of where the money is going, there is a breakdown by-core-unit here on makerburn, but there\u2019s no internal breakdown on spending there. At the least it can give you an idea of how much money goes where in terms of core units. ",
