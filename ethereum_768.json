                    "content": "I recently went back and listened to all the Core Dev calls that I could find in which ProgPow was discussed (call 38, and every call between 45-57 \u2013 let me know if I missed any) to understand the process by which we got to this point. These are the governance-related issues that I found most concerning: 1. There was an assumption from the beginning that it was appropriate for the Core Devs to horse trade with the GPU miners Core devs talked about giving miners ProgPow in exchange for them accepting the issuance reduction from 3 to 2. It seems far from obvious that this sort of thing is appropriate. I\u2019d guess that many in the community believe that GPU miners should not receive compensation from the network to \u2018offset\u2019 harms, but that we should instead only offer such compensation when it benefits the network as a whole. At the very least, if the network is to give out compensation like this it\u2019s something that more than just the Core Devs should decide. It\u2019s not a technical issue. 2. There is an assumption that\u2019s almost never stated explicitly that ASIC resistance is a worthy goal to pursue There is research and theoretical arguments suggesting that ASIC resistance makes the network less secure (see https://youtu.be/N6eDuEEb0Oc?t=458 for instance). Never at any point in my review of the dev calls did I see the Core Devs engage in how this change impacts the cost to attack Ethereum, which IMO is the most important consideration. It is true that the whitepaper is anti-ASIC and ethash was designed to be anti-ASIC, but our understanding of crypto network security has improved since then. Hudson did ask at least once if anyone had any opinions about whether ASICs were really a problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TafZui-DnV0&feature=youtu.be&t=3387, but his question was met with 18 seconds of silence. 3. To make such an impactful change we probably want to get feedback from more than miners Here\u2019s a very condensed timeline of how the initial tentative consensus was reached, based on my notes. I may have missed some things, and am not aware of anything that might have happened outside of the Core Dev calls: On call 38 the IfDefElse team joins the call the present ProgPow to the Core Devs. On call 45 there were several miners giving their opinions on ProgPow in the context of issuance reduction discussions. On call 47 Hudson says that there\u2019s renewed interest in getting ProgPow into a future hard fork, but it\u2019s not clear from listening to the call where the interest is coming from. I\u2019m guessing miners? Hudson later says that he\u2019s been talking to video card manufacturers about it. Calls 48, 49, and 50 have technical updates and implementation progress. On call 51 the devs confirm that ProgPow has not been decided yet. Miss If and Mr. Else (creators of ProgPow) are on call 52, where Hudson makes clear that in the call they\u2019ll talk about \u201cif\u201d they should ship ProgPow, not when. Most devs who speak seem in favor of shipping it, one has concerns about the amount of work required. They discuss for about 45 minutes in total. At the end of this call, Hudson says that they\u2019ll tentatively go ahead with ProgPow unless there\u2019s some major problem found. I believe it was after call 52 where the first big pushback occurred. It looked like the Core Devs made the decision after after consulting with miners and the IfDefElse team, but I didn\u2019t see much evidence that anyone reached out to the broader community. As noted above, all I listened to were the calls so I may be missing attempts to rope in others. It\u2019s seems hard for the community to discover such things organically, because discussions about ProgPow were sandwiched between discussion of technical issues that legitimately only required the consensus of the Core Devs, making it hard for non-Core-Devs to find the relevant discussions. Even if the community was following the Core Dev calls and had listened to call 51, there was no indication that the Core Devs were going to make the tentative go-ahead decision by the end of call 52. 4. There doesn\u2019t seem to be enough awareness of conflicts of interest. As in the Afri situation, conflicts of interest exist and are relevant regardless of whether the parties in question are doing anything wrong. Given that the situation we\u2019re in now seems to be the result of miners initially pushing for it, it would have been nice to see more skepticism and attempts to reach out to the broader community. There seems to be an assumption in the dev calls that what miners want should be given significant weight. IMO this is pretty controversial and not something for the Core Devs to decide. ",

For reference, related threads (which puts pings on those other threads):     My technical take on ProgPow's weakest link EIPs       First let me say that I\u2019ve worked extensively with the algorithm, and as far as I\u2019m concerned it is sound and meets its objective of evening the mining playing field. As proposed ProgPow creates a new pseudo random sequence of OpenCL or CUDA code every 10 blocks or so. In order to run on the GPUs this code is just-in-time recompiled at run-time with each new ProgPow period. In an ideal world that would be fine, but compilers (specially optimizing compilers) are incredibly complex beasts and are \u2026         On the progpow audit Action Item       Opening this thread as a general purpose place for the community to discuss the upcoming progpow audit being handled by the Ethereum Cat Herders at the request of the All Core Devs. Please post questions or comments and we\u2019ll do our best to make sure that all parties weigh in.

PoW isn\u2019t about censorship, it is about the ability to not trust a third party for transaction confirmations  Trust a third party to do what? Bitcoin and ETH were designed so that you don\u2019t have to trust a third party not to censor your funds, or confiscate them. The cryptographic aspects of Ethereum provide most of the resistance against theft (if someone doesn\u2019t have your private keys, they can\u2019t move your funds). The PoW mechanism allows double spending to be solved in a decentralized way, and the purpose of that decentralization is censorship resistance.  Putting hash rate into the hands of a few small companies (the ASIC manufacturers, who are well known bad actors), is the most censorship driven thing you could possibly do.  It\u2019s unclear whether ASIC manufacturers pose much risk. I\u2019ve decided to create a thread just about the object-level discussion regarding whether ASICs are good or bad for Ethereum, to ensure that this thread stays focused on governance:     Is ASIC-resistance good for Ethereum?       There has been some discussion in this thread and in the ProgPow-review gitter channel about whether ASIC-resistance is a goal that Ethereum should be striving for.  I thought it might be good to have a more permanent record of these discussions, in a thread that was exclusively devoted to them.  The main arguments in favor of ASICs are:  (1) GPU mined coins are cheaper to attack with rented hashpower  It\u2019s easier to rent a large amount of GPU power than it is to rent a large amount of ASIC powe\u2026     ",

IMO the hash rate vote should not factor in too much because assuming that the network is now dominated by GPU miners, it\u2019s asking an incumbent whether they want to disallow competition. The coin vote also represents a little less than 3% of all coins. It\u2019s definitely more interesting than the hash vote but the low voter turnout should not make it decisive. Specifically note that if ProgPow harmed Ethereum in such a way that a harm was distributed among the entire community but benefits were concentrated in a special interest group, you\u2019d expect coinvotes against it to be underrepresented because the members of the special interest individually have a lot more to lose/gain than an average member of the community, and are therefore more likely to take the time to vote. This is why special interests are able to get laws passed in their favor in democracy: normal citizens don\u2019t have the incentive to get worked up about every little thing that does them a little bit of harm. The twitter polls I have seen are much more evenly split, but Twitter polls generally suffer from the problem I described above too. The camp that benefits in a more concentrated way will have more incentive to game the poll. This is the only sybil resistant twitter poll I\u2019ve seen: https://tennagraph.com/eip/1057 In this poll there are 20 \u201cinfluential\u201d people in ETH. Only 20% of them favor ProgPow, 50% are against it, and 30% neither favor or are against.  The harm is the self interest.  The pro-ASIC arguments acknowledge that miners are self-interested, but denies that this leads to any bad outcome for Ethereum. If you can\u2019t show how self interest would end up harming Ethereum you haven\u2019t addressed the arguments.  On the other hand, GPUs don\u2019t have these self-interest issues.  GPU miners aren\u2019t self-interested? Your argument suggests that ASICs are less evenly/fairly distributed than GPUs. That\u2019s might lead to actual harms, but you haven\u2019t shown how it will. Lots of other coins have ASICs. Are there any concrete harms you can point to from them? \u201cMiners are centralized on coin X\u201d isn\u2019t a concrete harm.

That puts intense political pressure on maintaining the status quo.  This cuts both ways. The fact that a PoW change would make ASICs obsolete is the thing that makes attacking with ASICs so costly. An attacker that builds an ASIC farm to attack Ethereum will lose billions of dollars. An attacker who builds a GPU farm to attack Ethereum will lose much less because their mining hardware is still valuable. Do you disagree that it costs less to attack a GPU mined currency than an ASIC mined one?  That puts intense political pressure on maintaining the status quo.  The crux of the disagreement seems to be about how much political clout ASIC miners actually have. What is your evidence that resistance to ProgPow is coming from people with ASIC mining interests? Linzhe seems to be the only one making any noise about it. Look at the only Sybil resistant poll that I\u2019m aware of: https://tennagraph.com/eip/1057 What I see are a lot of people with good reputations in the community who don\u2019t have conflicts of interest making principled objections.

The likelihood is what the argument is. It may be slightly more likely to construct an attack with GPUs, but that effect is basically entirely washed out by the relative market cap of the respect chains. 51% against ETH is way less likely than against Grin or ETC, just due to the difficulty. The strongest chain (with a particular PoW algo) always wins. I would argue that the \u201cself-interest\u201d of GPU miners is known, as they are the incumbents, so it\u2019s a sort of \u201cprefer the devil you know to the devil you don\u2019t\u201d conundrum. The \u201cstatus quo\u201d would allow a relatively unknown actor into the Ethereum community, with a more complex and possibly counter-active set of incentives, which is more likely to be exploited due to the central power of that actor and cause network disruption at key points. We can point to Bitmain as an example of this.  The parties you mentioned are well-known members of the community, and if that\u2019s all you need to be convinced I suggest you take a closer look at their arguments instead of just relying on their reputations. To my knowledge, the most interesting and helpful argument that could be construed to be against ProgPoW is from Phil Daian. That post is here: https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/ His conclusions are simple: PoW have inherent economies of scale built in, which are impossible to remove. PoS is the only potential mitigation for these faults. Working on \u201canti-ASIC\u201d PoW algorithms is thus a waste of time for anything but a short-term gain. I don\u2019t want to put words in Phil\u2019s mouth, as I respect him and his work very much, but I don\u2019t think he would consider himself a hardware expert. His research is primary in code security and smart contract development, although he has a wealth of experience and observations that would be foolish not to take into consideration. At the core of his argument is this point: \u201canti-ASIC\u201d PoW algo changes are a waste of time as a long-term solution. ProgPoW is not intended as a long-term solution. It is intended as a 1-2 year stop-gap measure that should even the economies of scale between ASIC manufacturers and GPU miners (who mine with commodity hardware). It is used to help us get to PoS or a Hybrid PoW/PoS option, which will be possible in about 1-2 years when we are confident in the operation of the Phase 0 Beacon chain. You can make up your own opinion with this information, but I think you know mine. I respect your right to have a different opinion in this regard.  The rest of the people mentioned, to the best of my knowledge, have one or more of the following arguments:  Phil\u2019s point on anti-ASIC algo changes (we discussed this above) \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of precious developer time\u201d / \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction from ETH 2.0 / PoS schedule\u201d (most work is done) \u201cIt\u2019s contentious, therefore we shouldn\u2019t do it\u201d (circular argument)  Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but these are the only arguments I have received from these prominent community members. To address 2) Most of the work is already done. The rest of the work is planned because enough people want to see it happen. The teams involved are largely completely different. The only real distraction is the involvement of this proposal into a scheduled hardfork, which considering this EIP is the most complete of any proposed for Istanbul isn\u2019t really a great argument. To address 3) This is a circular argument. \u201cContentious\u201d means people disagree. If they disagreed for technical reasons, we should answer those concerns and resolve them, absolutely. If they disagreed because they have a different viewpoint (such as Phil\u2019s conclusions), then we can debate and come to consensus on which way is best for the network. I am very open to this. If they disagreed because other people disagreed, because other people disagreed, then we are all participating in a circular argument, wasting people\u2019s time, mental health, and \u201csocial capital\u201d by continuing to debate this important change.  Since proponents believe strongly that this makes the network better, and detractors have few if any real arguments against it (besides the fact they don\u2019t like it), I would suggest that the onus is on the detractors to raise technical concerns (to make the proposal as robust as possible, or show an un-fixable flaw), or to help come to consensus on these less fact-based arguments and opinions that are difficult to resolve so we can put this issue to bed. We currently have no forum for doing this sort of discussion, at least none that resolve with any real certainty, so this is a difficult thing to do. But I would argue that if we cannot do this (discuss and resolve contentious issues like ProgPoW) with any sort of final certainty, we will be royally fucked when more complicated proposals come though. This proposal is fairly straightforward, and good opportunity to experiment with solutions for this critical problem. (Hint: no other blockchain project have solved this either) ",

                    "content": " Yes, the costs are the same.  I\u2019m really surprised that you claim this. On the one hand you point out that ASIC manufacturers will completely lose the value of their hardware if a coin switches PoW on them (or if they successfully destroy the only coin that the ASIC can mine on). With GPUs you can attack a coin to death and still have very valuable GPUs. Given this, how can you say that the attack costs are the same? Do you agree that to the extent that you can rent hashpower to attack a coin, that\u2019s cheaper than building or buying the capacity to attack it?  but that effect is basically entirely washed out by the relative market cap of the respect chains  I\u2019m not sure why talking about market cap is relevant because we\u2019re considering different PoW algorithms for the same chain. The relevant question is: If Ethereum still had a ~15 billion dollar market cap but was entirely ASIC mined and was by far the biggest coin mineable with that algorithm, how would the cost to attack it compare to the cost to attack it today?  with a more complex and possibly counter-active set of incentives, which is more likely to be exploited due to the central power of that actor and cause network disruption at key points. We can point to Bitmain as an example of this.  There is some effect here going in the direction you want: if there are fewer people controlling more hash power, it\u2019s easier for them to coordinate to censor/attack, and easier for governments to pressure them. There is also an effect going in the other direction: if ASIC miners have more to lose from an attack / censorship than GPU miners do (which it seems like you don\u2019t believe, but hopefully I can convince you), then they will be less likely to ever want to engage in an attack / censorship. Can you point to any direct harm that Bitmain has caused? As in my discussion with Jon, I\u2019m looking for things like attacks, censorship, etc. \u201cHaving a lot of hashpower\u201d might be scary to some but is not a direct harm.  His conclusions are simple: PoW have inherent economies of scale built in, which are impossible to remove. PoS is the only potential mitigation for these faults. Working on \u201canti-ASIC\u201d PoW algorithms is thus a waste of time for anything but a short-term gain.  Daian also spends a significant portion of the article arguing that ASICs make coins more expensive to attack. This is the same thing I\u2019ve been arguing here, the same thing that Joseph Bonneau argued in his CESC18 talk. IMO this point is a major crux of the debate, so if you or others here don\u2019t accept it we should focus on that. You mention that Daian is not a hardware expert, but that\u2019s not relevant to the economic argument about why GPU mined coins are cheaper to attack than ASIC coins. I agree with you that \u201cit\u2019s contentious because it\u2019s contentious\u201d is a thing that happens in other cryptos (Bitcoin) and we shouldn\u2019t let it happen in Ethereum. ",

It also makes it easier to use coercion to attack the chain since there are fewer people to coerce.  I basically agree with this framing, I would sharpen it with the following distinction: Centralization of hash power makes it easier for existing miners or those who can influence existing miners to attack the chain if they want to. But if the chain is secured by ASICs then it makes existing miners want to attack the chain less, because by doing so they lose more. However if the attack is coming from someone other than the existing miners (or from an entity that can control the existing miners), then this attack will be cheaper for GPU mined coins vs. ASIC mined coins. So people who are more worried about state attacks or other big external attackers should definitely prefer ASIC mining. People who are more worried about a coin\u2019s own miners \u201cgoing rogue\u201d should on the surface prefer GPU mining. I say \u201con the surface\u201d because the thing about ASIC mining is that the community can switch from ASICs --> GPUs if ASIC miners ever start acting up. But switching from GPUs --> ASICs if a government starts attacking you is much tougher. So the downside of guessing wrong about which attack you should be worrying about is very different. ASIC mining gives you the option to defend at least pretty well against either attack. ",

They tried to use their power to force the narrative of Bcash into the Bitcoin community. They also largely failed (because miners are not the network, full nodes run by the community are). But to say this did not cause a significant disruption would be will fully ignorant. This is what we can expect from a centralized entity: if they have a reason to attack or disrupt a chain, they are very well-organized to do so. GPU mining farms are very disparate and georgraphically diverse. Because GPU mining is permissionless, it\u2019s very hard to predict exactly where they\u2019ll be, although places with cheaper power tend to win the economies of scale. To amass 51% of the hashrate, you would need to talk to something like 50-100 separate farms. That\u2019s a lot of coordination, and attack would be seen coming from a mile away. (Hell Bcash fork was known for a month). Giving time to the community to prepare is what counts and allows us to survive such an attack through a social majority running nodes. Now you might say \u201cHey, what about mining pools? Those are centralized!\u201d Mining pools have some of the lowest overhead costs of any business I have every seen. They take in all your mining rewards, hold them until you\u2019ve reached some payout threshold, and then redistribute after taking a couple percent cut for the cost of their \u201ccoordination\u201d (really their social reputation among the mining community). If they aren\u2019t working on what\u2019s involved to do a PoS Validator pool, they\u2019re really missing out, because that\u2019s largely the same business. All of that is to say, mining pools have very little incentive to disrupt the chain moving to PoS because they have very little overhead costs invested besides running a node with very high uptime, and some sort of automated database to keep track of who contributed what. That incentive might be slightly higher for Hybrid PoS/PoW but\u2026 Basically the same argument works there. ",

If I mention Bitcoin at all, it\u2019s as a rich source of historical precedent to draw from, and I am making no value judgements on the community itself. I think trying to make such value judgements of the Bitcoin community is largely a distraction to this discussion.     lightuponlight:  They reached out to Jihan Wu for help, because he is also a large-block proponent and has significant hash power.   This was my main point. The fact that he could be reached to organize a support for the new chain, and for that to have largely worked, is entirely my point. That would not be nearly as easy to do with our current GPU mining community.     lightuponlight:  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to lay the Bitcoin civil war at the feet of Bitmain and Jihan Wu.   He is definitely not fully to blame, but played a large part in helping it succeed, and it continues being a distraction to the Bitcoin community to the present day. We should avoid creating central power figures like this. The number of ASIC manufacturers will always be strictly less than the number of mining farms due to the economies of scale at play. ",

                    "content": " This is the exact opposite conclusion to what I argued. Given we agree ASICs lead to centralisation of hash power then it is far easier for an external actor to compromise by coercing the miners because there are fewer of them.  I specifically said my statement applied \u201cif the attack is coming from someone other than existing miners (or an entity that can control the existing miners).\u201d Your argument was about the situation where the existing miners can be controlled by an entity who is behind the attack. That is not the only situation to be concerned about. @fubuloubu writes:  Electricity costs being the majority of what PoW actually \u201ccosts\u201d means that for the sake of argument, the value of the devices can largely be ignored.  I strongly disagree that rounding hardware costs to $0 can lead to a remotely plausible analysis of a build/buy attack. Even if the majority of the cost of hashing is electricity in some cases, this is only true when the hardware cost is amortized over an extremely long period of time. I\u2019d really like to see you to provide some detailed back of the envelope calculations to support your claims. Here\u2019s my back of envelope calculations: I searched around to find a tier 1 GPU for ethash, and it looks like the NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti 6GB is pretty good. 29.5 MH/s at 90w. If you use the default electricity cost of $0.12 per KWh on cryptocompare you\u2019ll see that it will take about 3 years until the electricity cost overtakes the cost of this thing on Amazon. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a big GPU farm and you can get a good deal on these cards. It\u2019ll still be years before the electricity price is higher than hardware price. And this is using an electricity price that is higher than what I just happen to get in Seattle, so I\u2019m sure pro miners are paying less for electricity. If the ETH hashrate is 150,000 GH/s you need about ~5 million of these cards to overpower the existing network. Let\u2019s say you get a good deal and can get them for $200 each. That\u2019s still a billion dollars for only the cards. Even assuming that your facilities/land/cooling costs are zero, this will dwarf your electricity costs even if you\u2019re attacking Ethereum for many months continuously. Suppose your electricity costs are what crypto51.app reports for the ETH hash rate rental cost. Then we scale the reported hashrate to 150 TH/s which we used above, and round up to $100k per hour. So $2.4 million per day, $72 million per month. You could 51% attack ETH for 13.8 months continuously before your electricity cost would overtake your hardware cost. And this is with very generous hardware/infrastructure cost assumptions, and generous assumptions about the existing miners continuing to mine for zero revenue for those 13.8 months (otherwise the attacker could scale back their electricity expenditure).
