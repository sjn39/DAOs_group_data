These options don\u2019t lend themselves too well to an onchain poll.  \u201cYes, we should offer the bounty but 40,000 Dai isn\u2019t enough\u201d \u201cYes, we should offer the bounty but 40,000 Dai is too much\u201d  Depending on your timeline and intention I would recommend either running an informal poll with those options to gauge sentiment, or selecting concrete amounts of DAI for people to signal on so the poll can move on chain if there is majority support around one or multiple options.

The comptrollers act as the escrow for the funds, which should be drawn from governance when the bounty is placed, rather than when someone delivers. This also moves the administrative overhead to when the bounty is placed, rather than both when it is completed and when it\u2019s placed, which means that it demands less attention from governance (at the cost of moving some admin work to the comptrollers). Based on that, and the fact that the MIP as written doesn\u2019t really make the comptroller s+ multisig optional, I think you should stick with the process as laid out in MIP55.  Edit: Hm, in retrospect it wasn\u2019t really designed for bounties at all, but I think both the points I made are still valid. The idea is to give the people working on the SPF confidence that they will get the funds, and to reduce governance overhead. ",

Also, any proposal will need to account for the very disparate functions within Maker - structured finance with RWF CU is very different than potential ventures or contracts with Growth, which are different than corporate governance \u2026 and then there is regulatory too. No one lawyer has the requisite experience in each of the above. And even large, international corporate organizations require the support of external counsel who have the more specialist expertise. I would add that any proposal needs to: (1) identify key focus areas, (2) provide a budget for implementation and maintenance, and (3) describe how to retain the right talent (directly or indirectly) for each key subject area.
