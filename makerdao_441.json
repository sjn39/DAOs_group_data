Wanting to get in touch about our upcoming NFT L.A. Conference Feb 2022. We would love to talk to you guys about your involvement. That could range from speaking to a stall to sponsorship. It\u2019s going to be like TEDX meets Summit - with as many unforgettable experiences as possible. The conference is still in development but is looking strong. We\u2019re currently close to locking in LA Live to host the event at - L.A.'s largest expo venue. As well as the highlights below, we have Layer 1\u2019s, Layer 2\u2019s and Defi. With DAI being v popular as a currency for buying digital art, I think the synergies are very powerful. Conference Sponsor Deck: DocSend Core Highlights of the conference as of about 5 days ago: Day 1 (Tue): VIP experiences then welcome party for all Day 2 (Wed): Highly curated sessions with top tier speakers and entertainment for all attendees.  After parties. Day 3 (Thur): Breakout tracks to harness co-creation energy around key focus areas for sub-community building: Music, Gaming, Fashion, Fine Art, Digital Collectibles, Education, Social Impact, etc.  Special VIP after party at Wisdome where Scott Page from Pink Floyd will lay down an augmented reality dome experience and drop his new collection. Core Partnerships/Sponsors being finalized: Fan Controlled Football Alien Worlds Stacks The Crypto Company Blockchain Training Alliance Wachsman, Multiplied, and other leading PR firms And many others (former show guests provides some insights here) Speakers Finalized or In the Works: Scott Page, Former Pink Floyd Saxist Steve Aoki, DJ and Music Producer Austin Ekeler, NFL Running Back Spencer Dewitte, NBA Star Nicole Buffet, Fortune Magazine Top 50 NFT Influencer/Artist Michael Wagner, Star Atlas Matt Kalish, Draft Kings Robby Yung, Animoca Brands Tom Bilyeu, Quest Nutrition & Impact Theory Mark Cuban Would be great to connect and discuss further if its of interest to you guys.
