Paragraph Summary This MIP will offboard me, Philip Bain, as the Facilitator for the DUX Core Unit. Submitted simultaneously is MIP41c4-SP32 to onboard @0xdeniz  as the new Facilitator for DUX. In tandem these MIPs complete a handover of Facilitator duties from me to him for our team.  Specifications  Motivation Six months ago, when I took on this role, I was motivated to do whatever it took to help launch our Core Unit and make it successful. Since that time I\u2019ve happily watched our PM, @0xdeniz,  show his passion, enthusiasm, and commitment to Maker governance. I now feel it\u2019s the right time to step aside and let him take on this role for the DUX team. I know his skills and aptitudes are uniquely suited for the role of Facilitator, and the rest of the team agrees. I have fully enjoyed my time as Facilitator; it has been a great learning experience for me. I\u2019m not leaving the team, I\u2019ll be continuing my engineering duties as a senior developer for DUX. I\u2019m excited to hand the Facilitator responsibilities to @0xdeniz, and I\u2019m confident he will work hard to fulfill our mission of bringing the state of Maker governance forward!
