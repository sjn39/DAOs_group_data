                    "content": "Hello, We are doing an Ethereum focused Con in Brno, Czech republic. I\u2019m here to ask for some funding because it\u2019ll be completely free to attend. Maybe we can come up with a MakerDAO focused talk or workshop? Down below we\u2019ve put together some basic info about who we are and what exactly are we trying to do  Who we are? We are a group of Czech Ethereum enthusiasts who want to do more than observe. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve founded gwei.cz and BanklessCzech. Gwei.cz is a Czech-Slovak Ethereum community. We do multiple weekly calls where we talk about Ethereum. BanklessCzech is local sub-brand running under BanklessDAO and we mainly focus on getting new users acquainted to Ethereum through various kinds of media. What is this Con about? We want to make a local Ethereum focused Con because there just isn\u2019t one now. Our goal is to show Ethereum to new users, hopefully, educate everyone and make connections in our community. Content There will be two separate rooms. One for talks with a capacity of 120 sitting people and one smaller one for DeFi and other workshops. We are also thinking about some panel discussions, but nothing confirmed yet. The smaller room can be for 30 people, but if more capacity is needed, we can manage to combine the two rooms. There is also a caf\u00e9 restaurant on the site. Where and When The Con will take place in Brno (the second largest Czech city) and the date is set to be 9th October. Budget breakdown 2 rooms for 150 people \u2013 800$ 2 students for cleaning and carrying stuff \u2013 100$ Above are the necessary expenses, but we are sure that\u2019s not everything. We must be ready to pay for speakers to stay in a hotel or get a train. Also, if we accidentally break some glass or something, we must be sure that we can cover that too. Then there will for sure be expanses that we just don\u2019t think about now, but they will come up. We think that all of this can fit under 2000$ We have already asked for a grant from the Ethereum Foundation, which will be 1500$ if accepted in full. If everything goes as planned, we will probably get under 1500$, but since this is our first Con, we must have a reserve for unexpected expenses. Let it be noted that if we don\u2019t use some money it will stay on gwei.cz multisig and will be used for the next meetup. Things we need to do The place is booked and ready to use. In order to be prepared, we need to issue some ticket reservation system (The event is free, so tickets can seem useless, but we must somehow prevent the potential problem with too many people). Also, we need confirmation from the speakers that they will be there, so we can count on them.  Image 1 - The place we booked We are open to talk and really adaptable. So if you have any ideas on how we can cooperate then please bring them in  Also to be clear about what we are asking. We think that something like 500DAI would help us a lot and is also fair for what we are offering. ",

I had the opportunity to attend on Saturday - the quality of presenters was wonderful - from locally led initiatives to Ethereum Foundation presenters, and panel discussions, they even had a local Maker enthusiast, VeryVerum walk the audience through the inner workings of MakerDAO which was great. At the grass roots level this is what it\u2019s all about; getting awareness, understanding and knowledge sharing, and in the true spirit of Ethereum openness, the event was free to attend and maxed out at 120 people, kind thank you to Growth CU @Nadia for supporting this   EthBrno11920\u00d71440 170 KB   ethBrno21920\u00d71440 260 KB  ",
