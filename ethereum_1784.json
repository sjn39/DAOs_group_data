                    "content": " eip: title: An Article NFTs Standard description: A standard describing text-based NFTs for articles. author: xarraxyl  discussions-to: [tbd] status: Draft type: Standards Track category: ERC created: 2022-06-15   Abstract This standard describes a simple protocol for creating and displaying NFT articles.  Motivation NFTs are associated with art, yet any kind of digital asset can be wrapped in an NFT. By providing a protocol for creating and displaying NFT articles, we unlock the interoperability needed for content writers to create and show their articles, which in turn can facilitate the article\u2019s exchange using the already existing NFT infrastructure.  Specification An article NFT is an NFT whose URL points to a txt file that complies with the following rules:   MUST begin with a paragraph of arbitrary length that MUST begin with \u201ctitle: \u201d.   MAY be followed by a paragraph of arbitrary length that MUST begin with \u201cauthors: \u201c which in turn MUST be followed by the authors\u2019 names, separated by a comma.   MAY be followed by a paragraph of arbitrary length which MUST begin with \u201cabstract: \u201c   MAY be followed by a paragraph of arbitrary length, which MUST begin with \u201ckeywords: \u201c which in turn MUST be followed by the keywords, separated by a comma.   MAY be followed by \u201cmarkdown: \u201c and then followed by a word describing the markdown schema. \u201cnone\u201d is also acceptable if no markdown schema is used. The markdown schema keywords are not specified in this proposal but will be subject to organic community effort.   MUST contain at least one more paragraph.   Here is an example of the simplest possible txt file that would comply with the protocol: === title: Can trees talk to each other? Scientists have discovered that trees may indeed be able to alert each other to danger by sending electrical messages through their roots. === Let\u2019s take a look at an article that makes use of \u201cauthors\u201d, \u201cabstract\u201d, \u201ckeywords\u201d, and \u201cmarkdown\u201d. === title: Can trees talk to each other? authors: xarraxyl  abstract: What can scientists say regarding tree-to-tree communication? keywords: trees, communication, science markdown: none Scientists have discovered that trees may indeed be able to alert each other to danger by sending electrical messages through their roots. === Note that the order of the optional paragraphs is significant. This means:  \u201cabstract\u201d must be after \u201cauthors\u201d. \u201ckeywords\u201d must be after \u201cauthors\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d. \u201cmarkdown\u201d must be after \u201cauthors\u201d, \u201cabstract\u201d, and \u201ckeywords\u201d.   Glossary: Authors. Creators of article NFTs. Platforms and marketplaces. Web3 apps like LooksRare, OpenSea, Foundation, etc\u2026 which provide the ability for users to create and exchange digital assets. Paragraph. Text of arbitrary length that ends with two carriage returns.  Rationale The design seeks the sweet spot between:   Ease of use for authors.   Ease of implementation by platforms and marketplaces.   The title and the body of the article are the only part of the protocol that are mandatory. This provides a minimal skeleton for articles. The authors may provide additional metadata regarding the contents of the article by using \u201cauthors\u201d, \u201cabstract\u201d, and \u201ckeywords\u201d. The \u201cmarkdown\u201d keyword is intended to instruct the UI on how best to display the body of the article.  Backwards Compatibility Not applicable. Text-based NFTs that do not comply with the standard are not considered article NFTs.  Test Cases A regex tool can be written to aid the implementation of NFT articles by testing if a file complies with the standard.  Security Considerations There are security risks for platforms and exchanges parsing the article NFTs\u2019 text files to display their contents. A reasonable approach is to save the contents of these files in a database for a faster display to the end users. A malicious article NFT may take advantage of an automated articles crawler and perform an SQL injection.  Copyright Copyright and related rights waived via CC0 ",

The proposal describes the protocol for creating an NFT article, including the mandatory and optional paragraphs that must be included in the txt file. The proposal seeks to provide a minimal skeleton for articles while allowing authors to provide additional metadata regarding the contents of the article. The post also includes a glossary, rationale, test cases, and security considerations. The post does not advertise the proposal, but rather explains it and invites feedback and collaboration.",

This draft accommodates authors who want to do non-markdown (with markdown: none as one of the examples indicates), but for the most part, if someone writes just plain text it\u2019s also valid markdown. Is there a specific use-case you\u2019re thinking of where it\u2019s critical for someone seeking to be compliant with this standard to be able to create a text file that\u2019s not valid markdown? The preamble you\u2019re describing here is close to what EIP-1 describes for EIP preambles, but not quite. The EIP-1 structure uses \u201cRFC 822 style header preamble\u201d, a.k.a. \u201cJekyll-style front matter\u201d, which has several apps that already know how to parse (e.g. GitHub parses it and shows it as a table at the start of the file if formatted like this). So, rather than inventing a new standard, using something like that which is already established seems like not a huge change, with the upside of already being compliant with several existing tools?
