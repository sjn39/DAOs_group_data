I agree with you that the risk of personal liability of contributors is real and is one of our top priorities, as it can hinder considerably further growth of the ecosystem. The DAO needs specialized legal experts in many jurisdictions to tackle these issues (in a DAO, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d and also no legal counsel) so your expertise can be very valuable. SES is the best point of contact for you, as we will tackle critical scalability bottlenecks of the DAO and bootstrap new resources and incubate new Core Units. ",
