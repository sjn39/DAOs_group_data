COLLATERAL_VALUE_IN_USD = ETHUSD_AT_AUCTION_CLOSE * ETH_QUANTITY  DEBT_VALUE_IN_USD = DAIUSD_AT_AUCTION_CLOSE * DAI_OWED  ACTUAL_LOSS = DEBT_VALUE_IN_USD - COLLATERAL_VALUE_IN_USD  Disregarding the fact that keepers in MCD need a buffer to cover the various risks they are taking, I\u2019d wager that a lot of these positions would have received vastly less than they might think ",
