For example, I know there\u2019s community discussions about a number of things that will be needing to happen in our governance roadmap. For example:  MKR locked for t time during voting, to prevent from atomic vote+sale to escape liability. This would also ensure the malicious party loses MKR in the event of an ES due to their actions. Developing the mechanism for paying people out of the system surplus. An elegant and trustless solution to bug disclosures, patch development and deployment. other MIPs and ideas that don\u2019t \u201clive\u201d anywhere yet.  Thoughts? We can update that thread with links to the discussion threads and actual MIPs as they are created. But the ideas should be collected together somewhere so we can keep track. ",
