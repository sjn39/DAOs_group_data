                    "content": "Should there be a second set of vaults for major collateral types that offers preferential terms for extremely large deposits? If, for example, a party wanted to mint 100,000,000 DAI, should they have access to a vault with marginally lower Stability Fee, perhaps 10 or 20 basis points? This would be restricted to high-volume users by having extremely high Dust values. The exact metrics of how high to set Dust and how much Stability Fee discount to offer would require input from Risk and Growth to offer opinions on what levels would be most useful while not expanding our risk exposure more than necessary. Why Do This? Recent months have seen a large number of institutions become involved in crypto assets. We need a product that specifically appeals to these customers who may be still exploring options for USD-pegged stablecoins. Also, it is presumed that extremely large vaults are likely managed by parties with formal risk management teams and processes, making them less likely to be liquidated in a disorderly downturn than a standard vault. This may or may not be true, but my presumption is that this type of user can help anchor our core business when it becomes volatile. This is an automated, permissionless way to provide a tool the Growth team or individual DAO members can point to that is designed for institutions and high-volume users. Risks The main risk is continued exposure to the collateral types we already accept, but with lower aggregate fees. There is also a risk of existing large users \u2013 of which there are a few \u2013 migrating to these lower fee vaults without an offsetting increase in business from new large users. Next Step If Signal Is Successful If this poll is successful with a majority in affirmation, the next step is to bring a proposal with more details after consultation with Growth about what levels would be likely useful, and with Risk about what the appropriate trade-offs should be for combinations of Dust and fee discounts. A formal signal request will follow after asking for some input from Growth, Risk, and any other needed stakeholders. To help provide a clear signal, please vote in the poll below. I will push forward with a formal request if >50% of responses are affirmative on/after May 29 (two weeks) edited for typos     Yes. Let\u2019s get input from Risk and Growth and present specifics to act upon. No. This is not needed at this time. Abstain.     0 voters     ",

Growth will have the valuable input of who might be interested and under what conditions, but we can go live with this vault type without any client in mind and then add different ilks when the opportunity presents itself!

For example, standard stability fee on first 5 million DAI Stability fee -0.1% on 2nd 5 million and so on Numbers above just for illustration. This would be a permisionless system as anyone could open a large vault if they wanted and would also mean less work for governance - would obviously need input from the Risk team though ",

                    "content": "    PaperImperium:  Also, it is presumed that extremely large vaults are likely managed by parties with formal risk management teams and processes, making them less likely to be liquidated in a disorderly downturn than a standard vault. This may or may not be true, but my presumption is that this type of user can help anchor our core business when it becomes volatile.   I think this proposal is getting really close to something useful, but I don\u2019t think large debt size is a good proxy for lower risk profile.  A large borrower should need to offer something more. This proposal seems to be target at large organizations, business, or institutions. Those entities may be willing to gain more favorable terms in exchange for giving up anonymity and permissionlessness. If a known institution wants to borrow 1 Billion Dai, MakerDAO could offer a vault with lower stability and/or lower collateralization ratio in exchange for legal recourse.  The borrow agrees that if the loan defaults and liquidations don\u2019t cover the debt, they must cover the difference. MakerDAO can sue them for it. It would be a hybrid Real World Asset \u2013 A cryptocurrency vault but with legal recourse layered on top. Just being a giant borrower probably doesn\u2019t make you less likely to abandon a loan if the collateral value falls below the debt size, but being a known entity who co-signs for the loan (and isn\u2019t bankrupt) probably does. I\u2019m a NO on this vote but would be a YES if MakerDAO can get legal recourse thrown in. ",

I voted yes because I want to start exploring how we can implement custom vaults oriented to users willing to open and maintain the top five positions for certain collaterals. And not just that, but how can we improve Maker Vaults users\u2019 experience in general, like integrating with EPNS to send alerts from any vault activity or offering covers for the vaults (or sending them a muffin basket ). I know what you say about what others say on how Maker charges such low fees for taking on so much risk, but I also hear how difficult is to interact with the protocol and governance. If we start talking with these large vault prospects and understand what they need, we can improve their experience. ",
