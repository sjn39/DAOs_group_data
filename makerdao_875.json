                    "content": " Summary  This article explores ways to invest directly the MakerDAO balance sheet into productive assets Different kinds of assets are studied using their expected Return over Asset (RoA) and Value at Risk to obtain the Return over Equity (RoE) ETH seems to be a worthy investment despite high volatility. Yet such a strategy will require a bigger Surplus Buffer and will not help to invest our idle assets (low leverage) Short term bonds (a blend of corporates and treasuries) seems to be a great way to allocate idle assets without consuming a lot of capital (high leverage) and providing strong returns. Gold doesn\u2019t seem attractive. Diversification effect is only lightly addressed and will need more work.    Defining risks and rewards In the ALM Framework for MakerDAO, we defined the asset risk as \u201casset fluctuation risk over the. long-term\u201d and added a 1-year VaR metric. No formal definition was given but the idea is to use such a VaR metric as the minimum amount of equity required to safely hold such an asset and be in line with MakerDAO risk appetite. 1/VaR being the leverage. One word of caution first. While we will provide 1-year VaR, this should be used as a guide for discussion and not as a golden rule. The VaR paradigm is hotly debated in finance. \u201cThis, in my view, makes VaR relatively useless as a risk management tool and potentially catastrophic when its use creates a false sense of security among senior managers (\u2026). This is like an airbag that works all the time, except when you have a car accident.\u201d - David Einhorn This is why, in this paper, we will use light math and first principles common sense. The subprime crisis was caused in part because of the implicit assumption that mortgage defaults are not correlated. This is correct until it\u2019s not.  Value at Risk metric The formula we will use for lognormal VaR is the following: VaR(\u237a) = 1 - exp(RoA - V * Z\u237a) With \u237a the desired risk profile of the value at risk (95% or 99%), RoA the expected yearly appreciation of the underlying asset (Return over Asset), V its annual volatility, and Z\u237a the \u237a quantile univariate standard normal distribution. For some assets, we will not use the RoA part of the formula when it doesn\u2019t feel like its impact can materialize within the time period. For instance, the speculative appreciation of an asset, while real on the longer term, is quite uncertain over a 12 month period. On the other side, a yield producing asset is more regular in producing value. The volatility will be assessed historically, on a daily basis, noted Vd, or a monthly basis, noted Vm. To scale it to yearly volatility, we will use the following formulas: V = sqrt(365)*Vd V = sqrt(12)*Vm More details on VaR can be found in Measuring Market Risk by Kevin Dowd and Risk Management in Banking by Jo\u00ebl Bessis. For assets that don\u2019t trade every day, another number instead of 365 might be used for extrapolating from daily to yearly.  From Value at Risk to RoE The ALM framework is about maximizing our Return on Equity within solvency and liquidity constraints. Leaving aside the liquidity constraint (most assets here will be very liquid), it ends up being an optimization problem of finding the assets that provide the greatest RoA while minimizing the cost of capital (or Capital at Risk or VaR) RoE = RoA / VaR(\u237a) Another way to thing of it is to use the inverse of VaR(\u237a) which is the maximum safe leverage for this asset type. This formalization assumes an endless funding stream (i.e. DAI demand) and no cost from this funding. Those assumptions are currently satisfied for MakerDAO with $6B of unused capital and a cost of DAI issuance almost negligible (the DSR being at 1bps currently). Yet, we are aware that it is a temporary situation. DAI supply is actually quite limited and it is unrealistic to think it will stay free.  Asset #1 - ETH ETH is the native asset of Ethereum so it makes sense to start here.  1063\u00d7561 9.38 KB  The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of ETH, which can be seen as the average RoA, is quite impressive, yet volatile. The graph below shows the IRR from a given date to the last date of the dataset (in purple) and the IRR from the first data point of ETH (August, 7th 2015) to the given date.  966\u00d7583 18.7 KB  At maturity, assuming a constant market share in whatever ETH will be used for, the price appreciation will be linked to the burning mechanism (which can be expected to be low single digit) and inflation which would be a low digit single number (positive or negative). While historical performance shows that 200% RoA is possible, we would label it as optimistic as the endgame (probably in a few decades at least) is low single digit at best. For the years to come, it seems more prudent to use a 100% or even 50% RoA. Obviously this is speculation territory for which the wisdom of crowd of MakerDAo community is better suited. Looking at volatility, we can see that the one based on monthly data is higher than the one based on daily data which probably shows the existence of trends.  The VaR/RoE model is given below for 100%, 200% and 50% RoA. It is important to note that the VaR metric didn\u2019t include the RoA component. This was made to take into account that bear markets in ETH are bigger than the 1-year period under study. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to add the long term trend in such a short period. For the baseline scenario (100% RoA, monthly volatility), this change decreases the RoE for 95% confidence Var from 163% to 117% and from 121% to 107% for the 99% confidence VaR).  An analysis of max drawdown of ETH over a 1 year timeframe shows that ETH is indeed quite volatile with a max drawdown of 94% during the 2018 bear market.  984\u00d7443 35 KB  Using stETH or rETH instead of straight ETH would change slightly the RoA, the VaR (adding the yielding baseline), and, then, the RoE. Further analysis will be done in case the Maker community wants to move forward on holding ETH on the balance sheet.  Asset #2 - Gold Gold is one of the few Real-World Assets that is already tokenized in DeFi with PAXG from Paxos. In the current century, price has appreciated a lot as displayed in the chart below.  936\u00d7484 9.41 KB  Yet, Gold is still a quite volatile asset with up to a 33% 1-year drawdown. The annualized monthly volatility is 17%.  865\u00d7520 20.3 KB  For the RoA, we have an historical value of 9%. If we assume that it is unlikely to get any reasonably higher number in the future (migration from Gold to Bitcoin for example), we get the upper bound VaR model below. RoE is never above 60% and falls to 27% taking the historical max drawdown.  It seems clear that Gold is not a good opportunity by itself. More studies can be made to see if a diversification effect is possible, but by itself it doesn\u2019t provide what is needed. You can read a recent Lyn Alden piece to form an opinion of Gold.  Asset #3 - Short-term corporate bonds There is currently a Declaration of Intent to invest in short term bonds. A community poll showed support to invest in short-term corporate bonds last year\u2026 The index that will be used for this analysis is the ICE BofA 1-3 Year US Corporate Index as it is a quite long publicly available series. It is defined as an unmanaged index that tracks the performance of the U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade public debt issued in the U.S. domestic bond market. Qualifying bonds must have at least one year but less than three years remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $150 million. The evolution of the index (total return basis) is shown in the chart below.  1101\u00d7674 15.6 KB  The following chart shows the 1 year max drawdown. You can see that it is a limited volatility asset with some period of high drop in 2008 (Lehman crash), 2020 (Covid-19 crash) and a milder one currently (high inflation expectation leading the Fed to increase interest rates quickly).  1156\u00d7644 22.9 KB  The volatility analysis shows a contained volatility that underestimates the outcome of extreme events. To take that into account, we also provide a 8.1% VaR based on the max historical drawdown.   The asset manager Lord Abbet has provided an analysis of the surperformance of short-term corporate bonds which draw in part from a research paper: The Short-Term Corporate Bonds Anomaly.  Asset #4 - Short-term treasury bonds Treasury bonds are issued by the US Treasury, therefore there is no default risk. To evaluate the performance of short-term treasury bonds, we will use the Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 2-Year Constant Maturity dataset. We will use a zero-coupon bond approximation to recreate the total return index (which will be only an approximation, but enough for this study). An example of an ETF implementing this strategy would be SHY or VGSH. The performance of such an investment is illustrated below. As you can see, it is quite stable and suffered some long periods of stagnation as short-term treasury rates were suppressed for years after the Global Financial Crisis.  1093\u00d7648 15.1 KB  The volatility is indeed very low as the statistics below are showing. As always, a monthly based volatility is higher due to the serial dependence of variations.  From a drawdown perspective, the low volatility is highlighted with no 1-year drawdown going under -3%.  1181\u00d7684 26.7 KB  The value at risk model shows that despite a low yield, the subdued volatility allows for quite a strong leverage which allows to target a RoE around 50%.   Asset #5 - Short-term blended bonds To showcase the power of diversification, let\u2019s take a portfolio composed of short-term corporate bonds and short-term treasury bonds (the two previous assets). For this analysis, it will be 50%-50% rebalanced daily of the previous two assets. As you can see below, the performance sits in the middle of both individual assets. Nevertheless, you can get a hint that volatility is lowered.  1179\u00d7707 22.9 KB  Indeed, both the statistical volatility and the rolling 1-year drawdown is of smaller magnitude than both short-term treasury bonds and short-term corporate bonds.   1264\u00d7666 25.8 KB  Overall, while RoA is the average between the two, the fact that the volatility is decreased is providing a better RoE  We provide below the comparison of RoE for each pure investment (Corporates and Treasuries) and the blend portfolio.

I have maintained for quite some time that Maker should use something like ETHUSDC v2 vault to earn return (this is running 1000bps or higher currently).  Volatility is SQRT(ETH_PRICE) btw.  AND ETH as gas is needed for Oracles. There was a perfect opportunity to lower our ETH costs and earn return when ETH price was sub $3K.   Point here is that there are many units that need ETH to conduct business (it is a formal business expense) Maker should be looking at buying ETH and pairing it with DAI or USDC (USDC according to my numbers gets at least 50-100% higher return 10-20% vs. 5-10% for DAI) paired with ETH in a v2 contract. Gold is a total non-starter btw. Treasuries are going to have signficant interest rate hazards in the coming 6-24months which will make accessing liquidity hazardous for the return (if Maker has a longer term time horizon and can ride these to maturity perhaps they could be good). My point here is we need to look towards \u2018strategic\u2019 assets that leverage the ability for Maker to borrow and satisfy needs on consumables.   Once I knew what Oracle budget looked like it became a no-brainer for Maker to hold some v2 ETHUSDC or ETHDAI as a longer term gas investment that would earn us a very high rate of return with SQRT price volatility.

Pairing it with something in an LP is the next analysis depending on the reception of this one. ETH-USD V2 LP is dropping significantly and is no longer above 10% (9.7% over the last month, 8% weekly). And that\u2019s on a 200M pool that Maker would alter significantly. The trend is clearly towards making market making difficult and maybe volatility harnessing is the new paradigm (e.g. a 1% fees pool on V3 full range might make more sense?). I would also point to the post I made on the DAI/MKR LP proposal. If we are in a setting where what we are doing is volatility harnessing, then a ETH-MKR pool might even make more sense. But again, this signal request was downvoted. Maybe I didn\u2019t frame it well, but this analysis is here to show Maker community that there is a strategic need to take asset risk as it is a sound source of RoE for MKR holders. Before this study I wasn\u2019t personally convinced of holding ETH. I didn\u2019t expect those results. Now there is strong evidence in my view. ",

This is a useful way of framing investment decisions for the treasury reserve as well. Duration in crypto is always the big q mark but you could come up with a framework to guide with liquidity needs for eg. ",

                    "content": "Thanks, the framework is helpful.  According to it, we have room for more asset risk and interest rate risk.  This post considers asset risk specifically and the asset risk target in the framework was capped at the surplus buffer amount.  We\u2019ll never actually hit this cap because VaR is never over 100% and we are only considering the surplus buffer for investment (right?). What needs to be decide upon is desired confidence VaR and whether you really want to optimize for VaR and RoA.  If it\u2019s pure optimization, then pick the highest RoE asset class and throw everything you have toward that asset.  But there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty here (especially with Eth) and factors that are not yet considered.  Based on this analysis short term blended bonds are the way to go but as @MakerMan  mentioned, we are in a rapidly rising rate environment and interest rate risk would hit bonds specifically.  Because of uncertainty, I think diversification is your best bet while using the RoE formula to rule out bad assets.  In fact, as pointed out, the blended bonds is simply a small scale example of diversification. Also, what do you all think of considering mkr itself as another asset to add to this analysis?  This implementation would be similar to the burning mechanism except mkr is held on the balance sheet for the express purpose of being part of the buffer instead of being burned.  Since mkr is already in the treasury, I would not advocate for doing this until other assets have been added.  But shouldn\u2019t you be high on mkr growth prospects if you believe in what you\u2019re doing? ",

                    "content": "On MKR - I broadly agree with hasu\u2019s framework for treasury management. It suggests MKR tokens should be marked to 0 on protocol balance sheets, with fairly good reason. For instance, for the tokens to have \u2018market\u2019 value on the treasury would imply they will eventually be sold. The more the treasury accumulates the higher the potential risk. Just burning them to complete the buyback incurs an opportunity cost relative to other investable opportunities. The best use of treasury is where it delivers the highest possible return to the token holder. Regarding MKR tokens, therefore, if the protocol is buying them back, it is necessarily not spending that money investing in growth or in other sources of potential return higher than buying MKR tokens. MKR would have to be more undervalued than 1. Growth opportunities created by DAO contributors 2. Growth opportunities outside of the DAO. This can definitely happen but, if we do not value the token when marking to market then there is not much use in buying it on the open market beyond burning it to complete the buyback for tokenholders.  Rule 3: When adhering to the above rules, a DAO becomes an acyclical trader of its own token. If the DAO sees its token as overvalued and internal reinvest has a good return, it should sell tokens for cash and reinvest that cash into the protocol. This is almost certainly the case in all bull markets. When the DAO sees the price of its token below the fair value, and it has excess cash without a high internal return, then it can buy back the token. This is almost certainly the case in all bear markets.  ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your comments @Traster_Tray On being active on the asset side The current state is to have a clear line of reaction in case of liquidity demand.  First the PSMs are here to handle fluctuation Then D3M and short-term bonds depending on what is best at the time Then increasing rates on crypto-backed loans on MakerDAO Same for Instutional Vaults Firesale of RWA  The model didn\u2019t took ETH in consideration but regarding the cost of capital of holding ETH, it would be in the bucket #5. At max exposure, keeping the Surplus Buffer as a limit, we are talking about 70M. Not game changer on a 10B balance sheet (until ETH x10  ). For now, it\u2019s unclear what condition would put us beyond bucket 1. Bucket 2 should be used sometimes (otherwise it\u2019s bucket 1 that is too big). Last time we have used bucket 3 was early 2020 but there was no #1 and no #2 at the time. On the level of risk You point correctly that in the ALM framework, asset risk is bounded by the Surplus Buffer. We are discussion with @primoz to blend all solvency risks so it is easier to optimize. Mathematical optimization is a science, but the right allocation is more of an art and depend on the strategy pursued by MKR holders. Happy to hear more comments on the ETH (or ETH related) asset. Something we should pursue or not? Btw, I didn\u2019t put BTC, but you can assume it\u2019s kind of similar. But while we are linked to the success of ETH (our homebase), we are not that tied to the success of BTC so it seems of less strategic relevance. ",
