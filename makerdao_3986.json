With the inclusion of this change, we will be updating these descriptions:  From RWA001 to RWA001: 6s Capital From RWA002 to RWA002-A: Centrifuge: New Silver    Also for all RWA collateral types, we will be dropping the -A suffix from the ilk\u2019s registry symbol. This is to conform to other ilk symbols, as follows:  From RWA001-A to RWA001 From RWA002-A to RWA002 From RWA003-A to RWA003 From RWA004-A to RWA004 From RWA005-A to RWA005 From RWA006-A to RWA006     Updating the Changelog to include a a new address, specifically:  VOTE_DELEGATE_PROXY_FACTORY to support vote delegation  ",
