The post also indirectly advertises the use of DAI as a cryptocurrency. There is no criticism of the proposal, but rather a question about its potential future actions.",

The closest we could come it to deploy a new version alongside it, but I\u2019m pretty sure that would require us to redeploy the entire Maker protocol (and no one would use a new version that had a DAI token that included a blacklist, imo). The DAI contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code  I might add that the \u2018core team\u2019 (aka, Maker Foundation) has planned to gently disappear over the course of the next years. So eventually there will be on the DAO (aka, MKR holders) controlling the contracts, and I don\u2019t think it will be easy for the US (or anybody else) to force the DAO to do something. ",
