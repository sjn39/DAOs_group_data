It could scale the voting weight based on the amount of MKR staked in the pool so we can continue to hit the numbers required to pass executive proposals.  Personally, I have a majority of my coins locked in DeFi at a reasonable APY and I\u2019m a little bummed I can\u2019t participate in voting as much as I\u2019d like. Just wanted to start the discussion at the very least and get thoughts on how we can avoid having too few tokens to complete a vote. ",
