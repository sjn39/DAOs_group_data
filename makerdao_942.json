Are these funds earning current interest?  If so how much and what assets/risk are they invested in? How quickly could Maker recapture this cash if needed?  What would be the return process needed? For each underlying loan please include at origination a forecast of monthly of work completed (construction, financial\u2026) and then each month show the actual work versus the forecast.  If a project if consistently behind its forecasts, then reforecast and track the new forecast with monthly actuals, and note that it has been re-forecasted and why and new risk level to Maker.

They don\u2019t yet have the reports for the week ending 6/3. I have decided that it\u2019s better to not attempt to guess these numbers given the small discrepancy in dates.   The Vault debt for 6s in April and May is identical because no one has called drip. We\u2019ve included an estimate below the actual figure of what the Vault debt would have been if anyone had called drip on 5/31.   I\u2019m working with @tadeo to figure out how to put some of the key metrics in these reports on-chain so that they are ultimately queryable through something like Dune. Hopefully more on that next month. Until then, I\u2019ve started uploading these reports to Arweave so that there are permanent records of them.

I\u2019m not sure where you sourced that quote but here is the language from the conformed credit agreement. \u201cApplicable Rate\u201d means, for any day, a rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the Prime Rate in effect on such day, plus the Spread as set forth in the applicable Note. The initial Spread shall be -25 basis points.  \u201cSpread\u201d means the difference between the interest rate certified by the Verification Agent on a given date and the Prime Rate.  So if the Prime Rate is 4% and the Maker Stability Fee (as confirmed by the Verification Agent) is 3%, the spread is -1%. It had to be structured this way because the Trustee required an actual benchmark and couldn\u2019t just reference the stability fee - so a bit hacky but it got the job done. ",

Let\u2019s say 6S borrows 10M Dai, this is pushed through the secure conduit, to the Trust account, and ultimately downstream to the underlying loans. This is accruing 3% stability fees in MakerDAO on the Dai balance of the Vault and 3% interest pursuant to the credit agreement \u2013 all is good. Now let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that 6S pays back the $10M and has a 1 month delay between this repayment and its deployment into the next round of underlying loans. MakerDAO is still accruing stability fees and pushes 25,000 Dai (I did not include compounding for simplicity) to the Surplus Buffer; the Trust does not collect any interest. There is now a discrepancy of 25,000 Dai (so yes, 25,000 \u201cunbacked\u201d Dai in the surplus buffer) that needs to be accounted for. The best analogy I can think of for this situation is how Oracle gas fees are part of the cost of production for a Vault, but are backed out afterwards. I\u2019ll also note that this isn\u2019t a surprise. RWAC flagged this issue in our post \u201cAdditional Representations, Risks and Mitigations Related to 6s Capital.\u201d I have also been present on PECU office hours calls where 6S has brought the issue to their attention and brainstormed solutions. This is also presumably why other RWA borrowers using a similar construct have requested a 0% stability fee with the interest to be handled separately. So why doesn\u2019t 6S pay interest on the Vault and not its utilization of the credit agreement? It\u2019s our opinion that this would be very uncompetitive. Revolvers may charge a small non-utilization fee on the unused portion of a line, but they cannot charge the full interest rate. Additionally it would encourage 6S to convert the USD to Dai and pay it back to the Vault in these interim periods, which would render the facility unusable due to these recurring transaction fees. I think with the power of foresight, 6S would have tried to solve this issue by requesting a 0% stability fee and working out the interest separately; there\u2019s an opportunity to do this if they receive their requested scope expansion. Short of that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good way to fix it on the current $15M line without having to heavily (and expensively) redraft the governing documents, as the entire Credit Agreement uses the Vault stability fee as a reference point for the interest rate. Until we see the outcome of MIP72, I think the best option is to track and handle this discrepancy manually.     Ippy:  It certainly doesn\u2019t need to be on the forum, but does some DAO affiliate (like a core unit) have copies of documentation on these individual loans? If so, who would that be?   RWAC has been working with RWF CU to develop a process by which we can share the data/documents involved in our monthly spot check, which includes much of the documentation on the individual loans. But please keep in mind that as we scale, and as we begin to engage regulated counterparties, this kind of \u201clook-through\u201d will become more difficult if not impossible. Borrower privacy laws would prevent a counterparty (such as HVBank) from sharing much of the information that a CU would want to see - mainly because while Maker is conceptually the lender, legally it does not exist. I believe Maker will need to increasingly rely on trusted third parties (e.g. banking regulators) to screen for fraud and errors. Also, in our HVBank MIP6 and in MIP72, a Maker community-sourced committee is proposed to sit at the Trust Sponsor level, which would have a better ability to oversee these facilities. ",

A  Lender expects the Borrower to tie out their uses of borrowed capital to the last penny in the regular reporting cycle which here is monthly.  An consistent inability to do this would usually result in an Event of Default and closure of the Facility.   A real world Lender would not lend until they had operations and structure that would enable the Borrower to make this exact reconciliation.   The $43K in question are related to the approximately $5.1MM outstanding loan to 6S. This is about .84% which may not seem like much but given Maker only gets 2-3%/year on the 6S loan, this is a significant portion of one year\u2019s interest which is material.   A real world Lender starts charging interest as soon as the money leaves their \u2018vault\u2019 and only stops once its returned to their \u2018vault\u2019.  As long as the Borrower has control of the funds, they pay interest on it.   This raises broader questions, as Allan rightly notes, regarding what is an appropriate lending structure for Maker.  This can certainly be done at the Trust level but then puts even more focus on the Trust - is it being managed reasonably to protect Maker\u2019s rights and responsibilities as a Lender?  And also according to key DeFi principles such as transparency and trustless? ",
