L2 Recipient Address: 0x8cadb20a4811f363dadb863a190708bed26245f8 Grant category: Governance Fund, Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes, the proposal falls under the DeFi committee. Perhaps also the Tooling Committee if they are willing to review. Project description: Revert\u2019s mission is to build powerful analytic tools for liquidity providers in AMM protocols while keeping them open and accessible by everyone. This proposal focuses on the \u201cRevert Compoundor\u201d a protocol to automate compounding of fees for LPs on Uniswap v3. The Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued fees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to incentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas costs. Depending on the fee APR and size of positions this can significantly improve returns. Project links:  Website: https://revert.finance/  Gitcoin: Revert | Grants | Gitcoin  Docs: Auto-compounder - Revert  Whitepaper: Revert Compoundor - HackMD  Twitter: https://twitter.com/revertfinance  Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord  Please include all other relevant links below: Revert on Defilama   Additional team member info: Founder: @mariorz Relevant Usage Metrics:   Revert Compoundor:  $1,500,000 USD across all chains, latest TVL can be checked on Defi Llama $200,000 on Optimism    Revert App Connected accounts:  Over $940,000,000 USD across all chains Over $2,000,000 USD on Optimism    Is this project be open sourced? Yes, the compoundor contract and related projects (comopoundor-js) are open sourced along side other open sourced repos Revert \u00b7 GitHub Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Revert Compoundor has been live on Optimism since July 18th. Ecosystem Value Proposition: Our mission is to build powerful tools for liquidity providers in AMM protocols. We believe AMMs are going to become a fundamental part of financial markets in the coming years, this will create new investment opportunities for retail investors but will also require open, transparent, and accessible tools for everyone. Optimism, by lowering gas costs, makes LPing more accessible to a much larger number of users, also making more active strategies viable for non-whales, which in turn makes tools like the sort we build required by a larger number of users.  So far we\u2019ve built and integrated with Optimism the following tools:  Uniswap v3 position analytics Uniswap v3 initiator: backtest and initiate positions on Uniswap v3 https://revert.finance/#/initiator?fee&network=optimism&token0&token1   Top positions: browse top performing v3 positions and filter/sort by different criteria Compoundor: Protocol to automate compounding of LP fees for Uniswap v3 positions This is what we are hoping to incentivize in driving liquidity towards Optimism. More info on our docs: https://docs.revert.finance    Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 240,000 After reviewing other incentivized projects, we believe this is a reasonable amount to validate the strategy proposed with the goal of migrating sticky liquidity from mainnet towards Optimism. With ~300,000K USD to distribute over a 3 month period we believe we should be able to increase Uniswap liquidity on Optimism by over ~20m USD (total liquidity is currently around 60m). This would be measurable separate from Uniswap growth by measuring the TVL of the Revert Compoundor itself. Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: We have not. How much will your project match in co-incentives?: We have already done the heavy lifting in the sense that we are fully integrated with Optimism. But we will promote the OP rewards program with our users and the expected APR improvements in migrating their existing liquidity and make that as easy as possible. Revert will also contribute with a significant marketing push over our community and user base by promoting this program on our Twitter account, Discord server, Mirror blog, and more importantly in-product, highly directed, communication on our app. Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 100% will go to Uniswap v3 LPs on the Revert Compoundor Protocol on Optimism.  All LPs will be eligible to join the program, except team wallets which will be excluded. The distribution will be done in tranches via merkle airdrops. We will iterate on the criteria and parameters for the distribution, but they will be based on TVL, compounded amounts, and forms of vesting or minimum timeframes.  The specific criteria and scripts will of course be made public. We will likely favor popular assets, or otherwise make sure valueless pairs are not a vector for exploiting the program.   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  We are targeting 3 months, but we will adjust the period to try to incentivize more sticky liquidity as we learn from the results. Also explained in the previous answer.    How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  It will make LPing any specific asset pair on Optimism more attractive, particularly more so for positions with a high fee-apr which would imply in-range liquidity and pools that have low liquidity relative to volume. In other words it will incentivize liquidity in Uniswap in the pools and ranges where it is more needed.    Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Ultimately we believe our users as LPs will flow towards the pools that offer the best returns. However, because compounding has a cost of gas and compoundor (keeper) fees, there is a period until using the autocompoundor reaches break-even. In general our protocol is more attractive to positions that have longer time frame expectations. We go into this in our whitepaper. We will target the distribution rate of the rewards so that it incentivizes existing liquidity on Ethereum towards the Optimism pools, without being high enough to attract temporary \u201cfarming\u201d liquidity. So the period over which the period will be distributed will be adjusted accordingly. We will also analyze and share the results of the incentives program, in terms of attracting long-term liquidity to Optimism, as a case study from which we can all learn from.    Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism.  With the requested amount, we expect to increase Compoundor TVL on Optimism by at least 20m. We will evaluate and publish results of 3 iterations of setting and parameters to maximize the amount of sticky liquidity we can bring to Optimism.    Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability: Revert Compoundor Address: 0x5411894842e610C4D0F6Ed4C232DA689400f94A1 ",

Fair point. The way I\u2019m thinking about it is that regardless of our current TVL on Optimism, the rate at which it would be distributed would be adjusted to incentivize migration of liquidity without being too high where it would attract more temporary liquidity. So perhaps it would take us a year to distribute the OP given that constraint. But certainly reducing the amount of OP requested sounds reasonable.  This goal sees pretty well defined, and probably a win-win for your users as once they are on optimism the benefit of lower gas fees presumably will keep them here after rewards run out.  I think so as well. Would also like to highlight the aspect of us analyzing and sharing the results of the proposed OP distribution with the above goals in mind.

This a concerning tweet that was posted by your account on Twitter recently.  It seems like you had a spat with another protocol (Gamma Strategies) which gave you a grant for a revert integration, but you never provided the service due to some unrelated conflict regarding publishing rights. You stated that you \u201cdumped\u201d those tokens and had no intention of providing the integration. Can you explain why you didn\u2019t simply return the grant funds if you had no intention of fulfilling the service? If you didn\u2019t provide the integration, but simply dumped the tokens, doesn\u2019t that equate to stealing?   The publishing dispute should not have given you the right to take grant funds without providing the service. You could have simply returned the grant funds correct?  After you dumped the tokens, did you pocket the proceeds or return them? I think we need to have these questions answered given that this is another grant on a larger scale. Edit: Did some more digging and it seems like you had the intention of doing the integration with Gamma (formerly known as Visor)  ",

I think one of the common pitfalls of a lot of liquidity mining programs is that they over assign rewards that increment the LPs APR drastically in a way that attracts temporary capital that is only LPing for the rewards. Distributing 80,000 OP (~100k USD) in a month would be enough to increase the APR of ~20,000,000 in capital by about 6%. As described in the post the specific parameters are to be dermined and iterated on, but we believe we can attract that amount of capital from Mainnet to Optimism with the amount requested. ",

I was just notified that this discussion was taking place here by one of our community members. Our intention was not to go public with any of this information until it had become evident that @mariorz was attacking our character which prompted us to respond.  My aim here is to be as forthcoming as possible about our interactions with @mariorz (also known as Wario) and provide as much actual evidence of our interactions, so that it would be helpful to anyone who is doing business with him. Just for some context, we had reached out to Wario back in June 2021 regarding an integration where Revert would provide analytics for Visor Finance (now known as Gamma), and Visor would be giving him a grant to do so.     mariorz:  There was never an agreement on our part to integrate the protocol in exchange for a grant, Visor approached us, asked for an integration, we explicitly told them we would probably integrate liquidity manager protocols in the future, but not at that time.   Contrary to what he has stated here, there was most certainly an agreement in writing on Telegram.  image693\u00d7867 53.8 KB   At this point, we had already given the grant to @mariorz who had promised us that we would be the first Uniswap v3 vaults for integration, and that he was excited by working with us to get analytics on revert.  He even gave us a target date for when this would be ready.     mariorz:   Nevertheless they insisted in giving us a grant of 8,200 VISR (at current gamma price, the total is about 500 USD) which we immediately deposited into one of their vaults and left it there and was never withdrawn. This was in June 2021, here are the relevant txs:   Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan  Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan     He is correct that he received 8,200 VISR, but that was worth $10,563.56 on the day of transfer.  image1280\u00d71068 72.3 KB  He is correct in that we did do a token migration in December in which all VISR holders were given a 1:1 exchange for GAMMA tokens. Despite his saying that the GAMMA price is worth 500 USD, this is obfuscating the fact that he had sold the GAMMA for 5,494 USDC on December 29th, 2021, and those funds have never been returned to us.  He has also refused to do any integration despite monetizing the grant.  See the sale transaction below:    Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer    Ethereum Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | Etherscan Ethereum (ETH) detailed transaction info for txhash 0x4141130de776a9516dbc56ef11e9448bbd75d5ff8dd7211b7962c0c0d0755922. The transaction status, block confirmation, gas fee, Ether (ETH), and token transfer are shown.          mariorz:  In December 2021 we wrote an article, linked on this thread, on how the Uniswap liquidity mining program for Ribbon had been exploited by a few accounts taking most of the rewards. They baselessly accused me of plagiarism even though the article was researched and written in full by myself (after they pinged me to ask about the situation)   We never accused him of plagiarism.  We accused of him of failing to give credit where it is due.  We had consulted him for a research article that we were writing on the Ribbon incident.  However, during the middle of the conversations, he frontran the publication of the article, solely crediting himself and then subsequently asked the public to donate to his gitcoin grants for his publication. https://twitter.com/revertfinance/status/1468667993831915528?s=20&t=_p50abJ6jEdTQvDkBTY6zw. Here is where we explicitly told @mariorz that we were doing a write up on the exploit of Ribbon\u2019s Uni v3 staker contract.  See my team member\u2019s statement below where he states, \"We are doing a write up on the 1tickdao.eth \u201cEXPLOITER\u201d on Ribbon\u2019s staking contract.  image571\u00d7522 29.8 KB  I do not want to bore everyone with the entire conversation but we literally had pages of dialogue of joint research for this article.  In this text here, we had mutually agreed on a joint publication.  It was very obvious that this was going to be a joint publication based on the entirety of the conversations  image564\u00d7651 40.2 KB   image605\u00d71066 73.4 KB   image574\u00d7881 66 KB  We had pages of dialogue after his initial suggestion that we have a meeting on Monday to discuss.  Yet, his main reason for writing the article without any credit to our contributions was that we didn\u2019t actually schedule the Monday meeting.  That reasoning is completely absurd and illogical given all the dialogue and joint work that we\u2019ve done.     mariorz:  Towards the end of that month their protocol was hacked, iirc for the third time, and they rebranded with a new token now called Gamma. Supposedly a different team, but very likely just the same people, and airdropped it to vault depositors. We had no agreement in place with the original Visor grant, and no agreement in place with the new Gamma project. And definitely did not want to have any more dealings with them. I dumped the tokens, and good riddance.   This is completely irrelevant and a straw man argument to whether he wrongfully accepted and monetized grant funds and whether he wrongfully took sole credit for a joint publication.  However, I will still address it given that we are part of the Optimism ecosystem.  Uniswap v3 management was a bleeding new space, and we were the original authors of our position manager contracts.  As with many contracts that have been written for the first time, they have been exploited, and we took full responsibility and accountability.  We spent hundreds of thousands on new audits by Arbitrary Execution (hypervisor/AE_Gamma_audit_09_03_22.pdf at master \u00b7 GammaStrategies/hypervisor \u00b7 GitHub) and a 4-week intensive audit by ConsenSys Diligence (Gamma | ConsenSys Diligence), the best in the business.  In our rebrand to Gamma, we onboarded new security advisors and strategists specifically tailored to bolstering the safety of our contracts.     mariorz:  We had no agreement in place with the original Visor grant, and no agreement in place with the new Gamma project. And definitely did not want to have any more dealings with them. I dumped those tokens, and good riddance.   Based on the totality of the evidence, this is egregiously false.  And I don\u2019t think @mariorz is realizing that he dumped the tokens and monetized despite admitting to not providing any service at all.  That is theft if I\u2019m not mistaken.     mariorz:  I\u2019ll end by saying that I would advice caution in any dealings with that project, beyond their disparaging and false accusation against myself, the way they have conducted their protocol\u2019s own security issues should be alarming enough as to what their character is.   Quite the contrary to what he has stated, all the evidence points to his duplicity in our business dealings.  Our own security issues that he keeps referring to is a textbook strawman argument. In conclusion, we never intended to air this dirty laundry evidenced by the fact that we never went public with any of this information despite this happening in December 2021.  In my last DM to him, I said the following:  image568\u00d7564 35.5 KB  Again, I would like to thank him for revealing his character to us.  For us personally, we will never do business with this individual again. Apologies for the negative energy, but I feel that this must be stated as he has consistently shown himself to be an unethical individual. ",

It\u2019s funding going directly to revertfinance.eth. The same account that was used to steal funding we provided him. @mariorz has complete control over that account and any crypto that touches it. If I recall, a proposal by Byte Masons was strongly reconsidered after @lefterisjp released a statement saying the team had conducted themselves unprofessionally in the past. If @mariorz was a representative a DAO or organization he had no control over, that would be different. @mariorz first response to this accusation was a lie.  Nevertheless they insisted in giving us a grant of 8,200 VISR (at current gamma price, the total is about 500 USD  The grant was $10,000. He then later admitted to dumping the tokens out of spite multiple times.  And definitely did not want to have any more dealings with them. I dumped those tokens and good riddance.   And again those grant tokens were never sold and were just deposited and left in their vault, all while the token price was crashing.   What I was thinking of when dumping their airdropped tokens was that I did not look forward to having any more interactions with that team/project. (so much for that)  Instead of providing an explanation, @mariorz has attempted to discredit us personally and professionally. There is no explanation besides he took a grant with the stipulation that no work would be done, which is absurd, and refuted by our screenshots. This proposal is asking for over $300,000+ to be handed over to him unilaterally. If any delegate is considering approving this, I strongly would recommend that any funds be put on a multi-sig with OPLabs team access. That\u2019s the bare minimum of due diligence that should be done for someone who has admitted in plain English to stealing a protocol\u2019s funds. Nor is it fair to the other applicants, as their character and past actions were absolutely taken into consideration when evaluating their grants. ",

They insisted on giving the grant \u201cwith no strings attached\u201d. More so, I just took that grant and deposited into their own vault and left it there. So it is ridiculous to say that there was intention to profit from it, more so when during that period the price of that token grant was in free fall. I honestly did not care to use these funds, and they would not have, then or now, made any material difference to our team\u2019s runway. More than 6 months later, after they had already accused me of \u201cfrontrunning\u201d and \u201cstealing\u201d an article I researched and wrote alone, they airdrop me (and all vault depositors) a new token which I immediately dumped. At no moment did they indicate they wanted any of these tokens they airdropped themselves back, or that they were payment for anything. It should be evident to anyone who does a background check on the gamma team the dishonest way in which they operate. They have already received a grant approval for over a million dollars, in no part of that proposal do they explain that they are a team that rebranded after three consecutive \u201chacks\u201d under circumstances that are only explained by extreme negligence or worse.

Here they have used an obvious sockpuppet, and their own accounts (which btw nothing wrong with being anonymous, but while they use names like \u201cBrian\u201d, they seem to be anons with no seeming background, and twitter accounts created in 2021), to falsely accuse and malign me.

Hi @bobby , Apologies for what seems to be re-hashing a past partnership. I had responded with my comments above mainly for two reasons   @mariorz mentioned us first by name both on Twitter and on this forum in a derogatory light, to which we were forced to respond and clarify with evidence.   To reveal that in a prior grant context, he had never fulfilled his end of the bargain and acted dishonestly.   Again, we never asked to be dragged in here, but his constant mentioning of our name forced us to respond.  All our past security issues are out of scope for the relevance of how @mariorz 's personal history and prior action affect his own proposal\u2019s merits. To keep the dialogue relevant, he 100% did receive a grant from us for an integration that he promised us would take place.  Those services never took place, and he never returned the grant funds. The context of our grant program can be found here: Introducing Gamma: An organization dedicated to funding \u2018Active LP\u2019 strategies and research | by Visor Finance | Visor Finance | Medium If anyone would like to go into any details on us, our security incidents in the past, or our interactions with @mariorz please ask, and I will be happy to do so.

All LPs will be eligible to join the program, except team wallets which will be excluded. The distribution will be done in tranches via merkle airdrops. We will iterate on the criteria and parameters for the distribution, but they will be based on TVL, compounded amounts, and forms of vesting or minimum timeframes. The specific criteria and scripts will of course be made public. We will likely favor popular assets, or otherwise make sure valueless pairs are not a vector for exploiting the program. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  We are targeting 3 months, but we will adjust the period to try to incentivize more sticky liquidity as we learn from the results.

This is where I think there are some scope of improvement, three distribution with 100K each might bring the liquidity but there is nothing to hold them long term.  I believe this is the crucial question. I think we agree that attracting liquidity by distributing money is easy enough, as has been proven by multiple liquidy mining programs, keeping at least a very significant portion of it is really the problem to solve. So what makes liquidity stay or leave? Phrases like \u201cmercenary liquidity\u201d are often used. If we drill down to it, the issue starts from what type of liquidity you are attracting with the incentives. As example, if you were to do a liquidity mining program on a hypothetical WBTC/WETH pool on Optimism that resulted in people getting +100% APR improvement, that pool will attract A LOT of liquidity fast. It will migrate liquidity from mainnet for sure, but It will also attract  liquidity that was not previously LPing on that pair at all, it will even attract liquidity that might not even hold one or both of these tokens. The last two cases are liquidity that will very likely leave as soon as incentives stop. An an example on the other end, if you do a liquidity mining program on that same pool that results in a modest, say 6%, increase in APR over the pair on mainnet. I believe that it would be an attractive enough proposition for a lot of existing LPs on mainnet to migrate. It is much less attractive for people that did not previously think LPing on that pair was attractive, or those who might not even own some of the assets. So by keeping the extra incentives APR to a reasonable level, you select for liquidity that is more likely to be sticky. Granted, this would be the first liquidity mining program we run, so this thesis is to be validated.  You also mention in this thread that this distribution might last for 1 year, so which one we should consider ? 3 month or one year ?  So the timeframe of the distribution could be extended with the intention of not allowing the extra APR to get too high. However, by directly and clearly explaining the APR improvement to existing LPs on mainnet that use our app, I believe we can migrate the 20m in a 3 month time frame without problems ",

The point is of doing this is to learn in each iteration with the goal of maximizing sticky liquidity. If possible it might be even ideal to shorten the periods to 2-3 weeks to have more iterations.  Worth mentioning also that while the rules for the distribution will be fair, transparent, and with a clearly defined goal, the parameters might not be made public until after each iteration to minimize possible gaming if required. Also including a summary of previously requested and incorporated changes.  Reduced requested amount Explanation on how we arrived at the requested amount of OP.

Adding more background to give context to your feedback. As mentioned in our proposal, we believe there are clear aligned incentives between the Compoundor and Optimism in that the lower gas prices mean that some positions that are too small to compound profitably on mainnet can be profitably compounded on Optimism. So migrating this liquidity from mainnet to optimism effectively increases the addressable market for the compoundor protocol.  We think that KPIs tracking the migration of the \u2018sticky\u2019 marginal capital would cover this better than the simple TVL measure proposed.  I have to disagree though with the suggestion of changing the KPI to this specific type of liquidity. The rewards will be distributed in a way that does not exclude larger positions, so we should expect these positions to also contribute to the growth in TVL and Uniswap liquidity on Optimism (which we consider a good in itself). We do look forward to keep building on Optimism, and sharing the results of the proposed liquidity mining program in the context of our proposed KPI, though I also think doing analysis by different forms of cohorts, as the one proposed by the shadow committee is certainly worth looking into, and we will.
