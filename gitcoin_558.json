                    "content": "Hi everyone,  proposal I\u2019d like to propose adding the following section to the Gitcoin Code of Conduct.  Airdrops may come, but you are not entitled to an Airdrop. Over the course of time, Gitcoin Grants has become a significant pillar of the ecosystem - in which more & more projects are reliant for support.  Because Gitcoin Grants has had 1mm+ lifetime crowdfund contributions, it has become a source of data about which projects the community values, and who in the ecosystem is supporting these projects. Any Airdrops that come to Gitcoin contributors have been on a \u201cdon\u2019t expect it, but be thankful if it comes\u201d social norm. We expect that community contributors are informed about, and participating in, the process through which governance passes proposals.   We expect that community members are graceful in accepting airdrops, but are not acting entitled to them unless a governance proposal passes that specifically entitles them to an airdrop at a specific time. Any disrespectful, harassing, entitled, or trolling behaviour related to airdrops is against the code of conduct.   motivation 1 The motviation for this proposal is based partially out of this post from Vitalik (the architect of Quadratic Funding), in which he outlines the following spectrum through which what types of motivations for contributing to grants are within the design target for QF instances:  motivations841\u00d7331 22.9 KB   motivation 2 The second motivation for this proposal comes from my experience in interacting in the public channels of the Gitcoin Discord, in which several members have confessed to me that they are there to receive airdrops.  And would not otherwise contribute to Gitcoin Grants. In some cases, these conversations have become combative.  Conversations have become heated when contributors feel entitled to an airdrop on their timetable, without going through the ratified Governance process and the Gitcoin Stewards or Gitcoin team cannot deliver. By formalizing this policy in the CoC will make it clear to these contributors that their efforts to contribute only to receive airdrops are not worth their time,  TLDR   feedback welcome I welcome feedback from any community members in the GitcoinDAO.

I feel like I have been stuck with multiple user asking for an airdrop since a few months or since the launch of the GTC and so many conversation turn around having or not having received an airdrop\u2026 (On this forum also) When I joined Gitcoin about 2 years ago, we were tipping each other, sending Kudos, learning/creating some quest, I was also trying to contribute to some grants or project that seemed to be great like BanklessDAO Newsletter not only financially but also commenting his newsletter and reading his stuff. There was no airdrop, we were not hoping for an airdrop also, just having some fun and trying to build up the future web3.

Maybe misinterpretation of qf? Maybe there needs some more information? i am not so sure if it was good to split my donations in so much small little pieces? did i expect an \u201cairdrop\u201d - no. would it be nice - for sure. Some channels i saw before gr9 recommended GC because they got something back from gr8 donations. and i think, things like that made some expectations to the donations and a lot of people used it mainly for these reason and forgot the altruistic idea of donations? Should GC be altruistic with these persons? i trust in GC and his values to make a good decision. ",

I fully support the above text, and I understand the desire to leave open the option for future GTC airdrops, but I am very deeply against grant recipients giving airdrops to those who donate to their grants at any point. For this reason, I might separate out the two cases. GTC airdrops are one thing. Airdrops to those who donate to a grant by the grant recipient should cause immediate removal of the grant from the website (after review of course). The amount of damage airdrops by grant recipients does to the whole process is massive. The text above doesn\u2019t make that clear and actually confuses (at least for me) whether or not it\u2019s acceptable for grant recipients to give airdrops.

The original purpose of the Quadratic Funding idea was that the amount of matching funds given to a grant are proportional to the number of donations they receive (as opposed to matching based on the total dollars of donations they received). This is because QF is attempting to gauge true community sentiment for a project as a way to guide matching donors in their decision on who to match and how much. This works if the measure of \u2018true community sentiment\u2019 is accurate. When some projects (that is some grant recipients) promise something in return for donations, any project that doesn\u2019t promise equally valuable returns will obviously suffer in the measurement of their popularity. This defeats the original intent of QF. For grants that have nothing to \u2018airdrop\u2019, they simply can\u2019t compete for attention, and what you end up with is not a matching system that rewards projects that of the most use to the community, but projects who pay their donors the highest reward.

Call it grants throughout, give the prospects the rules and let  them decide whether to apply.   Following economic incentives, within the confines of specific rules, like maximizing ROI [maximum return for minimum investment], cannot be framed as a negative, when the very security of the blockchain relies on combined economic interests of the [notable] majority of numerous independent participants.
