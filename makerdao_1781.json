                    "content": " Introduction Since stETH-B vault type was launched (May 2022), stETH-A\u2019s exposure decreased significantly while the exposure of stETH-B continues to grow. Given that stETH-B\u2019s stability fee was significantly lowered compared to stETH-A\u2019s (currently 0% vs. 1.5%) this could mean that with vault migration of existing exposure to a cheaper alternative. This way Maker could suffer from revenue cannibalization (besides the direct revenue loss from a lower rate). There were three key arguments for bringing stETH-B\u2019s stability fee to zero: (i) decrease Maker\u2019s reliance on centralized PSM exposure, (ii) increase Maker\u2019s market share of stETH collateral and (iii) encourage long-term adoption. Meanwhile, estimated lost revenue per year at that time was 220,000 DAI (relevant proposal). In this analysis, these are some of the questions that we aim to answer:  How has the stETH total debt per vault type changed since the launch of stETH-B? What about the number of vaults? How did debt collateralized by stETH grow compared to overall market trends? How much vault exposure migrated from stETH-A to stETH-B since stETH-B\u2019s stability fee was dropped to 0%? How much stETH-B exposure has been minted by new users since the drop in its stability fee?  This report is a result of an ongoing research by @Risk-Core-Unit.  Analysis The chart below shows that from 10 days before stETH-B vault type was launched till now, stETH-A\u2019s exposure decreased from $150 million to $50 million. Inversely, stETH-B\u2019s exposure has shown a consistent growth, currently standing at $120 million. This implies that stETH-B\u2019s share of total stETH exposure increased to 70% only 4 months after launch. Total exposure collateralized by stETH has since slightly increased in relative terms ($170 million vs. $150 million).  901\u00d7494 28.3 KB  Number of vaults per stETH vault type shows a similar trend where stETH-B\u2019s vault recently outnumber those of stETH-A:  907\u00d7515 22.1 KB  Even though stETH-A\u2019s liquidation ratio is lower than stETH-B\u2019s (160% vs. 185%) we can see that stETH-A vault owners currently maintain a higher debt-weighted collateralization ratio. This is largely explained by Gnosis\u2019s vault whose share of total stETH-A\u2019s exposure is 60% (currently its collateralization ratio is at 342%). On the other extreme we have another whale with two vaults - 7 siblings which contributes to more than 85% of total stETH-B exposure. This means that the behavior of these two whales dominate the below metric across both vault types:  917\u00d7509 39.7 KB  Given a different liquidation ratio across vault types there could be a difference in how actively vault owners manage their vaults. This removes debt as a variable in the analysis and rather treats all vaults equally. When comparing stETH-A and stETH-B vault management based on event quantity in the last 30 day per vault we can see that distributions are mostly alike, the only difference in stETH-A\u2019s slightly higher third quartile. We excluded vaults that were opened less than 30 days ago to reduce unnecessary noise in the data.  879\u00d7511 13 KB  To investigate potential revenue cannibalization we look at individual DSProxy addresses (proxy wallets) and compare their stETH exposure before and after relevant dates. More specifically, we look at which DSProxy addresses had stETH-A vault activity before stETH-B\u2019s stability fee was dropped to zero, currently have an open stETH-B vault and previously closed down their stETH-A vault. The only exception is 7 siblings whale which has multiple DSProxy addresses that we actively monitor. We multiply this current stETH-B vault exposure with current stETH-A stability fee to estimate the revenue cannibalization amount (as current stETH-B stability is set to zero). About $109 million of current stETH-B exposure (90% of total) migrated from stETH-A and also closed down their stETH-A vault. Most (94%) of that comes from 7 siblings whale. This brings an estimated annualized revenue cannibalization to around $1.7 million DAI (with stETH-A\u2019s stability fee at 1.5%). This interpretation includes a strong assumption that exposure would be as high on stETH-A as it is now on stETH-B with the stability fee decrease (which is up to discussion). Importantly, $68 million of net positive exposure can be attributed to vault owners migrating from stETH-A to stETH-B. Another interesting view is to split current stETH-B exposure ($120 million) across different vault types that the DSProxy initially interacted with. We can see in the below chart that stETH-A\u2019s amount is aligned with the above cannibalization figure. That means that a DSProxy address first interacted with stETH-A before it eventually interacted also with stETH-B. Meanwhile, around $8.6 million of total debt (7%) can be attributed to DSProxy exposure that didn\u2019t interact with other vaults before stETH-B. These could be interpreted as users that are new and potentially started using Maker because of zero cost of borrowing on stETH.  867\u00d7515 13 KB  All of this brings us back from quantitative analysis to speculation on individual whale behavior and how different governance actions can impact the revenue/risk trade-offs. Would an individual whale still have $103 million exposure at Maker even if we didn\u2019t lower the stETH-B\u2019s stability fee to zero? If that\u2019s the case, this would bring us additional annualized $1.5 million DAI revenue through stETH-A vault type. This is not a negligible revenue stream. On the other hand, stETH-B is currently the third largest vault type collateralized by volatile assets and contributes to almost 15% of total risky debt. During a bear market when there is excess stablecoin demand (current stablecoin ratio is at 83%) it is necessary to maximize its supply. Lowering the cost of borrowing is one of the key levers that we have to achieve that.  Conclusion Maker\u2019s debt collateralized by stETH has increased from $150 million to $170 million since stETH-B was launched despite a more than 30% drop in collateral price during the same period (with overall stETH/ETH market shrinking). This is mainly caused by 7 siblings whale minting; whose stETH-A exposure was at its peak at $30 million and has since grown to $103 million through stETH-B. This one user brought most of the net positive exposure of stETH exposure in the last 4 months which would otherwise be net negative, aligned with overall market trends. To summarize, when evaluating the impact of stETH-B stability fee decrease: from the total of stETH-B\u2019s $120 million exposure, $109 million can be contributed to vault migration from stETH-A (16 vaults) and $8.6 million to new vault owners (43 vaults). The rest used other vault types in the past. The vault migration contributed to $68 million of additional exposure. It\u2019s important for Maker to establish itself as a long-term solution for lending services with stETH as collateral. Meanwhile, there are many trade-offs that the DAO is confronted with regarding parameter optimization. This analysis showed how the protocol economics are still largely dependent on individual whales. We initialized this research to start a discussion on both direct loss of revenue caused by lowering stability fees and also potentially indirect sources such as cannibalization caused by vault migration. As shown through the data, it\u2019s often difficult to directly attribute vault migration from one vault type to another. Given the importance of this research topic we will continue improving our methodology to monitor migration of exposure across the protocol and (ideally) also cross-protocol. This can contribute significantly in measuring sensitivity of rate setting which ultimately benefits the protocol\u2019s bottom line. ",

The rest used other vault types in the past. The vault migration contributed to $68 million of additional exposure.   Super interesting findings, to me these shows that vaults users are very rate (i.e stability fee) sensitive within the stETH vaults. This was probably well understood as staked coin users are yield seekers and this provides them with an arbitrage opportunity. Now that the stability fee is 0%, it will be interesting to see what stability fee we can charge without losing balances, in my past experience anything <1% is usually not enough reason to move but once rates start getting close to 1% or above, transition or looking for alternatives start to make sense. While the pros are clearly understood, increasing DAI\u2019s collateral diversity with an emphasis on uncensorable and onchain currencies, its at the expense of recurring revenue. To continue increasing this type of DAI collateral and basically providing interest free loans, its urgent that we generate revenue from the our large USDC position. ",

                    "content": "The insight into high rate sensitivity was further extended in a more high-level overview in our last analysis. There is a small difference in absolute terms in ilk stability fees across major collateral symbols (1% difference between ETH-A/ETH-C, 1.5% between stETH-A/stETH-B and 1.25% for WBTC-A/WBTC-C) with the price of lower capital efficiency (higher liquidation ratio) when choosing a low fee ilk. Meanwhile, low fee ilks have increasingly been growing their percentage of total exposure across these symbols (which is also related to period of mostly dropped rewards with lower upside on optimizing for capital efficiency, the exception are stETH vaults). But for cross-protocol migration (eg potential of losing exposure because of increasing stability fee that you mentioned) we could look at Maker\u2019s current debt on stETH-B that was migrated from Aave/Compound (because of 0% stability fee). The added nuance is that at Maker vault owners tend to be generally quite sticky because of its trusted infrastructure and OSM price delay so one way migration sensitivity might not necessary map directly to the inverse. We\u2019re also looking at more sophisticated methodologies for measuring causal impact, the challenge is many inter-connected systemic components (protocols, sentiment, yield farming rates etc.) whose impact is difficult to quantify in a unified framework. cc @TRUEMAKER ",
