                    "content": "I think we need to bring this conversation to the forefront of our thoughts. MakerDAO currently has no legal structure registered in any jurisdiction, notwithstanding the dissolving Maker Foundation and the Dai Foundation. In the US, we are almost certainly likely to be classified as a general partnership, which we urgently need an answer for. There are efforts underway to create a new legal carve-out in the United States in the next month or two, but my hopes of this happening are less than 50%. If there is not appropriate language inserted into the \u201creconciliation\u201d legislative process being considered in the US Congress, I suspect we will not see the required legal relief until it will be too late for Maker. For those who are unfamiliar, a general partnership is the default organization of a for-profit, unregistered entity. This means that any individual member of that organization can be held to account for any other member for (among other things):  Legal liability Tax burden Business obligations  We have previously discussed liability to DAO members, and begun to brainstorm ways to mitigate that exposure. It remains to be seen if there is a way to fully reduce this risk to sane levels. Just as our gymnastics with RWA have been ponderous and imperfect, I do not think we should hold out hope for a complete solution here. But we have some of our most knowledgeable minds working on it. Given the amount of money involved, it seems only a matter of time before claims (spurious or legitimate) are brought to members of this and other DAOs. Note that the only reason the Maker Foundation was able to move litigation from BT into arbitration was due to user agreements. To my knowledge, we no longer have those user agreements in place, and is the most instantaneous way we can at least lower our risk. Someone please make my week by telling me I am wrong, and new users are somehow subject to an agreement. Honestly, regulatory enforcement actions are likely to be the least of our worries for shared liability. Though on that front, I am hearing more and more ominous whispers about 2022 being a very litigious year for crypto. I have no special information about which protocols and companies that might impact the most. On the topic of taxes, US history has many examples of a single member of a general partnership being forced to pay the entire tax burden of their partners. Given the current political climate in the US, desire to increase spending, and growing worry over how to pay for that, I cannot foresee Maker \u2013 which pays taxes exactly nowhere \u2013 escaping notice, perhaps in multiple jurisdictions at once. Note that the final, late deadline for last year\u2019s tax filings in the US is about to pass in less than two weeks. I do not know what the variation in these exposures is in other jurisdictions like the EU, UK, LATAM, and others. But in the US, the current level of exposure to legal and tax liability is off the charts due to the size, complexity, and sheer number of members in MakerDAO. This trajectory needs to change. We need to find solutions to these problems as soon as possible, and not simply to manage our own risk. If we want to do business with highly regulated institutions, they will need to be assured that we are compliant with all applicable laws. Some solutions \u2013 like a legal wrapper for MakerDAO in some globally recognized jurisdiction \u2013 would even allow for our RWA program, which is supposed to be the next engine of growth to 100x Maker, to scale much faster and safer than is possible now. There are compelling business reasons to solve these issues, and do so decisively. In theory, anyone holding MKR could be exposed to these risks. One can imagine a number of other connections to Maker outside of holding the tokens that could also expose an individual. As a closing message, anyone who has not already done so may wish to limit their interactions with this and all other DAOs to be within a limited liability entity in their preferred jurisdiction. In most countries, there are simple, easy versions to set up. I conduct all DAO business through an incorporated entity, and also hold MKR tokens within an incorporated entity to limit risk. I cannot and will not give legal advice, but consider doing something similar for yourself. Please leave your thoughts and suggestions below. This has needed urgent attention for quite a while, and we need to get in front of this. ",

While I might not necessarily wish the same type of developments you want, I agree 100% that this discussion is needed. The MakerDao community is made both of decentralisation purists, which would be happy with just ETH as collateral, and more business oriented people which would love to see MakerDAO incorporated as much as possible. In light of the recent post of @rune , where he envisages a situation in 1 year where we can embark billions of corporate bonds, support RWA green activities, etc, I think it\u2019s mandatory to make it clear what this will imply on the legal fronts (in USA, EU, and other main areas). People should be well-informed now on what direction MakerDAO is going to take in the next year or so even if not all details are available today. ",

Currently, MakerDAO and most DAO are dodging the issue. We have ways to continue to dodge it with RWA (by using Maker representatives for instance).  We don\u2019t have a legal team yet, but that shouldn\u2019t stop us from thinking.  In my understanding a DAO is a general partnership where MIPs and MKR tokens are the agreement and this forum a proof of existence. Each country has its own legal framework and \u201cis a DAO a le\u2026     Regarding RWA, I think you can have a legal wrapper for that and it can be somewhat decentralized. What we don\u2019t have is how to solve taxes. I think I alluded somewhere how a Cayman Foundation (orphaned) could issue MKR as securities that somewhat can be used governing the protocol as well. If you funnel MakerDAO benefit to this entity, they might pay dividends to MKR holders (as it\u2019s security). You get limited liability. If the legal entity fails, you just start from square one, the contract itself is immutable and not controlled by the entity. ",

I think we need to quickly get this discussion going, because each day potentially leaves members exposed. If you have educated opinions about jurisdictions based on tax regimes and law, please chime in! If you have educated opinions about legal vehicle structure (including how to maintain the primacy of the MKR tokens regardless of equity structure), please chime in! This is an urgent issue where inaction has potentially catastrophic downsides, and action has the potential to allow Maker to more efficiently operate in RWA, fixed income, and anything else not on-chain. In particular, if we are interested in an ambitious new direction for MakerDAO, then we will need a firm foundation to interact with counterparties, shield our workforce from ruinous financial risk, and have definitive answers to claims of taxable burden.

                    "content": "Agreed with @PaperImperium that we need to step up our legal strategy efforts. The discussion is obviously heating up in the US and I\u2019m not going to speculate with hypotheses here, but, for me there is one important thing we should keep in mind when considering these matters: Any path that leads to legal AML/KYC requirements on the Dai token itself, should be a non-starter. The Dai token is of course fully permissionless and cannot be changed in its current form. But it\u2019s not unthinkable that the wrong strategic choices on the legal front could lead to a future where the current ERC20 token, under legal pressure, is decoupled from the core protocol and a new, permissioned version is deployed. If that happens, we should just trigger emergency shutdown, call Dai a failed experiment and give up. Free and borderless transactions with Dai, accessible to the unbanked, high inflation economies, etc. is the core of our value proposition. Any taxation and even liability considerations should be secondary to that. In a world where CBDCs will be the official legal tender and every individual value transaction will be up for scrutiny by law enforcement, Dai has to be the free alternative or it should not exist. Because the digital age makes absolute surveillance an option, this will become an issue as important as free speech. The other thing I\u2019ll say is that panic is rarely a good adviser. If individual DAO members (MKR holders) feel personally uncomfortable with legal risk, maybe we should consider constructions that can put their participation as MKR voters on hold while the storm is raging, avoiding them to quit altogether. In times of panic, at time-out can be very helpful. One way could be to deposit MKR tokens in a contract that locks them up and makes the retrieval dependent on the outcome of the US legal situation, putting a substantial risk of forfeiture in place that would remove any tax obligations. In case of forfeiture, another form of compensation can be considered. Or the forfeiture condition could be completely unrelated to the legal outcome, linked instead to some performance metric of the protocol. The Sagittarius engine proposal has similarities to this. (I just made these mechanisms up as thought experiments so don\u2019t take my word for it, but I want to illustrate the direction in which we can think here.) ",

I think this is a great post. I 100% agree with the ideas. Even if the US goes crazy with its legislation, we don\u2019t necessarily need to change to core values of MakerDAO. The USA is not the only country in the world.   DAI (not Maker) should be 100% decentralised. As @rune said in a recent interview with Grayscale: MakerDAO kind of decouples bitcoin into two parts:  DAI, which is a decentralised (as Bitcoin, in an ideal world) asset, but stable MKR, which is the speculative asset.

How about this construction for shielding US MKR holders:   It\u2019s possible to lock up your MKR in a contract which removes your voting power.   You get it back after a set period of time, on the condition that emergency shutdown hasn\u2019t been triggered in the meantime.   You receive a small interest rate for the opportunity cost.   The lock-up period is automatically extended at the end of the term with a new term, unless you explicitly indicate that you want to withdraw at the end of the current term.   The contract is 100% permissionless.   If your MKR is in the contract, you\u2019re covered by the self-insurance fund.   Emergency shutdown is a credible risk of forfeiture. And if ES is triggered, any MKR holders fate is up to the social contract anyway so you don\u2019t lose much. I think this should remove any taxation obligations due to the forfeiture condition, and the liability risk because it removes voting power (control). This is a simple contract to develop and could be deployed in a matter of weeks. Only the interest rate and the self-insurance fund features require permission from Maker governance. Anyone could develop and deploy their own version without those features today to get started. (Don\u2019t put all your MKR in a contract you developed in a day.) ",

We have cash for fines and even a draconian enforcement action then tells us what we need to remedy. Our problem is mainly that of liability and taxation. Maker in the US will almost assuredly be seen as a general partnership. I have yet to hear a lawyer say It would not be. That leaves all members on the hook for any perceived damages, taxation, and possibly criminal activity. I\u2019m not sure about you, but I don\u2019t think anyone here has the money to pay the IRS if they decide that Maker is a US entity and decide to treat as income the $400+ million batch of tokens provided by the Foundation. My understanding is the only way around this is simply that Maker itself meet any claimed obligations. If we wanted to dispute them, that would also be best handled at the level of any supposed general partnership \u2014 otherwise you have partners cutting deals to avoid being left holding the bag . So we need a shield around all our members \u2014 not only those who live in or have seizable assets in the US. We also need to definitively establish jurisdiction for Maker to live in so we don\u2019t suddenly find not just the US, but multiple countries claiming Maker owes taxes on the same income. Nothing about this says the protocol itself has to change. Or our internal governance processes. Or even whether DAI is decentralized, as the GC at dydx kindly reminded us that simple filings of required paperwork don\u2019t count as managerial efforts. But the first level of compliance is paying taxes \u2014 preferably in a single jurisdiction we choose now and not half a dozen that decide they can pick on a stateless DAO. And the first level of protecting our members and workforce is to have an entity that can stand between them and authorities/civil courts. We can figure out whether and how to do less basic stuff once we know what laws do/do not apply to Maker \u2014 much of which will be affected by jurisdiction and domicile. ",

There\u2019s no way to force someone to join such a group, and there is also no way for such a group to control Maker Governance. However, I do think, as Wouter also suggested above, that it makes sense for Maker to dedicate resources and make a commitment to proactively protect MKR holders in the US who may otherwise get spooked and dump their tokens, or quit their jobs in Core Units.

As for the US specific comments, it appears that the US government doesn\u2019t know how to regulate this space but is intent on making noise about it. This is leading to panic decisions by other protocols, such as 1inch and dydx who are now asking you to sign that you aren\u2019t in the US if you want to use their platform. That might make sense once there is regulatory clarity - right now, it\u2019s not! ",

Any moves in this direction should not be rushed in a panic and instead need to be carefully scrutinized from every angle. Frankly, I don\u2019t think we community members, nor Core Unit contributors, are remotely qualified to speak on the credible threats to the DAO, its members, and the potential legal constructs that might mitigate those risks. Apologies if this comes across as insensitive, but I find it quite irresponsible how people in this thread are using arm-chair lawyer legal interpretations and media sound-bites to justify action. Any brash action could jeopardize years of carefully constructed legal positioning. This reinforces the need for one or more Legal Core Units who have the expertise to navigate through such complex issues. ",

Hi all together As this is my first post ever in the forum I\u2019m not quite sure if this is the right manner (even though @discobot was a great mentor). I read this article as part of my ongoing research project just a few days ago and stumbled into Maker. Let me introduce myself briefly. Currently I am in my final year of my undergraduate study program. During my studies I got deeper into crypto and developed a keen interest for the field of legal studies. Especially the field where crypto and the off-chain world meet is a bloody battlefield of legal challenges and fascinating to explore. As I wrote earlier, I just started writing my bachelors thesis. The topic of my research is the question: What makes a DAO and is it possible for a DAO to gain the legal status of a legal entity in Liechtenstein? Why exactly Liechtenstein you might ask? First I\u2019am studying and working in Liechtenstein. But especially regarding crypto Liechtenstein is one of the most forward pushing jurisdictions in the whole world as you might know already. Back in 2019 Liechtenstein introduced the token and trusted service provider act. A law made for blockchain and crypto. If you want to learn more here is a comprehensive summary. My current structure is split. First, I really want to present what a DAO is. To show really the core ideas and motivation (decentralisation, liberty, independence, innovation\u2026) why do DAO\u2019s exist. The second half will be a detailed analysis if the current law in Liechtenstein allows for a DAO without restricting fundamental ideas and motivation. If the answer is yes, I will propose a framework how to establish a DAO within the jurisdiction of Liechtenstein. If the answer is no, I\u2019ll put together a catalogue of suggestion for both the legislation, where law must be altered, or new laws have to be implemented to allow for a truly decentralised autonomous organization. And, for DAO\u2019s to better fit into the current corporate law of Liechtenstein (without restricting itself beyond the cause). I would love to use MakerDAO as my example to better explain the how and what of DAO\u2019s. And present my findings to the community. You would get a scientific researched and conducted legal analysis if MakerDAO could exist in Liechtenstein. I cannot give you a direct legal opinion as e.g., a corporate lawyer but maybe test the jurisdiction of Liechtenstein in the eyes of MakerDAO. Because I\u2019m relatively new to the whole crypto space and of course the DAO communities I would need some mentorship, members who are willing to answer question about DAO\u2019s, history of MakerDAO, structure\u2026 furthermore guide me into the right directions where I can find more literature or things I could check for more ideas. In short give me guidance and navigation along the way. I would really like to contribute to the cause of MakerDAO. If you read until here, please feel free to share your opinion about it and connect me to people who might be interested. I hope this thread is rightfully placed and @discobot bot will not sentence me. ",

For me, finding the \u201cperfect\u201d legal wrapper for a DAO makes little sense, as DAOs (digital, transnational, decentralized, fluid ) and legal entities ( paper based, national, centralized, rigid)  are inherently contradictory. Submitting a DAO to a particular jurisdiction would defeat its purpose.  However, finding appropriate legal structures at the periphery of the DAO that wrap specific functions, product features or specific Core Units (which could be considered as mini DAOs) makes a lot of sense, specially for mitigating liability and tax risk. We are looking at structures like US Unincorporated Non Profit Associations  (@SES-Core-Unit  will host in December a public call with Miles Jennings GC from a16z who recently proposed this structure), Delaware series LL.Cs, Cayman Foundations, Swiss Associations (Verein) and other hybrid structures (Wyoming\u2019s DAO LL.C.,Open Law\u2019s Ricardian LL.Cs .) each valuable for specific use cases.

Your point about the fact that DAO\u2019s might be too different to be put in the context of souverain national law is something to think about. But with what I am learning about the DAO e.g., \u201cCase for clean money\u201d DAO\u2019s will need a way to interact easier in the off-chain world, so at some point some kind of legal structure is needed. But this is exactly why I build this two-sided approach. I do not want to put a DAO into the bag of some countries legislature but want to explain to people why this would and in your own words: \u201cdefeat the purpose\u201d. And I prepared myself already for the very certain possibility that a DAO like Maker cannot exist in the legislature of Liechtenstein. At least this is what I keep telling myself  Another circumstance which at least from my understanding makes the whole topic quite interesting is what is \u201cmost important\u201d and what is not making \u201ca big difference\u201d with regard to e.g., location of the DAO, liability of members, statues, tax implementations. Do you think I should make my own thread where I post updates, ask for input & more. Because right now I think it collides a little bit with the general topic of this thread. ",

In which jurisdictions are the people who are involved? SES has mostly been working with Core Units to connect them to outside council to advise them on specific questions.
