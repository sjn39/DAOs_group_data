Composable Superfluid streams turn the velocity of tokens up to its absolute max - frictionless forwarding of streams.    Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):  Superfluid is builder-centric. We are a developer tool and all of our focus is on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, we are additive to Optimism\u2019s own goals. Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals and Lending.   Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):   How will the OP tokens be distributed?  We would use the allocation to help treasuries move to L2, and start streaming salaries to their teams (in this case we would stream them the rewards, so we can keep the expenditure fairly controlled!). This will bring TVL, but also real-world use-cases We\u2019d also put aside a small amount for grants for apps in our ecosystem to deploy on optimism (i.e. Ricochet, Diagonal, future apps)   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  Salaries and real-world payments like subscriptions are a continuous source of usage, beyond market cycles. Composable Superfluid streams turn the velocity of tokens up to its absolute max - frictionless forwarding of streams   Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Payments like subscriptions or salaries aren\u2019t short-term minded. An incentive to move a treasury to L2 will get people over the initial mental and organizational hurdle (moving off L1), but they\u2019ll stick around for the utility!   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  We will be running the above incentives for 6 months and hope to return with a future request based on measurable successes   How much will your project match in co-incentives?  At the moment we aren\u2019t able to monetarily co-incentivize or we would have already! We believe L2s are the future, and have been campaigning with many teams to move their treasuries to L2 for over a year now.  ",

If the former, will the gas fees from bridging be reimbursed? Granting to dapps built on superfluid is a good idea too.  What % of the tokens will you allocate to that?  And how will you decide to whom to grant, and how much?  Will release of the tokens be contingent on deploying to Optimism? 100K OP won\u2019t go very far over the course of a year.  Compared to other proposals, your 100,000 token request is relatively modest despite incentivizing the type of behavior that the governance fund is designed to support.  I\u2019d encourage you to elaborate on your token distribution plan and increase your token request. Also consider allocating a portion of the tokens to marketing/outreach activities.  Not enough people know about streaming - if you can stimulate a bunch of lightbulb moments, the halo will extend to optimism and there\u2019s value there too. ",

Price is volatile and we dont know where it will be in next 6-8 Months, lets say that price doubled then you are not gonna return half of the token and similarly if the price goes down 50%, you will need more. Point being, as you are targeting a time frame of 1 year, does it make more sense to ask for half token now for 6 months and submit a new proposal again ? ",

I am not talking about  number of token, you know more about that than me, other delegates might also help with with that. What I trying to understand is why you need 12 Months of funding at once. Reduce it, may be 3 or 6 month, and submit another proposal with more data and statistics on what you have done with the first fund. Why I am bugging you is because you have a solid proposal, I see a niche and I do see that your project will add value of OP ecosystem, so getting this proposal passed will benefit us both. But its good to take input from others delegates as well, I know two of them are quite active here, tag them and get the opinion. They can also give you some input on number of token, let me know if you want me to tag them. ",

Ideally the draw of other projects to use on Optimism will keep them around too! For our ecosystem of projects, they will each have different models, but in general Superfluid doesn\u2019t attract mercenary capital as it\u2019s not \u201cyield farming\u201d and streams are long-term. Additionally we will be selective about who receives the OP tokens. There isn\u2019t much else that would make sense to do to lock people into Optimism from the Superfluid side IMO since we are a payment rail designed for maximum capital efficiency and minimum overhead.

Superfluid is a project that I\u2019ve tested out a little bit on Polygon and so I think I see the merit in this proposal as a way to migrate teams that are currently paying their salaries on the platform via a different network (such as Gnosis or Arbitrum). The amount of tokens requested is not large, but I do agree that it might make sense to reduce the initial period to 6 months and then reassess. If the number of people\u2019s salaries that are being paid on Optimism through Superfluid has increased significantly then there\u2019s no reason why the second allocation can\u2019t be larger than the first. Like SolarCurve said, I\u2019d be support this as it is, but it might just be more flexible for the project itself if you change to 6 months /150k then provide some kind of metric showing the change in use in a few months time and then apply for more based on usage and the value of OP at the time.

Seems like a really interesting project and admittedly being in Optimism would make even more sense than L1. At this point I have a simple question to only understand a bit better how the allocation will be used. My understanding right now is: You will use the tokens to incentivize building on superfluid (only in optimism) with 112,500 $OP (75%) and 37,500 $OP for salary incentives on the streams themselves. Question here. Salary incentives would be on both sender and receiver side of only one of them? And this will be for the first 6 months and then you may come back with another request. Correct? ",

We intend to stream funds to builders using Superfluid to give grants for them to deploy on Optimism and for salary incentives to web3 employees being paid in streams on Optimism. 75% will be allocated to projects within our community of builders for deploying on Optimism, in OP grants based on the amount of work required and the potential impact of the project, as judged by us in conversation with the relevant teams. We already offer extensive free developer support for builders and integrations and in addition, offer a totally free startup program called Superfluid Reactor where we offer startup advice, extra technical support and eventually partnership and investment introductions. The above grants may be combined with this programme if we see there is good alignment. 25% for salary incentives to employees will likely be a campaign we spend our own marketing dollars on, and likely divided equally between a certain total number of employees we aim to onboard to receiving salaries on Optimism (concrete details tbd).

We kicked off our Superfluid x Optimism Builder Grants in November Announcing Superfluid Builder Grants to Accelerate Money Streaming on Optimism | by Superfluid | Superfluid Blog | Medium and selected the winners on Jan 9th Announcing the Recipients of Our Superfluid Builder Grants for Optimism | by Superfluid | Superfluid Blog | Jan, 2023 | Medium, now we will be monitoring their progress to report back here. We are still working on an appropriate mechanism for implementing salary streaming incentives on Optimism, since a few early concepts were not viable after all, but we are closing in on a solution. We have not yet claimed any unused portions of the grant from OP Governance. ",
