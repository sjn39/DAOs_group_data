I am trying to begin drafting a skeleton for the manifesto from the notes and I thought it would be pragmatic to start with principles similar to the manifesto for agile software development. Please let me know your thoughts and what to change/add to. Hopefully together we can get some of this preliminary work done and then we can start having bi-weekly (twice every month) calls to get things going. Thanks @noot for helping proof read this  Principles of The Methods for Self Organized Development Cycles (SODC)  The highest priority is communication followed by process. Sharing knowledge by never saying no, always empowering individuals to participate in discourse. Self organization looks and feels different to different people, defining process and methodology for organizations is vital for decentralized development cycles. SODC is about the people; user, developer, designer, etc\u2026 needs come first. Inclusiveness as a mechanism for realizing individuals and collectives perspectives transparently. DoAcracy as a method for creating self determined and self regulated development cycles. This allows for the individuals of an organization to take responsibility for their day to day tasks through a self determined process. Milestones are a crucial aspect of SODC, allowing for team accomplishments to be celebrated. Whether the milestone was completed or not, the aim is to allow for an empirical study of the current SODC process being implemented. A transparent and open process between all aspects of the development cycle is expected. Ensuring research, design, implementation, etc\u2026 are all working together and not against each other. For SODC to be effective, it is important to collaborate with the wider open source ecosystem. Separate teams working on similar, dependent or complementary works should collaborate and share knowledge for the benefit of the larger community and in turn as members of the community help themselves optimize their development cycles. In SODC teams operate by respect, not rank. Teams must come to consensus on the definition of done, for clear outcomes to be understood by the entire team.  ",

One thought I have is the use of the terms Self Organization and Decentralized. I see why it is important to call out the key principles/methods of this initiative w/ the acronym SODC. But as this initiative starts to form an enduring Ring, perhaps the name of the Ring should only reflect the most essential part of the problem domain that is being addressed. Perhaps then: \u201cDevelopment Cycles Ring\u201d. Using a short name for the Ring makes it a lot easier to refer to, and makes it more accessible to newfolk. The Self Organized Development Cycles acronym and other terminologies can be used in the writing once the reader understands the bigger picture. As people get drawn in, they\u2019ll begin to pick up on the principles and methods\u2026 and if they\u2019re in Ethereum they\u2019ll probably already have a lot of that baked-in! ",

I think @jpitts suggestion for calling the ring \u201cDevelopment Cycles Ring\u201d does a great job of addressing the fundamental unifying characteristic between all decentralized, distributed, autonomous or agile teams which is the development cycle itself.

What\u2019s the best way to get everyone\u2019s email?   A weekly call would be amazing! Instead of rocketchat could we use riot.im? It\u2019s basically like gitter so conversations can be open to the public. Though I really like using the FEM discourse so people not fully active in the ring can still participate. We could also have a live streamed zoom call that we coordinate here or even create a github org so all our info can be public and forkable/maintainable by anyone. ",

As Scrum teaches, the most important part of the process that allows for teams to self organize around milestones is to allow for an empirical study of the actual process. Whether or not  the milestone was accomplished, the whole point is not to achieve meaningless milestones and have a party. The point is to refine the process so we can learn and grow as empowered individuals. ",

Then we should try to adopt this classical role to our reality without reinventing the wheel.   To answer all your questions, I would say that in blockchain it is much more than just depending on one another. It is about realizing that only together can we solve these problems. My big concern is that when we realize a lot of these projects we won\u2019t continue this open collaboration. In regards to the specifics, I would say that specific roles like a PM are not necessary to specify as SODC to me is more akin to Agile Principles than a Scrum framework. This is not about reinventing the wheel, we have already done that by partaking in the web3.0 paradigm. This to me is about making observations based on what we do and are doing and trying to create principles around it.     Ethernian:  Do we missing that part in our ecosystem?   It is the adhoc nature of these self organized calls like the Plasma Implementers Call that makes this process so unique. A lot of the time members of the Ethereum Foundation are involved, but it is individuals that have decided to self organize in these working groups.     Ethernian:  I would prefer to find and adopt existing experience instead of reinventing the wheel.   Everything I have written has been inspired by the manifesto of agile software development, not sure what you mean by reinventing the wheel. This is just building on pre existing processes in a way that tries to capture the nature of development cycles in web3.0. Thanks for the feedback! ",

Sharing knowledge by never saying no, always empowering individuals to participate in discourse.  By never saying no to what, a request for information? If that\u2019s the intent, I agree. However, there should be a way these requests are channeled, to reduce administrative burden, repeated requests and interruptions in deep work flow. At the same time, I do believe saying no is critical to getting work done, as it relates to setting effective priorities.  Self organization looks and feels different to different people, defining process and methodology for organizations is vital for decentralized development cycles.  Yes. The agreed to processes and methodologies will also vary to some extent, as every team and project is different, comprised of unique individuals.  SODC is about the people; user, developer, designer, etc\u2026 needs come first.  The unique needs of each group need to be considered and addressed too. Striking this balance is tricky, yet possible.  Inclusiveness as a mechanism for realizing individuals and collectives perspectives transparently.  Creating a safe environment for differing and sometimes conflicting points of view needs to be created. Doing this allows for the effective manifestation of solutions exponentially more effective than the simple sum (and trade-offs) of individual opinions.  DoAcracy as a method for creating self determined and self regulated development cycles. This allows for the individuals of an organization to take responsibility for their day to day tasks through a self determined process.  There should be some overall and agreed-to organizing principles and priorities though.  Milestones are a crucial aspect of SODC, allowing for team accomplishments to be celebrated. Whether the milestone was completed or not, the aim is to allow for an empirical study of the current SODC process being implemented. A transparent and open process between all aspects of the development cycle is expected. Ensuring research, design, implementation, etc\u2026 are all working together and not against each other. For SODC to be effective, it is important to collaborate with the wider open source ecosystem. Separate teams working on similar, dependent or complementary works should collaborate and share knowledge for the benefit of the larger community and in turn as members of the community help themselves optimize their development cycles.  This is key in minimizing duplication of effort.  In SODC teams operate by respect, not rank.  Yes!  Teams must come to consensus on the definition of done, for clear outcomes to be understood by the entire team.  Yes! It sounds simple, yet is often overlooked. Projects can linger for a long time at what I call the last 10-15%. This is when the project is 85%-90% done, yet the last 10-15% takes as much effort as the first 85-90% to finish. It\u2019s also a time where scope creep can prevent the last 10-15% from ever getting finished, i.e. \u201cMaybe we can get this in, now that we\u2019re almost done\u2026\u201d   ",

I think a major difference is the process in which these products are built. Our only user facing product is a wallet app which we started at ETHDenver and have been building out ever since. We plan on integrating different layer 2 projects, meaning we have to be aware of the current research and development that is out there and potentially work with different teams to help us integrate these features. I believe this is a unique aspect of the web3 product domain, what are your thoughts?     JamesZaki:  how far do protocol developers go to anticipate end-user product-needs, and how these might feed into the protocol?   I think as protocol developers and or people who build developer tools, we need to always think about how real people will end up using these things. If we do not allow for features that developers want to build for users to be a part of our tooling, I believe we are failing.

I believe this is a unique aspect of the web3 product domain, what are your thoughts?   Agreed, the movement of underlying dependencies is more rapid in web3 than regular open-source development. To add to the question, I\u2019m also wondering if the decentralised ethos comes into play when developing products. For those making a product for the sake of a token jammed into it, we\u2019ll probably see the same centralised product decisions being made. But for those building for the decentralised future, I wonder how product decisions and vision differ. Would open-source DApp developers prefer making white-label products that can then be branded by anyone who wants to use it (whilst still giving credit where it\u2019s due), or is that too idealistic an assumption to make? Also how developers in this space take to familiar product visions vs more ideal decentralised products, and where this touches upon feasibility. Plenty to ponder ",
