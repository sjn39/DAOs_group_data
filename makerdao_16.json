I got a hoodie from Jeremy. I had to pay some customs. Are you thinking of shipping to people in Europe from Europe to avoid those costs? It is tricky to pay for a gift. 24:24 - Antarctica: Is Maker coming to India? 24:45 - Someone (from chat): Are you planning to expand on digital swags aka NFCs 25:52 - Brian MacMichael: I see this as a grassroots marketing arm from a business perspective. In the past, we have had an enterprise marketing approach. Still, the guerrilla-style marketing that is proposed here is more crypto native. You are going to build more engaged fans who are then going to promote the message for us. If you create this good image out there, we do not have to do it. It would be good for MakerDAO and all of us. 27:18 - Payton Rose: Can you expand on the facilitator role? What differentiates this as a Core Unit as opposed to just applying for funding? 30:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you comment on what you are planning to do on the first three months? 32:23 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Some of the incubees on the SES Incubator team said it would be nice to receive something. I am guessing that is the same for PE or other CUs. Potentially there could be some cross coordination between different CUs or partnerships. 34:07: Payton Rose: What about partnerships with existing CUs? Have you thought about how you could collaborate with others at all? For example, you could team up with Growth CU to work with the swag shop. 35:24 - Frank Cruz: Do you see yourself doing something outside of crypto, Twitter, Lisbon, or any of those events? Setting up a booth at festivals where you are going to give away free gear but maybe have the average public take a small test on their phone, make questions on Dai, etc.? 38:39 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Any preferred platform for people to reach out to you? Any last comments  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 39:36  Thank you to everyone for coming!   Credits   @gala produced this summary.

Welcome to Core Unit Launch Pod Session #17. My name is Juan, and I am the facilitator from SES CU. Today, we have a group that is very special to us. If they are voted in, that would mean that they are the first successful incubee coming out of the SES Incubator. I am personally very happy about this. Today we are with the DUX CU. They will be speaking more about their application, what they are doing and how they are trying to bring value to Maker.   For other episodes of CULPS, please check the forum.

Can you quickly say what it is and why is that important, and how will it work? 35:41 - Retro: I would love to hear your perspective on  solidifying talent within your team for L2 or collaborating with other CUs for that purpose for Governance? 37:03 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you comment on the legal side and why is this needed? Why a team like yours might be liable? Why is it a good practice to have a buffer? 38:27 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you speak about openness and transparency? Are you planning any open calls to discuss the backlog, how is evolving, discuss features, get feedback? What are your plans regarding that? 41:18 - Michael Aparicio: How many tokens do you have to pull to be part of the governing body? 43:11 - Frank Cruz: How do you plan to communicate with CUs when it comes to front-end and back-in integrations? Is that something that is going to be weekly, monthly? How is that going to work? Do you see any issues that can arise? 45:17 - Frank Cruz: Are you thinking of working something out with Maker Discourse, as far as making it easier and more attractive? 50:54 - Someone: Regarding the roadmap, is there anything on the radar regarding creating more transparency around what goes into an executive vote, especially the spell? What is the feature of the on-chain effects? Are there other mechanisms to improve the transparency for executive spells? 54:37 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you comment on the current status of the poll? 55:53 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Where is the good place to find you, submit questions, reach your team?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 57:22  We can keep the discussions going at the forum. For voting, go to the voting portal. Thank you to everyone for coming!

Since you are not asking for a budget, how do you prevent, for example, some low priority CU coming and saying: I need three full archive notes, and I am not going to even use them or some crazy request without charging for a budget? Since the money aspect is that the DAO pays for all these services almost for free for the CUs to use, how do you prioritize? 52:13 - Juan: What is the basic package of infrastructure and where do you draw the line? 54:55 - Frank: You are scaling to seven or nine employees. What is your strategy for onboarding the extra three, four, five people? Regarding burnout, how do you make adjustments in team size and with the working hours? 56:48 - Frank: Do you have a public roadmap? 1:00:53 - Someone: Do you have a status page or any  metrics you are tracking to quantify the work being done? 1:02:00 - Juan: Is there anything else that you would like to mention before closing the call?  Closing Comment  Juan  Outro 1:03:07  Dumitru shared a dashboard of the different services and tracking them online. We will see this MIPset going into formal submission for the next cycle. If anyone watching later has any questions or feedback, feel free to post it in the forum. Let us keep the conversation going. Thank you to everyone for joining.

Welcome to Core Unit Launch Pod Session #15. We are exploring the StarkNet Engineering CU. We are with Louis Merkle and the team. They will be explaining what they are working for. For other episodes of CULPS, please check the forum.   Presentation & Discussion  Louis Baudoin and Ohad Barta 00:40  1432\u00d7767 97.6 KB   MultichainEnvironment1440\u00d7777 121 KB   WhoIsStarkware?1440\u00d7779 124 KB   MakerOverStarkwareSummary1440\u00d7776 140 KB    10:08 - Payton Rose: In terms of the bridge, can you give some context on what it provides to the Maker community? Is there Dai on StarkNet right now? How are bridges occurring? How important is this bridge for the community?   11:47 - David Utrobin: What is the difference between Starknet and other L2s, specifically Arbitrum and Optimism?   15:39 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding Phase 1, is there any possibility that the results give you the idea that this should not continue? Say you reach a stage where you find out it is not worth pursuing and decide to stop everything. Is that under consideration?   17:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: You mentioned that there would be the need to re-evaluate the resources after Phase 1, right?   19:19 - PE team\u2019s perspective about the proposal - by Bartek   21:15 - Frank Cruz: Is this going to be rolled out as a Validium, not as ZK-Rollup, or the other way round?   24:12 - Payton Rose: I do not know if this is a question for PE or the StarkNet team. Have you considered testing the integration with the PSMs? This question might need to be addressed by PE.   25:55 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: This might also be a question for PE. Is it an industry standard to subsidize this type of project? For example, did DYDX pay for this, or was it something unique to Maker because of the CU setup?   28:26 - Planet_X: Regarding making a bridge, in this case, a Dai bridge between Ethereum and StarkNet, what is the core competency of making it? Why you and not anyone else?     RiskMitigation1440\u00d7790 113 KB    35:32 - Frank Cruz: About the fee structure, is Maker and StarkNet going to front the withdrawals? Is Maker expected to put up some of that money? Is that part of the reason why we are going to start with 1000 Dai?   41:16 - Frank Cruz: The gas optimization for DYDX is high. Has that come down at all? Do you have numbers of what is DYDX compared to DeversiFi?   43:14 - Someone: Can you elaborate on self-custodial bridges? How will that be achieved?   45:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: It is nice to see the endorsement from the PE. It signals that it has been reviewed by people we trust.   45:50 - Frank Cruz: Would it be possible in the future to find some way of giving back to Maker treasury Starkware tokens if they ever come into fruition? I am not sure if you can answer that.   47:16 - Frank Cruz: It would be good if you posted in the forum some agreement with the PE CU.   50:37 - Frank Cruz: What you are saying is that the StarkWare people are going to hand over any annotated coding? Learning Cairo is something PE will have to take up on their own, or is Starkware going to have a hand in that?   52:50 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: There is there Special Purpose Fund MIP (MIP55), which allows to draw Dai from the surplus buffer to get something done. If a risk or feasibility study needed to be done, this would be a potential route. I was wondering if you have considered that or you want to take the CU path?   54:45 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: For those interested, where can they find you? What is the best way to send you questions or comments?    Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 55:36  We keep the discussions going at the forum. Thank you, Louis, Ohad, and everyone else, for joining us. As always, really good comments and questions. I will see you around!   Credits   @gala produced this summary.

Welcome to the Core Unit Launch Pod Session. My name is Juan, and I am the facilitator of SES CU at Maker. I am here with people interested in Maker. This is episode #19. Today we are joined by the Deco Fixed Rate solution, and they are going to be explaining a bit more what Deco is and their proposal in the forum.

For example, Institutional Vaults set a fixed rate. How did they do that? Do they took the current stability fee and negotiated down from there? Are you saying this would provide more information in these decision-making environments? 8:06 - David Utrobin: Through the TLM, the rates are set via Maker Governance. Whereas with Deco, the claim fee token price is discovered on the free market. Is the free market setting the rates or Maker? 12:52 - A D: The reason the vote is not proceeding is that people are concerned that these are yield tokens. Yield tokens, similar to DSR, represent some potential regulatory risk. Could this be structured so that the concerns are abated and irrelevant to the product? 14:18 - A D: In terms of the growth strategy, you have already spoken to both Growth and Oasis. Can you talk about your conversation with Oasis? 15:49 - A D: We currently have the floor for the Dai debt that qualifies an Institutional Vault, and it is 200 million. Right now, there is not a means to have a scalable on-ramp. Nadia suggested implementing Deco to turn Institutional Vaults over to them and use it as a way to on-ramp smaller users so that they can have scalable means. Do you think that this could meet that requirement? 17:22 - David Utrobin: Is the fee token a yield token? Is there a regulatory risk? 19:13 - David Utrobin: You talked about the claim fee tokens having rate discovery in a free market. Where does that happen if you abstract it all away in the CDP Manager? 23:44 - A D: One thing that was overlooked in this proposal is your current collaboration with PE in the Sandbox project. Most voters are not aware that by funding Deco in this proposal, Deco will be the first external integration written into the core of Maker smart contracts. Part of what will come out of this is the first processing procedures in collaboration with PE and SES to enable parallel smart contract development, which is a pretty significant blocker and a feature that would be added. Could you talk about this? 28:17 - Rune: There is tension around the proposal as it is proposed with the fixed and performance payments. But also concerning the concept of competition between the different proposals and the concept of an official Maker fixed-rates designation and what that means in terms of favoring one project over the other. These dynamics are important to consider. Can you talk in that direction? 31:48 - Bruno: Could you go through the fixed costs? Is it a plan of three years, and is there a fee share? Can you give some details? 35:18 - Rune: Is it two million for a three-year period? Is this the salaries? 37:01 - Rune: What is the MKR amount in total? 37:40 - Rune: The cash is the salary that is doing the work. Does the MKR represent the bonus and it is the value that you are providing to Maker and sharing? 38:08 - Rune: The point is that eventually, this turns self-sustainable. There are two options. The communist option where Maker buys it out and runs it as this native thing that is the official Maker fixed-rates and status. That is where Maker goes for economies of scale, pays it all, does it all, and focuses everything on this approach. The other option is more of a free market. You took the risk in creating this proposal and bringing it to governance. Now you will fully de-risk the actual work or the next three years of building and integrating and setting it up. From there, it has been set up a fixed-rate protocol that has a team attached to it that is getting a profit share. Their goal will be to integrate that everywhere, spread it, grow it, maintain it, so they can keep getting that profit share over time.  When this profit share thing is in place, an additional implicit negotiation has to occur, an expectation that is part of it, which is Deco protocols integration into frontends around the ecosystem to the extent that Maker can influence that. If we assume that Maker cannot influence that, then this does not matter. Oasis will integrate whatever they want, whenever they want to integrate. Because it is a private company, they will integrate whatever gives them the cheapest rate. How much of Maker\u2019s stability appetite is funneled into this thing? This directly impacts the performance fee that you get. There is also a connection between that and the marketplace you create on the other side of people buying into it. Because Maker wants to lock in its fixed rates into the different markets. What do you think of that? 46:47 - Rune: What happens if Maker voters decide to off-board the CU? 49:50 - David Utrobin: If we were to not go with Deco, for example, and go with Pairwyse or TLM. How do we do it? Do we give Growth this initiative? Would they need their CUs? What is the best path for Maker from a business standpoint? So far, Deco has the incentives and everything kind of right, and I like where it is going. 53:24 - David Utrobin: Although Deco does not need PE in the same way the others might, would Deco still need to engage PE during solution design coordination? Is it that no matter what, there will be overlapping coordination that has to happen? 56:34 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Vamsi, what is the best way to reach you if there are any questions or comments?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 56:50  Thank you to all for coming. It was great having you. See you around.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.

Thank you for joining episode #23 of CULPS. I am Retro, a contributor with the SES CU at MakerDAO. Today I have the pleasure of being joined by Mano Ventura Barreira from the proposed Maker Talent CU. Maker Talent is a team that SES is currently incubating to address the needs of attracting top talent to MakerDAO. The need for Maker Talent is highlighted by another SES research project called X-Ray, where our team is mapping out the journey of contributors, specifically developers, from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Project X-Ray has invested months of effort into mapping out the developer journeys. Maker Talent will now introduce us to their CU mandate of unlocking comparable insights for all roles at the DAO.

It sounds like you will be conducting more stakeholder interviews with contributors rather than the facilitator. Is that true? 13:25 - Frank Cruz: Do you see yourself more as an HR team, where you are not only pulling in the best talent possible but also helping with the onboarding? Whew you learning how to report back to the MKR token holders but also being that in-between where you are having the best interest of the new hires coming into MakerDAO? 19:39 - Frank Cruz: How can we improve the slowdowns of onboarding and delaying productive new team members that you onboard? 21:59 - Frank Cruz: How does DAO should be incentivizing individuals to come and work on this side of the world? 24:51 - Someone: Could you talk about the work that you are doing with the CUs under there? 27:29 - Someone: Do you have a few examples of how you interact with the CUs and the results that we got from that? 33:53 - Someone: How do you surface the hiring needs within a DAO? Talking to the CUs will only give you these micro perspectives on their scope and problems but not necessarily at the level of the DAO. Is that something that you have been thinking about on how to deal with that? 38:10 - Someone: You brought the idea of the internal job market. Is that this idea of organizing the marketplace of opportunities in the one-hand candidates, on the other hand, to continuously reignite people\u2019s interests by presenting them with new opportunities within the DAO? 39:16 - Someone: Do you have examples of other companies and what they are doing, or is this like an own practice? 40:19 - Retro: Do you have any last thing to say?

What are the initial steps that you are envisioning that can make Maker\u2019s personnel security more robust? 34:36 - Retro: Do you have plans to expand, or is it something that you will shoulder and continue carrying for the near and mid future? 36:50 - Retro: What is your philosophy on proactiveness and reactiveness, especially with security? Do you have a defined framework that Immunefi follows to try to prioritize some of these tasks being reactive or proactive, or is it more of a case by case or protocol by protocol approach for developing that framework? 38:44 - Retro: Is there any last-minute thing that you would like to include? What is the best way to get a hold of you?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 39:43  We will update the forum post for the CULP call with the recording and relevant links to get a hold of you. I am very excited to see the outcome of the formal submission trending in the right direction and to see the work you produce. Thank you to everyone for joining the call, especially Travin and Joshua. I hope that everyone has a great rest of their day.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.

Welcome to Core Unit Launch Session episode #18. My name is Juan. I am the facilitator from SES CU. I am joined by a group of people interested in everything CU-related. Today we are with the \u201cto be\u201d team from MakerLabs CU. Collin Raddatz, Adam Urban, and Tim Schuppener will be telling us what all this is about. For other episodes of CULPS, please check the forum.

I do not see a roadmap beyond three months, and the value of the CU is still not demonstrated. It is important to understand and to demonstrate the value in advance of burning the ship. You do not burn the ship before it is too close to shore. I saw a one-quarter road map, and the cost is significant. 20:35 - Someone: What is the life cycle of eurDAI? You would take it, run it, get it operational. Then where does it go? Who maintains it? PE is quite backlogged. One of the issues with Maker is that the CU is the only structure. I heard from you that it would be analogous to being a third-party service provider, putting a proposal for each product forward, and then letting Maker sign off the projects and fund them. We do not have that structure. The CU is the most effective structure right now. The question is in two parts. What happens with the products after? Who is going to maintain them because we do not have that technical talent? Let\u2019s say on the fourth month, nobody is willing to take it on. Are you still going to operate eurDAI? Are you willing to do that and to commit to that? On the other side, what about doing these MVPs and testing? We need people who will own the projects end-to-end. Otherwise, we end up in a position where there is nobody to take it over, and we end up with a bunch of underdeveloped products. 23:46 - Frank Cruz: Is it fair to say that MakerLabs, this possible CU, can create a prototype but cannot maintain it? Is that correct? If you create the next prototype besides eurDAI, is this something that someone like PE will have to take over? Also, would it be possible to work with someone like StarkNet CU? How do you see the role of MakerLabs in the development of CK rollups, Layer2s? Do you have any experience in that, and can you build a prototype for that? Are you going to build the prototype and let someone else maintain it? 29:50 - Planet_X: How minimal is the minimal viable products (MVP)? Is it so minimal that only developers can play with it? Or will it include the graphical user interfaces and everything so that the wider community can interact with it? 32:55 - Planet_X: Let\u2019s say that the MVP is working but that nobody picks up on it in the Maker organization afterward. Would it be possible to use bug bounties - paying people to try to hack it - to harden the product for scaling it beyond the first handful of million eurDai? 35:06 - Planet_X: What is the longest project you have been involved with? 36:30 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the eurDAI, you mentioned something about doing legal research to see if it was feasible. Let\u2019s say that it is not for any given reason or that there will be too much risk involved for you three or the DAO in general. Do you have a Plan B to work on, or is it something that you would see down the line? 38:24 - Payton Rose: In terms of how you might be sourcing community input. Are you looking to get suggestions or ask from CUs? Is this something that is going to be more forum or call-based? Have you thought about that? 39:58 - RoJo: The first project that you will be working on is eurDAI. As you move along, you will assess whether or not that is a viable product based upon a variety of factors like inputs from the community, your team, and others. If you decide that it is not a project that you want to move forward with. Are you willing to take input and feedback from the community to work on whatever the next thing is that the community deems necessary for the protocol? 41:08 - RoJo: In a lot of organizations that I have been involved with, there have been labs, like you propose, or some sort of incubator or skunkworks that happens inside of the organization. The projects that they work on a lot of times are dictated by other factors besides the community. I heard several comments about how you like the bootstrap stuff. I appreciate that because I think innovations are needed in the protocol. At the same time, sometimes there is work that you do not like to do, but it is necessary. Can you give us your thoughts on that? We are not going to throw work and tell you what you have to work on without letting you have any input. I am not suggesting that at all. 44:17 - LongForWisdom: If the community decides or thinks we should be working on some other cool new awesome project rather than eurDAI. Would you consider moving to that? I am imagining a hypothetical scenario where the DAO suddenly decides that we are going in a whole new direction. If eurDAI does not fit into that direction for whatever reason, even before the black product market has been approved for eurDAI, would you consider moving to something else if it was something you are aligned with? 47:07 - Frank Cruz: If someone said that MakerDAO is more in need of maintenance and quality products versus prototypes. Because we need teams, CUs, that can make things from the start to go live and to be able to pivot. What would your answer be to someone who is an opponent to that? 48:59 - Frank Cruz: Besides the community giving you feedback, how do you get product/market fit for different regions of the world? South America has a different view on financial freedom versus Germany. How do you get a vision of what product/market fit DAI can play well in the sandbox? 51:00 - Frank Cruz: Is MakerLabs more designed for someone who is looking for the value proposition versus the grow proposition? 51:43 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: What is the best way to contact you for anyone watching this later? 52:12 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Anything else that the MakerLabs team would like to add?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 53:56  Thanks to everyone for coming. It was great having you. Let\u2019s keep the discussions going at forum.maker.com. I will see you everyone around.

Do you have plans to do these types of services for any of RWA integrations as well? 25:29 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the simulations you do, how do you simulate a situation like Black Thursday? You would need congestion, high prices, and inaccessibility. Is that even possible, or do you have to take each event separately and hope for the worst? 26:41 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding anything that is coming in the future and how you are managing your backlog, right now, you seem to be focused on users and accessibility, which is great, and I am happy to see that. Have you also considered any type of integrations with exchanges or any other type of automatic bots or keepers that would run these auctions as well? Can you comment on that a bit? 28:35 - Payton Rose: In terms of the MKR package, is that going to be distributed to the company of Sidestream, or is it going to individual contributors? 29:13 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the process where we are, the proposal is in RFC. What is your idea and your plan to move forward? Is it to get feedback from the community? Are you in campaigning mode and trying to show the value? What is the stage here? 30:07 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: What is the best way of reaching out for anyone watching the recording? 31:11 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Are you going to set up any channels for the community to reach out to propose, for example, new features? Do you have any plans for that? Can you comment on it?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 31:56  Thank you for presenting. I see your progress quite often from the SES perspective. It is always great to comment a bit and to share with the broader Maker community. Thank you for taking the time to be here. Let us keep the discussions and the feedback going at forum.makerdao.com.
