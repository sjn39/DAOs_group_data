                    "content": "@gcolvin @Anlan @bitsbetrippin, It is now quite apparent that ASICs will dominate the network within the next few months. The recent rise in hash rate can be contributed to the A11 Innosilicon miner that started shipping last year and now the Linzhi Phoenix Miner is shipping in January. These miners are over 46% more efficient than the latest 3000 series Nvidia GPUs and represents a major centralization security risk. At the ACD#82 meeting it was decided to roll out EIP-1057 to testnet and be ready for implementation if needed and keep it in the \u201cback pocket if ASICs become a concern.\u201d In light of the new extremely efficient ASICs being rolled out, we now need to take action immediately. The longer we wait the more ASIC miners get sold, the higher risk to network security, and the more people who will be hurt if they buy them and then there is an algo change. I have requested EIP-1057 implementation discussion to be added to the next ACD #105 meeting agenda on 2/2/2021 here: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/241 Here are the hard facts on ASICs as of now compared to GPU mining Efficiency Best GPU miner - 3060TI 62MH@130W - Efficiency = 0.47 GH/W Linzhi Phoenix ASIC miner 2600MH@3000W Efficiency = 0.87 GH/W Innosilicon A11 8GB 2000MH@2300W Efficiency = 0.87 GH/W ASIC Power Efficiency Advantage = 46% more efficient Cost 42x3060TI@ 62MH = 2604MH 42x3060TI@ $550 = $23,000 42x3060TI@ 130W = 5,460W Linzhi Phoenix ASIC $12,900 + 25% tariff if US Innosilicon A11 ASIC $15,500 +25% tariff if US A GPU miner would have buy 42x3060Tis at $10K more to achieve the same hash. However as captured above in efficiency, electricity costs would be double. Ethereum network is now on a ticking time bomb of when not if ASICs will take over. My comparison does not take into account additional costs of running 42 GPUS, from MBs to PSUs, RAM, CPUs etc. Most of us are using 8-13 GPUs per rig so this would be at least 5 rigs. Then there is the work it takes to set them up and maintain them versus plugging in a single ASIC and PSU. ASIC Purchase Cost Advantage = 44% lower purchase cost When ProgPow was being discussed Linzhi published this paper against ProgPow all the while they were developing and probably already making next gen ETHash ASIC miners. Time has a way of revealing ones intentions. https://linzhi.io/docs/LWP15-Posts-Against-ProgPoW-05092019.pdf Linzhi Phoenix ASIC miner 2600MH@3000W image975\u00d7599 89.8 KB Innosilicon A11 8GB 2000MH@2300W image1380\u00d7840 168 KB ",

ASICs owner (like all miners) make money from ETH having a high value, and if the price of ETH was to drop to much, their hardware being specific could not be repurposed (unlike GPU which have a value outside of ETH minning).

I\u2019ll copy part of my post from a different thread, because I think it is relevant for the incentives that @Amxx asks for:  I know some of the devs here do not look favorably towards GPU miners. But when the time comes to switch to PoS you\u2019ll be better off with a network made up of GPU miners, than a network filled with these ASIC monstrosities. Since other Ethash-based currencies are worthless, these ASICs would become instant paperweights. As such, ASIC miners will have every incentive to delay, derail and prevent PoS. We saw the force of the ASIC propaganda machine when they essentially killed EIP-1057 (ProgPow). GPU miners, meanwhile, will have other options:  Mining a different coin. Selling the GPUs to gamers / creators / researchers Giving back by doing Folding@Home or similar.  Especially with current EIP-1559 pushing to reduce miner profits, weeding out the (least profitable) hobby GPU miners and promoting a network of centralized ASIC dominance.  Other concerns regarding ASICs can of course be found in the Ethereum Whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin [1]:  [on Bitcoin:] First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in.  And the Ethereum Yellowpaper by Dr. Gavin Wood[2]:  One plague of the Bitcoin world is ASICs.  These are specialized pieces of compute hardware that exist only todo a single task (Smith [1997]).  In Bitcoin\u2019s case the task is the SHA256 hash function (Courtois et al. [2014]).  While ASICs exist for a proof-of-work function, both goals are placed in jeopardy.  Because of this, a proof-of-work func-tion that is ASIC-resistant (i.e.  difficult or economically inefficient to implement in specialised compute hardware)has been identified as the proverbial silver bullet.  Where Wood refers to ASICs jeopardizing the two design goals of Ethereum\u2019s PoW:  Firstly, it should be as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.  The requirement of, or reward from, specialized and uncommon hardware should be minimized. Secondly, it should not be possible to make super-linear profits, and especially not so with a high initial barrier.  Both of which are in danger since the above mentioned ASIC:  Is highly specialized, generally inaccessible Provides super-linear profits over current GPUs with an enormous initial barrier: hard to obtain, and $15000.

We understand PoW on ETH is ending \u2122, but we can carry on elsewere and we would wish ETH the best in their new direction.

If there is no community will now to remove ASIC\u2019s from Ethereum, the chances of removal dwindle by the day, as more ASIC\u2019s are put forth until we find ourselves in a BCH-like schism like Bitcoin dealt with a few years back.

                    "content": "    lmaonade80:  Well, I actually disagree that the same argument works considering mining and therefore progpow is moot after ETH 1.x and many mechanisms from 1559 will live on in ETH2 chain.   The fact that the entire yellow paper that Ethereum was founded on explicitly calls out ASICs as a \u201cplague\u201d and the developers did NOTHING as POW sunsets while ASICs gain over 90% hash will have long lasting consequences. Consequences that show developers were unwilling to stand for something so simple as what they were founded on. Yes 1559 will be carried into 2.0 but will be quickly changed when stakers pay developers to give validators the fees instead of burning them as this was only for miners, not stakers. ",

I am really not sure why so much effort is going to go into forcing a switch to POS by ASIC miners when the simplier solution is to just make an algo change ASAP and GPU miners will welcome POS as we have always stated we would.
