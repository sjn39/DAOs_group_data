My opinion is that doing a last minute collateral onboarding is fraught with a lot of risk at this point (centralization risk on the stablecoins) and will be slow to complete.   We need to stick with the things that are reasonably quick to do and are more known than unknown. But good to have a thread opened to talk about this. ",

Having any of the others doesn\u2019t allow use to re-capitalize Dai (which is the whole point of the FLOP auctions.) What we could do is add a stablecoin as collateral which would allow market makers to lock said stablecoin and mint Dai. This Dai could then be used for the FLOP auctions. However as MakerMan said above, there is risk involved with this. ",
