The assumption here is that at a high enough level of liquidity, the peg will be more robust and governance/community can turn its focus to other things like adoption, fiat on-ramp etc. Some initial thoughts to kick start the discussion:   MKR yield comes from existing foundation reserves and/or inflation   lobby comp/aave to add MKR as collateral so that existing holders can borrow against and participate in yield farming as well   yield is exponentially proportional to vault\u2019s age \u2026 so drive-by farming whales don\u2019t make much yield. example: a 2-year old vault gets 4X yield as a 1-year-old vault   a {Dai, USDC} reserve is created, aiming to keep ~10% of Dai market cap; this reserve is used to buy Dai with USDC or sell Dai into USDC to modulate the peg   negative interest rates are introduced   the yield farming contracts are not built anew, tried and tested contracts in DeFi can be used; this allows the farming program to launch quickly without worrying about introducing potential vulnerabilities to existing code base.

A possibility will be to make a re-deployment of most part of the platform, with MKR2 tokens, and supported by the same team and community, that means, MKR holders will vote on the new platform, new MKR2 holders will be able to vote only in that version of the platform.

I think all numbers within MakerDAO are in a great place right now(yes, even MKR price). We don\u2019t have to take the the sentiment created by a few trolls on Twitter seriously. We should just continue to grind as we\u2019ve been doing the past five years and devote our time to serious new experiments like RWAs etc. Having said that, i think we could always launch experiments with new tokens and introduce them through fair yield farming launches.

                    "content": "I think the general idea is interesting and worth thinking about.  I am a bit conflicted, and have some random thoughts below: Arguments against   The 100B Dai Marketcap is probably out of the question short term\u2013it would imply a raise in the debt ceilings for our current vaults significantly, which would add a lot of additional risk.   The system is currently growing organically without the need for yield farming incentives, which is generally a bootstrapping mechanism to attract greater initial capital or a large uptick in locked value.  Even without this mechanism, Maker has the largest TVL in DeFi, which means we have reached product market fit. That being said, a yield farming program could lead to manic levels of growth, albeit short-term (as soon as the yield farming ends).  This manic level of growth doesn\u2019t really jive well with our debt ceilings, which basically limits growth to account for risk.   I also do wonder how this would effect the MKR price, since MKR is not the asset that is locked in yield farming, but rather dumped by the farmers once acquired.   Arguments for   Retroactively rewarding users who have used and bootstrapped the Dai Credit system, is, IMO, a great thing to do and part of the DeFi ethos.  This was impossible in the early days of Maker because MKR existed prior to the Dai Credit System deployment.   If the idea is to grow Dai supply and accrue fees from this growth, special \u2018yield farming\u2019 vaults could be created, with high fees to account for greater risk.  This would directly lead to the yield farming program generating revenue for the protocol.  If we could successfully offset the costs, this investment just might be worth it.   Here\u2019s a really naive example: lets say we use 50k MKR for the yield farming program.  At a price of $600 USD, this is a $30M opportunity cost.  If the \u2018yield farming\u2019 vaults have a debt ceiling of $500M, and fees at 10%, thats $50M in annual fees.  At $1B & 10% fees we would see $100m in fees.  We can play with the numbers obviously, but these fees burn MKR that would be minted for yield farming & more.   ",

The benefits of yield farming, especially when applied to Maker, are less about artificially pumping usage and TVL in the short term, and more about distributing MKR to loyal users, so they become more vested in the protocol rather than just use it until something more flashy comes along. Also to avoid stupid abuse the amount thats being distributed in MKR should obviously be less than the stability fees, so people dont just recycle money to farm and dont actually use the product. But if yield farming is done right, users will just see the MKR as a \u201cbuy 1 get 1 free\u201d type of free bonus that gets them more aligned with the long term success of the protocol. Also strategically it would be a good idea to try to time this before compound launch their \u201cmaker killer\u201d attempt, since it will obviously benefit from heavy yield farming right from the start that might give it a shot at a \u201cvampire mining\u201d type of attack similar to sushi vs uniswap.

I am no never a friend of liquidity mining like compund did: depositing and lending just to earn rewards might be a good choice to attract capital but as DAI marketcap growth seems fine right now it seems simply not necessary to attract more volume. But what I would like to see is an increase in number of users. The number of vaults have more than doubled during 2020 but still the growth in users is lagging behind the growth in capital. Cause it\u2019s quite expensive due to the high gas price many potential users with not-so-deep-pockets might stay away cause its not worth the gas to take out e.g. 2k Dai. This could be overcome if we offer some kind of incentive for opening a vault, possibly also for deposit and withraw. Thereby I would favor an incentive which isn\u2019t dependend on the amount (or just within a small range to avoid fake accounts that are never intended to be used) but given per tx. ",

                    "content": "I think a good approach that could avoid the compound style recycling, is to have the yield farming be dependent on stability fees paid and be e.g. 50% of stability fees. So e.g. if you pay 2.5% per year in stability fees on your eth-a debt, you farm 1.25% of the value of your eth-a debt as MKR. Basically it halves the cost of your debt, but the rebate is given to you in MKR which is more fun and interactive, and potentially will create a lot of MKR holders who will then buy even more MKR, or just be more aligned with the protocol and less likely to switch to a competitor. Maker will always be earning a profit all in all, but the difference is that the MKR holders will be using MKR rewards to subsidize growth which means an overall lower profit, in return for more users and more long term value, and especially more long term community members who hold MKR ",

Thinking about the volume, not only the market cap of tether but even more your proposed 100B gives me some headache\u2026What kind of securities can be used? USDC might not the best idea although it will be minted in large quantities if incentive is fine. Paying to backup the maker system with a competitor coin doesn\u2019t seem resonable to me. Ether and btc vaults are the other possible sources, cause of their market cap but still\u2026a volume of 100B?..this means about 150B locked value, i.e. more than the whole ether marketcap even after todays bull run. And regarding btc we have only access to the bridged part of it\u2026and another problem I see: If the stories about tether-driven btc bull runs are at least partially correct especially btc might depriciate if tether fails. So still much to think about, but having some more thoughs about a possible tether failure seems worth the effort.     aliatiia:  This is an interesting point, the challenge here is sybil resistance however   this can be easily overcome by installing a limit (amount and maybe time) which you have to deposit and ofc the incentive shouldn\u2019t be too high.
