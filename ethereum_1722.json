I am EOS Classic from alternative EOS mainnet development team, and today I would like to suggest new improvement proposal for Ethereum! We all know that difficulty bomb is a cancer for ethereum since it meant to work for casper upgrade however it is now ending up with significant transaction delay & mining centralization that comes from high difficulty. Therefore it will likely end up harming user experience if we don\u2019t change the difficulty adjustment algorithm on this Constantinople hardfork. And we should change the issuance of ethereum block reward that goes to miners in order to respond for casper upgrade and supply plan. Ethereum is now dominating more than 90% of mining hashrate share on ethash algorithm coins, it should be changed. For detailed information please refer my EIP here EIP-1276: Eliminate Difficulty Bomb and Adjust Block Reward on Constantinople Shift and please feel free to discuss about this EIP  ",

I understand that the difficulty bomb means more work for alternate chains as you have to coordinate hard forks on your own, but that shouldn\u2019t concern the main chain. Are you developing your own client node software? Are you basing it on Geth or Parity? Have you contributed any open source code or pull requests to improve Ethereum so far? The All Core Devs call that I sat in on last Friday had a good discussion on this. Getting the community to HAVE to take an action (specifically a hard fork) every 12 - 18 months is a good forcing function. This seems like a good thing. ",

We can hardfork ethereum for the proper upgrade & bug fix if we want, and we shouldn\u2019t rely on diff bomb for forking it, forcing miners to upgrade their node.   Last year difficulty bomb caused so many problem on relaying the transactions, dropping 1/2 performance of tps. If the difficulty bomb is intended to force the upgrade, it should not affect the whole performance and gasprice like last year, therefore I am suggesting to remove completely before we fork again otherwise unpredictable transaction delay will harm the whole ecosystem of ethereum And yes more work is great for chains however think of uncountable sidechains of ethereum that is working on the standard protocol that ethereum is using now, for sidechain development removal is needed also.
