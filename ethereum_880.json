                    "content": "Hi all Ethereum Magicians, I\u2019ve been talking about EIP process with @tintinweb for a while, mainly on the security consideration requirements. Also I have been passively reading on EntEthAlliance, OASIS progress https://notes.ethereum.org/Domx9MXtQNGjK_RIQPBMNg, and other similar initiatives. I applied for a HotRFC (https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/105/hotrfc/) session in IETF 105 Montreal meeting and got in. The session will only be for 4 minutes intro talk and hopefully get some interest to get IETF participants to discuss further on this subject in a side meeting (BarBof). I would like to get as much feedback as possible before this talk, mainly on what aspects of the EIP process could use input from IETF giants. But feel free to comment on anything related here. Here\u2019s our proposal: 11. Democratic Improvement Proposals for decentralization projects  Shayan Eskandari  Blockchain and DLT* based systems are waiting in the wings to join the potpourri of core technology that makes up our future digital lives. Both core internet infrastructure technology and many DLT solutions have one thing in common: They are developed with a diverse open source developer community and carry significant security risk. To manage software change related risks both Bitcoin and Ethereum - the second ranked cryptocurrency market - have derived their own process of managing change proposals. For Ethereum changes are discussed and agreed upon in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. However given the non-hierarchy management model, there have been many approaches and obstacles to make this process as close to a democratic procedure as possible. It is working, but far from perfect and there are many good approaches and lessons learnt. EIP requires input from experts at IETF to shape up and standardize.  This proposal is to introduce the EIP process to IETF participants and possibly spring up a BarBof session. For now please feel free to email us to discuss this further, we will create a mailing list when the scope is more defined.
