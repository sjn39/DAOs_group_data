This leads to an interesting question: should there be a different process for deciding on modification to the state data?  Perhaps the addition of a line stating that EIPs are not meant to propose changes to the state of Ethereum, only the Protocol itself, might assuage this concern of \u201cbailout\u201d proposals being a problem. You could still suggest an EIP that implements a process for state changes and communicating them to other clients through the Ethereum Protocol, but that should be it\u2019s own discussion regarding the benefits/difficulties with that approach (like we had on 867). The EIP process should not be concerned with signaling changes to state, that is up to the wider community. We already have mechanisms for this e.g. hard fork. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/956#issuecomment-376939093  Could it be helpful for there to be a new type of Standards Track / Core EIP which covers modifying the state data? Considering the controversies surrounding rescuing stolen or stuck ether, Core EIPs which involve modifications to the state data may require a more deliberative acceptance process than Core EIPs which involve modifications to the protocol. Such a decision process involving state modification may not only be technical in nature, but involve ethics, philosophy, and law. ",

True, but to be clear, protocol changes will not necessarily be free from discussions of ethics, philosophy, and law.     MicahZoltu:  client developers can propose a change by releasing a new client   Clients certainly do have the ability to release a new version that makes some state changes, but I don\u2019t see any reason why all such changes will split along client lines or why client teams will necessarily be interested in only supporting one side of the fork or the other. As with the DAO, clients may want to delegate the decision to their users. Also, if multiple clients want to support the same changes, then they will need a way to decide what changes should be made, when they should be applied, and what options should be presented to the user. If they don\u2019t agree on this, we\u2019ll end up with one fork per client. The process for doing this could be outside of the EIP process (and maybe it should be), but there will probably need to be some process (submission, evaluation, feedback, voting, etc) that has a number of similarities with the EIP process and shares many of the same stakeholders.

I think there is already a process in place (as evidenced by the DAO hack), and that process is already fairly robust and comprehensive through miner and user signaling on hard fork events. This allows economic signaling of support versus a purely governance-based mechanism, which I think is more robust overall. Perhaps identifying what the current process is and discussing it\u2019s shortcomings is a better path forward than another governance mechanism like EIP. ",
