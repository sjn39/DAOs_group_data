                    "content": "With the new year, we want to share an update on the work Centrifuge has been doing. TL;DR:  A few highlights of the three collateral partners that Maker and Centrifuge are working together on: they are attractive collateral and fit well into the criteria that RWF CU evaluates when looking at collateral These three pools have a demand to borrow approximately 200M - 300M DAI in the next 12 months Legal: We\u2019re evaluating a Jersey structure and will be sharing more shortly Say hi to Eli, our General Council! Upcoming community call: join us for an open Q&A session with our team   Our three collateral partners We believe the most important part is bringing on quality assets. For that reason the first topic we are covering today is three Centrifuge deals that have been introduced to the community in the middle of 2021, and are currently under risk assessment. Based on the Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions recently published by the RWF CU, these MIP6s that came before the methodology continue to tick the boxes with existing history, pipeline, investment-grade assets, and legal structure. We\u2019d like to summarize the latest updates on these partners as we are working with the DAO to onboard them.  Tinka - the MIP6 can be found here  Tinka is a Netherlands based non-bank and digital-centric deferred payments and consumer lending company, owned by Apax Partners, a leading global private equity advisory firm with more than 35 years of investing experience. Tinka is the clear market leader in revolving Point-of-Sale credit. Underlying Assets will be consumer loans originated/drawn-down at the Point-of-Sale, with a contractual claim over the purchased item. 100% of the borrowers are Netherlands-based and the average maturity of the underlying loans is approximately 30 months (ranging from 0 to 72 months). Highlights:  Tinka has had 60 years of experience in originating, underwriting, and servicing various consumer loan products. Over the last twelve months, Tinka has originated ~EUR 100 million of PoS Financings. Tinka\u2019s loan portfolio is currently refinanced by an asset-backed-lending facility provided by two large global banks. The anticipated pool size at launch will be 10-20 million Dai and consist of more than 25,000 individual consumer loan exposures. NCP expects this to quickly scale up to 50-100 million Dai over 6-12 months. Tinka is audited annually by one of the big 4 accounting firms. NCP and its team have significant skin in the game in the form of a material participation in the junior tranche.   Wintec - the MIP6 can be found here  Wintec is a manufacturing and supply chain management company within the semiconductor industry. The supply chain division has a strong track record of managing supply chain assets: accounts receivable and inventory. It services OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) in the Fortune 500 in the electronics and semiconductor industry to support the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars of goods through their supply chain solution. This is why they are a great asset for Maker:  Wintec has been in operation for 30 years, and has managed over $5bn+ of supply chain assets over the last 15 years.  Maker\u2019s RWF core unit has reviewed Wintec\u2019s historical default rates during its due diligence process.  Wintec is able to obtain highly competitive banking rates for deals at scale already and is interested in exploring new sources of capital including newly developing solutions via Maker/Centrifuge for future opportunities. Wintec is audited both by their clients and a top 10 accounting firm. Wintec will initially seek 20 million Dai from MakerDAO and increase to 50-100 million Dai over the next 6-12 months with pre-determined risk criteria setup by MakerDAO\u2019s RWF committee. Wintec will have significant skin in the game in the form of a majority participation (close to 100%) in the junior tranche.   Monachil Capital Partners - the MIP6 can be found here  The Monachil Private Credit Fund was launched in 2020. It is a senior secured credit facility which specializes in bespoke, secured lending to tech-enabled fintech platforms and specialty finance companies. Transactions are typically secured by ring-fenced credit assets originated by the platforms in transactions containing tightly-constructed covenants. They have funded 5 deals so far (a US-based merchant cash advance originator, a US-based near-prime auto lender, a Spanish consumer lender and Colombian consumer lenders), with four additional transactions in various stages of execution. The current pipeline of potential counterparties is in excess of $500mm. This is why they are a great asset for Maker:  Although the business is new, the senior leadership team has extensive structured finance experience and also experience working together, which we believe still fits within the Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions. Monachil is audited by Ernst & Young. There is a 250% overcollateralization (40% initial advance rate). Monachil will initially seek 10 million Dai from MakerDAO, increasing to 50 million Dai over the next 6-12 months. In lieu of a large TIN tranche, the DROP tranche is primarily secured by an off-chain equity tranche that is de facto owned by Monachil Private Credit Fund. In addition to the 60% of off-chain equity, an additional 1% TIN risk buffer will be taken by Monachil.   An update on legal: We will follow in the coming weeks with a comprehensive update on the legal work we have been doing. An update on the legal structure: after discussions with @christiancdpetersen and @eumenes, we have evaluated the Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) and are looking at better suited alternatives that best protect the interest of Maker as a senior lender\u2026 We are committed to finding a structure with our lawyers on both sides. Because a DST is not ideal for non-US deals we are exploring a Jersey SPV structure for Tinka. We are also excited to introduce our new General Counsel, Eli @elidco. He will introduce himself more formally in another post and is looking forward to engaging with the Maker community on the legal work we are doing.  Come talk to us: Hosting a community call for Maker with our team As we are cognizant that the Maker community is an alive and evolving one with new and newly interested community members, we will be hosting a Maker community call on Feb 23 (details soon to come), adding to the recent ones we did in September 2021 and June 2021. The topics will include an overview of Centrifuge and Tinlake, why on-chain securitization matters, a legal structure update, etc, with an open Q&A format. This call will be hosted by Lucas @spin (co-founder), Martin @martin (co-founder), Jeroen @jeroen (CTO), Eli @elidco (General Counsel), and me @roollie (Partner and Portfolio Lead). We will add call details once they are available, and we look forward to seeing many of you on the call for what we hope to be a vibrant discussion. ",
