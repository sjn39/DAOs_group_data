It is based on a basket of USD stable coins, but should constantly accrue interest. As such it adds the risk of the underlying assets and additional smart contract risk. yyCRV is used in a  number of ways:  As a long term Stable coin interest account (in the yCRV vault https://feel-the-yearn.app/ current value ~$200 million) Within the current yETH strategy which deposits ETH into a Maker vault (Vault 13972 via Current yETH vault strategy) As the reward token for the YFI staked int eh governance contract.  yyCRV could be used as a long term collateral for Maker giving us an additional stable coin to better weather market drops or as a short term vault (Similar to USDC-B) to allow additional DAI Liquidity to generated by yearn eco system / yault strategies in times of general market drops. Advantages for Maker:  Additional ~ stable coin collateral to allow DAI generation. Potential short term collateral to allow yearn and others to better manage DAI supply shocks (On the assumption that yearn governance will employ strategies that help support Maker / DAI objectives)  Disadvantages for Maker  The underlying collateral has additional (smart contract etc) risks compared to other stable coins. yyCRV is heavily involved in the yearn ecosystem and could be exploited by future yearn strategies. Current market cap of yyCRV is low.  ",
