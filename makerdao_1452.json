                    "content": " Background As part of MIP65: Clydesdale, DAI 250M will be invested in two BlackRock/iShares ETF short-term US Treasuries products. Sygnum Bank (\u201cSygnum\u201d) will act as custodian and the portfolio will be owned by a trust controlled by Maker with DAI Holders as beneficiaries. The underlying vault is operated/controlled using the current MIP21 token model. We expect this situation to be implemented ASAP (weeks now\u2026!). However, in our implementation work, it has become clear that, with some extra effort and cost, we can advantageously evolve the operational model in parallel to include a securitization and tokenization of the underlying ETF products, thereby providing a second layer of security and put up a starting point for actively participating in the evolving secondary regulated tokenized security trading markets in Europe (starting from Switzerland) and USA, which could become material platforms for liquidity and instrument innovation over the coming years. And allow for new trading partners who prefer this mode of transactions. Importantly, it would also be a legal and technical on-chain starting point to create a situation of \u201cno/limited human interaction\u201d, fluid transaction flow between Maker and regulated TradFi markets/instruments.  Realising MIP65 Tokenization with Partners: Oasis Pro Markets & Bank Sygnum To accomplish this, we are currently working with Sygnum Bank and Oasis Pro Markets to accomplish something akin to a \u201cdual token listing\u201d - one for Europe and one for the USA. We expect to be able to develop a solution over the coming few months with Bank Sygnum for Switzerland and Oasis Pro Markets for the USA (this, of course, pending appropriate CES, SF, LTS review etc.). Bank Sygnum has experience from securitizing and tokenizing assets under Swiss DLT law for trading on a regulated secondary trading platform. Within the asset management space, Sygnum already successfully performed such complex transactions as the one detailed here Sygnum is a regulated bank subject to FINMA supervision and, in particular, it holds:  Full Swiss banking and securities firm licence Authorization to operate a Swiss OTF (organised trading facility) in terms of which it operates SygnEx: a regulated secondary trading facility for tokenized securities according to Article 42 of the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA; SR 958 1).  And, of course, the necessary technology platform to perform tokenization and trading upon. Oasis Pro Markets LLC holds a US broker dealer licence and has a US registered digital asset security Alternative Trading System (\u201cATS\u201d) and appropriate securitization and tokenization experiences for the USA - and also an appropriate underlying technical solution.  Starting out in Zurich: Bank Sygnum The contemplated securitisation/tokenisation would be structured as follows, subject to final assessment and regulatory clearance: A structured product will be issued in the form of a tracker (certificate type 1300 of the Swiss Derivatives Map) that represents 1:1 the performance of an underlying ETF (i.e. USD ~250M under MIP65) (the \u201cProduct\u201c). Subject to the required assessments, the Product would be tokenized by Sygnum Bank and is intended to be  admitted to SygnEx (the secondary trading market). The Trust formed under MIP65 will retain ownership of the tokens/securities (and they will sit in an appropriate crypto custodian account with Bank Sygnum). As such, the tokens can, of course, be disposed of (redeem/sale/transfer etc) by Maker via the Governance Poll/Trustee instruction structure for now, but, as mentioned, we will work on a more automated solution over the coming month to allow a more liquid/fluid transaction format. Getting the token infrastructure in place above is just the first step. It is important to understand a key limitation of these tokens and their tradability. Our and Bank Sygnum\u2019s understanding of the current international regulatory framework is that tokenized securities would still fall under the remit of the traditional financial services regulations. As such these would need to be listed on regulated trading venues, such as a stock exchange or similar venue subject to licensing requirements and regulatory oversight. In the case of tokenized products issued under the Swiss DLT law, this means only regulated markets, DLT trading facilities/multilateral trading facilities and/or organised trading facilities (such as SygnEx) would be able to support them. Different from mainstream CEXes and DEXes, such venues are largely in their infancy in terms of trading volume, assets supported and use cases. Therefore, for the moment, this tokenization will NOT immediately lead to:  Substantially increased liquidity from large trading volumes on relevant listing/trading venues (the volume is simply not there) An ability to trade these tokens on decentralised exchanges (it would be participating in illegal securities trading at this moment in our current assessment).  Obviously, the expectation is that volumes would indeed start to appear on these trading venues over time, and who knows what will unfold around the DEX/CEX markets over the next year(s). However, for now, the logic of this exercise, as outlined above, remains to add a layer of control/safety and to decrease transaction friction and cost by moving into an on-chain asset tokenized world, yet staying within current regulatory constraints. The commercial agreement in discussion with Sygnum is that this tokenization exercise will add no extra transaction cost to those already agreed under MIP65 for ETF trading and custody, except a fixed payment (amount to be established) reasonably to cover efforts to execute the securitization, listing and tokenization.  Going West: Oasis Pro Markets With Oasis Pro Markets, we are exploring specific ways of executing this contemplated dual listing to access another major venue of liquidity and transaction partners. Oasis Pro Market has the appropriate set of licences (broker-dealer and ATS) and technical solutions to complete this listing and will allow the securities/tokens to be traded in a regulated and KYC/AML compliant manner in the US. Oasis Pro Markets have prioritised this project and expect to fast-track it through their processes. As such, we expect the work in both Europe and USA to be in parallel and potentially launch almost simultaneously. Our commercial agreement with Oasis is expected to largely mirror the Bank Sygnum agreement. As a side note, I would suggest that this \u201ccrypto winter season\" is exactly the right time to build such infrastructure as proposed, and set Maker up to have new capabilities and linkage into the TradFi world it can benefit from as a growth phase kicks in. Also, I will repeat, that we remain committed to building, whatever we do under MIP65 - including this tokenization project - as an open and transparent platform (no black box !), with Maker at the controls of all elements of the platform.  Next Step We will hear out the community over the next week, engage with CES, LTS and SF on the subject matter details, and, given appropriate community support, thereafter design and start this project, which should ultimately end in a governance poll with all details and specifics (appropriate reviews etc), following the format and process outlined here that will instruct the Trust formed under MIP65 to execute and implement accordingly.
