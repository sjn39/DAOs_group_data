                    "content": " Summaries reflect my own work and have not been reviewed by Rune. Any mistakes are mine. They are based on the written posts in this forum from Rune. I do not regularly attend Endgame meetings.  Levels of Detail This summary is organized into sections summarizing the same information in different levels of detail.  LOD0 represents the most-simplified and abstracted version of this concept LOD1 is more complex and more accurate. LOD2 is a direct summary of Rune\u2019s post. Runes post could be considered LOD3, with the highest level of detail and explanation.  Lower numbers = Easier to grasp and understand. Higher numbers = More complex but more accurate.     Level of Detail - 0  No role is elected through a formal governance process, no role represents MakerDAO as a whole. Two main governance roles:  Delegated Voter Committees Delegates   Members of each governance role can become Recognized. Recognized status brings benefits - including compensation - but comes with initial and on-going requirements.  Delegated Voter Committees  A loose group with aligned values that openly organize. Primarily made up of MKR voters and delegates. Organize regular subcommittee meetings that serve to direct the decentralized workforce. Have the responsibility to maintain the Endgame plan.  Delegates  An individual or entity that votes on behalf of MKR Token Holders that have delegated to them. Usually members of one or more DVCs, and support their strategies.     LOD1  Level of Detail - 1  No role is elected through a formal governance process, no role represents MakerDAO as a whole. Two main roles:  Delegated Voter Committees Delegates   One optional role  Budget Allocators    Recognized Status  Members of each governance role can become Recognized. Recognized Status is slightly different for each governance role (full details in LOD2,) below is general goals/benefits/requirements.  Benefits (to MakerCore)\u2026  Sybil defence Enforce separation between decentralized workforce and governance Quality and consistency    Benefits (to individual/entity)\u2026  Priority display on voting frontends. DAI or MKR compensation.    Requirements\u2026  Consistency of engagement with governance processes. Transparency Follow standard operating procedures. Initial public meeting.     Delegated Voter Committees  A loose group with aligned values that openly organize. Primarily made up of MKR voters and delegates. The most important governance body. Intended to balance the influence of the Decentralized Workforce. Organize regular subcommittee meetings that cover the DAO scopes. Responsibility to maintain the Endgame plan.   Delegates  Individual or entity that votes on behalf of MKR Token Holders that have delegated to them. Potential to shift balance of power away from MKR whales and towards the major delegates. Usually members of one or more DVCs, and support their strategies.   Budget Allocators  Individual or entity that allocates budget to Core Units and Tribunals. MKR Holders and Delegates delegate \u2018budget power\u2019 to allocators in the same way MKR Holders delegate voting power to delegates. A total budget is split between the budget allocators according to their share of the budget power. Allows minority voters to impact budget allocation.      LOD2  Level of Detail - 2  Maker Core also has roles that are carried out directly by companies or individuals, without going through MetaDAOs as intermediaries.  None oare elected through a general governance processes.  Instead they are marginally empowered by MKR holders in different ways to represent those specific voters. Provides strong minority stakeholder protections and reduces the risk of Maker level governance actors destabilising the meta.       DVCs  Most important organized governance body Goal is to openly organize and represent regular voters that are incentivized by their MKR token exposure. Needed to counterbalance the influence of the Decentralized Workforce and professional governance roles. Organize broadly and generally as a loose group of voters with aligned overall values and views.  Use chatrooms and forums to discuss their views.   DVCs directly engage in the important high level questions in Maker Governance by organizing Subcommittees and Subcommittee meetings that cover the 11 DAO Scopes.   Recognized Status  DVCs can become Recognized by the Governance Tribunal through a process approved by MKR voters in the Governance Scope Framework MIP and managed by the Governance Tribunal.  Objective is to ensure that the DVC contains real, independent MKR voters that have publicly registered some or all of their MKR stake to be aligned with their DVC. Ensure contribution to Maker Governance in good faith based on their incentives as MKR holders and community stakeholders. Ensure members of the Decentralized Workforce cannot be registered to a DVC.    Benefits  Recognized DVCs name and logo are directly displayed in the Maker Governance frontend and ranked based on MKR support. Registered DVC Subcommittee participants can earn MKR compensation for their participation on the Subcommittees. Recognized DVCs may call Council members, Tribunal members and Core Unit Facilitators to their Subcommittee meetings in order to gain the latest updates, advice and proposals on the specific Scope.  Requirements  Must hold quarterly Subcommittee meetings for each DAO Scope that are verified by the Governance Tribunal.  Verified = at least one publicly registered MKR holder must attend.   Must formalize their internal governance structure to follow a simple majority of registered MKR.  The most important role of the internal governance process is control membership, so the DVC can maintain a single coherent direction and vision.   Major governance disputes inside a Recognized DVC will result in the DVC splitting into two new Recognized DVCs.  Governance Tribunal determines inheritance of branding, usually the side with most MKR.   Must adhere to the overall scope constraints of the Endgame Plan. Responsibility to maintain the stability of the Endgame meta, cash flow incentives and complexity.  Any attempt to change the meta or fundamental rules of Maker must be interpreted as a power grab attempt that aims to directly or indirectly centralize control of the protocol.     Delegates  Play a critical and central role in the governance of Maker. Reliance is further increased in Endgame and used to engineer a stable long term meta, through the MetaDAO token farming incentives to active delegators. Delegates have the potential to gather significant amounts of voting power, shifting the balance of power away from MKR whales and towards the major delegates. Makes regulation of the official governance frontends extremely important, and dealing with this challenge is the main objective of the Recognized Delegate system.   Recognized Status   Can become Recognized by the Governance Tribunal if they post an application and hold a public onboarding meeting.  Used as their independent delegate strategy. Makes them eligible for compensation based on the amount of MKR that is delegated to them and their DVC attendance Gives a higher position in the official governance frontends.    In addition to their independent delegate strategy, delegates can also support one or more DVC strategies.  Makes it possible for voters to delegate MKR to a Recognized Delegate.  Constrained in that the delegate must vote according to the overall principles and values of a particular DVC.      Can freely support any DVC strategy without requiring approval.  DVCs internal governance process can reactively ban a Recognized Delegate from supporting the strategy if the delegate votes against its values. Banning a Recognized Delegate from supporting a DVC strategy prevents them from receiving more vote delegation in support of that strategy Doesn\u2019t remove the existing votes, and the existing votes instead effectively become a part of their independent strategy.    Having additional DVC strategies increases the position of the Recognized Delegates in the official governance frontend.   DVC Subcommittee attendance  Recognized Delegates become eligible to earn compensation based on MKR delegated to them but must attend DVC Subcommittee meetings in order to receive the compensation. Hours required increases as they become eligible for higher compensation, with the maximum achievable compensation corresponding to a DVC Subcommittee meeting attendance and preparation equivalent to a full time job. Delegates can also be banned from attending DVC Subcommittee meetings if they are abusing it to unlock the compensation and not actively contributing.     3 Categories of Delegate and their Frontend Ranking  Frontends categorize delegates into 3 ranks. Randomized within ranks.  Rank 1: Recognized Delegates supporting at least 2 DVC strategies  Forced to be more objective and professional in serving the interests of their voters Less likely to destabilize the meta.    Rank 2: Recognized Delegates supporting less than 2 DVC strategies  At higher risk of being biased and entrenched in their specific single perspective.    Rank 3: Unrecognized Delegates  Any delegate contracts that have not achieved Recognized Status. High risk of sybil attacks.     Budget Allocators  Optional role that provides a tool to allow minority voters to impact budget allocation. Technical system must first be built, and once built must be provided with an Allocated Budget through a MIP (could be fixed or relative.) Companies and individuals can then sign up as Budget Allocators  Recieve delegated budget power from MKR. Can be split from voting power if MKR holder wishes, otherwise goes to delegate then to budget allocator.   Total Allocated Budget split between delegates based on their relative Budget Power (non-custodial).  Can then either pass it on in a continuous streaming fashion, or in lump sum payments to Core Units and Tribunals only.   Maker Governance can freeze the Budget Allocator system at any time and clawback funds.   Recognized Status  Can become Recognized by the Governance Tribunal if they post a public information sheet and hold a public Q&A meeting. Recognized Budget Allocators become eligible for compensation, and are prioritized in the Budget Allocator frontend, but must post continuous updates and transparency reports.  Compensated based on a % of the budget power that flows through them.     ",
