                    "content": "There have been several MIPs, including but not limited to MIP76 (Makershire), that have proposed entrusting funds owned by MKR holders to L2s, sidechains and apps that are secured by 3rd party multisigs. These multisigs are basically \u201cgod-mode\u201d. They are fully capable of freezing and stealing funds, reversing transactions, and much more with total finality. I have pushed back on these proposals stating that 3rd party multisigs are inherently reckless to trust since their security is unknowable and unprovable. All keys to a multisig could be held by 1 person, or each key of a multisig could be held by 100 people. Neither of these can be proven or disproven for any 3rd party multisig. This is an inherent and existential problem with trusting multisigs that you do not own or control. Other multisig unknowns include:  who the holders of the keys are what jurisdictions they exist in whether each signer\u2019s wallet has been secure since before a key was assigned to it if the multisig signers can be trusted not to collude whether multisig signers will be forced by state actors to disrupt continuity and more  The only response I\u2019ve gotten from the DAO thus far is that, despite these unknowns, we  must put funds at risk or else we are in danger of losing out to competing protocols. To date, I have not seen @Risk-Core-Unit directly address the issues of unprovable security that I\u2019ve raised above. That needs to change immediately. MakerDAO prides itself on scientific governance, so before we entrust any more protocol-owned funds to 3rd party multisigs with unprovable security, I would like to see a scientific risk calculation that adequately acknowledges and justifies the danger that we\u2019re placing these funds in. If the DAO can\u2019t justify the risk, then the DAO should not take the risk. The only way that this risk can be justified is by scientifically acknowledging the very real risks, sharing the details of that risk with MKR holders, and then determining whether or not these risks are worth adjusting for. We can\u2019t do any of this without a proper scientific risk assessment. I would be happy to volunteer time to assist Risk CU in development of this urgent need. ",

That being said, we should have a multisig risk evaluation framework if there is not one already. PE has does some evaluation in the past on L2, SES has designed best practices for internal multisigs. It seems reasonable we have a framework to provide analysis to MKR holders to make informed decisions on the risks posed by third party Multisigs (e.g. are the signers known, is there a foundation , etc.,) ",

For example, the DAO could require that signers disclose whether they have ever experienced a loss of private keys, and terminate relationships if misconduct is discovered. An analysis of the reputation of each member of the multisig would also be appropriate, as well as the listing the jurisdiction of both the company holding the multisig and each individual member. Ultimately ascertaining certain facts such as \u201c[proving] signers\u2019 wallets are secure and not compromised?\u201d is nigh impossible, but we can use the reputation of multisig signers combined with their historical behaviors (and their jurisdiction\u2019s) to inform our decision-making.

MadShills:  I wrote a post about scientific governance in the past, it simply means to apply empiricism and predictions to evaluate outcomes (the scientific method).   I have posted in the past on this topic because to apply the scientific method to any situation, DATA is required.  With respect to multisigs one would have to estimate the number of these and the length of time they existed and then look at the number of compromises.   You can do this globally in the DeFI space as one measure, and then apply it to Maker as we know it. With respect to Maker we have a number of CUs that all utilize multisigs to operate.   One could argue that one CU basically claimed funds when offboarded but I honestly don\u2019t have a clean dataset just some memory.   A rough estimate on risk generally over a year something less than 1:100 multisigs rug in some way.  I think this number is less but again the above is a speculation based both on my experience and knowledge of 1Hive, Maker, Gnosis, and a few other DAOs I know have multisig type fund management and distribution models. We can also add a value weighted component to above data.  Like is a 100M multisig more likely to rug than a 1M multisig.  What we can say is that at least at Maker many CUs typically have multisig controlled budgets of over 1M, and in total now collectively hold ~15M DAI. Like all situations one has to weigh DATA based statistical models against the particular situation being presented.  How does the N of M multisig apply with respect to security ( having higher N/M ratio and/or higher M give better security statistically, does the $$ amount of what the wallet protects factor into a statistical measure of increased risk etc.) One way Maker can diffuse this risk is by distributing funds between many different groups (just as I suggested with RWA).  All of us DeFI users (if we are smart and are able) distribute our loss risk by using multiple wallets, different DeFI products spreading our portfolios in such a way that if we take one hit this doesn\u2019t wipe us out.  Same it true of TradFI investments and portfolio management, as well as insurance risk diffusion. While I think it would take a bit of work I do think a first shot risk assessment could be carried out, and would be interested to see what the data inputs look like.  I think other than some basic general statistics there won\u2019t be enough data points to determine whether size of multisig important, amount of funds etc.  I suspect there will be a direct correlation of the N/M ratio and number M wallets involved would be born out in the data even if the data was sparse.   Namely that for same level of funds a 2 of 3 is more likely to rug than a 3 of 5, or 4 of 7 etc. One thing I hear a lot from you @ChrisBlec is this idea of a strict adherence to \u2018trustless\u2019 solutions in DeFI and I while I think this is a goal that is an \u2018ideal\u2019 it is not easily or practically achieved and so when we look at the pieces of effort in these protocols applying some sort of \u2018trustless\u2019 measurement metric there would be useful.   I unfortunately can\u2019t define such a metric off the top of my head, but I think creating one and then applying it to all the pieces of DeFI (starting with Maker) would be quite useful it it hasn\u2019t already been done. So I see the question here being posed not just as to risk calculation of use of multisigs, but a more general one of what a \u2018trustless\u2019 metric could look like and seeking to make measurements of this for all the Maker/MakerDAO components but into RWA, D3M, L2, etc. so maker can set a standard of what is acceptable \u2018trustless\u2019 and what IS NOT.

I would be happy to volunteer time to assist Risk CU in development of this urgent need.   Chris, happy to cooperate on this topic. We recently started thinking about developing a framework that tries to score different L2 implementations, multisig being one of the technical risk inputs. We\u2019d thought about using L2 Beats for such descriptive inputs. See example from L2Beats for Optimism multisig risk assessment here. I must admit though that I don\u2019t expect us to develop a highly reliable \u201cscientific risk calculation\u201d of multisig risk as in performing some advanced quantifiable calculation, but more like a scoring table that uses all these descriptive inputs and then do comparison among them. So I don\u2019t expect us to have a reliable risk premium calculated which you could then simply use to compare with APY of an integration/investment (I imagine this is what you would be after). It\u2019s impossible to calculate the probability of multisig signers going rogue or even assess what\u2019s the actual signatory distribution behind these keys, while the severity of a potential attack event would have pretty much a binary outcome.

All I am really asking is for the DAO to stop treating 3rd party multisig risk differently than any other counterparty risk. We should not be trusting multisigs with a wink & a nod just because it\u2019s \u201ccrypto\u201d. It should be held to the same standards as any other counterparty. When it finally is held to those same standards, it will warrant a much different approach than it does today. ",

Having said that I believe that long term MSigs need to disappear. When they do, we should be comfortable moving billions of DAI to Rollups. In the meantime MKR holders need to decide how much risk they are comfortable with. ",
