                    "content": "Overview This signal request was prepared by @rema with input from the CMON (Collateral Management On-chain) initiative and its stakeholders which include different CUs, and is led by CES. We are proposing to offboard UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A due to lack of demand and consequent negative cash flow. In total there are 28 vaults, they represent only 1.65m dai minted which means liquidations won\u2019t be problematic in terms of price slippage. Risk CU prepared the proposed offboarding parameters explained below. Each vault type has an individual poll, please vote on all of them. Main problem with these vault types is pure lack of demand as the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC and UNI), have relatively high on-chain liquidity. MOMC made an attempt to make them more attractive by lowering the SF at the end of January, but demand unfortunately didn\u2019t increase. Proposed parameters were set in a way, where we try to minimize the damage done to existing vault owners while ensuring that sufficient amounts of debt will either be repaid or less desirable liquidated with minimal costs for the vault owners. The liquidation ratio will be increased using the dss-lerp, where we expect that keepers will call the tick() to update the value when needed. The end parameter of dss-lerp is determined by a formula to account for potential price change from the time of this signal request until the actual activation of parameter changes and the duration of liquidation ratio increase. If the end value was static, chances are that some vaults would be liquidated faster than we would want in the case of price decrease, while in the case of price increase some of the vaults could potentially end up with a higher CR than the end value and avoid liquidation, assuming that vault is not managed. The process of choosing these parameters based on the current state of vault types, the formula for determining end value and the projection of debt liquidated can be seen here. Due to the liquidation penalty being set to 0, we are also proposing to set the tip auction parameter to 0, in order to avoid the possibility of farming the liquidation rewards. There is a possibility that some vault owners will greatly increase their collateral ratio to avoid liquidation produced by this signal request. We will clean up such cases later in time with another action which is not part of this signal request. The offboarding process will be conducted according to the MIP62: Collateral Offboarding Process. Proposed Offboarding Parameters Proposed parameter changes;  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set debt ceiling to 0 Set tip to 0 Set duration of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio to 30 days Set end parameter of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio for each vault type as the following; highest collateral ratio vault within each vault type multiplied with 3, rounded on hundred.  Example of end parameter for UNI-A calculation; Highest CR vault is #18094 currently at 301.78%. After multiplying with 3, we get 905.34% and after rounding, we get 900%. The final end parameter will be calculated by Risk CU and communicated with PECU once they begin crafting the spell. Signal Request Polls (each vault type has an individual poll)    Do you support the proposed parameter changes stated above to offboard the UNI-A  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you support the proposed parameter changes stated above to offboard the UNIV2DAIETH-A  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you support the proposed parameter changes stated above to offboard the UNIV2WBTCETH-A  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you support the proposed parameter changes stated above to offboard the UNIV2UNIETH-A  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you support the proposed parameter changes stated above to offboard the UNIV2WBTCDAI-A  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps The polls will run until May 26, 2022 22:00 UTC; their outcomes will either result in on-chain polls assuming the outcomes are yes, or will be reinitiated with different parameters and/or strategy.
