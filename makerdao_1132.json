One thing I wanted to ask with regards to Voter Committee\u2019s, Allan Pedersen wrote a compelling piece on the work that goes into these Committees, and personally what resonated with me is the ability for Committee\u2019s to review a deal by meeting with the management of the proposed asset type and at times going out to visually see the proposed asset. Now the latter only pertains to RWAs and more than likely the MakerDAO Voter Committees will not be traveling to inspect a construction site, or meet with a protocol that the Growth team is dealing with in another continent (as examples). So, how do you visualize Voter Committee\u2019s trusting that Core Units have done the due diligence, placed their \u201cboots on the ground\u201d, etc., and are recommending a strategic Initiative that benefits MKR token owners and helps Voter Committee\u2019s evaluate protocol features, RWAs, budgets, etc.? And zooming out, should Maker Committee membership be staggered in order to bring on new members with fresh ideas? ",

This is the presentation I presented on the call:  docs.google.com    20220524 - Voting Committee Initiatives Update Voting Committee Initiatives Update 24 May 2022 Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit        How does due diligence fit into this?     flipflopflapdelegate:  So, how do you visualize Voter Committee\u2019s trusting that Core Units have done the due diligence, placed their \u201cboots on the ground\u201d, etc., and are recommending a strategic Initiative that benefits MKR token owners and helps Voter Committee\u2019s evaluate protocol features, RWAs, budgets, etc.?   In my opinion, this is all about the Auditor function that the DAO is currently missing. As you point out, it is a lot of work to review the deliverables and review various aspects of the DAO\u2019s operations: financial, secops, software quality assurance, legal due diligence, people best practices, etc. I\u2019ve compared this with a specialized PC Review Magazine in the past, in the case of software quality assurance: when core unit releases new software, a group would be reviewing that and assigning a rating based on evaluation criteria that they develop. The consumers of these reviews are delegates, MKR holders (esp. the ones on the voter committees), and any other stakeholder who has an interest in MakerDAO delivering according to its best potential. Access to an auditor infrastructure as described would empower MKR holders to get better answers to the questions they have, delivered by sources with better incentive alignment than just the default \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re professionals\u201d reply from the executing core units themselves.  Previous work on this This was the point of the planned Transparency and Quality Control track of the new season of the SES Incubation Program. Later, the decision was made to postpone the acceleration of the program:  image1316\u00d7743 215 KB   image1315\u00d7738 212 KB  Source:   accounts.google.com   Google Slides - create and edit presentations online, for free.

MakerDAO today is a car without seatbelts As long as MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have an auditor function, it is, in my opinion, incomplete and essentially broken. It\u2019s operating but not with all the necessary safety checks in place. Like a car without safety belts and airbags. As long as this is the case, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when accidents happen or the DAO is operating sub-optimally. Cutting costs as retribution in such cases may be a counter-productive measure making the situation worse instead of better.

Other examples   Immunefi Security CU is clearly contributing to smart contract security and operational security checks with their roadmap. They collaborate with other in the Security cross-core unit initiative that was mentioned in the meeting and in the slides.   SES is conducting monthly budget statement audits of core units that we\u2019re advising and who opted in to this. GovAlpha is running the same check on the SES budget. Important limitation of these is that the audits are focused on transparency and reporting QA, they are not meant to judge whether a core unit is spending their budget efficiently or wisely.   Smart contract audits are arranged through a coordination group that uses pre-purchased auditing credits from ChainSecurity for the most relevant projects we have in the pipeline.   ",

Others have mentioned this elsewhere I think. Regardless, I agree strongly with your view regarding the need for a separate audit function. Also agree it doesn\u2019t need to be large, maybe 1-2 resources from an external company employed 50-100% as a separate Core Unit. It\u2019s probably for the best that you postponed the Transparency track. Incubating within SES or an existing Core Unit would be a strategic mistake in my view, and would entangle the audit function hopelessly. But we could encourage auditors to apply through the MIP39 process and transfer all the auditing functions to them if approved. ",

There is one thing I want to clarify, however, because I\u2019ve noticed misconceptions about it in the past:   SES holds no control whatsoever over core units once they are graduated.   While, in practice, we continue to be the budget statement reviewer of the graduated core units and some others we advised, this is entirely voluntary.   Core units that are reviewed by us are at any point free to stop the collaboration by submitting a new MIP40 with SES removed as auditor.   It is not our intention to keep the auditing function within SES. It\u2019s only in our mandate if it\u2019s temporary. We plan to spin this off into its own thing and if anyone wants to help us with this, you\u2019re free to contact @juan or myself.   It might be a nice start to offer an alternative to core units who prefer not to work with SES. I asked @Aes ages ago whether SF would be willing to share this burden in the future. Back then he said he\u2019d consider it, but as I said, it\u2019s a while ago so I understand plans may have changed.   The budget statement review acts more like an accountant working with a client: in support of the core unit, helping them to follow best practices. But at the same time be a check that everything looks in order. ",

You could not approve DUX payments, so you control them! Well, this could be true for around 3 to 4 days. After that, they would explain the situation to Governance, the funds would be returned from the Auditors wallet, and the system would be broken (and this would not look great on us). 1- This method looks horrible until you have a Core Unit removing all the funds from the wallet because they\u2019re being offboarded (can provide a concrete example if needed). 2- You\u2019re welcome to take over. Actually, it probably falls into your mandate more than ours. We have offered this to @aes in the past, but any Core Unit that feels like doing it, feel free to reach out.

In either case, it doesn\u2019t really matter that the expert is a delegate.   I think this underestimates the need to evaluate the relative importance of different experts. On a strategic level it is common that it\u2019s impossible to follow the advice of every expert. At that point you have to make an informed decision between the advice of different experts or to forge a meaningful compromise between different opinions. A delegate who is an expert in a certain field will have a better understanding of that particular field and may overrule a CU expert, but will still need to consider expert opinion in fields in which he or she is not an expert.
