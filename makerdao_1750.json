MakerDAO Blog Update & Discussion Updates   [image] The Situation The Makerdao.com blog is an unused resource that can be a valuable asset if appropriately managed. Benefits include but are not limited to;   Access to an established external audience. Better control over Maker\u2019s narrative. Access to a platform where we can reinforce Maker\u2019s brand. Paves the way for inclusion in a larger marketing funnel. Increase overall exposure. Improves ties with the extended community of interested people. New channel for  Product Releases Product \u2026         Emily_Davis:  Who is responsible for writing the articles?   Currently noone.     Emily_Davis:  Why blog is inactive for so long?   After the Maker Foundation dissolved, the failure to onboard a marketing/external comms function left the blog dead in the water.     Emily_Davis:  What steps can be taken to reactivate the blog?

It\u2019s a rhetoric question of course. So the real question is: why nobody in the workforce has taken an active action towards doing something with the blog (or at least closing it for the time being until we decide to do something with it)?

No worries, I do my best not to take things personally here. I appreciate the edit.     iammeeoh:  \u2026is it the case that the current workforce is not capable\u2026   In terms of bandwidth, I don\u2019t think the current workforce is capable. In terms of mandate, no Core Unit has this responsibility in their mandate. In terms of skill, I\u2019m sure several people would be capable of running it if directed to do so. It is bad PR and a totally wasted potential, I agree.     iammeeoh:  why nobody in the workforce has taken an active action towards doing something with the blog (or at least closing it for the time being until we decide to do something with it)?   I can\u2019t speak for others, but GovComms did take a few actions:  In March, we proposed a Public Relations Project Manager hire as part of a proposed budget expansion. This was formally rejected in April. We even made a short video explaining that such a hire would enable us to take on the external comms side of our initial mandate. The voters decided they did not want to go in this direction and so our Core Unit pivoted away from the PR support. We prepared a MIP 60 for blog ownership in late May, motivated by our goal to improve the reach of our stakeholder publications. After consulting a handful of stakeholders, we decided not to go in this direction because of the lack of PR expertise within the team and the need for additional staff to handle such a responsibility. In closure, we notified the DAO by creating a discussion thread pointing out the potential of this unused resource and our view on the situation .     MakerDAO Blog Update & Discussion   Our View We believe the right course of action is to wait for a proper marketing team. Running the blog should require professional public relations oversight, which the DAO currently has no capacity for. The teams who currently come closest are the Growth CU and the incubating Brand CU. However, the responsibility seems out of scope for both in their current forms.   EDIT:  The ball is rolling around, untouched, in the court. None of our CUs, delegates, or active MKR holders have taken action since then. Perhaps a declaration of intent or some sort of request for proposal would be nice but no one has done it and understandably so. In this climate of uncertainty and budget conservatism we\u2019re in a tough spot. ",
