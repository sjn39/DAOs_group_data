I\u2019m running for delegate, with the specific intention of submitting and passing a proposal to add ETH/UNI to the list of liquidity mining pools to relieve selling pressure on the UNI token and encourage hodling of the native token by end-users and farmers to ensure proper alignment of incentives between users, liquidity providers, and the dex itself. I am a regular end-user, with a modest position of Uni that I intend to hold for the long term. After our initial goal of adding ETH/UNI is completed, I will review and discuss with the community and my delegators proposals submitted and voted for off-chain on Uniswap\u2019s snapshot page at: https://snapshot.page/#/uniswap. I will work with any delegator to ensure their voice is properly heard in Uniswap government and faithfully work to ensure the proper development and decentralization of the protocol.
