For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet. Updates are being done by a limited number of collateral stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the data. If you see any discrepancies in the data, please reach out to the #collateral-engineering-services-public channel on the official MakerDAO Discord server, Discord If you have any questions or comments about specific collateral, please post your comments directly in the MakerDAO forum within the collateral application forum post. For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization. These are Application, Poll Active, Greenlit, or those that are recently moved to Application Withdrawn, Will Not Do, Postponed or Deferred.  Forums 11177\u00d7709 245 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) This section contains the collateral working through the Assessment to Executive Vote statuses. These are Assessment, Gov Poll Active, Gov Poll Passed, Implementation, Exec Active, and those that are recently moved to Gov Poll Not Passed and Exec Not Passed.  Forums 31174\u00d7226 80.6 KB   Active Collateral This section contains all collateral applications in statuses under Business Review or those that are recently moved to Active, Offboarding or Offboarded.

For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization. These are Application, Poll Active, Greenlit, or those that are recently moved to Application Withdrawn, Will Not Do, Postponed or Deferred.  Forums 11174\u00d7675 248 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.

For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet. Updates are being done by a limited number of collateral stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the data. If you see any discrepancies in the data, please reach out to the #collateral-engineering-services-public channel on the official MakerDAO Discord server, Discord If you have any questions or comments about specific collateral, please post your comments directly in the MakerDAO forum within the collateral application forum post. For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization.

Forum 11146\u00d7457 177 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs).

For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet. Updates are being done by a limited number of collateral stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the data. If you see any discrepancies in the data, please reach out to the #collateral-engineering-services-public channel on the official MakerDAO Discord server, Discord If you have any questions or comments about specific collateral, please post your comments directly in the MakerDAO forum within the collateral application forum post. For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization. These are Application, Poll Active, Greenlit, or those that are recently moved to Application Withdrawn, Will Not Do, Postponed or Deferred.  Forums 11175\u00d7550 192 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) This section contains the collateral working through the Assessment to Executive Vote statuses. These are Assessment, Gov Poll Active, Gov Poll Passed, Implementation, Exec Active, and those that are recently moved to Gov Poll Not Passed and Exec Not Passed.  Forums 31175\u00d7379 136 KB   Active Collateral This section contains all collateral applications in statuses under Business Review or those that are recently moved to Active, Offboarding or Offboarded.

For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet. Updates are being done by a limited number of collateral stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the data. If you see any discrepancies in the data, please reach out to the #collateral-engineering-services-public channel on the official MakerDAO Discord server, Discord If you have any questions or comments about specific collateral, please post your comments directly in the MakerDAO forum within the collateral application forum post. For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization. These are Application, Poll Active, Greenlit, or those that are recently moved to Application Withdrawn, Will Not Do, Postponed' or Deferred.`  Forums 11221\u00d7643 236 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) This section contains the collateral working through the Assessment to Executive Vote statuses. These are Assessment, Gov Poll Active, Gov Poll Passed, Implementation, Exec Active, and those that are recently moved to Gov Poll Not Passed and Exec Not Passed.

For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.

Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) This section contains the collateral working through the Assessment to Executive Vote statuses.

                    "content": "Hello @Recognized-Delegates, independent voters and whom it might concern. We wanted to express our recommendation to governance to support green lighting GNO and GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI. We think it\u2019s valuable to take further research into these two potential collateral assets. As some had expressed concerns about GNO, due to low liquidity and market activity, we want to point out some additional information. Keep in mind, this is only descriptive and not final in any form or shape, it is meant to only add information in order for community and governance to better understand what we aim to achieve with GNO, and why we consider this asset whatsoever.   GNO would be a strategic collateral and vault type constructed with special parameters targeting specific users, while still using a format of public vault type; GnosisDAO itself and potentially some large long-term holders. The parameters would largely mitigate risks related to low liquidity and potential price oracle manipulation exploits.   The vault parameters would be designed with high collateralization requirements, which will likely mean that only GnosisDAO treasury management and perhaps some long-term larger holders will use the vault type.   We believe that these users will maintain high enough collateralization to not get liquidated even in case of significant price drawdowns; we expect that there won\u2019t be any liquidations.   Based on our early estimate, the Gnosis Treasury holds about 35% of value in hard assets compared to market value of GNO.   Because this is communicated with the Gnosis team, the debt ceiling will be instantly utilized by their management team, which means there is little room for price oracle manipulation exploit as debt ceiling will always be fully utilized.   Gnosis is a potential strategic partner due to their current usage of dai as a gas asset on Gnosis chain, and their treasury management department is already utilizing MakerDAO to draw dai debt. Based on this listing, the mentioned activity will increase in both fronts; they will (i) intensify dai usage across their products which will help with further dai adoption and holder acquisition, they will (ii) continue to use MakerDAO with decentralized assets they hold.   The final requirements MakerDAO wishes GnosisDAO to fulfill in order for this to happen is yet to be finalized, likely won\u2019t be necessarily static and is led by the Growth team, other teams are providing inputs. It is important that this brings value to both DAOs and requirements are reasonable and that no entity is pushed in an unwanted risky situation.   We understand that such soft deals based on the gentlemen\u2019s agreement can easily be played as we saw with some entities in the past; in such a case, MakerDAO will significantly increase stability fee on GNO vault type and prevent further dai minting by reducing the debt ceiling. This is an alternative to IV approach, which is probably worthwhile pursuing as it is permissionless and behavior can be managed by incentives.   In any case, this collateral asset is likely worthwhile greenlighting as it has potential.   The GUNI-BUSD-DAI is simply interesting because BUSD is one of the largest fiat stablecoins in the space, we believe that having doors open to USDC alternatives is healthy and we should at least research this collateral asset further and potential benefits we can get from interacting with BUSD asset in general. The future of MakerDAO and the attitude towards centralized assets is yet to be determined, but relative to status quo, adding exposure to BUSD does not change the risk profile significantly and potentially even lowers the counterparty/regulation risks due to centralized assets diversification. Binance recently announced that they will be converting all USDC, USDP and TUSD to BUSD, which has potential to increase usage of BUSD across the crypto space including Ethereum mainnet DeFi. Thank you for considering our recommendation. ",

Thanks for the additional insight! DAI usage for governance/transfer gas fees has huge potential to create organic DAI demand. For this reason alone I am happy to support this collateral onboarding greenlight even though a more thorough assessment of risks could ultimately make this collateral not feasible. ",

Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.

I don\u2019t know if you were able to attend or watched it later. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you might have. Based upon the CSI, there are a number of collaterals moving through for Q2. 14 of them are candidates for onboarding. These are a mix of erc20s, ETH/stETH tokens, hybrids like Maple/TrueFi, and RWAs. From a process and technical implementation perspective, I am happy to share my thoughts about all of them where we can have a dialog. It\u2019s nice to see some clarity in this area since it makes all of our jobs easier. I\u2019m sure Growth and RWF would be willing to join that to expand the discussion. Every week we run through the entire list so all collateral in the onboarding pipeline are being attended to as well as the implementation collaterals. Old Greenlit collateral from before the Maker Foundation dissolved is being cleaned up (the list you mentioned above). Yes, it\u2019s a big list and I can\u2019t imagine the data in those MIP6s is accurate at this point. If we didn\u2019t try to update the old application based upon the new criteria, what would we do to ensure it\u2019s a proper deal? I\u2019m not sure how to respond to fast-track or supporting disruptive innovators. My answer is, YES! I\u2019m open to suggestions that we can execute quickly since time is of the essence. ",

I also understand that your team has been handed the tough task of going to a plethora of MIP6 applications, cleaning house, and for taking time to do so, and I want y\u2019all know that we really appreciate the time you folks are taking to perform such. I guess at the end of the day, most of the worries on my end are from the backpedaling that the DAI supply is experiencing\u2013but I also know everyone from TradFi to DeFi is currently fighting an uphill battle.

Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet.

Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.

                    "content": "Hi everyone, Here is the latest edition of the CSI. For your reference, the update is divided up into four sections based on the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process:   Collateral Application Status - Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization as well as any statuses that remove the collateral from the process.  Prioritized Collateral - The \u201cUp Next\u201d status on the new CSI.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution as well as any collateral failing a Governance Poll or Executive Vote.  Active Collateral - All collateral that is in Business Review status, those that are in Active status and were recently updated, and those collateral that are recently offboarded.  Please reference the below graphic for the phases of the COB Process funnel.  1352\u00d7739 53.8 KB  The definitive source of information for all collateral moving through the COB process is located in the CSI spreadsheet. Updates are being done by a limited number of collateral stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the data. If you see any discrepancies in the data, please reach out to the #collateral-engineering-services-public channel on the official MakerDAO Discord server, Discord If you have any questions or comments about specific collateral, please post your comments directly in the MakerDAO forum within the collateral application forum post. For general questions relating to the CSI update, please post them here.  Collateral Application Status This section contains all collateral applications in statuses before Prioritization. These are Application, Poll Active, Greenlit, or those that are recently moved to Application Withdrawn, Will Not Do, Postponed or Deferred.  Forums 11178\u00d7676 244 KB   Prioritized Collateral This section contains the pool of collateral prioritized to move into the Assessment step of the COB process. Please note these individual collaterals are available to be pulled in by the Collateral Domain Teams. The order is determined by the CMON and CMOFF collateral stakeholders based upon several factors, some of which include the completeness of the MIP6 collateral application, Prioritization tab of the CSI spreadsheet, Domain Team availability, response to market conditions, the scope of the work to be completed, collateral supporting recommended metrics, and alignment to MakerDAO strategic objectives. Currently, collateral meeting strategic objectives include crypto native tokens with strategic protocol or MakerDAO value, ETH and staked ETH solutions, experimentation with collateral using D3M collateral technology, parameter changes on current vault types, and Real World Assets (RWAs). Also, please note that there is a possibility that this section would be empty when there are no collaterals that are currently prioritized as discussed upon CMON and CMOFF meetings.  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP) This section contains the collateral working through the Assessment to Executive Vote statuses. These are Assessment, Gov Poll Active, Gov Poll Passed, Implementation, Exec Active, and those that are recently moved to Gov Poll Not Passed and Exec Not Passed.  Forums 31173\u00d7296 98.6 KB   Active Collateral This section contains all collateral applications in statuses under Business Review or those that are recently moved to Active, Offboarding or Offboarded.
