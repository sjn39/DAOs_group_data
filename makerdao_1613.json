                    "content": " Background I started a small survey and a simple tool to surface short-term delegate priorities one month ago. The goal was to surface priorities for the next three months to make decisions easier and reduce cognitive load when arguing about direction while not being binding. A consensus enabling tool, if you wish. I used a humble Google Sheet and asked delegates to participate in a two-round process:  First round (5 days) Enter a topic they see as a priority in the column labeled What ? Enter a description of their rationale for the priority into the column labeled Why ?  Second round (2 days) Stop entering priorities and distribute 1000 points between the priorities collected in the list to get a sense of conviction and arrive at a collective prioritization score I cheekily called PrioScore\u2122. I posted the Sheet into the #delegates-govcoreunits Discord channel to have some form of access gating because the sheet was posted with full edit access. Here are the results:  Screenshot 2022-08-19 at 09.17.473562\u00d71236 457 KB   The top priorities for the 9 delegates who participated are:  Increasing vault usage (2399.84 points) Increasing DAI supply (1844 points) Ramping up MIP65 and other PSM yield strategies (1824 points)  Building the first Endgame Product - Syntethic ETH (EtherDAI) achieved the 4th place with 1416 points.  Next steps I found the exercise and the discussions the tool sparked very valuable and would love to continue with further rounds. Tagging @LongForWisdom here because I heard through the grapevine that GovAlpha is working on a DAO priority surfacing tool. @twblack88 has some interesting thoughts on the topic too. Happy to kick off a working group and/or continue developing this further on my own. For now, I\u2019m adding two polls to this topic: 1.) Should I do further rounds with my current tool?     Yes, let\u2019s do another round No, one was enough     0 voters     2.) Is a tool for surfacing short-term priorities valuable, or is the current forum and Discord sufficient?     A tool would be great for quick and easy reference We\u2019re fine as it is     0 voters      Update I\u2019ll close the poll on Monday, 5 September 2022, 0800 UTC ",

I\u2019ve got a few thoughts on making future iterations even more useful:   To build on @M_C\u2019s point above, my main issue with the tool was that while some options were high-level, essentially vision statements (\u2018increase DAI supply\u2019, \u2018increase vault usage\u2019), others were specific and tactical (\u2018formalize Arranger definition\u2019, develop plan to cap RWA as total % of collateral\u2019). For a first go at the exercise that\u2019s completely fine, of course, but I think it\u2019s hard to build actionable steps from a comparison between apples and oranges.   There could be another column in the sheet, where PrioScore is weighted by how much MKR is actually delegated to each delegate at that point in time. I do like the current setup where interested observers can compare delegates\u2019 positions on their merits, but I don\u2019t think this provides an accurate picture of the prioritisation of \u2018Maker governance\u2019 per se. A weighted score, factoring in that some delegate\u2019s views carry more MKR delegation than others, would provide a more accurate picture of where Maker governance\u2019s priorities lie.   It would be an interesting exercise to provide a twin poll for the next iteration to the community, per @twblack88\u2019s idea, but there would likely need to be some kind of Sybil-resistant mechanism to prevent spam (maybe piggybacking off the forum\u2019s reputation system, even if that isn\u2019t perfect either). I\u2019m positive GovAlpha (@prose11 @Patrick_J ) would have views on this given they have done recent work on community priority-setting: Prioritization Framework - Sentiment Polling.   ",

TRUEMAKER:  if for the winning topics, there would be a few action oriented items that RDs   Couldn\u2019t agree more. I want to tie that in to one of the excellent points @Matt_NZ is making:     Matt_NZ:  while some options were high-level, essentially vision statements (\u2018increase DAI supply\u2019, \u2018increase vault usage\u2019), others were specific and tactical   That was definitely missing in my ask. For the next iteration, we\u2019d need to be clearer on what level the priorities should be set on (strategic vs. tactical). Since this is for short-term priorities, the tactical level seems more appropriate for me. So to stick with the example: Instead of  \u201cIncrease DAI supply\u201d, say \u201cRun an experiment for three months where we increase bridge ceilings to help L2 DAI\u201d     Matt_NZ:  PrioScore is weighted by how much MKR is actually delegated to each delegate at that point in time   Good point and something I could just add afterwards. Something that\u2019ll probably make it to round 2. What I liked about the current approach is that, while it\u2019s not reflective of possible on-chain votes, it allows a more egalitarian input into the priorities tool. Which has value in and off itself.     Matt_NZ:  t would be an interesting exercise to provide a twin poll for the next iteration to the community, per @twblack88\u2019s idea, but there would likely need to be some kind of Sybil-resistant mechanism to prevent spam   Yeah, I really didn\u2019t come up with something better that would give me access-gate or sybill-resistance with lower cost to develop (0 for round 1  ) But I have a really cool idea for round two. Stay tuned. Gonna try that out in the next day or two. All I\u2019m sayin\u2019 is that you might want to put half a MATIC in your Polygon wallet  ",

For a first go at the exercise that\u2019s completely fine, of course, but I think it\u2019s hard to build actionable steps from a comparison between apples and oranges.   I agree with the challenge here. I would approach this from the very basics: Goals, Strategies, Objectives and Tactics. The Delegates has given us (non-binding) \u201cgoals\u201d; some are broad, some are more specific. Ideally, we evolve and end on more specific goals by iterating which would make work more efficient, but I think this is a good start nonetheless. Now that we have some Goals suggestions, who defines Strategies? I\u2019m my previous life, a Central/Global team does the research, from there with Goal inputs derives Strategies that are aligned across global, regional and local executives in a multinational corporation, and then, the Glogal/Regional/Local teams come up with projects that deliver on the Goal, following the decided strategy. Local teams might focus more on Tactics (short-term, quick execution, less resources needed) in the local supply chain and sales points and Regional and Global teams develop thorough cross-market projects that involve more time and resources which can be applied locally. In theory in a permissionless protocol, anyone can come up with Goals, Strategies, Objectives and Tactics, but in practice it is between: 1.- Delegates 2.- CUs 3.- Highly engaged community members / mkr holders. The questions are: how to facilitate the birth of these strategies? Should we evolve the simple tool into one where anyone can put in the remaining pieces: strategies, objectives and tactics? Should, @SES-Core-Unit  for example, coordinate cross-cu/delegates/community member workshops to source strategies and derive projects from them and later use project based funding to allocate current CU capacity to these agreed strategies? How can we make this decentralized: should we generalize a MIP that defines a process to source goals and derive Strategies/Objectives/Tactics in such a way that anyone can participate in it with a certain cadence such as our governance cycle has? Should the Monthly Governance Polls that @GovAlpha-Core-Unit  / @gov-comms-core-unit  started with different topics be the goal-setting-binding continuous-on temp check which we use to take a snapshot based on the cadence we agree on? I truly believe, end-game or not end-game, the DAO needs a new behavior on strategic decision making, such new behavior can later be used by metaDAOs, and for sure will be needed at Maker level anyway, you cannot run a business (aalso a decentralized one) without a set of goals and strategies.

The ideal tool is as permissive and encompassing as possible while still effectively eliminating spam and surfacing consensus. We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the role of delegates, and there\u2019s an excellent MIP set out by GovAlpha, right now tackling some of these issues.

DAOs are for self-starters, innovators, critical thinkers, where contributors are biased towards action. Maker is permissionless and open sourced to fuel diversity of ideas and innovation on top of it. Gatekeeping is the opposite of all that. We will have free-riders, there is not way out of it. I tend to think that in a typical corporation by gatekeeping you can extract value easier and faster, in a DAO where things take forever, gatekeeping is not as profitable, free-riders and larpers will lose interest and real doers, aligned with the goals, will persist. We need a new psychological safety state where CU members, delegates, community members, MKR holders are not afraid of self-starting. If we don\u2019t create a space where ppl can share their ideas openly, we are killing innovation, motivation, decentralization, we are self-censoring our DAO. How to reach such new psychological safety state where gatekeeping is not an issue? I don\u2019t really know, but I would start by:  Encouraging everyone on providing feedback that is fact based, removing opinionated connotations when interacting in the DAO (reduce the usage of adjectives when argumenting a point). Adjectives are powerful and the used in politicking frequently. Focus on the intention and not on the actions by others. Try to read what the intention was, and open a dialogue with the counterparty if you disagree on the action, but reach understanding of their intention first. A piece on this from kernel.community: \ud83d\udd0d Intention | Kernel    More seriously, we are conditioned to value action and results over intention. We live in a global culture that emphasizes what we achieve rather than what we mean. Actions are, in a sense, how we attempt to make the external world match our internal world. They\u2019re important, and what you achieve matters, but it is not the primary matter.

Unless you examine your own expectations, you will always be disappointed.  ",

I tend to think that Goals are going to become a handful no matter what, the long-tail goals are going to be smaller on impact and maybe external companies/DAOs/Ecosystem Actors can act on them through proposals to the DAO. Everything starts centralized. Everything new starts with the idea in someone\u2019s head. It is the believe in decentralization ethos which will lead that person to make the process decentralized. Having a framework for strategic decision making will provide a tool for anyone to share goals. I think we need a MIP for this at some point that enforces a new DAO behavior. New goals could be sourced through a template in the forum where a member shares the goal and some research data to make it compelling and then through a gov process add it to the continuous-on governance polls and as it reaches the top priorities, the same process will source strategies around it. It is going to be organic and somewhat chaotic until the process becomes just another behavior in the DAO. ",

A tool that surfaces short-term priorities for the DAO that resonate with the maximum amount of active DAO members.   Would be good if you add the dates to the sheet: date range for sourcing goals, date range for voting. This would give us the frame on why certain priorities are like they are by cross-checking what was happening in the market during that time and understand recency bias for example better. ",

                    "content": "    rspa:  I actually love that it\u2019s not binding, because I want it to reflect preference more than policy. Hope that makes sense. I feel people respond from a more unfiltered place when they don\u2019t have to steer the DAO.   I agree on this point - there are also extra issues that come with making something like this \u2018binding\u2019 (rightly, there would need to be layers of extra rigour and detail around costs, resources and logistics; plus extra questions about what happens if a delegate with lots of MKR chooses not to participate, etc)  and at that point the process may as well be folded into a MIP system. I take your point about how an egalitarian and less formal approach to priority-setting can be really valuable.     M_C:  I truly believe, end-game or not end-game, the DAO needs a new behavior on strategic decision making, such new behavior can later be used by metaDAOs, and for sure will be needed at Maker level anyway, you cannot run a business (aalso a decentralized one) without a set of goals and strategies.   Strongly agree. I note there are some suggestions to this end in the Endgame Plan which is great to see; simply launching a dozen MetaDAOs is not a solution in itself.     rspa:  But I have a really cool idea for round two. Stay tuned. Gonna try that out in the next day or two. All I\u2019m sayin\u2019 is that you might want to put half a MATIC in your Polygon wallet    Excited for this! ",
