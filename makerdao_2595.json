Last year I opened a CDP via the old online portal at https://cdp.makerdao.com/. I put up ETH as collateral and used DAI to buy more ETH, which I then added to the pool of collateral in order to lower the price at which I\u2019d be stopped out of my position. I was basically leveraging a long position on Ethereum. I have tried to migrate the contract using the tool at https://migrate.makerdao.com/ however the migration keeps failing. I\u2019m pretty sure I just need to add the correct amount of funds in either DAI or SAI, and MKR, in order to cover the relevant fees. I\u2019m not completely familiar with the technicalities of smart contracts and could really do with some help understanding my best option at this point. This was my first attempt at using any form of DeFi contract. I am hoping I can find someone with enough relevant knowledge to help me resolve the issue, and I will pay for their service. Thanks ",
