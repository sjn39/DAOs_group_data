                    "content": " Request to Poll: One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall As Interim Facilitator for CES-001, I am requesting to poll governance for approval on a one-time MKR distribution of 96.15 MKR. This one-time distribution is to correct the MKR shortfall created by the actions of the previous CES-001 facilitator during their departure and is required to fulfil the MKR awards for the current members of CES.  Summary of CES\u2019s MKR Situation  After conducting a thorough audit for CES-001, a shortfall of 96.15 MKR was identified for the MKR Incentive Program awards for current CES contributors. The shortfall was created by the previous facilitator of CES selectively accelerating payouts for certain contributors during his departure.  966.49 MKR was transferred to CES-001 for MKR incentives. 514.16 MKR was distributed by the previous facilitator for annual vests. 393.81 MKR was distributed by the previous facilitator for \u201caccelerated vesting\u201d during their departure, resulting in the shortfall.   I can confirm that the current contributors of CES did not receive any MKR awards due to the circumstances surrounding the previous facilitator\u2019s departure. They are owed a total of 154.67 MKR for annual vests in Dec & Jan. CES-001 currently controls a remaining 58.52 MKR of the initial transfer from Governance, and requires a one-time distribution of 96.15 MKR to fulfil the currently owed awards of it\u2019s contributors.  A full report on the CES-001 facilitator transition can be found here with additional details and context.   Poll Specifics  Approval of a one-time transfer of 96.15 MKR to the CES Auditor Wallet in the first available Spell to fulfil the owed annual vesting awards for CES contributors.  CES Auditor Wallet Address: 0x25307aB59Cd5d8b4E2C01218262Ddf6a89Ff86da    After funds are in the auditor wallet, CES will conduct the full auditor cycle defined by SES to move funds from the Auditor Wallet, to the Ops Wallet, and then to contributors.   CES\u2019s Updated MKR Forecast CES is scheduled for it\u2019s next MKR transfer from the Core on April 1st. The MIP-approved amount for this transfer is 483.24 MKR. MIP40c3-SP30 approved a range of 2,292.46 to 2,899.46 MKR over the life of CES\u2019s incentive program (through OCT-2024). After the recent changes, CES\u2019s semi-annual vesting schedule would only require 77.34 MKR (a reduction of 405.9 from the approved 483.24 MKR amount). Factoring in the initial distribution of 966.49 MKR, this requested one-off transfer of 96.15 MKR, and the 3 future vests of 77.34 MKR, the program forecast for CES is lowered to 1,294.66 MKR. This new amount does not factor in repricing, additional members joining, or compensation increases for current members. However, this forecast should demonstrate that the additional one-time transfer requested in this poll does not increase the total amount of MKR awarded to CES contributors under the approved program.
