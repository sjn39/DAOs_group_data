I\u2019ve delegated my gitcoins to some fella. My trust and encouragement were put into words that spoke to me from the pages of this forum. The time had passed, and years later I wondered - what happened to this fella, what is he or she is doing? How was the experience of taking the responsibility and going on with the stewardship? And the most puzzling question - who was that person? ",

The power to hold your delegate accountable means you need to 1) easily be able to identify the delegate and 2) view the results of their votes.  Without a lot of blockchain knowledge.  I would add a number 3) able to square stated principles with actual votes (but that might be too progressive for the moment). @abitrolly - I don\u2019t know the easiest way to do this myself, but I will use your case to write up a quick \u201chow to\u201d doc.
