                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of August. This month\u2019s primary focus is outlined below.  Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  Collateral Onboarding  [GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Form (Aug 11, 2022)  On August 11, 2022, @monet-supply proposed a MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application for the GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI LP token. The application is available below:     [GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Form Collateral Onboarding Applications (MIP6)   MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Form This proposal for collateral onboarding is intended to help diversify Maker\u2019s risk from centralized stablecoins across issuers. While all centralized USD stablecoins face similar pressures with respect to regulation, spreading exposure to multiple issuers could reduce risk from possible \u201cover-compliance\u201d.   Background Information 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  @monet-supply  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of t\u2026      Pending Collateral Work  Collateral Status Index  There are currently two on-chain collateral types in the implementation phase in the CSI CMON Prefiltered View: rETH and Compound D3M. rETH: The rETH Collateral Onboading Risk Assessment was published on May 20, 2022. The target implementation date for rETH was mid-August, 2022. However, spell deployment is now TBD due to the upcoming Rocket Pool Protocol upgrade as well as the upcoming Ethereum Merge. If there are no further delays of the Rocket Pool or the Merge updates, the mainnet implementation of rETH collateral on Maker is likely to be in October 2022. Compound D3M: The original Compound D3M Risk Assessment was published on January 12, 2022. The new target implementation date is mid-September, 2022. There are also two assets in the Application Phase (i) GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI and (ii) UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC. The greenlight poll target is September 5, 2022 for both assets. The CSI spreadsheet and the latest CSI Update (August 25, 2022) provides further insight into the assets that are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders.  Other Analyses  Merge Risks and Market Impacts (Aug 5, 2022) Proposal: Adjust ETH Interest Rate Model (Aug 16, 2022) [ARC] Aave ETHPoW Fork Risk Mitigation Plan (Aug 23, 2022)  There has been discussion in the Ethereum community and beyond on a potential ETHPoW fork following a successful implementation of the Ethereum Merge. The Risk Core Unit has provided an overview of potential market effects and risks involved for MakerDAO. The analysis is available below:     Merge Risks and Market Impacts Research       With the merge drawing closer and increased discussion about potential network fork(s), risk CU wanted to share an overview of the possible market effects and risks involved.   Background Ethereum is planning to merge the proof of stake (POS) validation mechanism with the execution layer and eliminate proof of work (POW) mining. This upgrade from POW to POS is the result of years of development effort and has strong support throughout the Ethereum and defi community. Technical execution risks ar\u2026     After some discussion, we realized that lending markets such as Aave and Compound face greater risks. Most tokens, excluding ETH, will likely be worthless on an ETHPoW chain. Hence, one strategy users may employ to maximize their cryptoasset holdings, will likely be to borrow as much ETH as possible, collateralized mainly by stablecoins or other tokens. This will allow them to retain the potential value of a forked ETH token. Due to the fact that Aave and Compound make up a significant market share of DeFi lending, the Risk Core Unit believes that the risks are systemic and can likely impact the whole DeFi industry, including MakerDAO. Hence, two seperate analyses and potential mitigation plans were posted to the respective governance forums of Aave and Compound. These analyses are linked below. Compound:    Compound Community Forum \u2013 16 Aug 22    Proposal: Adjust ETH Interest Rate Model Overview This proposal adjusts parameters for the Compound ETH market. Specifically, this proposal would implement a borrow cap and update the interest rate model to a new jump rate model featuring a much higher maximum borrow rate to ensure...

The dashboard is currently in the second stage of a three-part development plan. More information is available on the Aave Grants...  Reading time: 6 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 29 \u2764       To compensate for the research and development costs in connection to the proposals, the Risk Core Unit suggested a one time payment from both Compound and Aave. If both proposals are accepted the payment will be 100 COMP from Compound and 60 AAVE from Aave to MakerDAO\u2019s Pause Proxy.

Proposed changes this month included two separate options. The on-chain poll was structured as a ranked choice vote between option 1, option 2, and no changes. Option 1 would have a relatively negligible impact on revenue (~2%), while option 2 would have a more significant impact (~17%): Option 1  WSTETH-B: Increase maximum debt ceiling to 200 million DAI CRVV1ETHSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 2%, increase GAP to 10 million DAI, and increase maximum debt ceiling to 50 million DAI MANA-A: Reduce stability fee to 4.5%   Option 2  ETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 1.5% ETH-B: Reduce stability fee to 3% WSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 1.5% WBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 2% WBTC-B: Reduce stability fee to 3.5% RENBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%   The proposed changes were available for on-chain voting between August 29, 2022 and September 1, 2022. The winning option was \u201cOption 2\u201d, with 58,305 MKR supporting as first choice. The changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit\u2019s schedule allows.

This month we have investigated three potential vault types, (i) a CurveLP-stETH-ETH vault, (ii) a WBTC-B vault, and (iii) a WBTC-BProt-A vault. The CurveLP-stETH-ETH collateral onboarding risk evaluation has been published to the forum. A review and plan of action regarding WBTC-B and WBTC-BProt-A has also been published. A WBTC-B collateral onboarding risk evaluation will be published later this week. Several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken. These include (i) incorporating a monitoring tool for the Aave v2 DAI Direct Deposit Module, (ii) a risk page redesign, (iii) improved \u201cVaults at Risk\u201d simulations, and (iv) additional metrics for external DAI capital. More information about the updates are set out below. Two Risk Core Unit members, Primoz and monet-supply, are part of the MakerDAO Open Market Committee. Due to the increased demand for DAI minting a Mid-month Parameter Changes Proposal was published. This included several proposed changes to the DC-IAM of ETH-A, ETH-B, and WBTC-A. The end of month Parameter Changes Proposal focused more on increasing the stability fee of several vaults. Finally, six Core Unit members attended Lisbon Blockchain Week. Activities included: (i) attending the LisCon conference, (ii) meeting several MakerDAO community members in person, and (iii) both internal meetings with Core Units and external meetings with other DeFi teams.

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of February. Our primary focus this month is outlined below. A statement regarding the ongoing discussion and work of a B.Protocol integration was posted to the forum. In our opinion, the integration should be put on hold for the time being. This might be reconsidered in the future if and when B.Protocol can demonstrate higher demand for DAI locked in the B.AMM. In our opinion, at the present time, it would be more fruitful for MakerDAO to focus on opportunities such as L2 developments and D3M type modules. A second article, Maker Capital at Risk: Model Methodology, was posted to Block Analitica\u2019s Medium page. A deeper dive into the Collateral Risk Model is set out in the paper. The Risk Core Unit uses this model to determine two key risk parameters in Maker governance: Risk Premium and Debt Ceiling. A proposal was posted to the Compound governance forum on February 9. The objective was to gauge the sentiment for reducing the cMKR borrow limit (currently set to 25,000 MKR). The availability of borrowable MKR tokens significantly reduces the cost of an Emergency Shutdown attack. Hence, reducing the MKR borrow limit on Compound should make it harder for a malicious actor to perform such an attack. The winning option was \u201cReduce MKR borrow cap to 5,000 MKR\u201d. Following the recent signal request regarding FLAP auctions, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PE) has introduced a new solution that can limit the amount of parallel running flap-auctions. Part of this solution is a new parameter called lid. This limits the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to auctions at any one time. The Risk Core Unit posted an analysis and parameter proposal for an appropriate lid value. The analysis reviewed historical FLAP auctions in order to gain an understanding of how competitive the surplus auction keeper ecosystem really is. This resulted in a proposed lid parameter value of 150.000 DAI. With this lid value, a maximum of 5 surplus auctions every 30 minutes, or 7.2m DAI per day, can be executed. Several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken, such as (i) a new Auctions simulation, (ii) updates to the Compound monitor page, and (iii) improvements to the vaults debt at risk graph. More information about these updates is set out below. Following MIP40c3-SP56, we have now officially joined forces with Makerburn. This means, among other things, that Makerburn updates will be included as a separate section in the Risk Core Unit\u2019s \u201cmonth in review\u201d. More on these updates are set out below. Key topics for February include (i) DAI on L2, (ii) Collateral Parameter pages, and (iii) a Makerburnbot integration. Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply, are part of the MakerDAO Open Market Committee. Two changes were proposed for the month of February. These were (i) WSTETH-A: Increase debt ceiling to 300M (from 200M) and gap to 30M (from 20M), and (ii) DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Reduce bar to 2.85% (from 3.5%), increase debt ceiling to 300M (from 220M), and increase gap to 65M (from 50M). The proposed changes will be submitted for on-chain voting soon. This is the seventh monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here. We will continue to update the community on a monthly basis going forward. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates.

I believe there are various ways to integrate with these protocols, so please do not disregard the protocol if the current implementation is too risky. If the Risk CU argues that the current implementation is too risky for integration, or would only allow for a very low debt ceiling, it would make sense for the protocol to adjust the implementation to be more feasible for integration. I also would like to offer to contribute to the analysis of these two if that is something you would be open to. ",

The following list gives a run-down of our activities for the month of April and includes some pointers for what awaits us in May. As always, comments and feedback are very welcome.  Executives  Core Unit Budget Distributions April 29, 2022  Oracle Whitelist Additions, Curve stETH/ETH Oracle April 22, 2022  Offload TUSD and DAI Transfers April 15, 2022  Copy Stub For Out-Of-Schedule Executive April 14, 2022  MOMC Parameter Changes, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Debt Ceiling Increase, Recognized Delegate Compensation, ETHAmsterdam Event SPF Funding April 08, 2022  Core Unit Budget Distributions and Vesting Streams Setup, Gelato Keeper Network Budget Stream Setup April 1, 2022    Forum Posts  MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals 14th April Emergency Executive Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget Update to the Gelato Keeper Network Top Up Contract PECU Initiatives & Priorities TUSD Offloading - Flat Kick Incentive Change   Smart Contracts  Introduced enhancements and updates to DssTest, including support for the latest solidity version Added numerous changes to DssExecLib to optimise spell creation processes Provided DssCure contract feedback to ChainSecurity - no problems were identified Presented DssProxy contract following discussion with integrators. Auditor feedback and discussion is ongoing Completed GemJoin9 for PAXG which is now ready for audit Added vat.live check to DssVest to prevent its use after shutdown Updated DssVest DAI contract (MCD_VEST_DAI) to prevent vat.suck calls from being possible in the event of emergency shutdown. This also resulted in deprecating the future use of existing contracts and updated naming to  MCD_VEST_DAI_LEGACY. Worked with CES to onboard WSTETH-B for the following week\u2019s executive Provided feedback and updates to developerguides supporting CES Updated the CRVV1ETHSTETH oracle following the Curve pool bug resulting in the oracle freeze  Completed coding reviews on TUSD offboarding Provided the ability to override DssFlash using DssFlashKiller in the event of emergency shutdown Updated dss-deploy-scripts 1.11.0 to support the rate limited version of the flapper Completed GemAbstract integration test enhancements for spells-mainnet and goerli  Setup a local Erigon node in addition to openethereum to support faster testing and contract deployments Completed D3MPlanBase and D3MCompoundDaiPlan code for audit. PECU is currently providing a round of feedback to ChainSecurity before audit publishing is signed-off.  For reference, PECU continues to complete an internal review of the D3MCompoundDaiPool contract before handing over to ChainSecurity. Audits are expected to commence mid-end May.     Prototyping Community discussion often gives PECU the opportunity to propose technical proof of concepts in support of emerging ideas. This month included two such prototypes:   DssSnog that if implemented, authorises the Oracle Core Unit to give readers access to oracle prices without having to give authorisation via a governance executive. This would still require authorisation each time a new pip is onboarded, however it would allow the OCU to allow readers to call kiss() without waiting on Governance as per this recent executive.  DssKiln, allows a module to permissionlessly buy tokens and send them to an address, such as the PauseProxy. This solution was ideated in light of recent treasury design discussions. A forum post will be forthcoming but will not be worked on unless there is community appetite.

Utilizing Rust as the source language means that we can integrate it with Foundry, the new smart contract framework developed by Paradigm & gaining rapid adoption. This particular symbolic evm is also more modular than others that exist; often, only certain parts of a program are executed symbolically, and that choice depends on the specific analysis one is doing. This symbolic evm is modular enough that it will support various degrees of symbolic analysis as well as easily configuring which aspects are symbolic vs concrete. This will also improve performance since it means that engineers can tune which aspects are symbolic according to the particular properties they\u2019re testing for in a given situation. ",

Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses Collateral Onboard and Pending Collateral Work There are currently two on-chain collateral types in the implementation phase in the CSI CMON Prefiltered View: rETH and Compound D3M. rETH: The target implementation date for rETH is mid-August, 2022. Rocket Pool recently implemented an upgrade to the protocol. This means that CES needs to revisit the original rETH Token Smart Contract Techincal Assessment to see if any of the new changes will impact the collateral onboarding process. In addition, the original rETH Collateral Onboading Risk Assessment was published over 2 months ago. Internal changes to the protocol and relevant exogenous factors may impact the Risk Core Unit\u2019s analysis and recommended risk parameters. The Risk Core Unit will revisit the original rETH risk assessment prior to the mid-August target implementation date with new recommendations. Compound D3M: The original Compound D3M Risk Assessment was published on January 12, 2022. The new target implementation date is end of August, 2022. The Risk Core Unit is planning to provide updated risk parameter recommendations for the Compound D3M shortly before the Compound D3M mainnet implementation. The exact date will depend on the finalized mainnet implementation date. The CSI spreadsheet and the latest CSI Update (July 28, 2022) provides further insight into what assets are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders. Risk Analysis of MIP76: Makershire Redux  MIP76: Makershire Redux - reply from monet-supply (July 14, 2022)  MIP76 proposes an allocation of up to 10 million DAI towards liquidity provision strategies. The program seeks to improve DAI liquidity and utility, while generating yield for the Maker protocol. A response from the Risk Core Unit regarding MIP76 was shared by @monet-supply. The analysis is available below:     MIP76: Makershire Redux RFC       Hi all,  Sharing a general perspective on the proposal from the @Risk-Core-Unit.   Proposal Overview Makershire Redux proposal would allocate up to 10 million DAI towards liquidity provision strategies. The program would seek to improve DAI liquidity and utility, while generating yield for the protocol. Depending on the particular LP strategies employed, this could create exposure to a range of defi protocols, bridges, validator sets/sequencers, external stablecoins, and volatile crypto assets.  \u2026     It is also worth noting that the Risk Core Unit is planning on developing a framework with the objective of scoring different L2 implementations. Such an assessment framework may be useful for several activities, including (i) liquidity provision strategies, (ii) further development on new platforms, and (iii) collateral onboarding risk evaluations for MCD on L2s. More information is provided by @Primoz below:     Request: Scientific risk calculation of entrusting protocol-owned funds to 3rd party multisigs Miscellaneous       Chris, happy to cooperate on this topic. We recently started thinking about developing a framework that tries to score different L2 implementations, multisig being one of the technical risk inputs. We\u2019d thought about using L2 Beats for such descriptive inputs. See example from L2Beats for Optimism multisig risk assessment here.  I must admit though that I don\u2019t expect us to develop a highly reliable \u201cscientific risk calculation\u201d of multisig risk as in performing some advanced quantifiable calcu\u2026      Maker Risk Dashboard  Announcing Maker Risk Dashboard v3 (July 5, 2022)  The Maker Risk Dashboard v3 Announcement The Maker Risk Dashboard v3 was announced on July 5, 2022.

This audit is currently taking place and initial response is expected mid-July.  During June, the bulk of the work involved intensive internal-team review prior to audit handover ensuring improved readability, avoidance of redundancy, and elimination of any points of failure. This team-effort took place over a number of weeks and was critical for completness.   L2 - Fast Withdrawals & Teleport As previously mentioned, the code and audits for L2 to L1 fast withdrawals is complete. The team has been finalising their internal review through June into July with a target deployment during the first week of August. Integration and unit tests have been completed, with frontend UI work being the only remaining dependency. Other L2 work included:  Identification of StarkWare contracts not in the chainlog, these being added to goerli and mainnet spells with the STARKNET_CORE label. DssBridge development - enhancements to ensure accurate oracle price is recorded at shutdown Foundry support for multiple forks    General Smart Contract Engineering  Researching mechanisms to modernise the PSM.

I see response mid-July. Right now I have 2 critical things Maker needs to get done sooner than later.  Compound D3M (debate how much we might earn but I expect it should be at least 100K month) Getting HVB, Monetalis US-Treasuries or ETF investments going which should also net us 100K+/month on up to 100M  I am trying to get timeline handles from now to when we can start to see revenue on these. Second question is does PECU have any role in RWF coming on line here or is this just CES? Last question is about StarkNet and the .CU - how does the StarkNe CU work with PECU?  My questions focus on when this will complete formally (or the timeline to complete) and whether this will still require a StarkNet CU or if the operational side will formally drop to TechOps and PECU or ?  I am trying to figure out whether there will be some formal ramp down on StarkNet CU once released or whether that is going to need some sort of Ramp up from an expense to deliverable point of view. Thanks in advance. ",

Re: Audit estimations for the D3M PECU has already completed a code walkthrough with ChainSecurity (the entity we have on retainer and are using for this audit). They have a good understanding of the contract capabilities and are undergoing their audit this week. Speaking with them today, it is my expectation that the preliminary audit paper will be completed by the end of this week, upon which there is typically some feedback between them and us - depending on code questions that they have. Then, pending the governance executive and debt ceiling configuration, we should be good for launch during the first week of August is my best estimate right now (assuming there are no changes required to the code, and that HVB and SocGen fit into the prior week\u2019s executive). Re: PECU and RWF deals PECU\u2019s role in RWF is fairly minimal. Aside from 2 or 3 meetings with CES for technical oversight of their integrations, the bulk of the work has been in the legal domain, so our involvement has not been needed. Re: PECU and StarkNet CU Collaboration The StarkNet CU works closely with us as they have leveraged the simple bridge and the fast withdrawal capabilities. They have been very responsive and eager to work with us because of the opportunity to leverage existing implementations where possible. Taking a longer-term view - and assuming that this is an implementation of Multi Collateral DAI on L2, there will be still be a need to maintain and grow the ecosystem - whether this is keeping up with new bridges or adding new collateral types, maintaining rates, ensuring liquidations function, etc. So, yes, depending on the level of this work, a team will be required. It may be relevant to mention that this week we are having a detailed L2 offsite where I expect to have further detail on such roadmap and strategy questions that we can present back to you. ",

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of April. This month\u2019s primary focus is outlined below.  Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  COMP Reward Change: Impact Analysis (Apr 8, 2022) [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation Update (Apr 14, 2022) Introduction & Risk Parameters for wstETH-C Vault (Apr 18, 2022) Maker Collateral Risk Model: Feature Analysis (Apr 26, 2022)  An increased amount of D3M integrations will lead to a significant increase in risk exposure to external DeFi protocols. In an attempt to identify and mitigate some of these risks, our team will actively follow the governance process of protocols that MakerDAO decides to integrate with. For Compound specifically, a major decision was recently put in motion - to cut the COMP rewards in half. On April 8, @josolnik posted \u201cCOMP Reward Change: Impact Analysis\u201d to the Compound governance forum. The analysis focused on the following questions: (i) How did the distribution of recursive position supply change relative to other wallet strategies after the governance decision? (ii) What share of recursive position supply would be profitable if the rewards decrease even further? (iii) How much recursive position supply would Compound lose by further dropping the rewards, assuming that users would soon close any unprofitable positions? A Signal Request asking the community if PAXG should be onboarded ended on April 5. However, GovAlpha recommended on April 7 that the poll should be re-run after an updated risk assessment was made available. On April 14, following this recommendation, the Risk Core Unit published an updated version of the PAXG risk assessment, which is available here. On April 18, recommended risk parameters for a wstETH vault with a higher Liquidation Ratio and a lower Stability Fee were posted to the forum, following expressed interest by the Maker community. This particular vault type was previously discussed as wstETH-C. However, if onboarded to the Maker Protocol, the vault will be added under the ilk name wstETH-B to maintain sequential naming conventions. A third article, Maker Collateral Risk Model: Feature Analysis, was posted to Block Analitica\u2019s Medium page. The article dives deeper into the Maker Collateral Risk Model. It aims to answer the questions: (i) How important are different features on model output? and (ii) Which feature contributed most to a certain model output?  Proposals  Immediate & Short-term Parameter Changes Proposal for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A - DC and gap increase (Apr 6, 2022) Reduce MKR Borrow Limit (Apr 11, 2022) TL;DR Thread - Introducing the Basepool: a proposed partnership between @MakerDAO and @CurveFinance (Apr 29, 2022) Basepool Curve Pool and Maker Partnership Proposal (A/B versions) (Apr 29, 2022)  A post regarding proposed parameter changes to CRVV1ETHSTETH-A was published on April 6. The post included two separate proposals. The first proposal focused on increasing the debt ceiling from 3M to 5M DAI. This part was included in an executive which was passed and executed on April 11, 2022. The second proposal focused on (i) increasing the DC-IAM line (DC) to 50M and (ii) increasing the DC-IAM gap to 10M. However, following the out-of-schedule executive on April 14, this proposal was put on hold. More about the emergency executive here. On April 11, @monet-supply\u2019s proposal (to reduce the Compound MKR market\u2019s borrow limit from 25,000 MKR to 5,000 MKR) successfully passed. This change will help mitigate the risk of a malicious actor triggering the emergency shutdown module (ESM) in the Maker Protocol. See the previous discussion here. On April 29, a new partnership between MakerDAO and Curve was proposed by @monet-supply. The proposal would create a new pool (tentatively named Basepool) including DAI, USDC, USDP, and GUSD. The draft proposal is available here. A TL;DR Twitter thread is available here. The plan is to launch a formal proposal and begin moving the partnership forward in the coming weeks.

Included in this summary are updates highlighted in previous monthly reviews. To read previous summaries in further detail, refer to the Risk Core Unit Month in Review series.  Collateral-Related Work At the end of 2021, led by the @collateral-core-unit, several MakerDAO Core Units undertook a new coordination initiative for both on-chain and off-chain collateral. The initiative included weekly management meetings and monthly strategic planning calls between stakeholders. The sections below describe the @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s work in relation to this initiative for 2022.  Collateral Management With the @collateral-core-unit at the helm, throughout the course of the year, strategies and tools were developed to aid the process of aligning all the relevant stakeholders working with Maker collateral. The Collateral Status Index (CSI) spreadsheet, for example, was developed to help provide a comprehensive overview of the collateral onboarding, offboarding and management process. In addition, other procedures and documents were created to help facilitate the MIP6 process (note that MIP6 was deprecated following the Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set in October 2022). A document outlining MIP6 Recommended Guideline Metrics for Onchain Collateral Onboarding was posted to the forum in April 2022. Even though the MIP6 process is now removed, this document is still relevant and will provide context for future decision-making strategies related to collateral onboarding. Other posts were produced by the @Risk-Core-Unit in relation to the collateral stakeholder alignment initiative. A partial list is available below.

Although the auction parameters at that time were satisfactory, the @Risk-Core-Unit believed that there was still room for improvement. As a result, the @Risk-Core-Unit, in September 2022, performed an in-depth auction analysis and proposed a set of adjustments to Maker\u2019s auction parameters for 14 different collateral types.

However, it was also the year of the Ethereum Merge \u2013 a highly anticipated event and technological advance that took years of research, development, and coordination. As a result, from a risk perspective, several reactionary proposals and ad-hoc decisions have been necessary to ensure the resilience and robustness of the Maker Protocol. The section below summarises the work produced by the @Risk-Core-Unit in this regard.  Flappy Friday On January 22, 2022, major liquidation events occurred as a result of a significant, sudden market downtrend. This led MakerDAO\u2019s surplus buffer to exceed the Maximum System Surplus parameter. In turn, multiple surplus auctions (FLAP) were triggered. The surplus auction (FLAP) inefficiency of this event led to the day being referred to as \u201cFlappy Friday\u201d. This was one of the largest auction events in MakerDAO history and a severe stress test on the system. In response, the @Risk-Core-Unit performed a post-mortem of Flappy Friday to identify relevant insights and learnings. The analysis was used to help form an urgent signal request to stop MKR burning. It was proposed to temporarily prevent surplus auctions until the auction mechanisms could be improved. The proposed changes were (i) disabling the existing System Surplus Buffer lerp function, and (ii) setting the System Surplus Buffer parameter to 250 million DAI. Later in February 2022, the @Risk-Core-Unit posted an additional analysis and proposal regarding surplus auctions. Based on Derek\u2019s post and the supportive outcome of the Introduce Rate Limiter into Flapper poll, the @Risk-Core-Unit proposed a key parameter for the Rate Limiter called lid \u2013 the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to a surplus auction at once. A lid parameter value of 150.000 DAI was proposed. The lid parameter was later in May 2022 changed to 30.000 DAI, effectively reducing the number of parallel flap auctions from five to one.  Flappy Friday - CLIP and FLAP Analysis (Jan 2022) Rate Limiter Parameter Proposal (Feb 2022)   The Ethereum PoS Merge On September 15, 2022, the Ethereum network transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In August 2022, as the Ethereum Merge was drawing closer, there was a lot of discussion about potential network fork(s) that could happen as a result of the merge. In response, the @Risk-Core-Unit produced an overview of the possible market effects and risks involved. The situation was continuously monitored up until the merge. Two respective analyses and proposals were also provided to Compound and Aave, since lending markets were especially vulnerable to potential forks, and since they constitute a systemic level of market share in DeFi. Both proposals were adopted, which resulted in the payment of 100 COMP from Compound, and 60 AAVE from Aave, to the MCD Pause Proxy contract. Further details below.

The @Risk-Core-Unit took several proactive steps to counteract potential contagion risks associated with the event, including (i) proposing the offboarding of renBTC-A and (ii) proposing urgent parameter changes of MANA-A, MATIC-A, LINK-A, and YFI-A.

It is therefore important to set sufficient dust values, without impeding future growth and adoption. The posts below set out the @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s analysis on the dust parameter for 2022.

One section of the Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set was MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001, which includes several changes to the @Risk-Core-Unit mandate. The updated mandate makes the @Risk-Core-Unit Facilitator(s) able to unilaterally, and with no additional process, propose non-standard weekly polls and Executive Votes related to:  Decentralized and RWA Collateral management Risk parameter changes for Decentralized and RWA Collateral Other Risk Parameters in the Maker Protocol Decentralized and RWA collateral onboarding Decentralized and RWA Collateral offboarding Other votes and governance actions related to risk, Dai collateral and risk parameters  MKR holders have voted to support MIP39c2-SP35. However, it is worth noting that this MIP was neither created nor proposed by the @Risk-Core-Unit. Nevertheless, the @Risk-Core-Unit will adhere to almost all mandate changes, except for the coverage of RWAs. MKR holders and the Maker community has already been informed of this approach. Hence, RWAs will not be a priority for the @Risk-Core-Unit, and will mostly be covered by the @strat-fin-core-unit. The full difference between the previous and the updated mandate is available here.  MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation Another important MIP in the Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set is MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation. The MIP activates the implementation of a Protocol-Owned Vault (POV), starting with a Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) as an initial minimum viable product, manually operated by MKR holders. MIP84 states that the @Risk-Core-Unit is mandated with following the predefined processes as laid out in the MIP. These include: making parameter adjustment proposals, and if necessary, proposing emergency decisions to derisk POVE activity. RISK-001 facilitator actions include but are not limited to:  Stopping the DssKiln from purchasing more collateral Installing a new DssKiln with custom parameters to sell collateral for Dai to wind down the debt of the POVE Partially or fully liquidating the vault using a custom method Modifying any of the parameters that are relevant for derisking the POVE  In 2023, the @Risk-Core-Unit will continue to dedicate the necessary time and effort to follow its mandated responsibilities as laid out in MIP84. However, upcoming changes to the Endgame plan may lead to the implementation of POVE/POV being delayed. The @Risk-Core-Unit will in that case put POVE-related work in the backlog and prioritize other tasks.  Maker Risk Dashboard In May 2021, the Maker Risk Dashboard was introduced \u2013 a real-time dashboard with Maker-specific features such as (i) vault type metrics, (ii) collateral asset metrics, and (iii) automated quantitative models. The initial version of the Maker Risk Dashboard acted as a minimum viable product with a clear roadmap in mind. In September 2021, a second version of the Maker Risk Dashboard was deployed \u2013 with a new design and several new features, metrics, models, and graphs. All improvements to the Maker Dashboard v2 were documented in the Maker Risk Dashboard forum post and the @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s \u201cMonth in Review\u201d series. In July 2022, the launch of the Maker Risk Dashboard v3 was announced, which represented more than a year\u2019s worth of growth and development from the first iteration. The section below summarizes, in chronological order, key updates to the Maker Risk Dashboard v2 and v3 throughout 2022.

The Makerburn website has become a must-have tool for analysing MakerDAO performance and other on-chain-related events. In January 2022, the @Risk-Core-Unit and Makerburn officially joined forces on a team level. The section below summarizes key updates to the Makerburn website throughout 2022.

The MOMC normally meets on a monthly basis and publishes a corresponding proposal including relevant changes for the Maker Protocol. Two @Risk-Core-Unit members have been part of the MOMC since inception \u2013 @Primoz and @monet-supply. On November 23, 2022, following a unanimous decision by the MOMC group, @rema was also officially onboarded as a member. The MOMC produced 12 parameter change proposal posts in 2022.  Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 2022-01-07 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 2022-01-27 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 2022-02-24 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 31 March 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 28 April 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 27 May 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 30 June 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 28 July 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 25 August 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 29 September 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 28 October 2022 Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 24 November 2022   Month in Review To increase operational transparency, the @Risk-Core-Unit started the Month in Review initiative in August 2021. The list below includes all monthly reviews for 2022.  Risk Core Unit Month in Review: January 2022 (Feb 1, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: February 2022 (March 1, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: March 2022 (Apr 4, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: April 2022 (May 5, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: May 2022 (Jun 6, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: June 2022 (Jul 4, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: July 2022 (Aug 1, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: August 2022 (Sep 2, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: September 2022 (Oct 5, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: October 2022 (Nov 1, 2022) Risk Core Unit Month in Review: November 2022 (Dec 5, 2022)   Events Members of the @Risk-Core-Unit attended several events in 2022, including (i) DevConnect Amsterdam (April), (ii) EthCC Paris (July), and (iii) ETHGathering Barcelona (November). Such events are very valuable and serve as a good opportunity to represent MakerDAO, meet fellow MakerDAO contributors, learn from other teams, and coordinate relevant work in person.  A Look Ahead  Onboarding, Management, and Offboarding of Maker Collateral According to the Endgame Plan v3 complete overview, from the perspective of decentralised collateral, four main collateral categories should be prioritised (i) ETH (including LSDs, EtherDai, and ETH/DAI LP tokens), (ii) Misc Decentralised tokens (e.g. UNI and LINK), (iii) MKR, and (iv) MDAO tokens. Furthermore, in MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001, under \u201cAssets Onboarding and Offboarding - Proposals and Funnel (pipeline) Management\u201d, it is stated that the @Risk-Core-Unit shall evaluate assets with revenue potential above 1 million per year. The @Risk-Core-Unit will also perform risk evaluations for other collateral categories and functions in MakerDAO, including (i) Maker SubDAO (Creator) Lines of Credit, (ii) Other Potential D3Ms, and (iii) Collateral types for MCD on L2s. In 2023, the @Risk-Core-Unit will aim to satisfy the guidelines of the Endgame plan by identifying appropriate and sufficient collateral types for Maker Core. This will include market research into available Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) and other asset types that fulfil the relevant set of characteristics and metrics for the Endgame plan. Finally, the @Risk-Core-Unit will also continue to actively monitor Maker\u2019s existing portfolio and perform activities including, but not limited to, (i) proposing parameter adjustments, (ii) collateral offboarding work, and (iii) helping the facilitation of vault adoption by Creator SubDAOs.  Collateral Management Stakeholder Alignment Following the CES reorganisation, certain collateral management responsibilities have been transferred from the @collateral-core-unit to the @Risk-Core-Unit and the @strat-fin-core-unit. As a result, RISK and SF, for on-chain and off-chain collateral respectively, will manage the collateral management stakeholder alignment process. The @Risk-Core-Unit will lead monthly on-chain collateral strategy calls with relevant stakeholders. The Collateral Status Index (CSI) spreadsheet will be updated asynchronously by relevant stakeholders as required.  The Decentralised Collateral Scope Framework In 2023, Scope Frameworks will be developed as part of the ongoing Endgame plan. The @Risk-Core-Unit will aim to provide relevant feedback on the language, structure, and formatting of the Decentralised Collateral Scope Framework. In order to facilitate a smooth transition to the Endgame Plan, this work will be a high priority in early 2023.  Research Initiatives At the end of 2022, the @Risk-Core-Unit initiated a vault protection score methodology that would help produce a more granular view of risk profiles associated with individual wallets. In 2023, this research initiative will continue to be developed by creating a ML model for a dedicated vault protection score product.  The Maker Risk Dashboard Maker Risk Dashboard will continue to reflect relevant changes, improved features, upkeep, and ongoing maintenance work. Planned new features include:  DeFi Systemic Risk Monitoring D3M Risk Monitoring Improved Vault Owner Tracking Credit Scoring of Vault Owners  In addition, the Dashboard will track all relevant protocol changes over time that occur as a result of the execution of the Endgame plan.  Makerburn Makerburn will continue to track and support all necessary changes to the Maker Protocol. This will likely include (i) a comprehensive overview of SubDAOs, (ii) other Endgame-specific information, including the tracking of Elixir / LP-tokens, and (iii) more detailed RWA tracking.  MOMC The members of the MOMC (including @Risk-Core-Unit members, @Primoz, @monet-supply, and @rema) will continue to meet on a monthly basis and provide updates and proposals of necessary parameter changes to ensure the resilience and robustness of the Maker Protocol.  Closing Remarks The @Risk-Core-Unit will continue to update the Maker community on a monthly basis in 2023. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates. Please add any comments below or get in touch directly with members of the @Risk-Core-Unit.

Interesting that Luna is not mentioned in the spectacle it caused, but seemed to have had no direct negative effect on the protocol, except that via the domino effect also celcius went bankrupt which caused even more market turbulence, and then the aave D3m was deactivated just to be on the safe side. SET AAVE D3M DC to 0. It is all the more rewarding to see how secure the protocol is set up and monitored by you and the community. I admire the consistency and professionalism of the CU. lets see what\u2019s coming in 2023. ",

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of November. Our primary focus this month is outlined below. This month we have investigated three new vault types, a WBTC-B vault, a PSM-GUSD-A vault, and a WBTC-C vault. The WBTC-B risk assessment was published on November 3 and onboarded on November 22, after the executive passed. The PSM-GUSD-A risk assessment, as a response to the GUSD PSM proposal from Gemini, was published on November 10. The executive containing the PSM-GUSD-A passed on November 26. Finally, proposed risk parameters for a WBTC-C vault were published on November 18. These were also part of the executive vote which passed on November 26. We have introduced a new initiative that aims to track DAI supply growth and risk metrics. These metrics are meant to be included in the KPI Framework as part of the Monthly Strategy Review. We have also included these metrics in the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard website. A Dust Analysis and Signal Request was posted on the forum. The Signal Request queried the support for increasing the dust parameter for different Maker vaults. The poll closed on November 25. The results can be seen here. There are currently two active on-chain polls on increasing the dust parameter: (i) increasing the dust parameter for ETH-B, and (ii) increasing the dust parameter for all vault types excluding ETH-B and ETH-C. Several proposals have been posted this month, including: (i) increasing debt ceilings for different vault types (GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, Staked ETH, and Aave D3M), (ii) decreasing the target borrow rate for Aave D3M, (iii) auction throughput parameter adjustments, and (iv) offboarding collateral parameters. More information about these proposals are set out below. Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply, are part of the MakerDAO Open Market Committee. Due to the increased use of WBTC as collateral, the committee proposed to increase the SF from 2.5% to 4% for WBTC-A and from 5% to 7% for WBTC-B in a mid-month parameter changes proposal. These changes were part of the executive that passed on November 20. The end of month parameter changes proposal includes proposed changes such as: (i) increasing the stability fee for ETH-A, ETH-B, LINK-A, MANA-A, UNI-A, GUSD-A, and Uniswap V2-LPs, (ii) decreasing the stability fee for GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and (iii) increasing the debt ceiling to 2000m and increasing gap to 80m for WBTC-A. The proposed changes are currently included in an on-chain poll, and if passed, will be included in the executive vote on December 3. Finally, several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken, such as: (i) improvements to the AAVE monitoring dashboard, (ii) an improved vault protection score model, and (iii) the option to search vaults by user wallet address/vault id. More information about these updates are set out below. This is the fourth monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here. We will continue to update the community on a monthly basis going forward. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates.

Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  Collateral Onboarding  Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001 (Latest Proposal Version) RISK-001 renewed Mandate Diffchecker  The ratification poll for the Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set passed on October 24, 2022. As a result, the MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001 amendments were also accepted by MKR holders. The updated Risk Core Unit Mandate makes the Risk Core Unit Facilitator able to unilaterally, and with no additional process, propose non-standard weekly polls and Executive Votes related to: (i) Decentralized and RWA Collateral management, (ii) Risk parameter changes for Decentralized and RWA Collateral, (iii) Other Risk Parameters in the Maker Protocol, (iv) Decentralized and RWA collateral onboarding, (v) Decentralized and RWA Collateral offboarding, and (vi) Other votes and governance actions related to risk, Dai collateral and risk parameters. The full difference between the previous and the updated mandate is available here. The Risk Core Unit is currently in the process of:  Together with other Collateral Management On-Chain (CMON) stakeholders further defining the collateral onboarding, offboarding, and management processes, post Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set. Discussing the possibility and usefulness of a potential formation of a collateral onboarding committee with members from other core units.  More information regarding collateral onboarding, collateral management, collateral offboarding, and the formation of a collateral onboarding committee, will follow in due course.  Pending Collateral Work  Collateral Status Index  There are currently three collateral types in the implementation phase in the CSI CMON Prefiltered View: (i) rETH, (ii) Compound D3M, and (iii) GNO. There is one collateral type in the \u201cGreenlit\u201d phase: Backed Finance. There is one collateral type in the \u201cApplication\u201d phase: Goldfinch. rETH: The Executive vote including the rETH Technical Onboarding passed on October 28, and was executed on October 31. The initial Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) is set to 0. The remaining risk parameters will reflect the successful outcome from previous rETH governance polls (1, 2), that were recommended by the Risk Core Unit in the original and updated rETH Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluations. Compound D3M: The audit related to the technical implementation of the Compound D3M has now been completed. As a result, the MOMC has proposed to activate the Compound D3M with up to 160 million debt ceiling, 10 million gap, 12h ttl, and 2% bar. GNO: The Growth Core Unit, Risk Core Unit, and Gnosis are finalizing the agreement to implement a GNO vault. The Risk Core Unit is currently working on the GNO Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation. The CSI spreadsheet and the latest CSI Update (October 27, 2022) provides further insight into the assets that are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders.  Vault User Research  Maker Parameter Impact Analysis (October 17, 2022) Vault User Research: Intra-Protocol Exposure Migration (October 20, 2022)  A Maker Parameter Impact Analysis, looking at the effects of lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%, was published to Block Analitica\u2019s Medium page in October (previously posted to the Maker forum in September). Keeping with the same theme, a Vault User Research Report on Intra-Protocol Exposure Migration was posted to the Maker forum in October. The analysis looks further into vault exposure migration through a more generalized, high-level overview.

In June and July, a number of collateral onboarding risk assessments were carried out. Final collateral onboarding voting and decision making on these projects are still in the pipeline and awaiting resolution. As a result, in August, the @Risk-Core-Unit focused on other research projects, in addition to the usual ongoing work on collateral onboarding risk assessments. We have introduced a new research initiative to derive useful insights from different aspects of Maker Vaults. This month we have investigated data regarding vault owner\u2019s growth, risk, market activity, and liquidation protection. Going forward, we will continue to collect data and automize monitoring of vault activity in order to get a better understanding of user demand and user behaviour. In addition, more attention and consideration has been given to other relevant topics, such as (i) lowering liquidation ratios, (ii) dust parameters, and (iii) offboarding collateral. These reports can be found below under \u201cOther Analyses\u201d. We have also updated the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard with new metrics, tools, and design. The new release can be found here: https://maker.blockanalitica.com/. More information about the update is set out below. Finally, we are still working on the Nexo Institutional Vault Risk Assessment. The results are due to be released in September. We are currently awaiting the final outcome from the Nexo Institutional Vault Signal Request. This is the first monthly summary of its type published by the @Risk-Core-Unit. We plan to post similar updates on a monthly basis going forward. We would value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates.

                    "content": " PECU Month in Review: July 2022 July was yet again jam packed! This month saw PECU gather irl to talk about L2 architecture and security assumptions, with some of us staying on to meet other teams at EthCC before heading home to dive back into D3M, Teleport and other smart contract initiatives. Below is a brief summary of the month along with some forward looking descriptions to help delegates in their ongoing prioritization discussions.  Executives   July 06 - Core Unit Distributions, Recognized Delegate Compensation, Keeper Network Stream Setup  July 13 - MOMC Parameter Changes  July 29 - Onboarding Real World Asset Vaults   Forum Posts   Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management - security.makerdao. Pending no objection, this will be maintained and updated by PECU Fast Withdrawals and Risk Assumptions   Direct Deposit Module - Aave (aD3M) and Compound (cD3M) With the red team reviews completed and the final contracts handed over to ChainSecurity for audit review at the end of June, the month of July has involved ongoing clarification, feedback and discussion with the auditors to ensure safe contract operation. Changes to the code has been minimal, yet has included minor testing enhancements, better aligned interfaces for integrations, and improved tolerances and rounding calculations. Next steps include:  ChainSecurity to complete a final review of our documented feedback ChainSecurity to incorporate feedback and publish the final report PECU to target an end of August governance vote to put aD3M and cD3M live.  In parallel with the above we continue to review Compound V3 and be a part of their community to follow their deployment of a USDC instance over the following weeks.  L2 Teleport & Fast Withdrawals  Paris Offsite As some may be aware, PECU held its first full-team offsite during the lead-up to EthCC in the outskirts of Paris (optimal focus/temperature & minimal distraction!). We were also lucky enough to have a number of members from Oracles, Growth, Risk, and CES join us for part of the offsite. The objective of this meeting was to bring the teams together for a common understanding of various L2 bridges, message passing services, their designs, features, and inherent implications, risks, and security assumptions. The team will shortly be making available some of the materials presented during the offsite for community awareness. This was critical to help us align architectural considerations for how DssBridge should be built and how this will help us scale Fast Withdrawals from; L2 \u2192 L1, L2 \u2192 L2, and then to full MCD with minting rights on MCD.  L2 development work in July In addition to the offsite, ongoing work in the L2 Domain included:  Final team review of the L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawal implementation Making Router updates and improving Domain Naming Scheme for Teleport Ongoing development of Dss-xdomain to improve unit test coverage, and auctions support (for post L2 \u2192 L1 deployment) In advance of the Arbitrum Nova launch, PECU is also working to deploy canonical DAI to ensure DAI exists on this chain from the beginning. Hexonaut also gave a great interview to Defiant    Forward looking: Critical path tasks to launch L2 \u2192 L1 Fast Withdrawals includes: As we approach deploying Fast Withdrawals for Optimism and Arbitrum, it seems fitting to inform the community of our critical path tasks in this space, including: Updated timeline:   Aug 5th: Local Goerli deployment for testing example UI Aug 8th-9th: Deploy Goerli and mainnet contracts for Oracles and Data Insights to reference Aug 3rd week: Oracles package their release into a new mainnet deployment and work with TechOps to deploy their formal RPC endpoint and test it for correct operation Aug 25th-26th: PECU commences work on Goerli spell Aug 29th: PECU deploys Goerli Executive Spell Aug 29th-30th: PECU works on mainnet spell  Aug 31st: Mainnet spell is deployed and available for voting By Sept 7th: Oracles confirm post deployment operation and quorum is sufficient Subsequent: Growth follow with supporting marketing and communications   Smart Contract Work Alongside the above D3M and L2 initiatives, PECU also pursued development across the following areas:  Wrapped up gemJoin9 which included the pax-gem-join alongside local branch testing Added D3M Keeper to dss-cron Documented authorization scripts (wards) for VAT rely\u2019s Completed offboarding lerps and the LerpJob Keeper Finalised AuctionDemoKeeper support for the new WSTETH clipper callee Completed Exchange callees - replacing univ2daieth (now offboarded) simulations with univ2usdceth, as well as completing standardized curve lp token testing   Alignment With Other Core Units  Echidna testing for Deco regarding DssGate Meeting with Growth and Fireblocks for integration exploration in expectation of Institutional Vaults Working with CES for new RWA contracts & tests, including their jar contract, and RWA repo alignment wrt how we manage ongoing drawdowns. Sync with Oracles for osmMom reviews Review of recorded ChaosLabs presentation and proposal   Infrastructure  Erigon maintenance to keep up with the latest version Testing new Forge multi-fork features for L2 development New deployer Key following team changes as per standard security practices   Team Developments Our amazing Kris (Krzkaczor) has decided to depart in order to lead the L2Beat initiative and will continue to be active in the ecosystem as a major Optimism Delegate. We look forward to working with Kris where opportunities arise to further develop the L2 ecosystem!  Upcoming August Priorities At A Glance  L2 development as referenced above D3M deployment as referenced above DssKiln implementation as per recent Governance steer Emergency Shutdown Simulations and test suite coverage Various smart contract developments including; rETH ClipperCallee support for handover to SAS, enhanced DssProxyActions, LP Oracle updates etc.  If there are any questions or input that PECU can provide to enlighten delegate prioritization initiatives, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to us, thanks!

Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  Collateral Onboarding  [GNO] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation (Nov 16, 2022) Add GNO (GnosisDAO) as a new Vault Type - November 21, 2022  The Risk Core Unit posted the [GNO] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation on November 16 2022. According to the agreement between Maker Growth and GnosisDAO, it is anticipated that the GNO-A vault will only be utilised by the GnosisDAO treasury management team, fully utilizing the available debt ceiling. At the same time, the GNO-A risk parameters need to accommodate the lower liquidity of the GNO token. To reflect these conditions, the recommended risk parameters for GNO-A differ from other Maker collateral. For example, the Dust parameter is set to 100k and the liquidation ratio to 350%. To learn more about the reasoning behind the recommended parameters, refer to the [GNO] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation. The winning poll outcome for onboarding GNO-A was \u201cYES\u201d, on November 24. According to the CSI spreadsheet and PECU, the target executive spell for the GNO Vault Type is December 9, 2022.  Pending Collateral Work  Collateral Status Index  There are currently two collateral types in the implementation phase in the CSI CMON Prefiltered View: (i) Compound D3M, and (ii) GNO. rETH was enabled following the executive vote on November 21. The executive for Compound D3M is currently live. It will be available for execution on December 6, 2022. The target executive spell for the GNO Vault Type is December 9, 2022. The CSI spreadsheet provides further insight into the assets that are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders.  Vault User Research  Vault User Research: Survival Analysis (Nov 8, 2022)  As part of the @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s ongoing vault research initiative, a report was published with the aim of better understanding the inflows of new vaults and the retention of existing ones. The report covers Maker\u2019s churn dynamics, looking at how well Maker vault users are retained over time. To learn more about the analysis, conclusion, and possible future research directions, refer to Vault User Research: Survival Analysis.  Monitoring and Mitigation of Economic Risk  Monitoring and Mitigation of Economic Risk - From DeFi tools and processes to on-chain proposals (Nov 24, 2022)  Following @josolnik\u2019s presentation at the ETH Gathering conference in Barcelona (more information below), an in-depth article covering the same topic was posted to the Block Analitica Medium Page. Topics in the article include (i) DeFi Economic Risk Domain, (ii) Risk Monitoring and Mitigation in Practice, (iii) Capital at Risk, (iv) Debt at Risk, (v) Collateral Auction Parameters, (vi) Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M), (vii) Ecosystem monitoring, and (viii) System Goal Research.  Adjustming the Dust Parameter  Discussion: Adjusting Dust Parameter (November 2022) (Nov 11, 2022)  Since the collapse of Terra, Celsius, and 3AC in May and June of this year, Ethereum gas prices have compressed significantly. Activity has increased over the past few weeks due to market crashes and significant repositioning as some crypto platforms slid into insolvency. However, gas prices remain far below sustained highs seen in 2021 and early 2022. As a result, a discussion post examining the possibilities of adjusting the dust parameter was published to the forum on November 11, 2022. Read more here.  Proposals & Urgent Signal Requests  MANA  MANA-A intermediate parameter change proposal (Nov 9, 2022) MANA-A intermediate parameter change proposal - reply from Primoz (Nov 9, 2022) Urgent Collateral Parameter Changes - November 12, 2022  Earlier in November, it came to the attention of the @Risk-Core-Unit that the MANA-A vault type risk severely increased. This was due to a decreasing trend in collateralization levels, mainly caused by the price decrease of the MANA token. As a response, the @Risk-Core-Unit proposed three parameter changes to MANA-A:  Reduce the MANA-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 7 million DAI from 10 million DAI to 3 million DAI. Increase the MANA-A Stability Fee by 42.5% from 7.5% to 50%. Increase the MANA-A Liquidation Penalty (chop) by 17% from 13% to 30%.   MATIC, LINK, YFI, renBTC  [Urgent Signal Request] Urgent Recommended Collateral Parameter Changes (Nov 11, 2022) [Urgent Signal Request] Urgent Recommended Collateral Parameter Changes - reply from Primoz (Nov 11, 2022) [Urgent Signal Request] Urgent Recommended Collateral Parameter Changes - reply from rema (Nov 11, 2022) [Urgent Signal Request] Urgent Recommended Collateral Parameter Changes - reply from rema (Nov 16, 2022)  Two days after proposing the urgent collateral parameter changes of MANA-A, another tangential proposal was made by the @Risk-Core-Unit. In light of the recent events in the crypto ecosystem and surrounding uncertainty regarding financial stability and asset liquidity of various entities and their possible relations with token governed protocols, the following parameter changes were proposed.  Reduce the MATIC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 10 million DAI from 20 million DAI to 10 million DAI. Reduce the LINK-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 20 million DAI from 25 million DAI to 5 million DAI. Reduce the YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 7 million DAI from 10 million DAI to 3 million DAI. Reduce the renBTC-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) by 10 million DAI from 10 million DAI to 0.  The proposed changes of MATIC-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, and renBTC-A, as well as the parameter changes of MANA-A, were all included in an Urgent Collateral Parameter Changes vote, which executed on November 15, 2022.  Liquidation Parameters & Auctions Activation  [USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A] Liquidation parameters & Auctions activation (Nov, 10, 2022) [USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A] Liquidation parameters & Auctions activation - reply from Primoz (Nov, 10, 2022)  Following the successful outcome of the Activate Liquidations for Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt poll, Maker governance voted for the activation of liquidations on stablecoin vaults USDC-A, USDP-A, and GUSD-A. As a result, the @Risk-Core-Unit proposed liquidation parameters for these vaults.  Enable liquidations Use Linear Decrease for Auction Price Function (calc). Set Liquidation Penalty (chop) to 0. Set Proportional Kick Incentive (chip) to 0. Set Flat Kick Incentive (tip) to 0. Set Auction Price Multiplier (buf) to 1. Set tau to 4,320,000 seconds (72,000 minutes, or 1,200 hours). This results in an estimated 10bps drop in price every 72 minutes, or 50 days until the price reaches 0. Set Max Auction Duration (tail) to 43,200 secpnds (720 minutes, or 12 hours). This implies a minimum price of 0.99. Set Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) to 0.99. Individually set the Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) for the vault types as follows:  USDC-A - 20 million DAI USDP-A - 3 million DAI GUSD-A - 300,000 DAI    The changes were successfully voted through in a poll on November 17, 2022.  renBTC  [renBTC-A] Proposed Offboarding Parameters & Context (Nov 21, 2022)  On November 21, the @Risk-Core-Unit proposed the offboarding on renBTC-A. Given the recent bankruptcy of Alameda Research, the uncertainty significantly increased for the Ren project, mainly due to funding concerns. Ren recently announced that Ren 1.0 (current network and service) will be shutdown and Ren 2.0 will be deployed in parallel. The Ren 1.0 network mints were already disabled, and burns would remain enabled for 30 days. The disabling of mints means that renBTC could potentially depeg upwards, while disabling burns means that MakerDAO has a limited time frame to offboard the collateral in order to minimize potential future complications. The proposed offboarding parameters were voted through in a poll on November 24, 2022.  Maker Risk Dashboard Key updates to the Maker Risk Dashboard include:  Data pipeline improvments Small improvements and bug fixes   Makerburn Updates and improvements to the Makerburn website are set out below:  On the \u201cEstimate of Annual Profits\u201d page, PSM swap fees have been reintroduced since the Maker Protocol is now receiving swap fees from the GUSD PSM. PSM swap fee income is now also configurable in the same way as \u201cExpenses\u201d and \u201cLiquidations\u201d. 1214\u00d7939 57.8 KB   For the GUSD PSM page, a rate calculator has been implemented. The amount shown on the dashboard is based on Gemini\u2019s commitments to MakerDAO.  1141\u00d7906 78.1 KB   Collateral descriptions from LFWs metadata initiative have also been incorporated 1196\u00d7801 60.8 KB     MakerDAO Open Market Committee  Member Changes  Parameter Proposal Group - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - reply from ultraschuppi (Nov 23, 2022)  On November 23, during the MOMC meeting, following a unanimous decision, @rema was officially onboarded as a member of the MOMC. @rema is part of the Risk Core Unit and has covered for @Primoz on several occasions. Hence, it was decided that he should be permanently onboarded. As a result, there are now three Risk Core Unit members part of the MOMC: @Primoz, @monet-supply, and @rema.

This seems to be driven primarily through removal of supplied liquidity, rather than increase in borrowing demand.

Eth Gathering Barcelona The @Risk-Core-Unit attended the ETH Gathering Week and conference in Barcelona between November 14 - November 20. Activities included: (i) attending the ETH Gathering conference, (ii) meeting with MakerDAO community members, and other teams, in person, and (iii) attending the Unfuzz MakerDAO EndGame workshop. In addition, two team members, @monet-supply and @josolnik, participated in the conference as speakers. @monet-supply participated in a panel talk on \u201cOptimising Liquidity\u201d together with Lukasz (Request Finance), Squirrel (Arrakis Finance), Paul Frambot (Morpho), and Carvas (Lido Finance).  1122\u00d7546 861 KB  @josolnik presented \u201cMonitoring and Mitigation of Economic Risk\u201d where he explored the topic of monitoring and mitigating economic risk in DeFi, including its processes, tooling and examples of actionable insights that are mapped to on-chain proposals. A more in-depth article on the topic was later posted to the Block Analitica Medium page, titled \u201cMonitoring and Mitigation of Economic Risk - From DeFi tools and processes to on-chain proposals\u201d.  1122\u00d7590 901 KB   Community Engagements on the Maker Forum Relevant discussions and replies from the Risk Core Unit for the month of November are available in the dropdown list below.

Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  Collateral Onboarding  [rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation Update (Sep 23, 2022)  The original rETH Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation was published on May 20, 2022. Since then, a number of things have changed in MakerDAO and in the broader cryptoasset ecosystem. Hence, on September 23, 2022, an updated risk assessment was posted to the Maker forum. A vote for the proposed adjustments passed on on September 29, 2022. After mainnet implementation, the MOMC will continue to assess rETH activity to see if any additional parameter changes need to be made.  Pending Collateral Work  Collateral Status Index  There are currently two collateral types in the implementation phase in the CSI CMON Prefiltered View: rETH and Compound D3M. There is one collateral type in the assessment phase: GNO. There is one collateral type with greenlit status: Backed Finance [bIBTA]. Finally, there is one new collateral type in the application phase: Goldfinch [FIDU]. The CSI spreadsheet and the latest CSI Update (September 29, 2022) provides further insight into the assets that are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders.  Merge Risks and Market Impacts  Merge Risks and Market Impacts (Sep 1, 2022) Merge Risks and Market Impacts (Sep 10, 2022)  The Merge, referring to the original Ethereum Mainnet (execution layer) merging with the Beacon Chain (consensus layer), was executed on September 15, 2022. The @Risk-Core-Unit posted a number of analyses on the potential impact of the merge in August, 2022. These included: (i) MakerDAO - Merge Risks and Market Impacts, (ii) Compound - Proposal: Adjust ETH Interest Rate Model, and (iii) Aave - [ARC] Aave ETHPoW Fork Risk Mitigation Plan. In September, leading up to the merge, two additional updates relevant to MakerDAO were provided. One update on September 1, 2022, and a final update on September 10, 2022. Subsequent impacts on lending markets, caused by the merge event, have been covered in the September parameter changes proposal from the MOMC.  Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates  Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates - September 2022  There are now on average 15 unique taker addresses settling auctions. In addition, the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit has improved the accessibility of auction participation. In response to these changes and opportunities, the @Risk-Core-Unit recently proposed adjusting Maker\u2019s auction parameters for 14 different collateral types, with the objective of increasing auction throughput and in turn decreasing the market risk of liquidatable collateral. To learn more, refer to Collateral Auctions: Analysis & Parameter Updates - September 2022. A vote for the proposed parameter adjustments passed on September 29, 2022. The changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit\u2019s schedule allows.  Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%  Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0% (Sep 28, 2022) MakerDAO Twitter Thread (Sep 29, 2022)  Since the stETH-B vault type was launched (May 2022), stETH-A\u2019s exposure decreased significantly while the exposure of stETH-B continues to grow. An analysis on the topic, as part of ongoing research from the @Risk-Core-Unit, was posted to the forum on September 28, 2022. Questions considered in the analysis include:  How has the stETH total debt per vault type changed since the launch of stETH-B? What about the number of vaults? How did debt collateralized by stETH grow compared to overall market trends? How much vault exposure migrated from stETH-A to stETH-B since stETH-B\u2019s stability fee was dropped to 0%? How much stETH-B exposure has been minted by new users since the drop in its stability fee?  To learn more, refer to Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%.  Maker Risk Dashboard Key updates to the Maker Risk Dashboard include:  Improving the data pipeline Preparing code to be open sourced  FAQ page: 1600\u00d7904 324 KB    Dust Simulation Page:  1600\u00d7729 98.1 KB    New graph illustrating individual vault changes over time.

A new signal request has been instigated, polling the Maker community on two questions: (i) whether to adjust the collateral yield weighting within competitive rate calculations for the D3M, and (ii) adjustment of the allowed spread between the bar and the ETH-A stability fee. The signal request will end on 6 October 2022. An on chain poll will be submitted in the week that follows provided that changes receive approval from forum voters. More information available here.  Parameter Changes Proposal  Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 29 September 2022 (Sep 29, 2022)  Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply are part of the MOMC. Proposed changes this month include:  CRVV1ETHSTETH-A: Decrease stability fee to 1.5% YFI-A: Reduce debt ceiling to 10 million DAI 1248\u00d7378 107 KB    The proposed changes are currently available for on-chain voting. The governance poll will be active until Thursday, October 6, 2022.

The rest of December was less eventful due to the holidays and the downtime across both MakerDAO and Risk Core Unit. Our primary focus is outlined below. The community has signalled interest in a Compound D3M implementation. We are currently investigating the risks associated with such an implementation. A Compound D3M Risk Assessment will be published in January 2022. More attention and consideration has been given to other relevant topics, such as: (i) our new initiative on DAI supply growth and risk metrics and (ii) reviewing and discussing Curve Pool related collaterals. These discussions can be found below, under \u201cAnalyses\u201d. One Signal Request focusing on adjusting the dust parameter for LP token vaults was posted to the forum. The poll will run until January 6, 2022. If a majority of forum voters, excluding abstain votes, are in favor of changing the proposed dust parameters, the vote will move forward to an on-chain poll the following week. Two proposals have been posted this month: (i) a wstETH Parameter Adjustment Proposal and (ii) a MATIC Debt Increase Proposal. Both proposals were part of the Executive that passed on December 11, 2021. Several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken, such as: (i) Risk Model improvements, (ii) implementing a Compound Monitor, and (iii) creating a Vault Details page. More information about these updates are set out below. This is the fifth monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here.

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of June. This month\u2019s primary focus is outlined below.  Collateral Onboarding & Other Analyses  Vault Protection Score - Model Validation (June 6, 2022) [Signal Request] Update dust limit analysis - reply from monet-supply (June 7, 2022) Thoughts on Multichain DAI Liquidity Strategy (June 27, 2022)  Collateral Onboard and Pending Collateral Work As can be seen in the CMON Prefiltered View of the Collateral Status Index (CSI), there are currently two on-chain collateral types in the implementation phase: rETH and Compound D3M. The rETH risk assessment was published on May 20, 2022. The Risk Core Unit is planning to provide updated risk parameter recommendations for the Compound D3M in mid-July. The exact date will depend on the finalized mainnet implementation date. The CSI spreadsheet and the latest CSI Update (June 30, 2022) provides further insight into what assets are being prioritized and worked on by CMON stakeholders. Analysis of the Vault Protection Score Metric The Vault Protection Score is a metric created by the Risk Core Unit which aims to estimate the probability of vault liquidation in times of major market drawdowns. The initial methodology can be found in this post. In June 2022, a new analysis was posted with the objective of evaluating how well the assigned vault protection scores have estimated the probability of vaults being liquidated. The analysis was based on available data from the last 6 months. Based on the result of the analysis, a decision was made to halve the percentages of expected debt exposure that we expect to be liquidated per risk score. The risk scores will now be categorised as follows: (i) 5% for low risk, (ii) 25% for medium risk, and (iii) 50% for high risk. More information available here. Dust Limit Analysis Following a request for an update on Maker protocol dust parameters, @monet-supply provided an new dust limit analysis. A recommendation to not reduce dust limits was the outcome of the analysis. Key reasons include:   Gas cost variability: Network utilization rates can bottom out and rebound quickly. Hence it is not prudent for Maker to rely on current USD denominated gas prices remaining constant.  User experience: Enabling small vaults and then being forced to rapidly reinstate higher dust limits is likely to have a worse impact on user experience than keeping dust levels unchanged. There is also a broad consensus that the costs of transactions on Ethereum L1 is likely to increase over time. Maker\u2019s plans for MCD and D3Ms on Ethereum L2 should provide a more compelling option for small users, once live.  A similar viewpoint by @rema suggests that the critical point is that gas prices can unexpectedly spike in a very short time period ~1h. This is a more relevant metric than historical average gas prices when setting dust limits. In addition, if dust limits were lowered, retail users would likely produce an insignificant amount of DAI debt. Hence, there would be very little advantage for MakerDAO. Whilst at the same time, the protocol and vault users would be exposed to the risk where closing/liquidating certain positions would be unprofitable. Multichain DAI Liquidity Strategy DAI currently has high liquidity on Ethereum L1, with broad integrations to centralized exchanges as well as significant on-chain liquidity sources. Liquidity on external domains, including Ethereum L2s, alternative EVM chains, and non EVM chains, is significantly less deep. On June 27, 2022, a post was published by @monet-supply discussing strategic considerations and ideas for near term actions to address liquidity deficiencies of DAI. Ideas for action include:   Liquidity Incentives: a limited scope of incentives to bootstrap DAI liquidity on external domains to the point where DAI markets become self-sustainable.  Partnerships: Hand in hand with self-funded incentives, Maker can partner with external protocols to support DAI liquidity and integration within their app.  Community Visibility: Independent community members and/or MKR whales don\u2019t face the same governance and custody risks that MakerDAO itself would when deploying assets cross chain. Hence, they could play an important part in improving DAI liquidity across external domains.  Further information available here.  Proposals  [Signal Request] Set the AAVE D3M DC to 0 (Zero) - reply from Primoz (June 14, 2022) URGENT: Signal Request Set Aave D3M bar to 0% - reply from Primoz (June 15, 2022) Governance and Risk | Ep. 195 (35:16) - Discussion: AAVE D3M Response (June 16, 2022)  Aave D3M A proposed threefold plan for the Aave community was posted by Gauntlet on June 11, 2022. The steps were (i) freeze the stETH market, (ii) increase the LT for stETH to 90%, and (iii) pause ETH borrowing. The Risk Core Unit believed that the proposed 90% LT increase for stETH was a particularly risky move. At the time, out of the 200m DAI borrowed on Aave Ethereum v2, 100m DAI was being borrowed by Celsius and collateralized mostly by stETH. This presented a high risk for users borrowing stablecoins collateralized by stETH, especially in light of the fact that Celsius was under stress at the time of the proposal. As a response, to mitigate Aave dependency, the Risk Core Unit suggested that the Aave D3M should be disabled until such time that the Maker community considers it safe to enable it again. An out-of-schedule executive vote to set Target Borrow Rate (bar) of the Aave D3M to 0, effectively disabling the module, passed on June 15 and was executed on June 17. The event was discussed and presented by @Primoz on the 195th MakerDAO Governance and Risk meeting. The presentation starts at 35:16. Further discussion and reasoning is available in the posts (i) [Signal Request] Set the AAVE D3M DC to 0 (Zero) and (ii) URGENT: Signal Request Set Aave D3M bar to 0%. The most recent June edition of the MOMC Parameter Changes Proposal suggests that the exposure should remain at 0 (zero) for the time being.  Maker Risk Dashboard External Work  Discussion: External Work (June 10, 2022)  Block Analitica recently prepared dashboard mockups for Aave. Positive feedback was received along with an approval for an Aave grant. On June 10, in a forum post, we requested feedback from the Maker community on scaling and engaging in activities outside of MakerDAO. We believe that any activity Block Analitica engages in outside of the Maker ecosystem should also ideally have tangible benefits for MakerDAO. For example, the development of the Aave analytics tool will be of direct benefit for D3M risk monitoring. The forum post also discusses how the scaling of Block Analitica\u2019s business development fits into Rune\u2019s concept of MetaDAOs and the Endgame Plan. The Maker Risk Dashboard v3 The developer team in the Risk Core Unit is continuing to build out the \u201cMaker Risk Dashboard v3\u201d, a new version of the Maker Risk Dashboard. This third iteration of the dashboard will include new capabilities, more data, and a new front-end design. A blog post and a public link will be posted when the new dashboard is launched.

The Nexo Institutional Vault Risk Evaluation has now been published to the forum. The next steps are to await PE to set up the required infrastructure and to confirm the risk parameters after migration. The governance process for offboarding certain collateral from Maker is continuing. Two signal requests were posted on the forum regarding this matter.   Offboarding process for USDT Collateral types (USDT-A, UNI-V2-ETHUSDT-A, and UNI-V2-DAIUSDT-A). The on-chain polling passed on September 30.  Offboarding MANA-A, BAT-A, ZRX-A, LRC-A, UNIV2-LINKETH-A and UNIV2-AAVEETH-A. The offboarding process will continue to on-chain poll on October 4 for the following collateral: BAT-A, ZRX-A, LRC-A, UNIV2-LINKETH-A and UNIV2-AAVEETH-A. For MANA-A there will be no further action at the current time.  A signal request which proposes the activation of DC-IAM for PSM-PAX-A was posted on the forum. The executive containing this proposal passed and was executed on September 21. A report on the newly formed concept of Maker Vault Protection Scores was published this month. The report attempts to create a methodology for assessing vault level risk. Read more here. This continues the research initiative on different aspects of Maker Vaults (1, 2, 3). Several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken. These include (i) historical vault stats graph, (ii) liquidation score integration, (iii) moving the risk model simulation natively to the dashboard, and (iv) adding DAI trades (DAI peg) statistics. Learn more about the updates here and here. This is the second monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here. We will continue to update the community on a monthly basis going forward. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates.

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of February. This month\u2019s primary focus is outlined below.  Administrative  RISK-001 Budget Renewal Proposal  MIP40c3-SP92: Modify Risk Core Unit Budget (RISK-001)  MIP40c3-SP92 renews the Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) budget from March 1, 2023, through February 29, 2024. The @Risk-Core-Unit recognizes the current discussions regarding cutting costs. Hence, two voting options have been included: (i) approve existing budget (business as usual) or (ii) approve reduced budget (-10%). It should be noted that the @Risk-Core-Unit believes that the existing budget (business as usual) is still appropriate for two key reasons.  With the current Dai budget, the Risk Core Unit performs one of the most important protocol functions in MakerDAO while being only the 6th largest Core Unit by budget size. The @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s MKR vesting schedule is relatively low compared to other participants in the DAO. The @Risk-Core-Unit has considered increasing this amount to be more aligned with other Core Units\u2019 MKR per FTE allocations. However, we decided to keep it as it is to be more aligned with the cost-cutting environment at Maker.   Onboarding and Offboarding Risk Facilitator Proposals  MIP41c5-SP14: Facilitator Offboarding - Primoz (RISK-001) MIP41c4-SP41: Risk Facilitator Onboarding (RISK-001)  MIP41c5-SP14 offboards @Primoz as Facilitator of the Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) and MIP41c4-SP41 onboards BA Labs, LLC as a Facilitator, represented by @rema and @monet-supply. If the MIPs pass, @Primoz will remain in Block Analitica and MakerDAO, but will give @rema and @monet-supply the opportunity to take the lead as representatives of the @Risk-Core-Unit. The members of the @Risk-Core-Unit thank @Primoz for his leadership, hard work, and dedication to MakerDAO over the last 3+ years.  Collateral Management  Stakeholder Alignment Following the CES reorganisation, certain collateral management responsibilities have been transferred from the @collateral-core-unit to the @Risk-Core-Unit. The @Risk-Core-Unit is now leading monthly on-chain collateral strategy calls with relevant stakeholders. The first On-Chain Collateral Stakeholder Alignment Meeting was held on February 6, 2023. Meeting points are summarised below.   LSD overview and relation to Endgame: The @Risk-Core-Unit has performed market research into Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) during January and February to better understand the current landscape as it relates to LSDs as Maker collateral and EtherDai (ETHD). @rema gave a high-level overview of the results. In summary, no additional staking derivative is currently suitable as Maker collateral. However, it is worth following the developments of LSDs as the industry is still in its infancy. In addition, more work needs to be done to understand the most optimal design and strategy for MakerDAO\u2019s own staking product \u2013 EtherDai (ETHD).  Existing low liquidity collateral assets and their potential for SubDAOs: During the meeting, GNO, LINK, MATIC, and YFI were identified as collateral types that will likely fall under the \u201cStrategic Collateral Asset Type\u201d or the \u201cTransitory Collateral Asset Type\u201d categorisation in the Decentralized Scope Framework. Based on the latest Decentralized Scope Framework language, these assets will not be considered strategic, and will therefore likely fall under the \u201cTransitory Collateral Asset Type\u201d category. Hence, a potential migration plan to designated SubDAOs will be needed for these assets in the future.  rETH Maker campaign to stimulate usage and increase demand: The MOMC proposed a reduction of the RETH-A stability fee to 0.5% for at least 3 months to boost demand and usage. It was suggested that a potential marketing campaign may be appropriate to inform users of this initiative.  Initial Margin Requirements: @monet-supply initiated a discussion regarding the potential benefits of implementing initial margin requirements to Maker vaults (i.e. requirements for opening a vault, minting DAI, or removing collateral). Adding separate initial margin requirements to Maker vaults may improve protocol safety and competitiveness while having a negligible impact on vault user experience. More discussion is needed from relevant stakeholders. A more in-depth explanation of the idea may be posted to the forum to invite further discussion.  MIP92: Yearn Maker Vault: The ratification poll for MIP92 (Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield) passed in January 2023. The topic was therefore brought up for discussion to identify possible opportunities at Yearn. It is believed that the largest requirement is technical and development work. From the @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s perspective, an analysis can be made on existing Yearn strategies, examining financial risk profiles and external DeFi exposures.   Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework During the Pregame phase of the ongoing MakerDAO Endgame plan, the @Risk-Core-Unit will help bootstrap the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework by providing relevant feedback on its contents, language, and structure. To increase operational transparency, the @Risk-Core-Unit will from now on report this work on a monthly basis through the Risk Core Unit Month in Review series. Relevant work for the month of February is explained below.  MIP104: The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework - reply from rema (Feb 24, 2023) Diffchecker: @Risk-Core-Unit suggestions vs. Original  The first version of MIP104: The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework was posted to the Maker forum on February 6, 2023. The @Risk-Core-Unit, as the proposed \u201cResponsible Facilitator\u201d of the Decentralized Scope, examined the contents and gave appropriate feedback for the first iteration in April, 2023. Further improvements and iterations will be made in the future. However, the main goal of the initial suggestions is to ensure that no drastic changes are made that could potentially result in an unnecessary reduction in surplus generation from Decentralized Maker Collateral.  Endgame During Pregame, the @Risk-Core-Unit will have other responsibilities and priorities in addition to the work on the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework. Therefore, to increase operational transparency, other Endgame related work initiatives will also be reported through the Risk Core Unit Month in Review series on a monthly basis. Relevant work for the month of February is listed below.  The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework The first version of the Stability and Liquidity (S&L) Scope Framework was posted to the Maker forum on February 6, 2023. The Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework will be affected and constrained by the S&L Scope Framework through, for example, the \u201cBenchmark Yield\u201d. In addition, the contents in the S&L Scope Framework are tangential to the mandate of the @Risk-Core-Unit and the expertise of the MOMC. Hence, RISK has read through the S&L Scope Framework in detail and engaged with the community where it was considered necessary. The list below refers to all community engagement activities regarding the S&L Scope Framework for the month of February.  MIP103: The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework - reply from rema (Feb 15, 2023) MIP103: The Stability and Liquidity Scope Framework - reply from rema (Feb 16, 2023) Proposal to include deliberate stability fee experiments in the S&L scope (MIP103) - reply from rema (Feb 21, 2023) Proposal to include deliberate stability fee experiments in the S&L scope (MIP103) - reply from rema (Feb 21, 2023) Proposal to include deliberate stability fee experiments in the S&L scope (MIP103) - reply from rema (Feb 27, 2023)   Spark Lend  MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend \u2013 Spark Feedback (Feb 27, 2023) Announcing Phoenix Labs and Spark Protocol - reply from monet-supply (Feb 27, 2023)  MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend, submitted by PhoenixLabs, proposes a D3M to provide Dai liquidity to the Spark Lend protocol. The @Risk-Core-Unit provided initial feedback to MIP116: D3M to Spark Lend on February 27, 2023. The feedback post discusses (i) Spark risk parameters, (ii) Maker D3M parameters and rate model, and (iii) general comments regarding Spark. Depending on the results of the governance process, a more in-depth assessment will likely be required.  Maker Risk Dashboard Key updates to the Maker Risk Dashboard are listed below. Added   Improvements to the Total Value Locked (TVL) section on the DeFi page  The TVL chart now includes assets: ETH, WBTC, stETH, rETH, and DAI The TVL chart now includes markets from: Maker, Compound v2, Euler, Compound v3, Aave v2, and Aave v3 1600\u00d7789 105 KB      Improvements to the Vaults at Risk Simulator on the Vaults at Risk page  Added a \u201cVaults at Risk\u201d chart to help visualise current ILK debt risks, with debt amount on the y-axis and ILKs on the x-axis The chart categorises ILK debt into (i) no risk score, (ii) low risk, (iii) medium risk, and (iv) high risk Hovering over a particular ILK will provide more detailed information of total debt and debt amount at the respective risk levels 1600\u00d7971 94.2 KB      Added Antalpha under Whales tab   Added tx hash for each event under specific vault (e.g. #29721)   Changed  Compound D3M Revenue Calculator Adjustments to include COMP rewards Data pipeline improvements   Makerburn Updates to the Makerburn website are set out below.

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of January. Our primary focus this month is outlined below. On January 13, an on-chain poll for prioritising the onboarding of a Compound D3M received unanimous support with 85,229.39 MKR voting \u201cyes\u201d. A Compound D3M Risk Assessment has been published to the forum. It is worth noting that the market dynamics may change before the Compound D3M is implemented. Therefore, we may need to change the proposed parameters to reflect the market conditions at that point in time. A product discussion regarding NFTs as Maker collateral was initiated by @monet-supply. This post gives an overview of opportunities for MakerDAO to begin serving the NFT lending market. Block Analitica now has a Medium page. The first post, written by @josolnik, discusses the concept of Computer-Aided Governance and how the @Risk-Core-Unit aims to support better-informed decisions by using the Maker Risk Dashboard as guidance. The article is available here. During the weekend of January 21 to January 23, the cryptoasset ecosystem experienced a significant, sudden market downtrend. The surplus auction (FLAP) inefficiency led to the event being termed \u201cFlappy Friday\u201d. The incident was explained in detail by @Primoz on January 23. The analysis is available here. The analysis was used to help form an urgent signal request to stop MKR burning. The changes were proposed to temporarily prevent surplus auctions until the auction mechanisms can be improved. An out-of-schedule executive proposal was passed on January 24 and subsequently executed on January 26. The changes were: (i) disable the existing System Surplus Buffer lerp function, and (ii) set the System Surplus Buffer parameter to 250 million DAI. Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply, are part of the MakerDAO Open Market Committee. Several factors changed following the market crash in January. (i) DeFi lending rates dropped off considerably, (ii) funding rates on centralised exchanges are holding close to 2-year lows, and (iii) the DAI supply through the USDC-PSM has increased significantly, reaching a stablecoin backing ratio of 62%. The Open Market Committee reacted by proposing several changes, including (i) decreasing the stability fee for multiple vault types, (ii) decreasing the AAVE-D3M target borrow rate, and (iii) decreasing the maximum debt ceiling of GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A while increasing the debt ceiling, target available debt and decreasing the stability fee for GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A. The changes may help stimulate more DAI minting with other collateral types besides stablecoins. However, the anticipated effect on annualized revenue is negative 6.7 million DAI. The proposed changes are currently included in an on-chain poll, and if passed, will be included in an executive vote on February 4, 2022. Several updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard were undertaken, such as (i) implementing a Compound D3M Model, (ii) site reliability improvements, and (iii) moving to a new data API from the Data Insights Core Unit (DICU). More information about these updates is set out below. A new budget modification proposal, MIP40c3-SP56, was posted to the forum on January 12. In the short to medium term, the @Risk-Core-Unit plans to increase the headcount from 8 to 11 full-time equivalent (FTE) contributors. Makerburn has been financed by a grant program led by the Risk Core Unit since June 2021. We are now joining forces with Makerburn on a team level. We are also looking to onboard one Quantitative Analyst and one more Risk Analyst. This is the sixth monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here. We will continue to update the community on a monthly basis going forward. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates.

                    "content": "This post summarises the tasks, work, and activities of the @Risk-Core-Unit for the month of March. This month\u2019s primary focus is outlined below. A Maker staking and tokenomics revision proposal (stkMKR), by @monet-supply, was posted to the forum. This post attracted significant interest and debate. Further discussion was included in the 8th episode of the Youtube series \u201cFocus On\u201d. Subsequent to the stkMKR proposal, A16z published an additional MKR tokenomics upgrade proposal. In the past, the Risk Core Unit has posted two Product Discussions (i) Curve Pool Collaterals, and (ii) NFTs as MakerDAO Collateral. These are designed to steer attention towards, and encourage feedback on, newly identified product ideas that may be of benefit to MakerDAO. In March, we posted a product discussion on a Maker owned Fuse Pool and a Maker Fuse D3M. We are currently gathering feedback from the community. A Signal Request on this topic will soon be posted. Recently in an on-chain vote, the community decided to finalize the offboarding of TUSD via liquidations. As a follow-up, the Risk Core Unit posted recommended offboarding parameters for TUSD-A. The Executive Vote planned for Friday, April 15th, 2022 will enact these changes and enable liquidations for TUSD-A. In March, MakerDAO\u2019s first Curve LP token collateral, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, was onboarded. The Risk Core Unit proposed some updated parameter recommendations before its release to mainnet. Changes included:  decreasing the debt ceiling by 2 million from 5 million to 3 million; decreasing the stability fee by 1% from 4.5% to 3.5%; increasing the dust by 15,000 from 10,000 to 25,000.  Note that the MakerDAO Open Market Committee (MOMC) has since then assessed the performance of CRVV1ETHSTETH-A and has recommended decreasing the stability fee by 1.25% from 3.5% to 2.25%. More information on this below. @Primoz and @rema posted their feedback on an informal poll focusing on ways to increase the competitiveness of ETH & stETH collateral. Primoz highlighted the risk factors of using aETH as collateral. He also raised several key points to consider if Maker decides to add other wstETH collateral types. Rema analysed the risks, and assessed the potential demand, for additional wstETH and aETH vault types. In summary, it is believed that wstETH-B will generate relatively low demand, while wstETH-C has a higher potential to gain traction. The added risks of an aETH vault type are likely to outweigh the potential benefits to MakerDAO. In the Governance and Risk #184 meeting on March 31, 2022, the Risk Core Unit further discussed the topic of ETH staking derivatives. Questions included:  What are the current market trends for stETH usage in DeFi? What are actions that Maker should consider? What effect will rising ETH/stETH yields have on Stability Fees? How can Maker become a more attractive protocol for stETH owners?  Potential collateral alternatives were discussed. These included (i) wstETH-C, (ii) leveraged stETH as collateral, and (iii) support for other staking derivatives, such as rETH (Rocket Pool). Updates and improvements to the MakerDAO Risk Dashboard, including an Auction Kick Simulation and scaling out D3M monitoring tools, were undertaken. More details follow below. Updates and improvements to the Makerburn website are also set out below. Key topics for March include (i) adding support for MKR transfers on the expense page, (ii) Core Units Expense Overview, and (iii) focusing on internal maintenance/optimization. Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply are part of the MOMC. Proposed changes this month include:  decreasing the stability fee for WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WSTETH-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A; increasing the debt ceiling for GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A; increasing the bar for the Aave D3M.  More information about these changes is illustrated in the table screenshot below. The proposed changes will be submitted for an on-chain vote this week. This is the eighth monthly summary published by the Risk Core Unit. To read last month\u2019s summary, click here. We will continue to update the community on a monthly basis going forward. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding these updates. Please add any comments below or get in touch directly with members of the @Risk-Core-Unit.

                    "content": " PECU Month in Review: May 2022 May was a very packed month - from panel discussions at Permissionless Miami (shoutout Sam!), to full team code reviews, podcasts (shoutout Bartek!), audit sessions, smart contract development along with various architectural research endeavours, Protocol Engineering was kept pretty busy. Meanwhile various DeFi protocols also kept us on edge (keepers\u2026shoutout Mooney!) as UST failed to hold peg. The following is a summary of the month\u2019s work:  Executives During May we updated our internal spell writing processes and have since been deploying executives on Wednesday to allow for better cross-team coordination, fact checking and reviews. The following executives were released during May:   May 25 - Raise the ESM Minimum Threshold, MKR Vesting, Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate-limited Flapper  May 18 Foundational L2 Work, Authorize New Flash Mint Module, MKR Vesting  May 11 - Recognized Delegate Payments, Lowering WBTC Stability Fees, and Onboarding wstETH-B   Forum Posts  Ratified MIP69 L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals Proposed a PoC, DssKiln - a permissionless token purchasing tool Included DssCure Technical Enhancement in the 18th May Executive Included Flash Mint Module update in the 18th May Executive Implemented an improved Governance Cadence Improvement Process    Direct Deposit Module Work  PECU were involved in extensive line-by-line internal code reviews. Which involved pool, plan and hub contracts alongside numerous stateful and stateless fuzzing tests. Can not be understated how much diligence and team review effort went into this work. Reviews for both the underlying D3M infrastructure and the Compound contracts commenced in May and will be wrapping up in June for audit completion in mid-July.   Cross-team work We also saw increased cross-team participation this month, namely:  Working with the Deco team to help fuzz testing with Echidna. Next steps will be to review their formal proof documentation before deployment. Held a discussion with the StarkWare company and the StarkNet CU on the topic of gradual decentralization Provided CES interview support Provided support to Nexo for getting their infrastructure setup and ready in the event that they pursue Institutional Vaults. Met with the Paradigm research team to explore TWAMM solutions in light of recent DssKiln discussions. Integrated reccommendations from DAI Foundation to include Copyright guidance  Provided technical implementation support to the Makershire Hathaway initiative Participation in Community Decentralized Voter Committee discussions   Smart Contract work As usual, our weekly planning sessions saw a substantial push across a variety of value add feature functionality, including:  Enhancements to DssExecLib to improve our testfail coverage Improvement PRs to slither static analysis tooling for improved test functionality Improved timestamp creation and validation via a time PR  Improved DssExecLib documentation for RWAs  Made final improvements to the chainlog  Documented integration tests as part of emergency shutdown scenarios. Planning completion in June leading to improvements in dss-simulation-scripts  Integration tests to optimize poking the medianizer Added DssFlash legacy contract into Dune Analytics for monitoring as we deployed a new Flash module Optimised GemJoin9 to take into consideration check-effect-interaction patterns for use in PAXG Partly completed reviews of dss-charter including; join, exit and move. Code and audits is complete, further team review will continue pending market appetite to adopt Completed Univ2-lp-oracle and Univ3-lp-oracle  Added WSTETH-B ilk to the megapoker  Updated WSTETH callee contract to support a complex univ3 path Added AuctionDemoKeeper to support complex univ3 paths for curve LP tokens Updated the OSM mom with a PR that sets the debt ceiling to 0 and removing the autoline DssProxyRegistry was deployed on several production networks Updated authorization checks in Goerli    L2 As per our Stakeholder Alignment Meetings, the bulk of the work to deploy L2 \u2192 L1 fast withdrawals is now complete and is only awaiting a final team review before being ready for deployment in early July. This month\u2019s L2 specific focus has included:  Codebase renaming of wormhole to teleport Wrote and deployed keepers and coordinated ownership with TechOps Created Forta test suite for L2 monitoring Worked with Gelato to integrate the trusted relay Provided SDK support for Socket and Li.Finance teams to integrate Fast Withdrawals into their frontends Helped StarkWare team to align DAI StarkGate bridge architecture to our other bridges Forward looking research of the End contract and its behaviour in the event of L2 emergency shutdown Review of Cure implementation and its interaction with the End Research into Vat optimization for L2 domains Development of DssBridge as means to scale L2 adoption Commenced research into LayerZero and Axelar cross-chain communication services   Infrastructure With OpenEthereum riding into the sunset, many of us have been upgrading our node testing infrastructure to Erigon nodes for Goerli and Mainnet, which has taken some time but is now complete.  Safety Subteam Work  Worked with Certora to provide proofs for Layer2 contracts Documented a Curve LP Oracle postmortem - awaiting confirmation that there are no other parties at risk before publishing Added mathematical & strong induction sections to FV course for release in June Created documentation explaining the relationship between sequences, and recurrence relations to state transition systems - which help us create tooling to ensure smart contracts do what we expect. Created syntax highlight support and ported mcd-spec to Athena allowing for proof tests Final stages of releasing the symbolic EVM with foundry integration   June Priorities Spotlight Aside from supporting a number of planned collateral on/off-boardings, minor technical upgrades (ClipperCallees, AuctionDemoKeepers, etc), and the usual executive spells, our primary focus is on:  D3M final reviews and providing audit support Teleport final reviews to deploy to mainnet DssCharter (previously deprioritised) so Institutions can adopt when ready  ",

Year in Review  The Risk Core Unit 2022 Year in Review  On January 10, 2023, The Risk Core Unit 2022 Year in Review was posted to the forum. The post summarises key activities that the @Risk-Core-Unit undertook in 2022. The post also highlights @Risk-Core-Unit\u2019s plans and priorities for 2023.  Collateral Onboarding  Stakeholder Alignment Following the CES reorganisation, certain collateral management responsibilities have been transferred from the @collateral-core-unit to the @Risk-Core-Unit. The @Risk-Core-Unit is now leading monthly on-chain collateral strategy calls with relevant stakeholders. The Collateral Status Index (CSI) spreadsheet will be updated asynchronously by stakeholders as required.  Proposals  Dust  Discussion: Adjusting Dust Parameter (November 2022) - reply from monet-supply (Jan 20, 2023)  On January 20, 2023, the Discussion: Adjusting Dust Parameter post from November last year was updated. Three options were proposed for a governance poll. The winning option in the subsequent on-chain poll, was \u201cOption 2 \u2013 Limited Reduction\u201d. The following changes were included in Option 2.  Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 7,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 3,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 25,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for GNO-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A (along with 0 DC vaults RENBTC-A and MANA-A)  The changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit\u2019s schedule allows.  USDC-A, USDP-A, and GUSD-A  [USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A] Proposed Offboarding Parameters  The activation of liquidations for stablecoin vaults USDC-A, USDP-A, and GUSD-A in November 2022, successfully cleared all positions below the liquidation ratio. However, there were still a few overcollateralized vault positions remaining, totalling 3.682 million Dai debt across all vault types. These vault types serve little purpose to the protocol since the PSM was established. As a result, the @Risk-Core-Unit proposed to offboard the respective vault types on January 20, 2023. The proposal was accepted by MKR holders following an on-chain poll on January 23, 2023. The offboarding items will be included in the soonest eligible executive vote, as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit\u2019s schedule allows. @MakerGrowth has posted offboarding notices for each respective vault type, available below.

Collateral Onboarding  [rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation (May 20, 2022) [sETH2] Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6) - reply from CMON stakeholders (May 24, 2022)  Two ETH staking derivatives have been discussed and assessed \u2013 rETH and sETH2. rETH A Rocket Pool rETH Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation was published to the forum on May 20, 2022. The assessment covers (i) an overview of the Rocket Pool Protocol, (ii) rETH token analysis, and (iii) proposed risk parameters for rETH if the Maker community decides to onboard the asset. sETH2 Domain Teams (CES, RISK and ORACLE), as part of the on-chain collateral management (CMON) initiative, have agreed to and recommend that certain risks need to be mitigated before the continuation of the remaining onboarding activities for sETH2. More information here. Pending Work Visit the CMON Prefiltered View of the Collateral Status Index (CSI) for further insight into which assets are being prioritized and worked on. Pending work for the Risk Core Unit includes (i) a GNO Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation and (ii) an Antalpha Institutional Vault Risk Assessment.  Proposals  MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations (May 11, 2022) [Informal Poll] Curve Basepool Composition (May 24, 2022)  MIP74 The DssKiln \u2013 a permissionless token purchasing tool \u2013 was introduced by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit on May 3, 2022. MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations was published by @rema from the @Risk-Core-Unit on May 11, 2022. MIP74 proposes the utilization of the DssKiln module. It defines the process that will be used to agree and take action on a number of permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. Basepool As part of the proposed integration and partnership between MakerDAO and Curve Finance \u2013 termed Maker Basepool \u2013 an informal poll was posted to the forum, asking the Maker community to vote on the most preferred Basepool composition. The final Basepool composition will incorporate feedback from the poll but may differ from the results depending on technical implementation concerns and comments from core units, delegates, or Curve community members.  Signal Requests  [Signal Request] Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn (May 26, 2022)  The Signal Request \u201cDeploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn\u201d was posted to the forum on May 26, 2022. If the Signal Request passes, it will serve as an initial trial of MIP74 and the DssKiln Module.  Maker Risk Dashboard Risk in DeFi Dashboard A significant increase in risk exposure from external DeFi protocols will result from an increasing number of D3M integrations and other protocol dependencies. For example, stETH leverage on Aave is now affecting stETH liquidity risks for Maker. The Risk Core Unit aims to actively monitor and follow specific risks associated with protocols that have already been integrated or will be integrated in the future. A new dashboard is being developed and will soon be completed. It will incorporate a range of unique data and metrics, the objective of which is to quantify and mitigate certain risks associated with external integrations. The dashboard will be more generalised than the existing Maker Risk Dashboard and will include data from several DeFi protocols and assets. A public link will be posted when the new dashboard is launched. The Maker Risk Dashboard Key updates to the Maker Risk Dashboard include:  Planning and working towards a new version of the dashboard \u2013 \u201cthe Maker Risk Dashboard v3\u201d \u2013 which will include new capabilities, more data, and a new front-end design.   MakerDAO Open Market Committee Two Risk Core Unit members, @Primoz and @monet-supply are part of the MOMC. Proposed changes this month include:  LINK-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 50 million DAI WSTETH-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 200 million DAI WSTETH-B: Increase gap to 30 million DAI MANA-A: Increase maximum debt ceiling to 15 million DAI DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Reduce bar to 2.75% and reduce debt ceiling to 100 million DAI  The proposed changes were part of a successful on-chain poll, available here.

We have sourced a number of graduates and are reviewing candidates.   The Month Ahead  Protocol Engineering is in the final stages of being ready to deploy Fast Withdrawals on Optimism and Arbitrum. Outstanding work is limited to receiving final audit responses on critical modules, finalising formal verification specs, and putting in place the required bridge monitoring and alerting. Similarly, we are approaching completion on the Compound D3M, which will put in place a modular architecture facilitating reuse and scalability. In the same spirit of scalability, DssGate will enable MakerDAO to support debt ceiling limited initiatives such as the Deco Protocol and other \u201csand-box-like\u201d initiatives. Protocol Engineering is also actively following current RWA discussions and is at the ready to help CES with any onboarding oversight required. We do not however expect that these discussions, if ratified, will impact or alter long-tail work such as Institutional Vaults, D3Ms or ongoing MCD on L2 development, as these initiatives entail different non-competing resources - I am happy to elaborate on this further if requested.
