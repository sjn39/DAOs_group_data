                    "content": " Clarification on PECU Initiatives & Priorities There were a number of what I deem to be incorrect statements in today\u2019s #Speculation channel that I would like to clarify with respect to the Protocol Engineering Team. My response here as the Facilitator for PECU is done in the spirit of transparency and as always I welcome questions from anyone seeking clarification on what we as a team are actually working on, if it isn\u2019t clear from our summaries. Specifically regarding the following statements: Everyone says there\u2019s some huge backlog but we have CUs pursuing their own favored horses without even informing MKR holders  ...PE working with TrueFi and Fuse D3M. RWF working with a financial institution. Anons who work for CUs claiming conflicts of interest without disclosing their own  \u2026I don\u2019t want to see PE or RWF working on unapproved ventures when what has been approved is not complete  With regards to active development work, these statements can be clarified by the following.  PECU Current Engineering Tasks The following engineering work summarises existing technical development. These items have come into existence through either extensive community discussion, communication and where necessary sign-off by governance, including:  Compound D3M DssGate PAXG TUSD Offboarding DssCure (for L2) DssProxy (for L2 and core protocol) Core protocol initiatives  DssDeployScripts maintenance & enhancements Keeper maintenance & enhancements Chainlog migration & enhancements Associated safety, review and internal audit work     PECU Pre-MIP Advisory Work  The team is advising Maple Finance in order to ensure that their future integration with Maker will be possible and safe. Similarly, we have met in person with TrueFi at EthDenver to ensure future alignment if/when Governance determines we proceed. Initial investigation has been done into Rari pools to ensure that the solution we build is scalable for such future implementations. Initial meeting with OasisProMarkets (re: India Power Green Bonds and others) to ensure future token integration will be possible (wrt how ES, liquidations and other components will function). Informational meetings with L2 ecosystems not yet in the formal roadmap to ensure canonical DAI will be possible to be implemented across domains.  In conclusion I want to reiterate that PECU is not developing code that has not been cleared by Governance or beyond our mandate. We do however maintain close contact and dialogue with other protocols that may at some point become formal MakerDAO counterparties. This is not only important for maintaining a technical development pipeline, but also for ensuring that the architectures and designs we are currently working on today will remain relevant and scalable into the future. I therefore fully support the work that my team is engaging in and do not consider any of this activity as drawing attention away from current governance initiatives. ",
