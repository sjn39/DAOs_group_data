Yeah it is entirely unclear whether I should try to speak with other delegates about this.  Time is running out.  @twblack88 @flipflopflapdelegate - you two alone are passing this.   Precisely why do you believe we need to kill the stablecoin-DAI spread?   Because if the poll is approved your basically telling all markets on L1 in particular in stablecoin-DAI to fold up shop.   Realize anyone wanting to go from one stable to another can do it with 0 fees (killing USDP, USDC markets as well).  Passing this will signal a death knell to the GUNIV3DAIUSDC vault. ",

As I stated on the Flip Flop Flap Delegate platform, this Vote is about DAI being accepted as   Perhaps?   My view is we want to actually support liquidity and reasonable fees to create a large and growing stablecoin/DAI trading market.   This move will actually crush trading in not just USDC-DAI, and USDP-DAI but also USDC-USDP by proxy and as Maker adds more of these PSMs with tin/tout at zero it is going to cross an even broader swath of these markets.     PaperImperium:  I think he\u2019s partly tip toeing around do we think Maker is more or less likely to be blacklisted than our (value weighted average) LP pool.   Has noting to do with being blacklisted but completely has to do with having robust markets and liquidity sources to trade.  This is about free markets and price discovery to support liquidity.   At some point if we do enough PSMs with 0 fees to DAI someone is going to look at Maker as having a monopoly on the stablecoin \u2018markets\u2019 and price fixing.  If this is in conjunction with a market loss event.   Well then likely game over for Maker. The numerous other hazards I have already commented on in many places. Fortunately with choices eventually come consequences.    Everything can look great until it doesn\u2019t and by them the window to act will likely have closed. ",
