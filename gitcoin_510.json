Meta-Governance    One year after the community rallied behind the grant to fund the research and implementation of EIP1559, Tim Beiko and the team have now sent back the extra funds to the matching pool! Due to the price increase of ETH and a generous donation by the EF the team is sending back more than double the amount they raised in USD terms; $200,000.   The proposal for CLR Fund to receive 40k GTC has passed, acting as the first major \u201cimpact\u201d (non-operational) funding decision in the DAO.

Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there\u2019s anything missing please reach out!    Meta-Governance    Anett and Yalor are continuing to help steward meta-governance in their thread aimed at increasing the transparency of Stewards Calls by posting details and notes. The post outlines the agenda for the #1 monthly Gitcoin DAO Steward Call that will take place on the 5th of July.   The formal proposal introducing Gitcoin Seasons by fireeyes, _\u200b:fire:, last week has sparked a more general conversation after a post by lefterisjp on how Stewards should be compensated.   A new but related proposal was put forward in parallel to ratify a one-time allocation for GR10 and \u201cincentive to help dogfood grants which support the GitcoinDAO\u201d.   Toby, Simona, Ken, and others are actively working towards an updated governance process including a more precise definition of workstreams to help frame the discussion around workstream specific compensation.   Discussions around the unclaimed tokens from the GTC airdrop continue to be active in two threads 1 & 2. Yalor provided a summary of the discussion.   Bobjiang shared an update on the Gitcoin Chinese Ecosystem after their first group meeting earlier in the week.    \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion  Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management   Gitcoin Grants Round 10 was a huge success. Owocki started a thread on Grants Data Round over Round with dashboards and stats of the Grants Rounds.   The Gitcoin Building Gitcoin round showed off a range of projects in the GitcoinDAO ecosystem, if you have a project that you\u2019d like to include in the next round please add it!   The discussion around what constitutes a public good continues. Among other questions, pet3rpan started a proposal discussion around whether VC backed projects should be included. Defining rules for inclusion in grants rounds seems like a strong priority.   Progress on executing the Akita vote continues, with Austin Griffith creating a website app that lets Gitcoin approve certain amounts of Akita to be sold at the current market price.   Shreyas and others are continuing to draft a first version of a treasury management strategy to be executed by the Public Goods Funding workstream.   The BrightID team and others have noted issues with rounds going over saturation resulting in incorrect match amounts (the point at which matching calculations according to QF exceed the funds available in the matching pool) and are writing a proposed solution.   Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)   First pass of the website is live with shiny new designs being shared across Figma files.   The workstream will kick off officially at EthCC in Paris the week of 7/19, anyone with ideas for prototypes that help push public goods forward is encouraged to join.   Decentralization Workstream   Philip has closed out the architecture phase (including the tech stack) and begun development of decentralized grants independent from the core team.   A GitHub organization and repositories have been created for anyone to track progress.   The grant for further funding the decentralized grants workstream has been very successful raising over $30k with matching.   A discussion about what responsible data stewardship on the existing Gitcoin.co marketplace looks like was started by Owocki.   Anti-Sybil Workstream   Recruited community members and stewards to participate in evaluation of users for sybil behavior to train the ML algorithm.   Performed statistical analysis to estimate percentage of sybil accounts. This is used to determine accuracy of the ML algorithm. The machine learning group found the estimated fraud tax from GR10 to be 14.5k, which is down from GR9\u2019s $33k. This is a 2.05% taxation quotient.   Grant Disputes have been cataloged in a public Notion and automated to show on the GitcoinDisputes twitter.   DistruptionJoe wrote up the closing steps and ratification process for Grants Round 10. Check it out on the Governance Forum.   Working on sybil-resistance mechanism design with Moonshot Collective & Decentralizing Grants workstream.   Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream   Initial mockups of a map of the quadratic lands have been started to help new participants navigate the GitcoinDAO ecosystem.   Fred and Chris are continuing to push forward the meme contest in partnership with Stateful Works.

Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there\u2019s anything missing please reach out!    Meta-Governance    @owocki authored a thread on Gitcoin Grants Side Rounds. Side rounds are \u201ctypically for ecosystems that are Ethereum-adjacent, and they are run during the same time as the main Ethereum round every quarter.\u201d.   @Sujiyan from Mask Network proposed a \u201ctoken swap between $MASK and $GTC to further diversify both treasuries and strengthen the interaction between our communities.\u201d The post on strategic token swaps on the MaskDAO forum can be found here.   @AcceleratedCapital added more information to their thread on Gitcoin Treasury Vision; \u201cWe are currently in the process of creating financial reporting and doing some legal work with Gitcoin Holdings on how best to implement these decisions\u201d   @owocki shared an \u201coverview post about Gitcoin, so that prospective DAO participants know the why/what/how of GitcoinDAO\u201d in a thread titled TLDR - What is Gitcoin? [Updated Sept 2021].   @alisha replied to the discussion around What are the KPIs that GitcoinDAO Optimizes for with thought on ways to measure ecosystem impact with three main areas of importance; Impact of Discoverability, Community and Matching.   @krrisis did a quick revision of the GitcoinDAO homepage to make it easier for new contributors to find their way around. He also created a new typeform which will help us evaluate new contributors more easily.   The proposal to Issue a 40k Grant to CLR.Fund will soon be live on Tally to get ratified onchain.    \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion  Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management  First public goods bi-weekly ops call is coming up starting this Wednesday for those interested in joining the Public Goods Workstreams. These are the roles we are currently looking for. Check our link to learn more! There is increasing interest in finding ways to run side rounds via Gitcoin Grants for independent ecosystems, discussions are taking place on how to do this in a way that maximizes benefit for the public good. The public library has started to become a key place to jam on public goods related topics, the group is discussing starting a shared Mirror publication. RFP initial winners and honorary mentions are set to be announced in the next week.  Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)  Every Friday the Moonshot Collective gets together to show off their progress. Individual projects demo what they\u2019ve been working on, and this week we had five projects demo. Key demos include Open Signal, Tip Party, Tokenstream, Scaffold Directory, and the Figma Community Design Kit. Demo videos for each project can be found on  the YouTube playlist. Follow @MoonshotCollect onTwitter for frequent updates. Learn more by saying hello in Discord, or checking out our Website.  Decentralization Workstream  A new team member from the community has joined our team! This new member was found through a Gitcoin hackathon and built a prototype of the Curation Game. dGrants has added compatibility for Polygon and has deployed the dGrants contracts to the Polygon network. A closed demo is planned for the Moonshot Collective workstream this coming Monday where we will show off what we have built and ask for feedback over the next few weeks as we implement fixes and add polish to the dGrants product   Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD-WG)    @DisruptionJoe authored a thread on Threats to the Success of GitcoinDAO on the series of open workshop sessions FDD will be conducting to \u201cidentify threats & weaknesses of the GitcoinDAO during the first couple weeks of October.\u201d. If you want to attend please add your availability to this group calendar. GR11 ended last week and @DisruptionJoe authored a thread on Expected Timeline for Completion, Ratification, and Payout of GR11 Matching Funds with information on \u201cwhat needs to be done and when grant creators can expect payouts.\u201d  @erich added to the conversation on FDD Grant Approval Policy for DAOs with a link to a \u201cPol.is conversation on this issue that we can leverage to find rough consensus with the community.\u201d  Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream   The Budget Proposal Request for Q4 2021 is up for review and feedback on the forum. In order to move forward with the budget feedback from more Stewards of the DAO is needed.   The Steward Report Cards are live! The Steward Report Cards provides the most valuable metrics on engagement for each Steward in the Gitcoin DAO. The cards aggregate public data from Discourse, governance participation and workstream involvement and calculate an overall Health-score. The project will be explained in more detail in an upcoming forum post by the workstrea.   The second iteration of Memepalooza will take place in Discord on Friday. Memepalooza is not a contest - it\u2019s a collaborative jam session and a celebration of meme lords and great memes on the topic of public goods, web3 and the values of Gitcoin DAO, and it\u2019s super fun!   That\u2019s it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance. Feel free to join the discussions via the links above and on Discord, and visit the Gitcoin DAO Event calendar to keep yourself updated on what\u2019s to come! Previous Edition ",

Topics, ideas, proposals, and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there\u2019s anything missing please reach out!    Meta-Governance    The Gitcoin DAO Steward Monthly was held on July 5th, Yalor and Anett shared the agenda, a recording of the meeting, and notes.   Simona, Toby, and Ken have put forward an updated DAO governance process for review and ratification.    \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion  Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management   A proposal discussion authored by DisruptionJoe asks Community Stewards to ratify the GR10 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding to community norms, including the judgements and sanctions made by the Anti-Fraud Workstream.   The website app by Austin Griffith that lets Gitcoin approve certain amounts of Akita to be sold at the current market price has been tested to burn and sell ~6% of total AKITA   UBIpromoter started a discussion around how grant matching estimates during Grants rounds can be improved to display more accurate numbers. Owocki shared data on how match estimates changed over time during GR10, by round.   Yalor gave an update In the thread on a second claim window for GTC stating that discussion \u201chas not garnered enough support to even get to a proposal stage\u201d.   A community call was held on July 6th to discuss the stablecoin introduced by Lior. The ICHI team has begun working on a TL;DR-version of the value proposition of oneGTCto the Gitcoin community. A Telegram group chat has also been created for further discussion.   Spugpow proposed ways of implementing regular opinion polling of grant contributors that would allow contributors of grants to signal whether they are satisfied with how the project has used their donation or not.   Shreyas is continuing to push forward a holistic treasury management strategy for review.   Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)   MoonshotCollective.space is live and we are collecting emails for our first meeting which will be after EthCC. Kevin and Austin are \u201cannouncing\u201c the MoonshotCollective at EthCC   Initial components and starter kits are also being hacked on so they can have some good examples at the first meeting   Decentralization Workstream   Development on the prototype has begun. You can see the beginnings of the GrantRegistry and GrantRounds contracts in the contracts directory.   Frank Chen has joined the workstream and will be taking on some of the project and product management responsibilities.   We are tightly scoping the first iteration of the prototype build project in an effort to enable wider and more decentralized contribution.   Richard Schumann has joined the workstream and is kicking off designing the UI for the Decentralized Grants dApp.   Anti-Sybil Workstream   BlockScience published a post that evaluates their Anti-Fraud Results for Grants round 10. One of the results presented is the improvement around fraud tax: \u201cThe fraud tax for Gitcoin Round 10 was $14,400, approximately 2.1% of the total matching funds of $700,000. (\u2026) The fraud tax in Gitcoin Round 9 was $33,000, or a total of 6.6%. (\u2026) We have many iterations and improvements planned for the sybil detection pipeline between now and the start of Gitcoin Round 11.\u201d   The thread on Gitcoin Disputes by tjayrush sparked a discussion on ways to improve the mechanisms used to identify and settle disputes.   Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream   The deadline for the Gitcoin Meme contest has passed and the process of picking the winners is currently underway. Winners will be invited to join a meme squad for public digital goods.   Steward Report Card designs and a general map of the Gitcoin DAO ecosystem are in progress.

Product planning is being done in preparation for running a side round in GR12   Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD-WG)   Posted the Proposal to Ratify the Results of GR11 & GR11 Governance Brief  Please discuss the proposal and vote on snapshot FDD advises we discontinue paying the Fraud Tax   BlockScience shared their report on the GR11 Anti-Sybil efforts  Fraud tax is down over 50% First round we had enough human evaluators to perform statistical analysis 853 sybil accounts sanctioned   The stream presented to the multisig keyholder oversight squad with the accomplishments of Q3 and deliverables for Q4.  Current structure of FDD & how we got here The roadmap of how we will progressively decentralize Breakdown of current state of all initiatives and squads Turning it into a blog post to supplement the Q4 2021 budget proposal next week   Sending out DAO contributor agreements to all FDD participants. Recommending all DAO contributors use an LLC. Began payments to contributors!  Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream   The Q4 budget proposal for the MMM-Workstream has met the requirements to move forward and a proposal is live on Snapshot until October 9th.   Memepalooza2 was hosted by the workstream last Friday in the Discord. Over 50 people joined and created over 100 memes on the topic for public goods, the open internet and the values of GitcoinDAO. We had a live DJ playing tunes and we tested out coordination tools from Moonshot collective; tip.party and Quadratic Diplomacy.   @fred gave a presentation and shared details on the Steward Report Cards project during a demo event hosted by Moonshot Collective. A video recording of the presentation will be uploaded to Moonshot Collectives Youtube page.   That\u2019s it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance.

Topics, ideas, proposals and votes will be listed with links for further reading and discussion. If there\u2019s anything missing please reach out!    Meta-Governance     Community members are continuing to express interest in becoming Stewards in the DAO and govern for the public good with introductions rolling into the Steward Governance thread. No formal criteria have been set on becoming a Steward aside from interest in participating at this time.   Several Stewards have begun drafting a version of formalized rules for governance based on existing rules found here. It is expected that these will be ratified in the coming weeks, after a hectic start given some unexpectedly complex votes around Gitcoin Grants treasury management.   The deadline for claiming GTC tokens ended this week. 97% of all tokens were claimed and the remaining tokens have been transferred to the Gitcoin DAO treasury for future use by the community.   Some members have suggested a second claim window using the funds in the treasury given the tight 30 day window for the first distribution. Join the discussion here!   A formal proposal around season-based compensation for Stewards has been put forward by Fire Eyes, _\u200b:fire:, for community review. Callum describes seasons as \u201ca time period for Gitcoin Stewards to earn GTC for active participation in governance. It consists of the top 40 delegated addresses, with an open application process for community members to join.\u201d    \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion + Proposal Updates   Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management   Andrew\u2019s path forward for AKITA was ratified by the community after healthy debate, and several stewards (Austin, Trent, Andrew, and Avsa) are working towards executing next steps.   GR10 matching pool allocations were ratified on Snapshot with overwhelming agreement around the proposed categories.   A proposal to \u201cUse Gitcoin to build GitcoinDAO\u2019\u2019 was passed and an open call for grants was started by Owocki. If you haven\u2019t created a grant you still have time!   Peter Pan asked an important question around whether VC funded projects should be included in grants rounds moving forward. Discussion is still ongoing.   Lior proposed a native medium of exchange for the Gitcoin community.   The $SACKS LP position was successfully transferred to GTC treasury for safekeeping   To start, for simplicity, the DeFi Treasury Management workstream has been formed as a subset of the Public Goods Funding Workstream. Shreyas has begun working on a general values statement and strategy for treasury management expanding on his post here.   Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective) Austin announced that the Prototyping Workstream is now transforming into the Moonshot Collective, the first call is scheduled for July 19th at 12pm MST (invites can be found at https://moonshotcollective.space) Active Projects:  Some interesting work being done around quadratic trust - a QF tool where you fund with your clout instead of your money Gitcoin.dance - an NFT dance off for funding public goods, is targeted for GR11 SACKS launched last month, has raised $250k for public goods, and is still kicking (pun intended). Song a day man did a song about the project. Bondable, an incentivized jobs board is being worked on (see Andrew\u2019s grant / forum)  BurnVendor), an initial interface for burning Akita to get the ETH necessary for the LBP is in progress  Projects that are more highly visible on Gitcoin Grants are more likely to be funded. A discussion around the decentralization of Gitcoin Grants Discovery was started by Owocki. Decentralization Workstream   Phutchins provided an update on Decentralizing Gitcoin and describes the progress as \u201cOver the last week we\u2019ve made some great progress on the Architecture Proposal and are nearing completion of the initial draft. Most of the big pieces are getting clearer and are falling into place.\u201d   Furthermore, a new thread and a form was created to help guide community members who wish to contribute to the decentralization of Gitcoin.   Anti-Sybil Workstream  The Anti-Sybil workstream has put forward a helpful guide for anyone looking to get involved. Click Here to Inquire About Participation in This Workstream   Ops, Comms, Edu  Clarified the workstreams participants and status Hosted a full workstream Zoom on Tuesday, June 22nd  Grant Verification  Oversight of the grant verification process is now publicly available here  Recruited 4 community members approved by Workstream to participate in reviewing new grant applications & oversight of Gitcoin denials. Began defining policy for both the Platform & Eth rounds. Working to draft clear in/out of bounds territory. Documenting \u201cgray\u201dzone cases for review  Detection of Sybil/Fraudulent Behavior  Continued experimentation of specificity vs sensitivity of algorithm Human evaluation of algorithm for training data continues  Appeals, Sanctions, and Evolving Policy  Work has begun with the coordinator role being assigned A first draft of an appeals process has been made for grants and users Rough consensus formed on using an English common law standard of precedents and appeals to update the policy  Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream  Chris Martz announced the MMM workstream, described as \u201ca small creative team operating in service of Gitcoin / GitcoinDAO, it\u2019s wider community and it\u2019s values and goals. [\u2026] Using merch, memes and marketing MMM will create unique public goods, new projects, fun stuff that generates curiosity and hype around public goods, Gitcoin, open source software\u201d.

Meta-Governance    The thread outlining the Gitcoin DAO Governance Process v1 has sparked an active discussion with questions and improvement suggestions on various parts.   An in-person stewards meet-up took place at EthCC! Topics including how to improve incentivization, deliberations, and accountability of the DAO Stewards were brought up. @krrisis provided notes for review.   The Public Goods Funding workstream has put forward an initial draft to formalize their efforts and request a governance reward budget of 45,000 GTC to be deployed over the next 3 months. Discussion is ongoing in the thread.   @austingriffith and @owocki put forward a budget request  for 40,000 GTC to fund the Workstream through the next 3 months. Please comment!   @thealexyao proposed a new workstream titled \u201cGitcoin Grantee Content Creation + Storytelling\u201d to \u201cre-engage grantees who have graduated from Gitcoin Grants and create a formal process for them to tell their stories.\u201d.    \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion  Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management   A vote to ratify the allocation of GTC from the Community Treasury towards grant recipients in the Gitcoin builds GitcoinDAO category of Round 10 passed! A Tally vote to distribute the funds and execute on the proposal is in progress.   @Yalor authored a new thread regarding the community stable coin $oneGTC previously introduced by Lior. The proposal will be open for discussion for 2 weeks leading up to the next Gitcoin Stewards Call August 2nd, with a snapshot vote that will be up soon and open until August 3rd.   The discussion on Mini Grants Community Events is ongoing with more details provided by the author @Sirlupinwatson.   @DisruptionJoe provided some insights on the effort to decentralize grants and allow the community to run and verify the calculations for Grant Rounds payouts.   @HelloShreyas and the team at Llama have started making progress on a unified treasury management strategy with the hope that the public goods funding workstream budget will be passed to help fund their work.   The topic of establishing a ruleset for potential tokens being gifted the Gitcoin DAO treasury in the future got some new attention after posts by @Sirlupinwatson and @php.   Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)   @owocki and @austingriffith formally introduced the Moonshot Collective at EthCC with a presentation titled It\u2019s all Coordination.   The kickoff call for the Workstream was a success with a large number of attendees. A recording of the call can be found here, the deck can be found here.   A budget request to fund the Workstream through the remainder of the year was put forward by Austin and Owocki.   @austingriffith posted a request for help with general ops, meetings, website maintenance and making sure things get completed.

The discussion following the proposal authored by @owocki to Adjust the Gitcoin Code of Conduct WRT Airdrops is ongoing. @tra38 authored a new thread to discuss how a ban on airdrops could be enforced with active discussion.  @owocki authored a thread on GitcoinDAO META: Coordination (of Culture + Capital).  @kyle provided some details in the discussion on Gitcoin Round 11 Matching Pool Allocations with stats from previous grants round with SE Asia subcategories. @tjayrush added a summary of the proposed changes.  @owocki authored a thread to highlight open positions in the Workstreams. @ceresstation posted a link to the new onboarding Typeform for GitcoinDAO contributors.   \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Workstream Discussion  Public Goods Funding / Treasury Management  The transaction from the Gitcoin DAO treasury towards funding for the Public Goods Workstream has been executed on-chain! The treasury management doc by @HelloShreyas is still up for discussion, please leave comments! Judging for the public goods RFP continues with some excellent submissions so far Discussions are starting to take shape around how DAOs at large should define the kinds of public goods they care about, in the context of Uniswap\u2019s side round and other current events Some new Discord bots / community management tools are starting to take shape  Public Goods Prototyping (Moonshot Collective)  @ThomasCrown authored a thread called Moonshot Bot Gifting Program with the question; \u201cHow do we incentivize additional mints and strong sales for MSB, to maximize their usefulness as public goods funding tools?\u201d. Our biggest visible accomplishment this week is the ramp-up to launch tip.party We\u2019re also upgrading the tech, content, and team behind scaffold-eth We\u2019re putting together a media strategy, more on this soon! We\u2019re building a foundation of scalable pipelines and playbooks, the results will be invisible, but have many knock-on effects that help keep our project velocity high  Decentralization Workstream  The transaction from the Gitcoin DAO treasury towards funding for the Decentralization Workstream has been executed on-chain. The first MVP of decentralized grants is close to completion to be showcased for a \u201cGitcoin Building Gitcoin\u201d side round!   Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD-WG)   Updated all FDD events on add-event calendar with new zoom links (please delete and resubscribe to current events if you already had it)! New contributors are starting to be onboarded in preparation for Grants Round 11 defense Blockscience continues to put out great research, this time on the role of algorithms in governance  Merch, Memes, Marketing Workstream  The first Memepalooza event took place in Discord this week. The event was a collaboration between Moonshot Collective and MMM. The MMM Workstream onboarding experience for new contributors has seen an overhaul with a new Typeform. A second Typeform to request memes, merch, marketing or anything between, is also live.  That\u2019s it for this week in Gitcoin DAO governance.
