Not all of them make sense, but are there for completeness.  Run them in parallel Have an EVM hosted on WASM as a precompile Add an AS_WASM opcode to the EVM spec; accept WASM bytecode as args Have WASM as a precompile in an EVM environment Write an EVM in WASM, and use that until ETH 2.0; then use it in option 2 Drop the WASM idea all together and just improve the EVM Drop the EVM completely; find migration strategy (transpile or manual migration)  ",

The rest are pretty much just different ways of implementing a client\u2013unless we go with 6 or 8 then clients need to run both eWasm and EVM somehow.  One way to make that easy for wasm-only clients\u2013which might amount to 7\u2013is to place a canonical evm2wasm transpiler on the blockchain for them to use.
