                    "content": "As the applications for real-world assets come in, the community should evaluate each with a lens of \u201cwhat could go wrong here? and how is maker going to be protected?\u201d. Good news is that Maker does not have to reinvent the wheel. Commercial lending has been occurring since the dawn of time. Granted modern day commercial lending within the confines of the law is an \u201cacquired taste\u201d that has been streamlined in the last 50 years. Even if LendCOs are not banks, LendCOs should still think like bankers. This is not to slander bankers (or LendCOs), rather LendCOs (and by abstraction) MakerDAO can learn from the way bankers lend. There is a craft and a reason for most lending practices. Some decisions however are crafted by regulation that most (if not all LendCOs) should be able to avoid. That said, let\u2019s look at commercial lending for a moment. To be a commercial lending bank:  They comply with the law. Period. They know the law. If in question, they seek external counsel for the risks of a specific transaction. They do not take excessive risk. They have established credit teams to evaluate and underwrite their risk exposure. They meet frequently. They know the KYC for all of their borrowers and have reviewed their tax returns (see comply with the law above and senior lien below). They will always prefer to lend to companies instead of people (see they know the law above) Current price volitility is less of a concern than CERTAINTY to an exit Referencing the above, they hope borrowers are shrewd and make money on their exit, but bankers have positioned the deal such that they are not taking the downside risk. Borrower\u2019s equity is taking that risk. (see they know the law above for enforceability) They have equity investors of their own they must report to. They spent a small fortune getting a banking license. No  deal is ever worth risking that. They live and die on the their stated principles and values they want others to see (and must ALSO have integrity to do the right thing when no one is watching). If they don\u2019t do those, they will not be in business very long.  Specific to real-estate  They virtually always demand the senior lien position with a national title company to provide the title insurance. They will not close on a real-estate deal if construction has already started (reference the senior lien above). In the event of foreclosure, they will never fully foreclose and take the asset on their balance sheet. They extract some performance \u201cmotivator\u201d with the borrower to perform. All appraisals / metrics are computed at closing. The lender does not (and cannot) foreclose based on a price change (only on if the borrower fails to repay). ALL metrics and decisions pre-closing are driven around constraining the banks exposure and to require the borrower to put up more equity if there is a concern. (e.g. DSCR, debt service coverage ratio)   General Warren Buffet advice / rules:  Do not lose money  NEVER forget rule number #1    These are only but some of the interesting take-aways I have personally witnessed in my career. As Maker evaluates new applications and grows its footprint in RWA commercial lending, we will all learn the basics of this craft. There are and will be some painful (and probably expensive) learning experiences as we try to decentralize the knowledge base of centralized bankers to a community. At the same time, much of that craft (the nuance) comes from experience to which there is no substitute. For this reason and with time in a macro view, Maker will benefit from having a portfolio (0-50) of seasoned LendCOs that know the INs and OUTs of their specialized field of expertise. ",

Meaning RP and DSR should be treated as independant variables What happens otherwise? Well lets say Dai price drops which warrants a DSR hike. If governance says\"  lets reduce RP so our client doesnt leave us (keep IR stable)\" Then Maker will eventually have no more profit margins on those vault types. And then\u2026 well I think its obvious\u2026 Just like lenders work with external entities for their clients to hedge so can MakerDao ",
