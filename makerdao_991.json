                    "content": " Ilks So far, governance, front-end UI\u2019s and the community generally has tended to use the Ilk Names (ETH-A, ETH-B, GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A, etc) directly when referring to vault types within the Maker Protocol. This has some advantages:  Simplicity and shared terminology for communication and understanding. Direct link between changes in the code of executive spells, and the commonly used names.  And some disadvantages:  Ilk names cannot be (feasibly) changed. More complex collateral types end up with alphanumeric soup Ilk names: GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, etc. Some collateral types have names that are completely disconnected from the collateral: RWA001-A, RWA002-A, etc. Ilk naming conventions are pretty loose and this can\u2019t easily be fixed. This leaves front-ends with the choice of:  Displaying the (often hard to parse) ilk name directly. Making up a display name (may be inconsistent with other front-ends)      Why am I bringing this up? We\u2019ve reached a situation where there is effectively no good ilk-name for a vault-type we may want to onboard because we have two contradictory conventions. I\u2019m referring to wstETH-C. The two conventions are:  The letter suffix of an ilk refers to the order in which it was onboarded (ie, first -A, then -B, then -C, etc) The letter suffixes of -B and -C have taken on additional meaning from the usage with the ETH-B and ETH-C ilks, namely -B meaning higher leverage, and -C meaning lower leverage.  For the low-leverage, low-fee wstETH vault type being discussed, by one convention it should be wstETH-B, and by the other wstETH-C. Given that the ilk-names are more or less unequivocally a technical consideration, we\u2019re going to follow the technical convention for the low-leverage, low-fee wstETH, so the ilk-name will be wstETH-B and not wstETH-C as we\u2019ve been referring to it so far.   Solution The general way to resolve issues like this is to add a layer of abstraction to avoid the issue. In this case, add a new canonical \u2018display-name\u2019 (controllable by Maker Governance) that is used in front-ends and discussion instead of the ilk-name. This mitigates most disadvantages, imposes relatively lightweight costs, and brings some advantages. To give an idea of what this might look like, here are some ilks with possible display names.     Ilk Display Name     ETH-A Ethereum Balanced   ETH-B Ethereum High Leverage   ETH-C Ethereum Low Fee   PSM-USDC-A USDC Peg Stability Module   RWA001-A 6s Capital   GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A UniswapV3 0.01% Fee DAI-USDC Pair (Gelato)   CRVV1ETHSTETH-A stETH-ETH Pair (Curve)    One huge advantage is that we can modify display names. IE, if we add an additional CRVV1ETHSTETH vault, we can modify both display names to reflect the differences. @Protocol-Engineering can obviously feel free to contradict any of the following, but my understanding of this setup is that you want to create an on-chain mapping of ilks to display-names (and any other metadata that is important enough to be set directly by governance.) This may already exist to some extent in the ilk-registry, but I\u2019m unsure if this covers everything we may want from this system. ",

This gives a few advantages:  We can help ensure that the various vault types have consistent branding across front-ends. (display-name mapping.)

A UI to quickly consume it could be produced quickly by a DAO-affiliated frontend dev or possibly a gitcoin grant. A developer would need to call the list() function on the Ilk Registry and then iterate the array, converting each value from the internal bytes32 tag to their human-readable string counterparts. Additional information on each ilk type is available via the Ilk Registry as well, and you mention a good point about giving offboarded collaterals a different tag. I\u2019ll bring this suggestion back to the team.

Once we all have agreement, CES can craft a spell to update the registry accordingly.  TL;DR  Customer facing product naming must focus on \u201ccustomer benefit\u201d rather than technology used or revenue streams such as \u201cfees\u201d. Using this approach eases the friction for new DEFI users to select the product that fits their needs. -A, -B, -C vaults become \u201cBalanced\u201d, \u201cHigh Leverage\u201d and \u201cLow Leverage\u201d respectively.

It is just using the already loosely defined customer segments that vaults -A, -B, -C are targeting for Ilks such as ETH and wBTC.  Customer segments Customer segments are a specifier to target a specific product (Vault) variation (Ilk) to a customer; focusing on communicating the customer benefit.

Naming Convention Proposal Principles:   The convention uses onchain data such as token.name() or token.symbol() to provide consistency across front-ends and verifiability through blockchain explorers, but Maker can take the decision to overrule this principle for readability and a\u00f1ready adopted namings on front-ends across the ecosystem.   A concept in brackets, ie.: (segmentation), means that it is optional.   Customer Segment and Product Types will focus on communicating customer benefits, when irrelevant they become optional, such as when there is no -B or -C version of an Ilk.

Once we all have agreement, CES can craft a spell to update the registry accordingly.   Really appreciate you working on it  I don\u2019t have super strong opinions over what we call everything, ideally it should take some input from @Growth-Core-Unit and/or branding/marketing if we have those in the future. Couple of notes friom me personally (though  may not be valid as I\u2019m not approaching it as a customer)     M_C:  -A, -B, -C vaults become \u201cBalanced\u201d, \u201cHigh Leverage\u201d and \u201cLow Leverage\u201d respectively.   High Leverage + Low Fee rather than High/Low Leverage. Basically, naming vaults based on their positive attributes, rather than postitive/negative.     M_C:  PSM customer facing name becomes \u201cDAI Arbitrage Vault\u201d   I mgiht exclude \u2018Vault\u2019 from this. \u201cDAI Arbitrage\u201d by itself seems a little meh though. DAI-USDC Exchange? DAI-USDP Exchange? Exchange Vault? etc.     M_C:  D3Ms get a suffix, either: \u201cFixed Rate\u201d (Aave style protocol2protocol integration) and \u201cCredit Line\u201d (not-live-yet Maple protocol2protocol integration)   Fixed rate is maybe misleading for D3M\u2019s as we change the target rate semi-regularly (or have in the past.) Maybe \u201cRate Targeted\u201d versus \u201cFixed Rate\u201d? Honestly, naming conventions are less important for D3M\u2019s as they are not directly customer facing. On balance I would just keep it as \u2018Aave D3M / Maple D3M\u2019 etc. Some of these are a little long to be convenient as well.     M_C:  A concept in brackets, ie.: (segmentation), means that it is optional.   I would not make Balanced/High Leverage/Low Leverage optional inclusions. I misunderstood, you mean it\u2019s optional as in not every vault type will have a segmentation.     M_C:  |PSM|DAI Arbitrage Vault   I would probably not refer to the PSM product type as \u2018Vault\u2019 at all, in practice it\u2019s a completely different product to everything else we are calling a vault.     M_C:  MIP21 RWA ERC20   Imo there is no reason to include the gem symbol in the display name for these. It\u2019s a token that essentially doesn\u2019t exist outside being a placeholder in the Maker Protocol.

However, I do not think it is going to work from the Maker perspective to standardize these names in a way that will suit all the integrators. If customers are more used to a certain term because the rest of DeFi/Tradfi is using that term, than it is much easier for UIs to quickly change it, rather than to push MakerDAO to update the naming. However, again, I think this will be really helpful, especially with new more complex ilks that will be introduced, to communicate about them to the broader audience in a more clear way of what it is trying to achieve.

Exchange Vault? etc.   I wanted to use the Product Type \u201cVault\u201d for every technology that a user B2C or B2B can interact with. I explicitly did not call the DAI Direct Modules \u201cDAI Direct Vaults\u201d as D3M tech is a protocol2protocol (machine2machine) integration so with Module and Vault I try to differentiate that \u201cVaults\u201d are for users (through UI, programatically/bots) and \u201cModules\u201d are protocol2protocol (smart contract to smart contract). That\u2019s my reasoning to keep Vault when communicating D3Ms.     LongForWisdom:  Fixed rate is maybe misleading for D3M\u2019s as we change the target rate semi-regularly (or have in the past.) Maybe \u201cRate Targeted\u201d versus \u201cFixed Rate\u201d? Honestly, naming conventions are less important for D3M\u2019s as they are not directly customer facing. On balance I would just keep it as \u2018Aave D3M / Maple D3M\u2019 etc. Some of these are a little long to be convenient as well.   The key difference here is that Maple D3Ms are just a credit line to Maple pools. We fill up the pools up to DC as needed, we are not calculating a target APY on Maple, but a target Pool Liquidity. Aave D3Ms aim to provide a stable borrow rate for Aave DAI users. So the way the D3Ms work and the benefit are different. We could go for \u201cD3M Stable Rate\u201d and \u201cD3M Credit Line\u201d.     LongForWisdom:  I would probably not refer to the PSM product type as \u2018Vault\u2019 at all, in practice it\u2019s a completely different product to everything else we are calling a vault.   It is a tricky one, agree, but my reasoning is that it is a end-user tech (B2C, programatically/bots) vs a D3M which is protocol2protocol only. I agree PSM\u2019s collateral are not user specific, it is just a mix of all collateral anyone has ever arbitraged, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that any DEFI user can interact with it, where D3M are permissioned protocol2protocol.
