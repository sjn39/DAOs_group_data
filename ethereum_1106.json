By levering the blockchain as a ground truth an authenticated messaging layer can be built on top of whisper.   ## Abstract By the EIP-627 specification, not all whisper wire messages are created equal.  Each whisper message has an associated proof-of-work that establishes a value of the message. When the network is inundated with messages, then nodes will cull lower-value messages. Anyone can send a message to any publishing channel, and include any information they so choose.   Blockchains are not subject to proof-of-work pre-computation attacks because newly formed blocks must contain information about the previous block.  Authenticated messages take this a step further, and also includes information about a transaction that emitted the message.      This file has been truncated. show original      I am very confused by the name choice for the protocol.  I don\u2019t think \u201cwhispering\u201d is an accurate name for a global broadcast.  Additionally, I was first drawn to this project because I thought it was written by Whisper Systems, and now I don\u2019t think they are related at all. ",
