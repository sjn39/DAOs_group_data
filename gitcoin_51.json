I wonder if there is consideration to become cross-chain, like say, developing on/for Algorand? Everything on Ethereum is so expensive. I\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my income from the DAO on gas. I wonder if moving some of the treasury over to a stablecoin pegged to GTC on other chains is a good idea. L2s are the common rebuttal, but they\u2019ve all got their own set of challenges and problems with the \u201cblockchain trilemma\u201d that Algorand solves quite elegantly. It\u2019s also pretty impressively easy to use, and mobile-first. ",

The author suggests moving some of the treasury over to a stablecoin pegged to GTC on other chains. The post also discusses the challenges and problems with L2s and how Algorand solves them. The post does not ask for feedback or advertise the proposal, but rather explains the proposal and invites constructive criticism and questions.",
