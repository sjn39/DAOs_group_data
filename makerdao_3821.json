                    "content": "Couple of people on this thread: [Signal Request] Shorten the PPG process - #9 by Tosh9.0 were commenting on the competitiveness of Liquity in relation to Maker. I\u2019ve looked pretty deeply into Liquity at this point (it\u2019s an interesting protocol!) but I am not convinced that it represents an improvement for Vault users in Maker, regardless of the attractiveness. I believe that any vault holders that migrate to it are eventually going to realize that it\u2019s much worse for them than Maker is, regardless of the relative fee.  Almost 90% of all LUSD in existence is in their Stability Pool and receiving LQTY incentives. This means either (or some mix of the following) are true:  Close to 677M worth of usage doesn\u2019t reflect any desire for credit / leverage using Liquity - meaning it\u2019s not stealing users from us. Everyone using Liquity for leverage is not going to be able to pay back their Troves if (when) the ETH price drops - leading the price of LUSD to spike the same way it did to DAI on Black Thursday and Trove users taking up to a 10% haircut as they need to buy back LUSD close to $1.1.     [Signal Request] Shorten the PPG process   I\u2019ve also seen a marketing campaign by Liquity-connected persons to pump up the positives of LUSD vis-a-vis Dai. Now would be a good opportunity for content production or marcomms (if there was one) to point out why LUSD is problematic for the typical user/borrower.   To be clear, LUSD is probably a superior asset to DAI provided you purchase it at close to $1. It\u2019s that superiority that makes Liquity as a platform a terrible deal for Trove/Vault users. The trade-offs that the protocol makes to ensure LUSD is a great asset directly and negatively impact Trove users. This is most apparent in these mechanics:  Redemptions to maintain lower bound of the LUSD peg are directly negative for Trove users, and introduce a zero-sum game mechanic when trying to maintain a safe collateralization ratio. Stability pool incentives that lock-up such a huge proportion of the existing LUSD - preventing Trove users from accessing it when they want to de-lever. \u2018Liquidations\u2019 that socialize bad debt to all Trove users in the absence of LUSD in the stability pool (admittedly unlikely in the near future due to the incentives above.) The upper bound of $1.1 on the LUSD peg risking haircuts when wanting to close up a Trove.  Edit: Some counterpoints to the above have been provided by Liquity in a recent medium post. Feel free to give it a read. ",

For example, remember how the community talked about Reserve Protocol and Kava as potential Maker Killer. But now their stablecoins are not scaling at all (and Kava\u2019s stablecoin is constantly 5-15% off peg). Then the community also talked about Vigor on EOS\u2026 not doing so well. Then some talked about Venus and Vai. Vai is under peg all the time and due to recent manipulation, millions in debt and they don\u2019t know how to solve it. Point is: Gotta watch these competitors for a long time before we worry about them. For example, I think UST managed to grow to a point that they can challenge us in certain niche markets (E-commerce for example but I mean their founder company is an E-commerce giant). ",

It\u2019s like your pants are falling down and we can see your underwear. Also, I wish y\u2019all luck. To anyone else, I know it\u2019s unfashionable to say so, but if a business has to pay equity to its customers, it is losing money. Full stop. It\u2019s not cash, but no one with an even basic understanding of accounting would say that\u2019s a good strategy for more than an extremely short time. In theory, yes, you could dilute slower than you grow profits, but I\u2019ve never seen evidence any protocol (not trying to only pick on Liquity) is in that situation. TLDR; anyone providing their own equity/governance to pay customers cannot do so forever, so we don\u2019t need to view them as a competitor until they prove their model actually generates value and isn\u2019t a place where capital goes to die. Maker worrying about Liquity is like a professional boxer worrying about some 5 year old who trash talks them on Twitter. Maybe they\u2019ll grow into a threat, but it\u2019s not clear they can even hit a keyboard \u2014 much less a punching bag \u2014 without spraining something. ",
