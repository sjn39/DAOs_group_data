It also brings stress to investors, founders, and the community.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: To protect the price of OP projects from volatility and panic selling, Marsbase suggests making large deals outside the CEX/DEX market. Unique PART mode of OTC deals allows selling bigger token volumes to many buyers at once by splitting the offer into parts. Traditional OTC auctions will help to find demand in the long-term market for large transactions.As well as projects launched in the presence of optimism and having vesting will be able to carry out safe trading of vested assets through our protocol. This will release more liquidity into the network Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: This is a smart decision whereby hundreds of thousands of investors will be able to save money on slippage, large whales will return liquidity faster from vesting, average retailers will be involved in OTC deals with dicsounta that were not available before, and all of liquidity will return to your ecosystem and will not just be lost due to lack of liquidity and dumps of projects that are in the vesting Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: \u0422\u0449 Number of OP tokens requested: 45000 ( OP \u00b1 $ 2 ) Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: - How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): - How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Dev salary - 40%OTC trading rewards (cashback from deals) - 30%OP + Marsbase Ambassador task center - 20%Vesting trading rewards for OP projects - 10% Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Dev salary - 3 months until we transfer contracts and mechanics to optimismOTC trading rewards - 1 mnthOP + Marsbase Ambassador task center - 1 mnthVesting trading rewards for OP projects - 2 mnth Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Already DonePart-deals auctions zero-collateralmarketplace notification system calculatorsStage 2 - START Q1-Q2 2023Stage 1 - Q1Marsbase OTC deals contracts megrating to OPOTC leaderboard for OP trading volumsStage 2 - Q2Vesting trading protocol also for OP projectsOTC Widget for B2B (OP) & OTC Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Users will understand the value of OTC and vesting trading for themselves when trading medium and low-liquid assets in OP ecosystemYoung (OP) projects will be able to protect their community and market prices from dumps during manipulation and unlockingTherefore, we believe the tool will take root in the network Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): MARSBASE \u00b7 GitHubAbout Marsbase - MARSBASE Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",
