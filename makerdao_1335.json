It is also positive for the crypto ecosystem in general because this means that people are demanding or wanting to handle euros in Defi, more options for users, and more money coming into crypto, this is good news.

The economy of the European Union has weakened a lot lately, but the block of Russia, China and India not so much, I think that if in the future they bring out an alternative Dai, it would be better that it is linked to the more robust economy of the East, that makes more sense than alternatives of Dai concentrated in the West.

Therefore each trade is counted twice, once under the sold currency ($) and once under the bought currency (\u20ac). The percentages above are the percent of trades involving that currency regardless of whether it is bought or sold, e.g. the U.S. Dollar is bought or sold in 88% of all trades, whereas the Euro is bought or sold 32% of the time. I would think currency pegging priority should be based on real world currency demand. EUR is currently in 2nd place. ",

The euro is not as much in demand as the dollar, it is a more reliable currency from my point of view, but we follow the same centralized debt system. Adopting the least bad does not exempt us from a possible debacle in the global economy. We have to diversify, in my opinion, think outside the box. ",
