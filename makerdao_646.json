                    "content": " MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Compensation  Executive Summary At the end of November, GovAlpha asked the community if we should modify the Delegate Compensation calculation so that Delegates with Lower Voting Participation and/or Communication metric scores could still receive compensation. That Signal went onchain and was successful, leading to the compensation calculations changing for the month December. However, one delegate, @MakerMan, received no compensation for November and would have received 8,245 DAI if the new compensation model had been in place. @MakerMan is the only delegate that would have received additional compensation from this rules change. He was not eligible because his participation score was 89.1% (cutoff was 90%). This signal asks the community if the protocol should pay MakerMan the 8,245 DAI for his Recognized Delegate duties in November, calculated based on the December formula change.  Additional Information Metric Tracking for Recognized Delegates is available here. The original Signal Request for establishing this compensation trial was modified by this Signal to increase the compensation amounts.  Pros to approving this Signal  Applies what GovAlpha believes is a better compensation formula back to the start of the Delegate Compensation trial. Acknowledges the minuscule difference between 89.1% and 90.0% participation.   Cons to approving this Signal  Distributes rewards despite the criteria at the time not being satisfied. Could set a bad precedent for applying new policies retroactively.   Signal    MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Compensation  Yes, send 8,245 DAI to MakerMan for his November Recognized Delegate work. No, take no further action at this time. Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This Signal will run for two weeks, concluding on 2022-02-18. If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes are for the \u201cYes\u201d option it will move to an onchain poll on 2022-02-21. An executive vote to distribute the funds will be required if that poll passes. If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes are not in favor of this Signal, no further action will be taken. ",

I do think some element of personal illness, family illness or other unavoidable circumstance needs to be taken into account.   Everyone in the world gets sick days off from work, or vacation.  Perhaps 1 or two passes should be afforded to delegates for such circumstances.   The passes being such that it can be used on say one set of polls and maybe an executive that basically removes these from the performance computation.   Covering a week\u2026 We should not have delegates that have family, or they themselves in a hospital worrying about whether they voted or not, when they need to be focused either on their own health or the health of a family member. I also point out that over a year someone with 100% participation could possibly blow off the last month and still get their compensation for that month using this participation metric. ",
