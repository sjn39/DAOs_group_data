A proposal is discussed here In order for a proposal to be officially submitted an address has to have 1% of UNI supply delegated to it  How do I delegate my UNI to an address? Where can I do it through a simple GUI? What does delegating my UNI mean in terms of that UNIs usability? Is it \u201cfrozen\u201d in any way?   The address with sufficient UNI delegated to it submits the proposal  How is proposal submission done? Is it also a GUI thing, and what contents of the proposal are actually sent to the chain?   The proposal appears at https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote and each UNI holder can vote for the proposal  Can those who delegated also use the same UNI to vote?   If the proposal gets 4% of the total UNI supply in votes it is accepted, but there is only a 7 day voting window  How is it then afterwards ensured that what the proposal suggested is also what is executed for the proposal? Who can execute the proposal once it is accepted?    Hope you understand my questions, and thanks for any clarifications! ",
