Both projects have made considerable efforts to engage with the Governance process to move forward. Last call was not enough to cover all the questions that the Community members have. This will happen on Wednesday September 16th, 5pm UTC. To continue with the Standard Collateral Types, we will have Stani and Marc (@marczeller) from Aave discussing their token and Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) from Gemini discussing GUSD. This will take place on September 23rd, 5pm UTC. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

How long is that going to take?  12:10 - Akash: You are expecting a market maker to have FX broker accounts and have banking systems with all these different currencies, right? What is the settlement process to eventually turn it back into USDC where they could mint more Dai, for example? 16:25 - Akash?: Is your banking account on Signature or Silvergate so that you can do fast transfers? 17:30 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do you have banks in, I guess, Europe, Australia and Canada, so that the wire transfers are local or is it like a combination where you have funds from across the world? 18:35 - Akash: Does Silvergate has Australian dollar for these fast transfers or not? 18:55 - Akash: What are the best and fastest options for the other currencies in terms of creation, reductions or mints and burns? 20:20 - Will Remor: What are the next currencies to be onboarded? 21:20 - Rafael Cosman: Alex, do you want to touch briefly on TrueGold? 22:15 - Matthew: What about negative interest rates? 23:40 - Primoz: If you had TrueEuro, you could put it into Maker and potentially have a high interest Euro which would be a good deal, right?

What are the maximum stability fees and would it make sense to mint Dai? Do you have a Dai pool? 36:10 - Akash: What is the total size of the assets in these pools? And, what\u2019s the expectation of leverage you are going to introduce in the system? 41:10 - Akash: Does Mooniswap has a token itself? 42:55 - Nik Kunkel: In terms of stability fees, for Mooniswap and the other liquidity token pools as well, what would be the best way to price them and what is the best way to look at the stability fees and collateralization requirements? 44:35 - Nik Kunkel: Can we discuss about the average risk profile of a user who would put LP tokens into a Vault? 49:00 - Christopher Mooney: Do we expect that users would just use it to lever up on the liquidity pool tokens therefore selling the Dai on the market and hopefully bringing the peg back into balance? Would it be more the case for this rather than other collateral types that we currently have?
