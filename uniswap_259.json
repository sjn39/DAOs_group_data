                    "content": "What is the main problem Liquidity providers (LPs) have today and why is it hard to get new users to provide liquidity? Simple, its crypto volatility and the fear of losing money. So how do you get people to LP without the fear of losing money? Uniswap v4 should have a DeFi model that helps LPs increase their earnings while minimizing loss of capital! This model for Uni v4 should automaticaly adjust the LPs position in the pool based on real time data. For example, in the ETH/USDC pair, if the price of ETH increases ABOVE the pool range, the algorithm could automatically switch the LPs position from USDC to ETH. This would allow the liquidity provider to earn aditional earnings from the increased value of ETH!

Screenshot_20230118-215901_Gallery1440\u00d72580 390 KB  This automatic switch is done today every second in v3 thanks to concentrated liquidity! But it is done in the opposite direction\u2026 When the price of ETH decreases BELOW the pool range, the algorithm switches the LPs position from USDC to ETH, increasing the potential losses from holding a declining assest! And when the price of ETH increases above the pool range, the algorithm switches the LPs position from ETH to USDC, NOT allowing the LPs to earn aditional earnings from the increased value of ETH! This is not how DeFi should work\u2026  Screenshot_20230119-184636_TradingView1440\u00d72558 417 KB  If you are still reading this, then you should have figured out by now that the solution to this is very simple! Just change the direction of the switches in the LPs position in the pools! You already have the system and the leading algorithm! You just need to make this change! We know its imposible to change the code for v3 so this has to be done for a future v4. And I suggest you do this before your many competitors make this change when they are allowed to use the code for concentrated liquidity\u2026 Im poor, so can a UNI delegate or whale please copy & paste this into a new proposal with a snapshot so people can vote? I dont care if you take credit for it, I just want this to be done, thanks! ",
