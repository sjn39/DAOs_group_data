I have some OP on an old (maybe compromised wallet) and I want to move it to another wallet. I see that it\u2019s currently delegated to someone.  How do I un-delegate it?  The section of the page that tells me who is currently my delegate has no button to \u201cremove delegate\u201d. If I locate that delegate on the left, I can open up their profile section and there\u2019s a button to Select them as a delegate but not one to remove them. How tf do I do this so I can transfer my OP? Thanks, Scott ",

The tokens will automatically re-delegate to your new selection and you don\u2019t have to do anything after that! ",
