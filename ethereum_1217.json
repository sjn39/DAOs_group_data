Etc. is there a single roadmap, or multiple roadmaps? do we need more experimentation? More main chain forks, testnets, sidechains, constellations, etc? Is our collective vision still \u201cone chain to rule them all?\u201d  Economic policy / Paying for the public good  How is economic policy (e.g. the ether issuance rate / inflation) to be conducted? Is there anything technical that we can do about the current wealth gap situation? How to incentivize more people to use Ethereum and how to pay for all of the ongoing infrastructure work that needs to be done?  UX Conclusions   @JosefJ is hosting a UX Meetup in Prague. He will put together a summary and outcomes and present it live. We\u2019ll capture it on video as well.  Working Groups Proposed topics to be covered in working groups  Virtual Machines: EVM / WASM / K-EVM / IELE EIPs relating to new opcodes / changes to opcodes UX: account management / signatures / wallets Upgrading clients / making forks less dire Compensating nodes / paying rent on contract storage Status codes and improving the developer experience Security and contract auditing (or is this covered by EthBerlin?) Social scalability  Who would like to be the champions for these subjects? Are there other topical groupings of EIPs that have a lot of support? ",

If the work is onerous enough where there is decreasing or stagnant returns with scale, then those on the fringes will do the work and enter the ecosystem. As much as PoW is centralized now, in the early days it is definitely credited with decentralizing the wealth of Bitcoin as it got started. We have to replicate that novelty somehow as wealth distribution mechanism. I also think with adoption will come decentralization of holdings ",
