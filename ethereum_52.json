                    "content": "I am presenting my two cents here and hope people can join the conversation to help improve this draft:  Similar to real-world credentials and identities, SBTs can\u2019t be changed but can be burned. It is important to signify who has the rights to burn a specific token. For example, a club membership can be burned by both parties, a paid membership can only be burned by the receiver, and a loan record can only be burn by the issuer. Ideally SBTs\u2019 content shall be immutable after issuance, this provides credibility and keep receivers\u2019 identities safe from an unreliable issuer manipulating SBTs after issuance; however, it is difficult to enforce that in an interface, so the immutability requirement is kept only as a guideline rather than an enforcement. The idea of consensual follows naturally. If we are trying to build a SBT ecosystem that every token\u2019s identity can be trusted, it is important that receivers give consent to the identity, burn agreement, and metadata proposed by the issuer. Otherwise bad actors can issue fake identities that can\u2019t be burned by receivers, destroying the overall credibility of the system. The goal of this EIP is to provide a standard that makes lives easier when developing SBTs related services. Instead of an error message from calling transfer (this standard extends EIP-721 to be compatible with existing NFTs ecosystems), developers can now check the interface ID and avoid calling transfer on SBTs. They can quickly isolate SBTs issuing events from the unique emits, and there is a number code standard for different burn authorization.  ",

One concern I had was that EIP-5192, which\u2019s still in review stage last time I checked, might change in the future. Another thing to be noted is that EIP-5192 allows contract owners to lock and unlock the transferability of NFTs. In my vision of SBT, the token shall be untransferable throughout its lifetime. Though EIP-5192\u2019s lock and unlock controls provide flexibility in some scenarios, they also undermine soulbound token\u2019s credibility. In the long run, SBTs shall differ from NFTs in terms of how much trust users and verifiers can assume with confidence. If we take away the immutability of ownership, SBTs are just special NFTs that have certain transfer rules customized by deployers. ",

If EIP-5192\u2019s ownership was mutable I\u2019d also think it\u2019d undermine their credibility. The interface came together given the community\u2019s feedback and their wish to not standardize around a purely immutable EIP.

I have seen pro-flexibility and pro-immutability feedbacks in our community\u2019s various discussions surrounding SBTs. IMO, both standings have valid points. Furthermore, EIP-5484\u2019s proposal describes how to do key rotation based on consensual burning mechanics, so it has a good balance of immutability that users can assume trust on, while provides some flexibility that certain sbts can be unbound from an address. My overall goal is to setup a guideline for good issuers to follow, and protect receivers\u2019 rights on the identities they are receiving from easy manipulation of issuers. Again, I am not saying only one approach is right. I think a flexible sbt and a trustworthy immutable sbt can go hand in hand. Developers can pick on which one they would like to use based on their application needs. ",

EIP-5192 is a perfectly capable interface for expressing both permanently \u201csoul\u201d-bound tokens (in a code-immutable way) as much as it can express a permanently transferrable token (in a code-immutable way). E.g. public-assembly has shipped a permanently account-bound token with EIP-5192: Add first cut ERC5192 interface by TimDaub \u00b7 Pull Request #6 \u00b7 public-assembly/curation-protocol \u00b7 GitHub, but entirely different flavors are possible! EIP-5484 is rushed into finalization (which happens in a few days on 2022-11-05) although being unclear and incomplete about, e.g., soul binding. Yes, you named it \u201c\u2026 Soulbound token,\u201d but while the specification acknowledges non-transferability and its issues, it does NOT specify clearly how binding needs to be implemented., E.g., this section:   One problem with current soulbound token implementations that extend from EIP-721 is that all transfer implementations throw errors. A much cleaner approach would be for transfer functions to still throw, but also enable third parties to check beforehand if the contract implements the soulbound interface to avoid calling transfer.  I\u2019m writing this with this intensity as it was pointed out to me that the specification is now already moving into finalization (of which I was surprised - I should have paid more attention) without meaningfully addressing the community\u2019s feedback (e.g., mine). I think that your burn and authorization logic around consent is actually really valuable, and they represent what, e.g., the authors of the DeSoc paper have described. I\u2019m being so passionate about this all here because I think your work so far has been quite impactful and important! So my demand is asking you to roll back the status to \u201cReview\u201d and do the appropriate changes towards better consistency and completeness of your document. Please! ",

                    "content": "Hey @TimDaub, With all due respect, the followings are gonna sound harsh too. I noticed you had the tendency to call competing proposals \u201crushed into finalization\u201d, and saw you\u2019ve done it several times in the past. I was expecting you post something similar when I moved to last call, and here we are. So this is my response to that:   Your EIP-5192 Minimal Soulbound NFTs was created on June 30th, and moved to last call on Aug 29th, roughly 60 days. While this EIP-5484 was created on Aug 17th and moved to last call on Oct. 27th, roughly 70 days. Ten more days than your proposal.   I know the change you actually want me to make is again the change you personally demanded earlier, which is to base EIP-5484 on your EIP-5192. I have responded to that previously in this post, which received great community feedback and you never responded to.       BuzzCai:  Hey Tim, The community has different feedbacks based on different concerns. I have seen pro-flexibility and pro-immutability feedbacks in our community\u2019s various discussions surrounding SBTs. IMO, both standings have valid points. Furthermore, EIP-5484\u2019s proposal describes how to do key rotation based on consensual burning mechanics, so it has a good balance of immutability that users can assume trust on, while provides some flexibility that certain sbts can be unbound from an address. My overall goal is to setup a guideline for good issuers to follow, and protect receivers\u2019 rights on the identities they are receiving from easy manipulation of issuers. Again, I am not saying only one approach is right. I think a flexible sbt and a trustworthy immutable sbt can go hand in hand. Developers can pick on which one they would like to use based on their application needs.    It is interesting you brought up community feedback.      TimDaub:  without meaningfully addressing the community\u2019s feedback (e.g., mine).   Here is a community feedback I am sure you saw and ignored.     BuzzCai:  Another thing to be noted is that EIP-5192 allows contract owners to lock and unlock the transferability of NFTs. In my vision of SBT, the token shall be untransferable throughout its lifetime. Though EIP-5192\u2019s lock and unlock controls provide flexibility in some scenarios, they also undermine soulbound token\u2019s credibility. In the long run, SBTs shall differ from NFTs in terms of how much trust users and verifiers can assume with confidence. If we take away the immutability of ownership, SBTs are just special NFTs that have certain transfer rules customized by deployers.   This conversation happened during the final call of your proposal EIP-5192. I am wondering why you pushed your proposal all the way to final when you didn\u2019t, as you phrased it, \u201cmeaningfully addressing the community\u2019s feedback (e.g., mine).\u201d The only difference is that I didn\u2019t come to your proposal asking you to revert your EIP-5192 status to review because I considered there is a conflict of interest between us competing proposal authors.  The list goes on, but really these are the important points I want to make for now. I know you knew this proposal isn\u2019t rushed to finalization, and you knew I read EIP-4973 and EIP-5192 along with all their discussions multiple times as in the very beginning I posted the links to the relevant discussions and proposals for people to refer to.      BuzzCai:   Related Proposals/Discussions:   EIP-4973 - Account-bound Tokens  | Discussion    EIP-5114: Soulbound Badge  | Discussion    EIP-5192: Minimal Soulbound NFTs  | Discussion     @MicahZoltu and @TimDaub have contributed greatly on the topic, it might get you a better understanding of the discussion if you take a look at the related proposals/discussions links.   I know that you are accusing this proposal being rushed and me being unfamiliar with the two proposal in order to undermine the credibility of this proposal to community members who haven\u2019t been following along. Frankly I understand why you do what you did as a competing proposal author, but hey we are not writing these proposals for personal or business benefits, and I think as a very active member of the forum, you are better than that.

FINAL EIP-5192 - Minimal Soulbound NFTs   This will allow wallets to check for transferability for UX, allows implementers more freedom around mint/burn and maybe even allowing transfers in certain situations.      FINAL EIP-5192 - Minimal Soulbound NFTs   yeah, @aram I think this is a good idea as it\u2019ll still allow someone to inseparably bind a token to an account, but leave that choice to the user (which IMO should ultimately have the freedom of decision). The effect is that it can shut up the nay-sayers arguing for better key rotation practices in SBTs as the interface is neutral towards the concept of permanent locking.   You specifically mentioned token transferability is possible, and this \u201cshut up the nay-sayers arguing for better key rotation\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter who has the rights to change token transferability, contract owner of token receiver, the fact that this is changeable makes my previous point:     BuzzCai:  Though EIP-5192\u2019s lock and unlock controls provide flexibility in some scenarios, they also undermine soulbound token\u2019s credibility.

What\u2019s important is that the flexibility of EIP-5192 diminishes credibility of SBTs\u2019 immutability. If you want to argue that oh wait, I have changed my mind, and EIP-5192\u2019s lock status CANNOT be changed by either parties after issuance. There are few things you have to do. First,     TimDaub:  Contract owners e.g. EIP-173 owner() address CANNOT change the locking or unlocking.   This should be in your EIP\u2019s specification section, not here in the comment section of a related proposal. Your proposal made it very vague and ambiguous on who has the rights to change/assign lock status. Previously I thought you leave it to the implementation to decide the specific rules, but if you want to argue that lock/unlock status is permanent after issuance (which is basically what you are arguing in the previous post), your current EIP-5192 definitely needs a lot of modification on clarifying the rules, and I recommend you roll it back to review status if you intend EIP-5192\u2019s lock status to be permanent after issuance.

TimDaub:  For any EIP-5484 or EIP-5192, without users specifically auditing the actual implementation there is no credibility that implementing the interface correctly also means immutably soul binding the token.   It is pretty obvious we cannot force the exact implementations of sbts. If you read my previous posts carefully:     BuzzCai:  My overall goal is to setup a guideline for good issuers to follow, and protect receivers\u2019 rights on the identities they are receiving from easy manipulation of issuers.   you wouldn\u2019t waste your time explaining basic concept like EIP cannot enforce implementation, since the goal of this EIP is to set guidance, build credibility, and create a standard for burnauth number coding, not enforcement. Furthermore, you are dodging all the important questions I have posted and focusing on useless details that you might think could help win your argument. This conversation has become a total waste of my time. I am not going to respond to your further questions/comments if it\u2019s just another childish attempt trying to nitpick some nonexistent problems to make yourself feel better. ",
