To the first question, tell you that it is the only project that has thought about its users / clients at the time it launched its token. Uniswap has grown exponentially and has rewarded those of us who have bet on it. This is a fact that makes the difference with all the others. I feel indebted to UNI and I like to think that I have contributed to its success. I will stay true to our project Regarding the second question, more than an airdrop from a snapshot, create the possibility of blocking holdings of those users with improved performance groups \u2026 basically UNI futures market, etc. Thanks for the quick reply and a big hug, Jos\u00e9 ",
