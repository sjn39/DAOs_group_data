Check out the stats overview here  Shoutout to Michael Silberling for gathering the stats and answering questions, as well as Chuxin Huang who helped pull together the stats! There is a lot of room to contribute, head to the #analytics channel on discord if you want to pitch in The interesting question lies in how to make users stay after incentive program ends We might do more similar stats walkthroughs in the future on other topics    Bedrock V2 Proposal  Go check it out & comment on the forums Needs 4 delegates approval in order to move to the next stage We will have a community discussion next week on this topic!   RPGF2  Voting is currently anonymous, will end March 23rd Hopefully RPGF rounds will happen much more frequently in the future and with very clear expectations   Community discussions  We\u2019ve landed on doing community discussions every other week in the Discord on specific topics    If there is anything I left out, feel free to add it below!  -Michael   ",
