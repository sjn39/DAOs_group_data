Paragraph Summary I, @luca_pro, have been an active member of MakerDAO\u2019s community for a while, helping defining Maker\u2019s role along the crypto lending stack (also through the publication of the Real-World Sandbox Report) as well as collaborating with several Core Units. I have an extensive 15+ years experience at the highest level of banking and fintech, and am a DeFi researcher through my Substack publication Dirt Roads. I am a firm believer of MakerDAO\u2019s centrality within the DeFi ecosystem and intend to do everything I can to support this vision and the evolution of the DAO as Facilitator of LOVE-001.  Specification  Motivation With this proposal, I put myself forward as the candidate facilitator for the Lending Oversight Core Unit. I am convinced that the DAO could benefit from my involvement, as an experienced financial professional, DeFi researcher, investor, and ultimately genuinely enthusiastic human being. I believe that my involvement so far within the community can testify about what my role as Facilitator could be, and I am looking forward to this incredible journey as mandated actor, community member, and protocol ambassador.  Core Unit ID LOVE-001  Facilitator Name and Information  Name: Luca Prosperi Forum: @luca_pro  Discord: @luca_pro#7418 Twitter: @LucaProsperi  Website: https://dirtroads.substack.com/  ETH Wallet Address: 0x74fAC9056E56FA7A1f65b65abF9F35dA2A76EEa2   Facilitator Credentials  Involvement with MakerDAO  Supported RWF-001, other Core Units (CUs), delegates, and all other stakeholders in improving working practices and processes for all things related to structured finance during the CU\u2019s incubation period. Led the research that produced the Real-World Sandbox Report, aiming at redefining and formalising MakerDAO\u2019s position along the crypto lending stack. Started getting involved by publishing an external audit report for FortunaFi.   Relevant Experience  Publishing Dirt Roads, a Substack newsletter on the evolution of DeFi. Senior advisor to Cherry Venture\u2019s crypto dedicated venture fund. Originated and financed c. EUR 200m of credit through alternative lenders via both a banking platform (Citadele banka, ECB-regulated bank where I was Board Observer representing Ripplewood as the majority shareholder), and a credit fund (while at Partners Capital, a c. USD 40b AuM outsourced investment office.) Completed deals totaling > USD 5b USD throughout 5 years as a private equity (Ripplewood Advisors) and private credit (Partners Capital) investor, with focus on financial institutions and fintech companies. Advised on several high-profile transactions throughout 3 years as M&A banker in Morgan Stanley\u2019s London FIG team. Advised financial institutions on the topics of risk management, strategy, and business growth for 5 years as strategy consultant at Oliver Wyman. Master in Business Administration at London Business School (with hons), MSc and BS in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics at Bocconi and Tel Aviv University (with hons.)   Facilitator Commitment  As a Facilitator I am committing to fulfill the CU\u2019s Mandate, as well as collaborating with all relevant stakeholders, both internal and external, to help MakerDAO becoming the true central pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. I have dedicated my full energy and attention to my role as MakerDAO\u2019s community member during the last months - my transition to a Facilitator role will enhance my ability to have a positive impact on the evolution of the DAO. The team will be flat, skewed towards seniority and deep knowledge, focused on delivery, and absolutely non-bureaucratic, growing to a maximum of 4 FTEs (including the Facilitator) before further decentralising. The team will remain available to support all other CUs, and loyal to a professional yet entrepreneurial mindset in order to keep a focus on both quality and speed of execution Education and communication are the core pillars of a sustainable development, for this reason the team will remain available to offer guidance to anyone and receive criticism from anyone via all communication channels. Best practices identified will be shared within the CU, as well as the wider community whenever relevant.

Our interactions have been entirely within the Maker ecosystem. I have found Luca to be exceptionally professional, respectful, thoughtful and, most importantly, transparently focused on improving the real world finance process/procedures and helping us achieve the goals established by the Maker community. Luca brings a wealth of banking experience to our discussions and provides valuable inputs and guidance to our efforts. Luca\u2019s communications in the Forum have been both respectful and substantive. I think both of these criteria are essential in helping the Maker community discover what works best for Maker. I have been a transactional lawyer for 25 years and have worked with all types of individuals. I am pleased to consider Luca a colleague and I hope that the Maker token holders will provide us the opportunity for continued collaboration. ",
