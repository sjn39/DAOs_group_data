                    "content": "Hey everyone \u2013 my background is in the financial world selling options on equities and harvesting income. Additionally, I\u2019ll sell covered calls against my stock holdings and I love the income that I generate from doing so. I\u2019ve recently been interacting with ThetaNuts.Finance and I think there is a powerful idea that could bring an entirely new competitive advantage to the Maker platform. Idea Summary: Use an identical interface to ThetaNuts.Finance and allow vault holders to sell covered calls against their collateral. The reason that I love this idea so much is that it generates yield for our vault holders on their collateral \u2013 a yield which may actually be larger than the interest they are accruing via their loans. Additionally, I\u2019ll explain how this process actually lowers risk to the Maker protocol of being undercollateralized during some type of market crash. Let\u2019s pretend, for ease of explanation, that it\u2019s a WBTC Maker vault. Scenarios to consider\u2026 Scenario #1: WBTC is at $40,000 \u2013 and the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000. If WBTC does not hit the $50,000 strike price by the time of the option\u2019s expiration, our vault holder gets awarded the premium for selling that covered call. Our vault holder is happy, we are happy \u2013 and the vault holder has a new incentive to park more collateral in the protocol to generate more collateral-secured yield. Scenario #2: WBTC is at $40,000 \u2013 and the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000. If WBTC moves above the strike price at the time of expiration \u2013 the vault holder can either allow the collateral to be called away (liquidating the full vault to repay outstanding DAI, sell the WBTC at $50,000 \u2013 thus the vault holder gets the proceeds of the sale + the premium for selling the covered call minus any outstanding DAI debt). There is no risk to the Maker protocol of being undercollateralized since the value of the collateral went up. Scenario #3: WBTC is at $40,000 \u2013 and the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000. If WBTC drops to where the vault has to be liquidated, the covered call\u2019s strike price is now even further away from the current market price. To avoid the risk of the market dropping quickly (forcing a vault liquidation) and then rising very quickly above the strike price\u2026 the covered call position would either be closed at the time of the vault liquidation (likely at a profit to the vault holder) \u2013 or the covered call position could be auctioned off to be assumed by a vault keeper for the duration of the option contract. The powerful part of this is that the premium harvested for selling the option is actually available to pay back outstanding DAI in the event of a liquidation that fails to repay all outstanding DAI. Summary:   We know that options, and their popularity in DeFi, are going to play a larger and larger role in our ecosystem. If we can be seen as an early player via a very low risks strategy (covered calls) \u2013 that gives us a unique advantage over AAVE and other competitors.   By offering covered call selling, we allow our vault holders the opportunity to generate an income stream that may entirely offset their interest expense.   If we choose to \u201chold\u201d the option selling premium in the vault until the expiration of the option contract, we actually lower the chance of a vault liquidation being insufficient to payback all of the outstanding DAI.

Maybe some ETH remains, maybe not After 15 days, ETH price rallies to $3200.  I guess the call option would expire worthless? ",
