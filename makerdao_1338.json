Sentence Summary MIP6 Collateral Onboarding application for tokenized short-term bonds in line with the requirements of MIP13c3-SP12  Paragraph Summary MIP6 Collateral Onboarding application for Swiss-law tokenized short-term bonds in line with the requirements of MIP13c3-SP12. Backed Finance will create on-chain, permissionless securities backed 1:1 with an underlying short-term bond ETF held at a secure custodian in Switzerland. Market participants will be able to sell tokens (tokenized ETFs) to MakerDAO for Dai up to a limit defined by Governance. A preliminary idea is to utilize a modified PSM implementation that incentivizes users to sell tokenized ETFs to MakerDAO in return for newly minted Dai, but the exact implementation is to be determined in the assessment phase. All trading will be liquid, passive and permissionless, requiring no active management and no KYC on the part of the protocol. MakerDAO should incentivize market participants by providing a small buying spread when it wants to increase exposure and a small selling spread when it wants to decrease exposure. Exposure could also be modulated through changes to the Debt Ceiling.  Context:  The MakerDAO Community recently approved the MIP13c3-SP12 proposal. In it, the DAO asked providers to put forward proposals towards designing and executing an asset allocation strategy to gain exposure to short-term bonds, taking into account the particular characteristics of the protocol.  Backed Finance AG (BF) is a Swiss company, which has developed a fully compliant solution for issuing tokenized versions of tradable securities, including short-term bond ETFs. This is implemented via its fully owned SPV, Backed Assets GmbH (BA). Switzerland has long been at the forefront of developing innovation-friendly regulations to foster the growth of an ecosystem with a strong and well-understood rule of law. Most recently, in July 2021, the Digital Ledger Technology Law (DLT) came into effect, allowing the existence and transfer of digital asset securities on permissionless venues. BF\u2019s solution is based on the issuance of openly transferable tokenized structured products under Swiss law, fully-backed by the underlying bond ETFs in a dedicated collateralized account, that would allow MakerDAO to gain exposure to short-term bonds without having to off-ramp crypto to fiat or leverage any real-world structures. In our view, this should be Maker\u2019s endpoint for asset-liability management: token markets in permissionless collateralized exposure to asset classes outside pure crypto. BA has filed for a Prospectus with the Liechtenstein FMA, for both professional and retail investors within the EU/CH. The prospectus was recently approved. The project has been in the works for approx. 18 months. The project, which is sponsored by reputable investors, is state-of-the-art for TradFi infrastructure and is based in a friendly jurisdiction.   bIBTA Collateral Application Template | Short-Term Bonds (bIBTA) Preliminary disclaimer The securities have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended or with any securities regulatory authority of any State or other jurisdiction of the United States and (i) may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of U.S. Persons, and (ii) may be offered, sold or otherwise delivered at any time only to transferees that are Non-United States Persons (as defined by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission).

Backed Finance AG, a Swiss company incorporated in Zug. We are responding to Maker\u2019s MIP13c3-SP12 with the below MIP6 application.  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Backed Finance, via Backed Assets, will create and issue tokenized IBTA (short-term bond ETFs) securities on the ETH blockchain, with a view for the Maker protocol to allocate a portion of its assets to short-term bonds in a fully permissionless way. BA\u2019s tokenized IBTA securities will represent 1 for 1 units of the underlying asset. They will be sold to market participants, which will pass full KYC and AML, and will have the ability to mint and redeem token securities for the underlying. These market participants could then deposit the IBTA tokens in a specialized Maker vault. Every time a token is either issued or redeemed, the corresponding security will be purchased or sold respectively preserving the fully backed by underlying status.  How long has the project been live in production?  The project has been in development since December 2020. The legal entities were incorporated in May and July 2021. The prospectus was approved on May 9th, 2022, and launch is planned in early July 2022.  Provide a brief history of the project.  In December of 2020, we developed the concept of bringing to market the equivalent of USDT/USDC for securities to allow the streamiling of traditional security assets and on-chain infrastructure. Some initial prerequisites were defined: (a) a freely transferable, ERC20 token (b) a product that would be fully backed by the underlying (c) a fully compliant product. The combination of these prerequisites complicated matters. Many jurisdictions were investigated, and were found to be incompatible. Eventually Swiss law seemed the most adequate, especially due to the 2021 DLT law, which defined ownership through distributed ledger technology as equivalent to that of other legacy forms of ownership such as bank entries. Upon obtaining a legal feasibility study that confirmed all aspects of the product\u2019s properties, a company (Backed Finance AG) was incorporated in May 2021, and Seed round raised. Gnosis served as the anchor investor in the Seed round, among additional seed investors. Work on a prospectus started in July 2021, and a Swiss subsidiary (Backed Assets GmbH), to serve as the issuer (SPV) was also incorporated. In parallel, AML compliance was also required, so a Swiss SRO membership was applied for. By December 2021 the first version of the prospectus was filed. Accounts with financial service providers were also negotiated and opened. During Q1 of 2022, a pre-round A CLA was raised, and prospectus was brought to final versions. Final approval was obtained on May 9th, 2022.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  The proposed assets are fully compliant, approved financial products, thus all legal information is public, and can be found at: www.backedassets.fi The specific asset discussed in this proposal is: Name of token: Backed iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF (Accumulating) Contract Address (Ethereum) is: 0x9ABB4E7f4ee96cA58F156338640aEd031188E5E1 Product follows, and is fully backed by the following underlying:    BlackRock   iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF | IBTA The Fund seeks to track the performance of an index composed of US Dollar denominated government bonds issued by the US Treasury.      Underlying Ticker (LSE): IBTA  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)  The proposed asset is a fully-backed (1:1) structured product, sold in the form of an ERC20 token. The value driver of the structured product is identical to the value of the underlying assets, which is a short-term fixed income ETF, holding a series of 50 T-Notes issued by the US treasury. In essence, this is a \u201cstore of value\u201d type of financial exposure, with the added benefit of interest being accumulated.  How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)  The asset is ERC20, hence fully transferable. It also entitles holders the right to redeem it for cash via the issuer at any time (during market hours), provided that the redeeming party has cleared KYC procedures with the issuer. ERC-20 transfers do not require addresses to be KYCed. The product does not distribute dividends by definition, however the underlying was chosen so it is an accumulating ETF, so the value of the paid interest is automatically added to the value of the underlying, and reflected in its tradable price.  What is the market cap for the asset?  This is a new issuance, created with MakerDAO in mind but available to the broad public, so starting with 0 on-chain. The ETF market cap is over 9 Billion USD but the market cap for the underlying treasuries is much larger, over 1 Trillion USD.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  Currently no circulation, so no exchange data available. The asset is ERC20 so it is freely tradable OTC, centralized and decentralized exchanges. 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth.  Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)?  The asset in this proposal is ERC20, thus settled on-chain. The underlying, which drives the value is a tradable security, and is settled in regulated exchanges such as the LSE or SIX, and is thus trusted.  If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time.  The underlying, which is a conventional security and therefore based on a trusted system, is purchased using a Broker, and placed in a custody account by a regulated Custodian. Moreover, the custody account is supervised by an unrelated 3rd party (the \u201cSecurity Agent\u201d), which has the authority to block the account and dispose of the assets to pay token holders the value of their investment. The Custodian is: ISP Securities AG, Zurich, Switzerland (additional Custodians might be further included) The Security Agent is: Security Agent Services AG, Baarerstrasse 75, 6300 Zug, Switzerland (Security Agent may be replaced)  List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type.  The price of the underlying ETF on which the collateral token is based, appears in the following link:    londonstockexchange.com   Stock Search stock, chart, recent trades, company information, trading information, company news, fundamentals      In addition, given the fact that the underlying assets are trusted, and that a dependency on the legacy financial infrastructure is unavoidable, Backed Assets would be interested in maximizing the level of transparency of the \u201creserve\u201d, namely the collateralized custody account. For that purpose, it suggests using a \u201cproof of reserve\u201d type oracle, for instance, and is willing to collaborate with the MakerDAO Oracles CU to develop the appropriate solution.  List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type.  Given the ample liquidity of the underlying products, there will likely be many market participants interested in arbitraging for e.g. a liquidation event and increase (Issuance) and decrease (redemption) of units.  Business Questions  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?  The Dai generated by the vault should go to market participants depositing tokens into the vault at a slight spread. Following oracle price updates, the change in price or accumulation effect should mint new Dai directly into the surplus buffer. Drawdowns in price or value should remove Dai from the surplus buffer to cover for liquidations.  What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  The debt ceiling should be calculated as a portion of Maker\u2019s stablecoin holdings to allow volume to shift to the ETF token. Initially, we propose setting a 50m ceiling to test. Over time, assuming all the tests are successful, the debt ceiling could move to a substantial portion of total stablecoin holdings with a cap to be defined by the Maker ALM team, to allow for rapid liquidation in the event of a run on the protocol.  What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?  MakerDAO has expressed its desire [link to growth post] to move to a fully on-chain investment strategy for its stablecoin assets. We believe Backed Finance is the first such solution that also offers the benefit of a solid regulatory framework, issued in a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.  Legal Questions  What are the legal risks associated with the tokens?  There are a series of listed risks in the prospectus. What we consider to be the primary risks are divided between the inherent risks of the value, and the risks associated with the form the products have been designed and brought to market. The inherent risks of T-bonds are the risk of default by the US government. This is considered an extremely low risk, and is, to an extent equivalent to the risk of the US dollar. The risks related to the form the product has been designed and brought to market are, essentially, the following:   Counterparty risk: the underlying is an ETF issued by Blackrock, a huge asset manager. In case Blackrock is not able to meet its obligations, the issuance and redemption of new ETF units might be halted, and liquidity become limited. Nevertheless, as the ETF physically holds the assets it follows (the T-bonds), the ETF unit holder will be mostly secured from default by the ETF issuer.   The Custodian - the ETF units are held by a licensed custodian. In case the custodian defaults, a legal procedure for releasing the assets would be required. Nevertheless, the assets under custody are legally separated from the balance sheet of the custodian, and would only be attributed to the account owner (Backed Assets) and its customers (the token holders)   The issuer of the token - Here again, the issuer as a legal entity might default due to unforeseen circumstances. Nevertheless, as the underlying assets are held in a collateralized account, the Security Agent would intervene and seize control over the account, paying the token holders their corresponding value.   Enforcement by regulators: the issuer has done every effort to ensure that the issued tokens are fully compliant. Nevertheless, some authorities, and especially the SEC, might decide to exert their jurisdiction over the products, despite the fact that these products are not marketed or offered to US persons. In addition, regulations in other territories might change, making the product non-compliant any longer. In such cases, the issuer would probably end the life of the product, notifying all token holders that they may redeem the tokens and be entitled to their corresponding funds. At the moment, our tokens do not have the ability to blacklist addresses though.   (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?   The issuer of the token (BA) is the owner of the collateral account, and therefore fully responsible for it. The organization is incorporated in Switzerland (Zug), and operates under Swiss law. In addition, the security agent has full authority to ensure that the collateral (meaning the collateral on which the token is based, the ETF) reaches the token holders in case of default.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  The project did obtain legal opinions from several legal advisors. The principle one relates to the whole structuring of the products and their sale, and relates to the application of Swiss law to this structure. Also, some legal analysis with regard to EU regulations was obtained, further providing comfort that the products are fully compliant. Additional legal advice and memos were also obtained for additional jurisdictions. Unfortunately, these documents are not available to the public, and can be shared only with individuals committing to strict non-disclosure agreements.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  The tokens are issued based on an approved European prospectus. The extensive documentation involved can be found at: www.backedassets.fi  Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)?  The issuance is managed by Backed Assets, and thus is controlled by the signatories of the token contract, which have been defined by the company, thus the issuance is centralized. 21.a. If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity and jurisdiction? The legal entity is Backed Assets GmbH, a company incorporated in Zug (Switzerland).  Technical Questions  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.    github.com    Omega-Audit-Report-May-2022.pdf       Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified?  No. We did not go through formal verification but intend to do so in the near future.  Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400)  Yes, ERC20  Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)?  Minting of new tokens is controlled by a multisig (Gnosis safe), controlled by Backed Finance AG.  Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved?  The tokens have no whitelists or blacklists. Direct issuance and redemption, as well as holding the associated ERC-20 token, is formally prohibited for US persons as well as other sanctioned jurisdictions. However, the ERC-20 token does not face any technical restrictions on transferability.  Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved?  Yes, the smart contract is upgradable, mostly for addressing unforeseen security issues, and for unforeseen regulatory requirements. The public prospectus denotes the considerations of such upgradability and possible future functions that might be added. Detailed information about this matter can be found in the Terms and Conditions, in the Security Note, section 4(II) of the public prospectus.  Does the token contain rebasing logic?  No ",

Step 5: The US Gov issue bond in a permissionless tokenized form because the market is so efficient that it\u2019s cheaper than tradfi. We are the primary dealer.  Monetalis MIP65 is pushing (almost done!) from step 0 to step 1. This is the start of step 2 to 4. The underlying ETF, IBTA is one of those that are currently being selected by MIP65. It is obiously the first of, I hope, many to allow MKR holder to allocate their balance sheet easily as they see fit. I really believe this is strategic for MakerDAO and DeFi. ",

As there is no distribution of profits, there is nothing to handle on chain.   This is a good question on the choice of product. The choice was made according to what we thought MakerDAO is looking for. Which I think is good assuming that from the time Maker will get the products interest will stop going up. But it is important to mention that Backed can create any product, and we are a financial infrastructure, not a financial advisor.   Backed Assets is charging issuance and redemption fees.

Nevertheless, some authorities, and especially the SEC, might decide to exert their jurisdiction over the products, despite the fact that these products are not marketed or offered to US persons.   I was interested in building a similar project at one point and talked with four U.S. securities lawyers about pretty much this exact idea. They all took the view that tokenizing a security would definitively make the token a security, and that enabling it to be traded permissionlessly would likely result in enforcement actions from the SEC. Have you consulted with U.S. lawyers who have advised you on whether or not the token would be considered a security, and if so, the likelihood of enforcement? ",

I concur with this view (not legal advice). I\u2019m definitely interested in the answer. Have not reviewed the proposal in detail yet, but from the DAO perspective what would regulatory enforcement look like from the SEC if it were determined that any ERC20 collateral is a security and MakerDAO is an unregistered broker-dealer or other? MakerDAO is not a legal person/entity, so who would they go after and why? I feel a responsibility to warm the community that people telling you we are decentralized (sprinkle magic dust) and not a financial institution (more magic pills) so ALL GOOD doesn\u2019t tell you (person reading this) a single thing about your personal or firm risk relative to the influence/control you have in the operations and governance (*cough) of this DAO.

I have a legal-ish question, which is surely naive since I am not a lawyer:     backed-finance:  BA\u2019s tokenized IBTA securities will represent 1 for 1 units of the underlying asset. They will be sold to market participants, which will pass full KYC and AML, and will have the ability to mint and redeem token securities for the underlying. These market participants could then deposit the IBTA tokens in a specialized Maker vault. Every time a token is either issued or redeemed, the corresponding security will be purchased or sold respectively preserving the fully backed by underlying status.   The path (back and forth) is: IBTA ETFs \u2190 \u2192 Backed Finance \u2190 \u2192  tokenised ETF \u2190 \u2192  KYC/AML market participants \u2190 \u2192  Defi (including Maker) what worries me in this path is that it essentially circumvents the point of the KYC/AML step and allows random people to hold the IBTS ETFs. One could say that since the redemption must go through the KYC participants, this is acceptable. But effectively having MakerDAO emitting DAIs for these tokens, allows for (effectively) an on-chain redemption. In other words, MakerDAO is basically allowing to launder these ETFs. QUESTION: Can you pleas explain, at a high-level (again, I am not a lawyer) how this has a chance of being legal (not just in the US). ",

As per AML, sale of a financial asset that is ERC20 by performing KYC and AML monitoring at the issuance and redemption points is identical to that of Tether and Circle. There is little significance to what the financial product being sold is. AML compliance is determined according to the platform that buys/sells the products and not the products itself. Since Backed Assets is a Swiss company, the issuer is regulated in Switzerland in that respect by being a member of an SRO organization. From a securities point of view, there are requirements for issuing, and additional requirements for offering. The issuer has registered in a competent EU authority, and the security has been fully described and disclosed. Therefore the issuance of these securities is allowed, and the fact the ownership takes place using a cryptographic token has little impact. The products are even defined at a relatively low risk category of \u201cstructured products\u201d, which means that the product is fully backed by a collateralized underlying. As far as offering goes, these tokens are approved for sale in the EU and Switzerland. They will not be sold nor offered in any sanctioned country, and not in the US. The company has spent considerable efforts and resources in making sure it\u2019s compliant with every aspect of the KYC/Issuance/Offering regulations. ",

This process isn\u2019t as seamless as ETFs\u2019 creation/redemption mechanism and can lead to periods where there are too many/too few shares available to the market. When this occurs, the share price will trade at a discount/premium to the value that the share represents.\u201d As the Backed products would be issued and redeemed almost continuously, there should be a much lower arbitrage between the NAV and the trading price, otherwise someone will intervene and take the profit.

There are no \u201cdummy\u201d tokens there, as this is the real deal, each token in that contract legally represents a financial asset. The code of that contract can thus be reviewed and compared to the audit. Does this answer your question? As per the ownership and management: Backed Assets is a fully owned subsidiary of Backed Finance, so not much to elaborate there. Backed Finance has 3 controlling shareholder, owning the majority of the company: Adam Levi, Yehonatan Goldman and me (Roberto Klein). The rest of the equity is owned by our seed investors, who\u2019s privacy we should respect. As per management, please refer to the Backed.fi Website, it is all mentioned there. The potential conflict of interest you mention is derived from the fact that the parent company, Backed Finance, also provides tokenization services to the subsidiary, and gets paid for that. Therefore, how to price the service is a good question, and there exists a risk of conflict of interests. I think this is mostly a \u201ctransfer pricing\u201d issue related to tax, and nothing to do with security and safeguarding of the assets. ",

                    "content": "Hi @JasonS, Sorry for the long answer, it is for the purpose of clarity. The missing part in the flow you described is that the actual real owner of the securities is not the Custodian, but rather the Issuer, namely Backed Assets. The Custodian merely holds the securities that act as collateral in a securities account bearing the Issuer\u2019s name. As long as the Issuer is operational, regardless of crypto market conditions, any fully KYCed client of Backed Assets (the Issuer) would be able to redeem tokens into cash/stablecoin without interacting with either the Custodian nor the Security Agent. As long as there is sufficient liquidity of the underlying asset in the principle trading venue of that underlying, such redemption could be executed even in very large volumes. Payouts for redemptions would be done directly by the Issuer. The Security Agent enters into play only if the Issuer, for some reason, stops serving its clients and keeping its commitments. In such case, the Security Agent assumes control over the securities account, sells the assets and distributes the cash to token holders. BTW, the erc-20 is not only an on-chain ownership. According to Swiss DLT law, this is also a real proof of ownership accepted by Swiss courts, so owners of a Backed token are legally entitled to the value derived from the financial instrument it represents. Now, as per vault liquidations: Please note that the proposal, as defined above, includes the following suggestion: \u201cA preliminary idea is to utilize a modified PSM implementation that incentivizes users to sell tokenized ETFs to MakerDAO in return for newly minted Dai\u201d How do you see vault liquidation becoming relevant in such scenario?

It is the first of its kind, and I am sure others will follow. This actually makes the token a MIFID financial instrument that are also freely transferable. As per our legal firm, we work in Switzerland with MLL, a Tier 1 Swiss law firm. We are, unfortunately, not able to share the legal opinion. That is one of the only documents that are really proprietary, and is basically intended to protect us by defining that what we do is completely legal. Having the public prospectus, I do not see much reason why this would be required by the token holders. As per SRO, it is the requirement to comply with KYC/AML regulation. It requires, BTW, regular audits making sure our AML is compliant. The SRO has nothing to do with issuance of financial products. For doing that, Backed Assets is not required to be regulated given it issues Structured Products, however it is regulated by the fact it filed a prospectus. ",

Can you please elaborate on how you have addressed the obligations of BackedFinance to track the changes in ownership of the token and its transferability from a legal perspective? My understanding is that if this MIP passes, MakerDAO will onboard with BackedFinance, deposit X amount USD (DAI) and invest with this in a portfolio of fixed-income ETFs, that will later have a 1:1 representation on-chain as an ERC20 token. Then MakerDAO will have the ability to transfer these tokens out of BackedFinance\u2019s platform to any address of their choice, potentially for example a market-maker to participate in AMMs or simply convert these into other assets. How would you in this case trace the ownership of the token? MakerDAO would still have a securities account with BackedFinance holding the underlying ETFs and hence would be taxed/reported on their holdings (for example, capital gains) while the instrument (token) is in reality held by another party?

Backed is limited as to who it can sell to (only professional investors) and redeem from (most investors except those from non-serviced countries). The reason this can be so, is that the type of financial product Backed issues is a \u201cStructured Product\u201d, which, in essence, is a debt security, and therefore freely transferable, and requires no tracking of ownership. The proof of ownership is embedded in the control of the token by the private key, which is inline with Swiss DLT law. As correctly answered by @adcv , Backed does not onboard the DAO as a client, as only entities with a defined UBO can legally become clients. The professional clients that will onboard Backed will choose if and when to interact with the DAO based on the financial incentives the DAO will incorporate. ",

I really like the model but in this case, I find of special importance to brainstorm and include as part of the proposal a better definition or suggestion of the incentives for market participants to engage in the sale of these tokenized debt securities to MakerDAO. Fixed-income instruments despite having recovered, still show a rather limited yield (the iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF taken as reference product has a current Weighted Avg YTM of  3.10%) which discounting the cost of the custodian (ISP), issuer (BackedFinance), and incentives to be paid to sellers paid by MakerDAO might end up reducing significantly the final yield for the treasury. Do you have any view on the cost structure? Further to this, I am also concerned about the liquidity risk as there might be an scenario where MakerDAO might want/need to liquidate/rotate its exposure to this specific ETF but not find any buyer in the market hence would be forced to significantly increase the spread to incentivize market participants, which can end up draining the cumulated performance and yield. Compared to this, although a more centralized setup, I believe MIP65 would give MakerDAO direct access to traditional securities markets to buy/sell the exposure. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for this @abcb. Incentive design for rate setting will be exclusively in Maker\u2019s purview. This collateral application is just about opening a vault in the Maker system for bIBTA tokens. MIP65 is a good step in the right direction but we need to diversify our risk as much as we can from a jurisdiction and arranger point of view in order to avoid centralization risks of exclusively managing our balance sheet through MIP65. It also helps that the model from Maker\u2019s point of view is permissionless and removes a layer of intermediation. Concerning liquidation risk - both MIP65 and bIBTA face the same subset of liquidity available to the total UST universe as they are an ETF rather than direct treasury exposure. In both instances, there is sufficient and deep liquidity to manage an investment rotation. I don\u2019t believe there is any more or less liquidity risk from MIP65 moving off-chain assets to meet on-chain redemptions than there is slippage risk on-chain for a tokenized PSM allocation to instruments that are 1:1 redeemable by authorized participants. In both instances this risk is as yet still only theoretical. I encourage you not to think about MIP65 and this application in a zero-sum perspective. Should both do their job well and bring in much needed ROA to the Maker balance sheet, we may be able to consider opening up new strategies to serve Dai holders such as increasing the DSR and expanding the balance sheet further for even greater exposure. In that instance, MIP65 would face the possibility of managing an even greater allocation, as would any other onboarded arrangers. I would be surprised if token holders would allow one or two single arrangers to manage this exposure, which would net reduce the ROA we are able to generate for the system as a whole and keep the pie quite small.

To get there we may have to scaffold a few settings first but the infrastructure should allow us to, over time, automate the allocation.     dbkcan:  Curious how you plan to manage this exposure how often and how will payments be made to say the surplus buffer? Or will the yield just increase our exposure to the underlying ETF ?   We will manage maximum exposure through setting the DC. The surplus buffer will just reflect as an accounting difference between the change in value from NAV or price. This ETF is accumulating so the NAV should drift upwards over time. Losses in value would reflect as a deduction of course. It makes me really happy to be able to write that you could say we are yield farming this ETF.     dbkcan:  Who will be responsible for creating any oracles required to manage the position?

Regarding price signaling and secondary markets: Obviously we have no ability to guarantee anything in UNISWAP or any other DEX, nor do we intend to control secondary market. That is the beauty of well aligned economic incentives. If you think of any better price setting mechanism, we are very open to hear, however this has been thought through very carefully, and we believe the best solution for market pricing is by allowing market participants to capture arbitrage if such appears. It is the most decentralized price setting mechanism, and the Backed team has made a huge efforts to streamline the products to be as permissionless as possible. ",

The proposed mechanism seems the most efficient one, suggested by individuals with profound knowledge of the MakerDAO, as it requires very little to 0 centralized control after implementation, however if you can think of a better mechanism, please feel free to bring any suggestion you think is relevant. As per the choice of asset and costs: Actually, custodian costs would apply no matter which method of holding the RWA is chosen. In our case, we do not charge that to the owners of tokens (No AUM commission), so the holders of tokens do not pay the custody fees. Please also bear in mind that MakerDAO will not be the only holder of these tokens. Billions of individuals around the world have no access to RWA with such properties as IBTA or others, and for such individuals, the ability to buy onchain such exposure is worth paying a positive arbitrage, whish is how our business model works, as Backed only charges issuance and redemption fees. Lastly, about liquidity - Backed will buy and sell IBTA units from the principal market makers of the IBTA product (as defined by the iShares legal documents), which basically mean these units will be created/destroyed by the market maker on the spot. Consequently, issuance and redemption of bIBTA (the token) will not depend on our ability to buy and sell the underlying in the capital market, but rather in the liquidity level of the bonds that construct the IBTA ETF itself. Being US treasuries, these are the most liquid bond markets in the world. ",

                    "content": "These are my personal views and not those of CES.     backed-finance:  MIP6 Collateral Onboarding application for tokenized short-term bonds in line with the requirements of MIP13c3-SP12    I think we are losing the purpose of the original intent of MIP13c3-SP12  and this proposal is now turning into MakerDao essentially acting as a market maker for bIBTA. Specifically, from the backed-finance collateral onboarding call ( Collateral Onboarding Call #45 | Backed-Finance ) it is clear that backed-finance wants no involvement in onboarding this collateral - through say a MIP21 structure and wants ideally the bIBTA to be treated like a stablecoin such as USDC - with a planned exploration of using the PSM for this. From the perspective of incorporating this in the PSM as has been suggested by @strat-fin-core-unit - I think this is a non starter for the following reasons:   The PSM is used for providing a permissionless swap capability between stablecoins - by offering an bIBTA permissionlessly in the PSM we would be getting away from the initial intent of MIP13c3-SP12 - which is to reduce our USDC exposure and generating short term bond income. By pursuing the route suggested by @strat-fin-core-unit we are violating this original intent and by opening up a permissionless 2 way swap market - risk making no income from these biBTA\u2019s.   The PSM is used for swapping stablecoins - where typically there is no issue with respect to oracles related to the underlying asset as these tend to be pegged to the US$. The underlying asset for the bIBTAs only trades during stock market hours - and will definitely need an Oracle - the issue that would be of concern using the PSM is that arbitrage opportunities are potentially created when stock markets are closed and we are providing a market closing price for this opportunity - the only way of mitigating this would be through the PSM parameters or by \u201cclosing\u201d access to the PSM when stock markets are closed which would not be practical.   By making this token available within the PSM - we are implicitly - allowing Maker users to trade a token whose underlying asset may not be redeemable - especially if the bIBTA is owned by a US investor .  Given this, I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for Maker to make the bIBTA tokens available for permissionless trading - and would argue that by making it available on a permissionless basis - without disclosure of the restrictions on redemption of the underlying asset - we would be exposing Maker to potential legal and regulatory liability. You can argue that it is up to the buyer to beware - but if Maker users are to trade this without disclosure - they will have unnecessarily incurred gas and other transaction fees for ultimately an asset they cant redeem.   Given that backed finance has stated that they have no interest in completing a MIP21 - and that it will be incumbent on MakerDao to be responsible for all aspects of integrating the bIBTA into the protocol including oracles etc\u2026 For these reasons I personally don\u2019t believe we should be green-lighting this proposal.

                    "content": "Thanks @dbkcan. Taking the liberty to build on some of your concerns and hopefully address:     dbkcan:  The PSM is used for providing a permissionless swap capability between stablecoins - by offering an bIBTA permissionlessly in the PSM we would be getting away from the initial intent of MIP13c3-SP12 - which is to reduce our USDC exposure and generating short term bond income. By pursuing the route suggested by @strat-fin-core-unit we are violating this original intent and by opening up a permissionless 2 way swap market - risk making no income from these biBTA\u2019s.   The PSM as proposed would exactly achieve the objective of MIP13c3-SP12 by allowing the reallocation of USDC volume to bIBTA, short-term bond ETFs. I am not sure how you imagine this does not achieve the original intent of the DoI. Maker can decide, through policy rate parameters, effectively how much DC to accumulate in bIBTA. It is a stretch to argue that it would act as market maker - it is no more making markets in bIBTA than it is in ETH through liquidations or USDC through the PSM.     dbkcan:  The PSM is used for swapping stablecoins - where typically there is no issue with respect to oracles related to the underlying asset as these tend to be pegged to the US$. The underlying asset for the bIBTAs only trades during stock market hours - and will definitely need an Oracle - the issue that would be of concern using the PSM is that arbitrage opportunities are potentially created when stock markets are closed and we are providing a market closing price for this opportunity - the only way of mitigating this would be through the PSM parameters or by \u201cclosing\u201d access to the PSM when stock markets are closed which would not be practical.   Arbitrage opportunities are precisely the way to incentivize market participants to constantly reach the desired DC in a permissionless way. Maker can effectively determine the availability of these opportunities through the MOMC rate setting process and does not have to pay attention to ETF trading hours. Arbitrage outside market hours is pursued at the risk of the PSM user, who may so desire.     dbkcan:  By making this token available within the PSM - we are implicitly - allowing Maker users to trade a token whose underlying asset may not be redeemable   We incur this risk already with WBTC and USDC. This is no different and does not expose Maker to any more or any less legal or regulatory risk than either of these two tokens that are a mainstay of the protocol. We can choose to disallow collateral that embodies this risk, as some have argued, or accept the compromise that with PSM fees we can effectively regulate the potential risk these tokens represent. This would be an improvement to regulatory capture risk over our USDC-PSM vault, where we charge no fees. My own view is that:  MKR holders (today) effectively already accept holding on-chain centralized crypto vaults (Category 2 in Chris\u2019 framework below) MOMC will effectively regulate the % exposure to optimize ALM for DAI maturity (as well as Category 3 exposure to short-term bonds, which can and should exist contiguously to this collateral type) The permissionless design aims to minimize human interaction and make it possible to reduce potential liability and hypothetical regulatory scrutiny in the same way  Then, within Category 2 types of collateral, it is actually a meaningful improvement in resilience over USDC and WBTC in a more favorable jurisdiction:  No blacklisting or whitelisting functions in the smart contract Jurisdiction of choice is among the most forward thinking for crypto in the whole world with very strong property rights Bankruptcy-remote custodian structure safeguards collateral in the event of the tokenizer ceasing business     MIP6: Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets Collateral Onboarding   The key categories are:  On-chain decentralized crypto vaults (i.e. ETH) On-chain centralized crypto vaults (i.e. USDC, WBTC) Off-chain vaults (all RWA, bonds, etc)    EDIT: Will add,     dbkcan:  For these reasons I personally don\u2019t believe we should be green-lighting this proposal.   At greenlight stage this discussion is premature. The collateral type answers a need MKR holders have expressed and does it in a permissionless and on-chain way that minimizes risk to the protocol. Should any of your concerns materialize in practice, I could agree with you to halt domain work or reject onboarding polls. My view is that at this stage, token holders should approve the greenlight to explore further, which is what the poll is asking for. ",

It seems like you are suggesting here - that MOMC will set the rates to ensure that it is effectively a 1 sided market so we can be sure that we are earning an income? Perhaps you can clarify ? Maybe a better approach is to create a collateral vault like for WBTC and get the oracles for liquidation etc working appropriately first before trying to make markets for this in the PSM ? It would be interesting to get @Risk-Core-Unit 's view on how they would treat this collateral or would you expect @Real-World-Finance to complete this risk assessment \u2026 In fact - this begs the question if we are not willing to complete a regular collateral vault for this asset - does it make sense until that is done to even offer it through the psm ?     adcv:  We incur this risk already with WBTC and USDC. This is no different   How can you say no difference - Do WBTC and USDC - have any stated ownership restrictions for the underlying asset ? Correct me if I am wrong but for bIBTA the underlying token has clear upfront restrictions - backed will not issue to US based investors and stated that they will not redeem the tokens for any US investor and/or someone they have not KYCd. So trying to compare this tokenized security with USDC and WBTC, I believe is not a meaningful comparison.     adcv:  Then, within Category 2 types of collateral, it is actually a meaningful improvement in resilience over USDC and WBTC in a more favorable jurisdiction:   Conveniently, you keeping choosing to ignore the key point point that Issuance and Redemption of tokens and the underlying assets is restricted to US investors \u2026 (not the same as USDC/WBTC)     adcv:  My view is that at this stage, token holders should approve the greenlight to explore further, which is what the poll is asking for.   My main concern is that what you want to spend time exploring - potentially requiring resources from other core units - is the most complex possible solution and probably the riskiest solution. To minimize work and effort from other core units - I think if green-lighted - the focus should be on an Oracles Assessment and risk parameters -  before deciding on the best implementation - which if MIP21 is not an option would be a regular collateral vault, psm, or some custom technology.

Perhaps you can clarify ?   To be explicit: high tout rates should effectively price for risk and close arbitrage opportunities outside of the price + tout range. Getting a @Real-World-Finance view as well as @Risk-Core-Unit on this would be super interesting imo to understand the legal context properly, but open to suggestions.     dbkcan:  How can you say no difference - Do WBTC and USDC - have any stated ownership restrictions for the underlying asset ?   USDC has an active blacklist that bricks the token. If an EOA is in the US it theoretically cannot actually be stopped from holding bIBTA and trading it to a liquid buyer who is able to KYC. They might not be able to redeem bIBTA, but neither could someone if they failed to clear regulatory processes in the US to onboard at Circle or BitGo. So it\u2019s really just a difference of degree - in which bIBTA has theoretically fewer restrictions of degrees of freedom as it can trade fully permissionlessly.     dbkcan:  I think if green-lighted - the focus should be on an Oracles Assessment and risk parameters - before deciding on the best implementation   I would ultimately agree with the approach where domain work is the only way to really find out the risks and implications of a proposed solution.

I would actually say it is the easiest and safest RWA solution. Modification to be made to the PSM are not that complex. The proposition of a PSM is really just to get the understanding, it is mainly a was to passively buy and sell assets (opposite of DSSKiln). Such a tool is key to MakerDAO no matter what. The MIP6 explicitly says \u201cthe exact implementation is to be determined in the assessment phase\u201d). It doesn\u2019t need a legal structure which is complex by definition. All legal structure are complex to work with governance (complex as humans in the mix). Here, governance just have to set parameters. Very easy. A legal review will be needed, but that\u2019s the same thing for any RWA. Except this one unlock all public markets. The key part of the work is indeed on the oracle side. I guess there is significant work there, but also significant opportunity. @NikKunkel can provide guidance here if he wants. Notice we can also start with a degraded version without oracles (DSValue managed by governance, same as all others RWA). I encourage you to provide alternatives. I\u2019ve spent considerable amount of time finding better solutions but couldn\u2019t (yet I will continue to look for them). To go back to profitability, in my view, MIP65 and this MIP6 are key. Nothing a $40M/year workforce can\u2019t handle. ",

Nobody in Strategic Finance has any economic link with Backed Finance AG or any of its related parties and do not stand to gain personally from this deal in any way you could possibly imagine. Call me naive but of course there is always the potential for MKR token value appreciation should this collateral type eventually be onboarded, which we are ultimately incentivized by and believe this is the point. Similarly, Backed Finance does not own, to our knowledge, any meaningful amount of MKR tokens and is therefore unable to influence voting outcomes, which comes as a refreshing change. We are passionate about this proposal because of the promise that it holds for our ability to manage our PSM exposure in a permissionless way with minimal human interaction.

There has been push back from some sectors.

The regulatory strategy Backed has adopted, since the project\u2019s inception, was to be fully compliant with the minimal amount of regulatory burden, as more (unnecessary) licenses generate costs, and that, eventually, is paid by the market. We do not avoid regulation in any way, but have no desire to overdo it. I don\u2019t know where you got the 2-3 people input, which is really far from the truth. As this point is beyond the legal/professional issue, it generates a strong sense of a hidden agenda in your position, and I am not sure this serves either the discussion or the MakerDAO community. If there is any new input or concern, we would be happy to address those, but as far as the above mentioned topics, I don\u2019t see much substance any longer.  ",

Once the MM is onboarded, we will ask for their permission to share their info (some MM prefer not to be publicly known). As per exchanges, we are having ongoing discussions with a few. CEXs are in a much more sensitive position, as they \u201cown\u201d the retail clients, and by selling them securities, they might be considered as making an offering (not always, but the risk exists). It seems that in Europe CEXs still have some work to do before they can list securities, but outside Europe (and obviously the US) discussions are progressing nicely. We do not want to create false expectations, so forgive me for not namedropping, but we are talking basically with major exchanges, and many smaller ones as well. As per your last question about our plans - we cannot launch without at least one onboarded MM, which is now in process. Once this is done, we will be ready, and will launch, probably in a gradual manner, first in smaller issuance series and once convinced all works as planned, we will be ready to issue larger values. In principle, all this should be complete before MakerDAO has a change to finalize the onchain voting. ",

I do understand that Maker might need to accept additional risk in return for yield and diversification from UDSC exposure. However, it seems that this asset will take weeks to liquidate well because we\u2019d have to ask Backed Finance to sell the tokens for the underlying ETF, sell the ETF for DAI, and hand over the DAI. Would they even do that? Otherwise, we\u2019d have to find a buyer of last resort and quickly, and I think we both know how these deals look when forged under fire. ",

If Maker is the only/largest holder of these tokens, what do we do in an event when we need to liquidate the collateral in the shortest possible order?   So far this MIP6 is considered slow to liquidate mainly because even if we invest at scale (500M) we would still have plenty of USDC in the traditional PSM. The limitation is the balance sheet capacity of the MM (and other KYCed actors) and the speed to create a loop. We had/have the same issue with WBTC in which most of the liquidity is in BTC (it was a concern at the beginning where MakerDAO hold most of the WBTC). Contrary to a crypto-vault, liquidation speed is not a big issue here. It is not really liquidation but selling. This MIP6 provide foundation to move to the very short maturity in a second step. For which IBTA is probably not a good match anyway. ",

Hopefully a decentralized bIBTA/DAI market will emerge on Uniswap to provide a robust and independent source as well. I\u2019d be excited to see what @Oracles-Core-Unit believe is possible as an example of a decentralized and trust-resistant price feed for a traditional financial instrument. Our Oracle team is one of Maker\u2019s key strengths and will be important for the ecosystem as a whole if we can show the way forward with a robust and decentralized solution to bringing price feeds for these types of instruments on-chain. Of course, we would have to evaluate based on feedback from the Oracles team and on the outcome of the domain team work. However, imo, it is worth investigating further. ",

Ownership of these tokens will be illusory, at best, since they can be invalidated or taken from you at any time for any reason.

Probably any structure or system with a centralized element is prone to enforcement risk, or arbitrary/wrong decisions. This applies to security tokens very much as it does to Fiat-backed stablecoins and commodity tokens (such as Gold-pegged), for which a centralized element cannot really be avoided. There is, however, an important (and very much studied, for instance here) stabilizing effect in diversification of risks, thus RWA might also offer volatility protection, and improve the overall utility of the reserve. In addition, the RWA market is significantly larger than the intrinsic crypto market, and injection of RWA could generate growth of the DeFi ecosystem to much bigger scale. In that sense, I believe a portfolio-based approach would improve the resilience of the MakerDAO reserve, even if that means exposing it to some centralized risk. BTW, I think this answer addresses the RWA issue in general, and not this proposal in particular. ",

Throughout the past months, Backed team members have remained in full build mode, and below is a quick peek into our main challenges and accomplishments. Following our initial post in this forum, we faced some headwinds, including financial service provisions in Switzerland and taxation uncertainties for fixed-income products, both of which delayed our time to market. We are excited to announce that we have managed to resolve the logistical hurdles and get clarity on taxation and are now free to issue Backed tokens that track almost any tradable security. In the past months, we have also onboarded our first primary customers, including five professional crypto trading firms, with a few more currently going through the process. Backed has recently achieved an important milestone with the launch of its first product, bCSPX. bCSPX is our ERC-20 tokenized tracker of the popular iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF and can be viewed on Etherscan. We are now preparing to issue our first fixed-income tokenized trackers, bIB01 & bIBTA. We will issue the fixed-income products for a trial period of 1 year. We are thus happy to proceed to the DD phase on the project and products in light of MakerDAO\u2019s continued interest in RWAs. ",

You can find the legal documentation in Backed\u2019s website.

That is true, and particularly, it seems a large proportion of MakerDAO\u2019s RWA are custodied with Swiss banks already. There is no way of owning RWA without a real world custodian somewhere along the way. Even after what happened yesterday, I believe that the Swiss legal system is probably healthier than most others. Not perfect, but neither are others. Comparing this to \u201cregulation through enforcement\u201d as displayed by the US, or an indecisive FCA which allows no regulatory certainty in the UK, the Swiss rule of law is probably still preferable. Possibly, when the MICA regulation becomes effective in the EU we might explore if that is viable option as well, given that regulation is constantly shifting, and projects need to be nimble to stay on top of that moving target.
