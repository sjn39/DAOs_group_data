                    "content": "Preamble:  The explosive growth of the NFT market continues with the recent success of CryptoPunks, Hashmasks, NBA TopShots, and also by attracting the interest of artists and art lovers. The recent chatter on Crypto Twitter, Clubhouse, and other social media outlets leads experts to believe that NFT are here to stay and it will drive the growth of this ecosystem. Context and Motivation Not only is the NFT chatter about how Hashmasks raised over $15M+, but it\u2019s also coming from Sneaker Designers, Musicians, Digital Content Artist, Creative Consultants, and underground Art Curators. If we take the narrative that the next Sneaker (shoes) Designer will have exposure to Trade Finance because of the need to maintain & finance their supply chain, protocols like Centrifuge will benefit tremendously as they already issuing NFTs via contracts that mint an ERC20 Token (DROP & TIN) that represent a security in an RWA pool. As we all know, Centrifuge Chain supports the ChainSafe Bridge Pallet which enables users to securely move assets between Centrifuge Chain and Ethereum. With the recent rise in Ethereum Transaction Costs, many protocols are already working on building a Layer 2 solution, including Compound who is building Compound.Cash, Uniswap with it\u2019s innovative move to a Layer 2 solution and Vitalik Buterin calling on Power Users to Move to Layer 2 Scaling. Maker Community it is no secret that Layer 2 Scaling is more than 12 months away for MakerDAO. In fact, with the Load of Work that the current Core Units have on their plate, and the fact that we Do Not have a Layer 2 Core Unit (it would take 3-6 months to onboard) tells us that we must improvise. And the way we extemporize is by prioritizing the onboarding Centrifuge into the Maker Ecosystem. It is my opinion that these Real World Asset Founders will have a need to use Maker via Centrifuge\u2013by using a Product that is very powerful. And that product is staring right at us. I ask you, Maker Community\u2013to push forward the ability for this DAO to push forward and onboard Centrifuge as soon as possible. But Dude\u2026 Why did you need to wake up on a Monday Morning and Ramble about Prioritizing Centrifuge as a Layer 2?? Over the weekend I was overexposed by the appearances of Stani Kulechov the AAVE founder who is a brilliant mind. Not only is he perhaps the second most popular figure in the Ethereum Community ( behind Vitalik), but the man gets things done. He is a great ambassador of Ethereum. And I don\u2019t know how he manages to get it done\u2013and it does not matter\u2013but I can tell you that I am he is positive when it comes to making shit happen. I can also tell you that he publicly said that he is talking to Centrifuge about onboarding their NFTs into AAVE. Meaning that we Maker Community, perhaps we are falling asleep at the wheel? So, I ask\u2013do you want to innovate Maker Community? Or, do you want to play second fiddle? ",

Tinlake, the set of smart contracts that is issuing the TIN & DROP tokens that are then used as collateral, is running on Ethereum and thus unfortunately can\u2019t help with scaling a lot of this stuff just yet. This is coming soon though  But I look at these pools as a different kind of scalability solution; it allows Maker to scale on a governance level; bundling different loans means you can look at the portfolio risk of dozens of assets instead of having to make a decision for every single NFT. That\u2019s the crux with borrowing against any NFT no matter if it\u2019s a Hashmask or an invoice. ",

People are still looking carefully at how the L2 landscape is playing out.   While there are a lot of issues what I am looking at is the L2 bridging network behind the scenes.  So I am watching carefully to see which L2 players look to be L2 back end hubs between other L2 networks, as I think these will be the places where infrastructure should and will appear. Cities grow where there is an intersection of roads and business.  I believe the same thing will happen in L2/sidechains when hubs start to appear. Frankly while I can say I am not up to speed on the entirety of the L2/sidechain space, and many names have been mentioned, this is the first time I have heard of Centrifuge as a L2 player. With Maker DAI growth I honestly wonder if Maker shouldn\u2019t be putting a L2 analyst team together, as I have been asking different communities who is interested in putting together a L2/sidechain report (as in a matrix of the different L2/chains against a list of features, speed, tx cost, EVM compatibility, bridges, etc.) and then ranking the candidates in terms of attractiveness, growth, likelihood to be a major player etc.  I think this one thing (a report providing a matrix of features and some kind of rankings on L2s) would be an excellent first goal for such a group rather than people just tossing out L2/sidechains as their favorite targets. Lets get a team together, do some research, have a discussion and then figure out how to move forward.   In this vein any suggestions of any L2/sidechain are premature and lack a proper perspective imho. ",

Yes, there will be an L2 solution for voting after Liquidations 2.0 has been released. But as far for opening vaults\u2013looking at 12 months + IMO. The comparison for Centrifuge Chain as an L2, is based on the idea that it is built on parity substrate that allows folks to purchase NFTs of DROP and TIN tokens with DAI. meaning it will be less expensive to have access to Decentralized Finance.  The fact that NFTs are  peoples minds, will make it easier for them to want to purchase the DROP and TIN NFTs. Hopefully that makes sense. Now I will say\u2013I am not sure if using the Bridge from Ethereum to Centrifuge Chain will be inexpensive, as tonight I saw one of our community members trying to cross back over to Ethereum from Avalanche:  Maybe @spin can provide more colour on how the bridge back and forth would work for Ethereum to Centrifuge, estimated gas cost, etc. Apparently the AVA team said: \u201cThis is because of Ethereum. The bridge contract for deposits has complex logic. When you initiate an Avalanche \u2192 Ethereum transfer, you have to pay 5 relayers the Ethereum gas fees to initiate a deposit on Ethereum.\u201d     MakerMan:  With Maker DAI growth I honestly wonder if Maker shouldn\u2019t be putting a L2 analyst team together, as I have been asking different communities who is interested in putting together a L2/sidechain report (as in a matrix of the different L2/chains against a list of features, speed, tx cost, EVM compatibility, bridges, etc.) and then ranking the candidates in terms of attractiveness, growth, likelihood to be a major player etc.   Yes, this is something I am 100% sure has been investigated by the Maker Foundation Teams. However, with the quest to be fully decentralized, this will not be a priority IMO, in the near-term. But hopefully I will be wrong. In the meantime\u2013why not take advantage of our resources and partners who are innovating, like Centrifuge? BTW:  ",
