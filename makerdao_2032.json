                    "content": "When we started the Core Unit model, we were a bit unsure of how it would go due to the complexity of having processes and coordination between teams in a DAO. However, as we began working together, we quickly realized the benefits of sharing knowledge and resources. We were able to pool our collective expertise and work towards what\u2019s best for Maker. Although we still have a lot to improve, and the Endgame comes with a new framework, during 2022, we learned how to work together with all Maker actors: community, delegates, and CUs. Examples of this collaborative work can be seen in our most significant achievements as a DAO:  The onboarding of RWAs in Maker, thanks to the work of RWA, @strat-fin-core-unit , @collateral-core-unit  allowed us to position Maker\u2019s success story as the bridge between CeFi and DeFi. We successfully presented the story through press releases, interviews, commentary, and bylines, bringing Maker to big mainstream media such as Yahoo Finance, TIME, Bloomberg, Benzinga, NASDAQ, etc. Thanks to the collab between SF and us, we created a new line of revenue for Maker through the PSM We have been working with @Protocol-Engineering  to improve the integration of our products (like Teleport and DSR) to make them more straightforward for our partners. We also have sponsored grants to promote its integration. We have been working with @Risk-Core-Unit  to onboard new crypto-collaterals in the protocol like GNO, and to provide support to the main vault owners. We worked with @data-insights-cu  on the first campaign for vault owners, the Nature campaign. To extend the impact of Maker\u2019s achievements, we brought Twitter and LinkedIn back to life! That allowed us to work with all MakerDAO, especially @GovAlpha-Core-Unit , on the Twitter announcement of everything happening in Maker Governance.  We also collaborated with CUs to improve our experience as Maker Contributors, by organizing the MKR dinners of the year with @gov-comms-core-unit  (Thanks Clau and layer, for helping us with the last one). And also to improve our partners\u2019 experience with Maker, thanks to EventsCU and StrategicHappiness. Thanks all MakerDAO, for this fantastic/crazy year. And remember to check our Transparency Dashboard. In there you will find the key metrics across different functions of Growth\u2019s core unit.  What we did during the year     North America  PSM marketing incentive  In collaboration with Strategic Finance, a PSM strategy was developed to generate revenue on stablecoins in the PSM. This provides a new revenue stream for the protocol and helps stablecoin issuers gain more exposure into DeFi via Maker. The Coinbase USDC Institutional rewards proposal (MIP81) and the Gemini Marketing Initiative sparked new proposals from CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP86) OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) 1 and most recently Yearn. While the Maker protocol revenue has decreased due to less vault activity and stability fees generated, this strategy can deliver new revenue. Coinbase rewards rate in 2023 offers 2.36% = $37M in potential annual revenue. Gemini rate 1.25% on 500M GUSD DC = $6.2M potential annual revenue from fees.  Institutional vaults & D3M  We developed the concept of an institutional vault based on feedback from some partners who were seeking to borrow DAI at fixed rates (mainly in 2021 market conditions). Their goals last year and early 2023 were to use DAI towards DeFi yield or swap to dollars to service other borrowers and lenders. The decline in the market, which resulted in lower Defi yields and appetite for leverage, impacted the demand for this type of product. Additionally, many of the target users (in the US) faced severely negative impacts from the events with 3AC, Terra Luna and FTX. During the product development cycle, feedback from potential institutional vault users was that having to over collateralize a vault to reach a 200M DAI mint requirement, was a friction point because it tied up assets they could otherwise put to use. While it was never intended to provide under collateralized vaults for these users, it\u2019s become abundantly clear how resilient Maker is because it does require overcollateralization. Earlier this spring we explored a model to use the D3M with partners like Maple and TrueFi to enable DAI lending in specified borrower pools on their platforms. This appeared to be an opportunity to earn potentially attractive rates while also providing loans to approved borrowers such as market makers who could help us with DAI liquidity on target L1/2s. While we worked collaboratively with our partners on devising a solution that met the standards of Makers risk profile, we learned through the ideation process that the timing and mechanics to execute were not ready for Makers needs.  L1/2 landscape  Teleport on Arbitrum and Optimism has helped DAI usability on these important ecosystems. We recently submitted a proposal on Optimism to participate in their grants rewards program. If approved by their community, the campaign will incentivize usage of DAI within native Optimism dapps (and other key dapps) to help bring and keep users on Optimism while using DAI.  We worked with Avalanche to activate AVAX rewards onto Aave v3 resulting in DAI supply increasing from 129M to 477M in 1 day of turning AVAX rewards on earlier this summer. Umee added support and promotion of DAI on via the gravity bridge Completed collaboration with Axelar Network to enhance DAI usage and liquidity through cross promotion and other initiatives Hashport added support for DAI making it the 1st stablecoin supported on their bridge We successfully presented a proposal in the Agoric forum (Cosmos L1) to include DAI in their IST-PSM Co-promote Moonbeam based stable base pool with DAI Worked with JetDAO community to add support for DAI   Europe  RWA  RWA was a big focus area for Europe this year with three reference cases integrated in the year. The amount of work that goes into these Transactions both in the design and implementation phases is immense as have been the learnings we have taken from each experience and will look to apply in further scaling our RWA portfolio efficiently moving forward. SG-Forge vault was set up and they have recently conducted a penny test transaction paving the way to scale this in early 2023 and fully use the 30million DAI facility. Monetalis went live with MIP65 and has already hit its debt ceiling of 500million DAI which we expect will be a significant revenue driver for the protocol moving forward and also act as a reference structure for future RWA implementations. In partnership with Centrifuge and ConsolFreight we were able to integrate MakerDao DeFi financing into the Mastercard provenance blockchain and run a successful Trade Finance pilot. Events in and concern with the wider crypto industry mean we will not be immediately scaling this initiative, however it has demonstrated the potential for DeFi to disrupt the multi trillion dollar Trade Finance segment.  DeFi  In the crypto native DeFi segment we have seen progress on both the supply side and demand side of our ecosystem. On the supply side; We happily concluded the collateral onboarding for both RocketPool rETH and Gnosis GNO . With both of these partners discussions have been in progress since the beginning of the year and the collateral onboarding , initially with relatively small debt ceilings, can be viewed as merely a first step of a bigger strategic partnership with new opportunities with both RocketPool and Gnosis to be further developed through 2023. On the demand side where we see the bulk of our partner integrations ; the marketing campaign we ran with Argent set a benchmark for how we can effectively drive DAI demand ( every DAI spent resulted in 17 DAI on-ramped to the wallet ) and something we will look to expand on especially to drive L2 adoption on zksync and StarkNet where Argent have a leading position.  Events  We saw a lot of activity in the European region with MakerDAO representation at Events this year and participation in multiple panels both at the crypto native events of ETH Amsterdam, Paris and Lisbon. But also in Podcasts, University Blockchain events and at the more institutional focused events including London Token2049 and various other privately hosted institutional crypto events mostly in London with its large number of Financial Market firms curious to learn more about the DeFi ecosystem. A definite learning has been how much more effective the smaller and thematic focused events are, ie. partner dinners or theme focused events ( ie. RWA, layer 2 ) and we will apply these learnings as we choose which events we participate in / sponsor in 2023.  APAC  CeFi  We have partnered with many Asia based exchanges, including Binance, and some local exchanges in Indonesia (like Pintu with more than 4 million users) and Philippines (like Coins.ph with more than 7 million monthly active users) to promote DAI usage. We worked with Binance to launch Argentina\u2019s Binance Card DAI campaign. This campaign was designed to promote the use of DAI as a payment method in Argentina and customers who used the Binance Card could purchase goods and services with DAI at more than 100 participating merchants. DAI was the first stablecoin to be whitelisted in Japan, meaning DAI is the only stablecoin that is allowed by JFSA to be listed on Japanese exchanges. DAI is currently listed on GMO coin and Coinbest.  Institutional Vaults  AntAlpha\u2019s Signal request to further investigate the possibility of implementing the first IV passed at the end of May. We are still working with Antalpha team now to explore a smaller retail vault to start because of the market volatility. There are also some feedbacks we gathered from potential IV leads after the market crash in May, that is borrowers are now looking for:  Low-risk and stable yield; Better yield on DAI, i.e. they would hold DAI if it gives them a relatively credit-risk-free yield; Fixed stability fees might help them better predict interest rates and cash flows. DeFi  As for DeFi partnerships, we are in conversations with the Polygon team to discuss potential deployment on their zkEVM testnet and include it in Maker\u2019s multichain strategy. We worked with Instadapp to launch a DAI-lite vault - a Dai Vault integration that allows users to start earning yield on their DAI with one single click. The current TVL of the DAI-lite vault is 2.4mill. On Arbitrum, we have the largest dApp integrated DAI, and there is about 25mill in the DAI pool as of writing. We also worked with vivid.money, a dApp with over 500k users.  Events  We gained a few speaking opportunities at some of the region\u2019s largest fintech events and blockchain events and conferences, such as the Singapore Fintech Festival, Token2049, and several other online conferences such as GeckoCon.  Brand  We run Nature, our first branding campaign with a meaningful initiative \u2014 trees and POAPs for all Maker users! As result, we planted 125 trees in M\u00e9xico to support butterflies\u2019 habitat and distributed 444 POAPs to Maker Vault owners. We hired a visual design agency to start creating visual assets for our social media content strategy and our official announcements. According to our social media results, we realized that our posts with Maker-aligned visual assets got better results in terms of engagement. We created videos, infographics, recurring banners, and GIFs. We hired the PR agency Wachsman for a proactive PR campaign. Alongside PR, Wachsman also did PR training for members within the DAO. We took part in Twitter spaces, and podcasts and reached a broad list of media outlets to showcase and promote MakerDAO\u2019s endeavours. We took ownership of MakerDAO\u2019s Twitter and LinkedIn activities, delivering impressive growth in brand engagement and followers. We ran campaigns with Argent and Binance Card in Argentina to reach everyday users. These campaigns provided us with valuable data to help form future campaign strategies. We ran our first out-of-home advertising in Devcon, Bogota which received a lot of positive messages.   Pipeline progression    The general outline of our traditional cycle consists of the following phases: Outreach \u2192 Initial conversations \u2192 Project formalization and commitment \u2192 Activation support (technical or marketing support) \u2192 Integration Go-Live (deal closed) \u2192 Maintenance and growth. During FY22, we closed 83 integrations and made 51 Marketing activations with partners across various verticals and regions. As in previous years, most closed integrations are in DeFi (58%), and most Tier-one integrations are CeFi companies (71%). Below is the breakdown by vertical and Tier type.  image2000\u00d71474 166 KB  This year was important for Maker regarding RWA. With the onboarding of SocGen, HVB, and the Monetalis liquid bond strategy, Maker established itself as the bridge between DeFi and TradFi and allowed us to showcase the power of DAI. We also started doing more DAO-DAO businesses, introducing a new way to negotiate agreements with our partners, bringing more transparency to the table by opening our proposals and working with the community, core teams, and delegates to find the best solution for all participants. Examples of this are HOP and GnosisDAO. Marketing activations were exclusively focused on Tier-one and Tier-two partnerships. Depending on the impact of the integration, these activations consisted of grants for our more relevant partners or announcements on Twitter or media outlets. Each activation with a grant commits to sharing its results, helping us understand the type of grants that are more beneficial to Maker and the ecosystem. Examples of Marketing activations are the ones we did with Argent (DeFi) and Binance (CeFi).  image2000\u00d71264 119 KB  For Next Year, our focus will be:  Supporting the Endgame Plan:  Working on the plan\u2019s renaming and narrative to simplify it. One of the most repeated criticisms of the plan is its complexity, not just for outsiders but also for our community. We know other teams inside Maker are working on making the endgame more accessible for the community. We want to create a redux version of it to make it more accessible for everyone outside Maker and work with the PR Agency to have the support of media outlets in explaining what it is and why it is a game changer for the ecosystem. Identifying potential partners for the Creator and Protector Clusters. Collaborate with the Growth Scope by providing feedback on the Maker and Dai brand and the growth and marketing initiatives.   Promoting integrations with the Maker products: Maker Teleport and DSR  Creating technical solutions to make Maker products easier to integrate Promoting new front ends and consolidated projects to integrate Maker products Educating the community about it   Maintain DAI presence in the main chains, apps, and dapps  To do that, we have been working on Q4-22, so our pipeline for next year will help us to achieve our objectives. Below is the breakdown by the pipeline stage.  image2000\u00d71304 146 KB   B2B Marketing Activations     In 2022, we ran we have some fantastic activation with our partners. Our strategy for these activation has been to double up on any opportunity by co-marketing with our partners. To do this, for every activation campaign, we created messaging groups; this allowed us to time our publishing to match our partners, thus increasing exposure.

Maker\u2019s PR     Media mentions worldwide data  Description: Since June 2022, the brand team has been collecting data on articles mentioning Maker and DAI worldwide. In total, we have gathered a list of 2,014 articles in the media from 70+ countries. Intention: The intention was to gain a better understanding of how far the Maker news travel, and how widespread it is as a brand. Results: The top countries that Maker was mentioned in are the US (43.2%), China (18.1%), Vietnam (5.5%) and Great Britain (3.1%).  image1920\u00d71215 74.5 KB   Maker messaging, narrative, and strategy By focusing our efforts on PR strategy, we had the following goals in our mind:  Grow the number of mentions of MakerDAO and DAI in the media Build stronger relationships with media representatives Go beyond crypto news and get more representation in more mainstream financial media outlets Spread news and announcements directly to news channels, and build a narrative to be followed for consistency.  Through our PR efforts,  We facilitated 30+ interviews and media commentary representing Maker in different formats, channels, and topics. We have raised awareness around Maker as a brand, by increasing exposure to the tech and financial world in more mainstream media (see chart below) We created 3 different boilerplates to align the key message about Maker depending on the topic and sent out press releases for all significant partnerships and votes We facilitated 11 media training for MakerDAO spokespersons from different core units We managed to let the world know that Maker is back, and recapture the attention that Maker is still the DeFi leader. By sending out press releases, and being proactive in commentary, pitching, and interviews - we presented our narrative of Maker - the OG, secure, and reliable DeFi giant making moves.   image1920\u00d71188 49.7 KB   Social Media     Twitter:  Our Twitter strategy focuses on the engagement rate metric, which is the ratio of engagements to impressions. Basically, a higher engagement rate means we\u2019re converting a bigger share of impressions into engagements. In Twitter, engagements are all actions our audience has done on our tweets, such as likes, retweets, comments, saves, shares, clicks, image opens, etc. But, it\u2019s not just about increasing engagement. We also focus on getting our audience to engage with what we would like them to engage with: Maker and Dai. For that reason, our Twitter strategy has been developed based on creating narratives around Maker and Dai with the following types of content:   image1920\u00d7860 131 KB  Since February 2022 (the month we started to manage the MakerDAO Twitter account), these are our metrics:  image2000\u00d71241 166 KB   image1920\u00d71177 67.2 KB   image2000\u00d71221 134 KB   LinkedIn:  Before starting a specific strategy, we run audience analysis for the MakerDAO LinkedIn account. We discovered that most of our audience is connected to Business Development, Software, and Finance job functions, within Technology and Finance industries, with a significant majority located in the United States, United Kingdom, and India. This is very valuable information for directing specific content through LinkedIn.   image2000\u00d71271 147 KB   image2000\u00d71236 153 KB   image1920\u00d71690 78.2 KB   We also conducted a benchmarking analysis to compare MakerDAO\u2019s positioning against the top performing accounts in the crypto space within LinkedIn. Through that benchmarking, we ended up discovering the desired amount of posts per week, a specific method to write posts, and the value of adding visual assets to all our posts.   image2000\u00d7500 146 KB   That being said, our initial approach on LinkedIn is about discovering what types of posts perform better than others while trying to direct our topics to the aforementioned most significant audiences.  Since September 2022 (the month we started to manage the MakerDAO LinkedIn account), these are our metrics:   Note: For the engagement rate chart we take September as a starting point, because in prior months, data shows the engagement rate is considerably higher due to the insignificant amount of impressions versus engagements. As we continue managing the LinkedIn account, we\u2019ll find out how the engagement rate evolves during higher levels of activity.   image2000\u00d71230 128 KB   image2000\u00d71230 120 KB   image2000\u00d71228 106 KB   makerdao.com Restructuring  In August we submitted a proposal to revamp makerdao.com. Our motivation for working on the website was to utilize the domain without a clear proposal fully. The current website is dated, and the information is not up to date. Our aim for the website is to create more commercial appeal, make information easy to access and increase participation. We also wanted to put in place a way for the brand team to create and refresh content as and when needed. Deepwork will help create this on a no-code CMS platform which the brand team can work on. Following the proposal, we hired Deepwork Studios agency to help with the redesign process. The project is fully underway with the final design delivery date expected on the 16th of January. We will arrange sessions to present the designs once they are complete. The brand team with Deepwork had workshops focusing on the key areas.   Workshop 1  Introduction and understanding of brand priorities (through a \u201cHow Might We\u201d Session) Alignment on the mission statement Visual references and research    Workshop 2  Alignment workshop Prioritization of landing page and goals Research of existing solutions Presentation and deciding on visual direction from the style-board    Workshop 3  Ideation workshop Sketching individual solutions Creating a user journey    Workshop 4  Storyboard Workshop Merge all information to prepare for the prototype Presentation of final style-board    Workshop 5  Protocol health design    As per the MIP to wanted to keep CUs involved and update on progress, we provided updates below,  https://www.loom.com/share/f4c7e95199f144f88e6176518ee2439d https://www.loom.com/share/37baa159d71c44b6913e70640654c4d2 https://www.loom.com/share/c3ef012390b240a2a491d5f77774c6cf https://www.loom.com/share/6be32fbd85d640469c4b8ee1957d1f20    We want to hear from you    Share your thoughts, feedback or tips with us in the comments below.

I see twitter and linkedin as core traction channels from social media side, do we also have plans to explore the other channels? Like reddit also I feel community building is very important where we are lagging now and with the introduction of gas less voting this scenario might change, but lets also focus on community building ",

As the Brand team, our work is more focused on increasing awareness and recognition of the Maker brand among our target audience, rather than community building initiatives. We do this by managing various channels, such as LinkedIn and Twitter, which are powerful tools for reaching our target audience and helping us align our efforts with the business development goals of the Growth Core Unit. Our ultimate goal is to position Maker as the top DeFi protocol and DAI as the top decentralized stablecoin in the industry, and we think community building forms part of another layer that has had great traction in separate channels like the Maker Forum and the Discord channel. As part of our work, we\u2019re also exploring new communication channels that could help us with our purpose, but at this point, nothing has been decided yet. It is a research and discovery phase for new channels but as soon as we have any new updates or information we\u2019ll make sure to keep the community updated. ",
