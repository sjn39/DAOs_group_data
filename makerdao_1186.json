                    "content": "      Collateral Onboarding Call #44 |  Kredika AMA  Application Summary Kredika is a purpose built legal framework and technology solution to bring real-world assets (RWA) into the domain of decentralized finance. Kredika has recently submitted a MIP6 application to onboard a UK-based diversified portfolio of property-secured loans as collateral through the use of their ERC20-compliant Kredika Tokens. The solutions enabling the Kredika Tokens are custom built, and aim to provide the highest degree of transparency for underlying collateral on a loan-by-loan level. The team behind Kredika has laid out a 2 stage approach to fully implementing their solution into MakerDAO\u2019s ecosystem. For stage 1, Kredika plans to open a $100M USD institutional vault with the initial focus of comprehensive testing the infrastructure for tokenization and portfolio management. Stage 2 will introduce scaling solutions, and potentially position Kredika as an arranger for other approved participants to build new collateral pools.  Join us Join us 2022-06-08T17:30:00Z as we host the Kredika team to take a deep dive into their MIP6 application and investigate what this opportunity means for MakerDAO. If you\u2019re unable to attend this call but have questions: submit any questions for the AMA on this forum post and our hosts will have them addressed during the session.  We will host:   Max Chmyshuk @Max11 - Co-founder & CEO   Artem Tolkachev @ATolkachev - Co-founder & CIO   Victoria Vaksman - Chairperson   Jon Harrison - CFO & Head of Credit    Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by the Kredika team Community Q&A   [MIP6] Pilot Vault for a portfolio of bridging loans secured with UK-based properties    With the initial implementation, we are requesting access to a \u00a3100m institutional vault to mint DAI against Kredika ERC-20 tokens issued on the Ethereum mainnet and representing a senior claim over a portfolio of bridging loans secured with full legal charges over UK-based properties with an average loan-to-value (LTV) of 75%. The loans will be originated, serviced, and monitored by an FCA-regulated portfolio manager Yes Growth Ltd. First \u00a3100min liquidity for the conversion of DAIs into USD/GBP was confirmed to us by one of the authorised Swiss banks which is happy to support our project. We consider this implementation as the first step in developing the Kredika platform for accommodating multiple asset managers and growing capacity to \u00a3500 million and beyond.
