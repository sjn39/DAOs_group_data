The amounts under _Payment_ have been set accordingly, as was the multiplier under _Sources and Data_.   Sentence Summary This is an offboarding proposal for the GovComms Core Unit that includes both a golden parachute and retroactive MKR compensation.  Specification  Core Unit ID COM-001  Motivation MakerDAO is restructuring in accordance with the Endgame Plan. With the rejection of our last budget proposal, we\u2019ve been advised by the leading delegates that work related to our mandate would be better executed as an ecosystem actor or as an in-house function within other stakeholder groups. The rejection of our budget proposal did not come with a complementary offboarding proposal, so we are putting it up ourselves. This core unit should be formally offboarded to support the transition, formalize the status of the team, and provide any \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation and retroactive benefits due to contributors.  Facilitator With the offboarding of this Core Unit, the offboarding of the Facilitator is implied.  Deliverables and Responsibilities Administrative responsibilities:  Managing relationships with our accounting and payroll service providers Managing the Operational Multisig Managing the Continuous Operations Multisig Participation in the Ambassador Program as a multisig signer Paying invoices Publishing monthly financials  Active programs:  Calendars  Calls Votes and Important Dates   Call Support  Attendance tracking Banners/Thumbnails Hosting Summaries Slide Decks Strategy   Communication Platform Stewardship  Forum Moderation Subreddit Moderation Forum Information Architecture Design Tag correction   Emergency Communications Support  Pager Duty Coordination w/TECHOPs Emergency Playbook   Stakeholder Alignment  Participate in Decentralized Operations Initiative Host Monthly Collateral Management Initiative Planning Host Monthly Security Initiative Planning   Stakeholder Content  Aggregated Monthly CU Updates Weekly Relay Weekly Forum Recap   Stakeholder Database Stakeholder Notices  Vault Offboarding Notices as required by MIP62   Trackers  External  All Available Dashboards Tracker All Available Guides Tracker Office Hours Tracker Initiatives Tracker Discord Server Tracker Publications Tracker   Internal  Call Support Tracker Current Events Tracker Services and Owners Tracker Offboarding Checklist Publications Tracker DAO Accounts for Zoom Event-Specific Trackers for Attendees, Speakers, and Resources       Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Work The active facilitator, @Davidutro, will execute the unwinding of the Core Unit with expected completion by the end of January 2023.  Administrative responsibilities   The last contributor invoices will be paid in the first week of January. Financial statements for both December and January will be published. An agreement will be made with accountable to administer the severance package in February, assuming this proposal passes. All excess funds will be returned from AccountAble and the Operational Multisig. The Continuous Operations Multisig will have its funds returned. An agreement will be made for the ambassador program multisig to replace us. We will verify that all intangible assets are appropriately licensed and that any transferable assets be transferred to the appropriate parties.   Active Programs   Following the budget rejection, we worked with the GovAlpha Core Unit to transition the critical and most valuable parts of our work. We are on track to close or transition all of our work by the end of December.   Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Funds  One-time expense associated with unwinding  2x $350 offboarding charges from the payroll provider Severance Packages for full-time team members Retroactive MKR benefit compensation January compensation for Facilitator January expense for accounting & payroll services   Golden Parachute These amounts will be transferred through the Executive Vote that follows the ratification of this proposal, contingent upon the completion of the Core Unit\u2019s unwinding as signified by the successful transition of work items, return of all excess funds, publication of all financials, and the closure of the continuous operations multisig.     Detail Amount (DAI)     3 months of Facilitator Compensation & Healthcare costs 35950   3 months of PM Compensation & Healthcare costs 24750   Total 60700     Retroactive MKR Compensation  Summary Govcomms did not prioritize getting an MKR compensation package in place early on. Instead, we decided to prioritize our actual work while waiting to see if a preferred standard would emerge by the end of the year. That never happened and so we planned to publish our proposal, modeled after GovAlpha\u2019s, for RFC in December 2022, so it could be voted on in January, in time for what would have been our first 1-year cliff vest in February(under the GovAlpha model). Since the Core Unit has been defunded, we added our retroactive MKR compensation here as a part of our offboarding. During the RFC period of this proposal, we polled recognized delegates about their preference for paying out in MKR or the DAI equivalent value, DAI equivalent value won.  Formula MKR Compensation will be derived based on the salary earned within the Core Unit during the retroactive eligibility period. This proposal would compensate team members in MKR in the amount of  80%, 100%, or 120% multiplied by the DAI earned during the eligibility period divided by the moving average of MKR over the eligibility period to derive the MKR token amount for each contributor. MKR amount = DAI earned x multiplier% / $1737.12 DAI Eqivalent = MKR amount x current price  Sources and Data Current Price - Approximate price on 12-26-2022 $550.00 Eligibility Period - From inception to last day of approved budget: August 1st, 2021 through December 31st, 2021 Lockup - Determined during the RFC period. None. MKR Moving Average - Is derived from the \u201cClose\u201d price on CoinGecko (latest data point per day, UTC), taking the average closing price for that eligibility period. See spreadsheet for data. Price: $1737.12 Multiplier% - Determined by the proposal\u2019s on-chain vote result. TBD Token - Token used for the payout was determined during the RFC period.

I\u2019m so pleased we had a chance to meet in person at ETHDenver early in my Delegate work for ACREinvest. @Davidutro you are an OG here and have been so loyal and concerned for MakerDAO and all its people inside the community and the wider world. The viscous cruelty with which this moment has arrived is a stain and a shame on this community, among other recent examples. It is a disgrace for people in governance and who flaunt their prominence and power such as @flipflopflapdelegate to try and shame you when they have had all transparency, cooperation and compliance FROM you regarding the rules of the road. In particular you have been persistent and consistent in asking for feedback, direction and input the entire time ACREinvest has been a part of this community. Our impression is that rarely has anything constructive been forthcoming in a manner and time that would have allowed you and your team even a chance to course correct or navigate to a better outcome than this. People critical of compensation or whatever details need to humble themselves enough to do some actual research as to why what particular facts are what they are and what responsibility lies where and with whom. We regret the process unfolding here and abdication by many in power here of an ethical duty to show empathy and basic human kindness. That said, I am excited for you and team who have enormous talent and fortitude. You will prosper in whatever you decided to do next. When one door closes, another one opens. Best regards, Kianga ",

He\u2019s been what I\u2019ve seen to be a solid constant in the project ever since, and his departure would certainly mark the end of an era in my opinion. Regarding the compensation, MKR holders and delegates should once again remember that everyone \u201cworking\u201d for the DAO is doing so as a contract arrangement and so much of the comp to individuals is lost to business and compliance overhead. To second csmith\u2019s point, you\u2019ve all voted to dilute us anyways, so I\u2019m not sure the reason to be penurious with a long-time fixture of the DAO. Regarding GovComms, I\u2019m generally pretty busy with my own role, and don\u2019t have time to troll forums all day. Having David and Artem separate the wheat from the chaff and summarize the happenings in weekly gov calls has been one of the primary ways I\u2019ve been able to keep my finger on the pulse. I will notice it\u2019s absence. I want to thank them for their work on the project and I hope that this isn\u2019t the end of our future collaboration. ",

This is an attempt at figuring out the fairness of providing a \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d to those Core Unit members that need to evolve into the Endgame. It\u2019s about protecting MakerDAO and the need to send a clear message that this DAO is not a Cash Grab. And again, we are not stating that GovComms is doing a cash grab move here\u2014but as you All know by now, MakerDAO will Pivot to the Endgame State. This isn\u2019t the END for David and Artem. I believe they\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to blossom. As far as I can tell they can be added by as Free Agents by ANY Core Unit, or recruited to serve in clusters. They can also adopt as an ecosystem actor, councils, tribunals, or become a Governance SubDAO. This isn\u2019t their last dance. Myself as a MKR token owner, I will always put MakerDAO first. And while you @csmith perhaps think that Recognized Delegates are over paid \u2014 remember that the first pawns to fall will be Recognized Delegates when push comes to shove. Just remember that when you think the money is what motivates me and I\u2019m willing to be the first soldier in the firing line. ",

People have plans, families, commitments in the offchain world. DAOs are competing for the workforce with the corporate world. DeFi already has a reputation of a roller coaster in terms of job security. One of the key goals of the Endgame is to attract the new generation of qualified delegates and builders. People are already taking risks connecting their lives to the nascent field like DeFi. An organisation culture with soldiers and the firing line is not conducive for the DAO\u2019s sustainable growth.

As we spoke about it during the Delegate Office Hours the entire CU off-boarding process has been a nightmare since inception. Perhaps the next best approach should be to have the community come together and figure out a process that works best for everyone.Otherwise, off-boardings will continue to be a painful experience as market conditions could potentially deteriorate further.     pvl:  anybody can be in their shoes at any given moment.

The time has now come for us to commit the next few months to collective, pragmatic, workshop-based approaches to solving these questions. Maker\u2019s future situation cannot be predicted; thus, the final decision may remain difficult for both parties. The fact that a DAO this large has developed \u2018decentralized\u2019 points of view is not surprising, but it is not necessarily a bad thing (looking beyond the current example). There are a number of challenges and targets on everyone\u2019s plate, but we are actually fortunate to have the opportunity to work together at any time, on any day, from anywhere, hand in hand, to achieve bulls-eye solutions. The answer may lie somewhere in the middle, or it may not. This cannot and should not be decided by any single individual. Our membership in a DAO should not prevent us from working together as a strong community. Anyhow, there are still a few Delegate office hours left, and I suggest they be utilized now more than ever.

I can tell you as an American that I personally would choose DAI as retroactive compensation, as it has a tax advantage and allows you to keep your MKR versus having to liquidate to pay for any vested capital gains when reporting such. With that in mind\u2014since the DAO does not have an off-boarding policy and I am not an attorney, nor do I have real-world life experience working for a Human Resources department\u2014I reached out to some personal contacts that have real-life  experience in these matters. I was provided several opinions for severances/\u201cgolden parachutes\u201d, and the unusual usage of \u201cretroactive pay\u201d which in the real-world means you owe money to an employee for services performed under an employee contract. As you might realize \u2014 some folks in the real world can\u2019t comprehend what we do here in a DAO\u2014it was difficult to explain this situation. I was provided the opinion that an employee without a vesting stock plan or employee contract does not constitute an employer providing retroactive pay. I was told that in certain instances, some companies may choose to accelerate unvested stock options, or to extend the post-termination exercise period, as a \u201cgoodwill gesture\u201d.  I was also provided the opinion that perhaps a 3 month non-contractual retroactive pay would be a nice goodwill gesture for this instance. However, doing the above might set a bad precedent, or because a real-world organization can incur \u201csignificant accounting charges\u201d by modifying the stock option grants\u2014this is widely avoided. So, I don\u2019t claim to have all the right answers\u2014because if you provide this CU 100%, 200%, etc., does that mean every contributor should also get the same treatment? And if an offboarded employees walk away with large bonuses/retroactive benefits and then cluster into the endgame to earn more from MakerDAO is that fair to CUs that will still around for the next 12-months? I don\u2019t know @csmith \u2014 I\u2019m trying my best to figure it out. Please understand that Flip Flop Flap Delegate is only 1 of 21 recognized delegates and MKR token owners who can decide what is the right metric. And again, I never claim to have the right answers\u2014I\u2019m doing the best I can with the limited resources that I have\u2014knowing that one day I\u2019ll be in the same position, as we are All working on limited time. Nothing last forever. This I can assure you. ",

The average Director, Corporate Communications salary in the United States is $118,387 as of , but the salary range typically falls between $105,285 and $131,398. - source - Salary.com  The golden parachute is fair since other offboarded Core Units used 3 months of compensation as their standard. The retroactive compensation is fair given the packages that have been granted to other Core Units. (Full list - https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/list?search=$%20%23mkr-budget) So yes, the compensation is high. That was the cost of retaining Core Units as agreed by the DAO in all of these cases. It would be easier and less rewarding to get traditional jobs. Instead, we all embarked on the risky adventure of running independent teams at the DAO in public, with MKR token ownership as a part of our incentive. I think there is a reason why the DAO chose to reward teams in this way and it shouldn\u2019t be lost in the conversation. ",

Davidutro:  How much does a Director, Corporate Communications make in the United States?   Director of Corporate communications is generally assumed to be a role requiring something like 7+ years of corporate communications experience and a few years of experience managing teams. You had 1 year, maybe 2?, of experience prior to the CU (or at least this is what emerged when you presented your CV) and no significant management experience. So yeah, I suspect in a traditional company your profile would have been more realistically this:   Salary.com    Corporate Communications Associate Salary | Salary.com The average Corporate Communications Associate salary in the United States is $61,807 as of November 23, 2022, but the salary range typically falls between $56,627 and $67,235.          Davidutro:  So yes, the compensation is high. That was the cost of retaining Core Units as agreed by the DAO in all of these cases.   True! The DAO agreed to pay \u201cabove market\u201d prices (also in your case) because:  we were in the middle of a bull market, and indeed, working for a DAO carries additional risks like lack of security of the position in the middle-long (or even short) terms, legal risks, etc.  The high salaries provided an acceptable (for both MakerDAO and CUs) compromise covering all these risks. Now, if your CU is being off-boarded, well, you should look at it as part of the risk which has already been accounted for in the compensation package.     Davidutro:  The severance golden parachute is fair since other offboarded Core Units used 3 months of compensation as their standard.   I am not arguing with this point. If it was done for others, why not for you? This is a fair point, imho, and MKR-holders should consider it carefully. ",

                    "content": "I have some thoughts that I\u2019d like to add to this discussion, while also acknowledging that I am one of the above contributors that stands to benefit financially. I\u2019ll also add that the financial benefit would be nice, but wouldn\u2019t likely exceed $2-4,000. Not life changing money by any measure (at least, for me.) I think that the core question being asked here is: What level of retroactive compensation (two parts to this, golden parachute and retroactive back-pay) should David and Artem receive? There are a number of options and opinions provided here, but what I\u2019m not seeing much of is a discussion on what should go into this decision. I\u2019d like to offer the following ideas as a place to start:  Looking at historical patterns and trends for similar offboarding/MKR retroactive compensation. Ideally this is contextualized to CU\u2019s that have done similar type work and/or longevity within the community. Whether or not the team and its members provided valuable support and were regarded in good standing. Whether or not here is evidence that leads of a CU put the DAO above their own financial interests. Commitment and involvement in the DeFi space more broadly.  But, before I get into the above, I\u2019d like to address some points that I consider are being made in an ill-considered manner. I\u2019ll also add that my opinions below are made in the context of my own career - I have over a decade of experience, more than half of it in roles that require me to hire and manage people/teams/functions as well as manage and set budgets for departments.   @iammeeoh David\u2019s work experience prior to joining the community has absolutely no bearing on what his salary offer was, nor should it have been. He was hired into a new, volatile, promising industry based on his passion for it, his ability to network and make powerful connections within it and because he had clear strengths that convinced someone to give him a position as a leader. Especially in David\u2019s case, as an early adopter who landed a role at Maker precisely because he provided clear value before being paid anything. If those in charge of approving his salary deemed it reasonable, then looking BACK at that and saying \u2018he was overpaid\u2019 isn\u2019t fair and entirely misses the point. The onus should be on those setting a salary, not those receiving it. This also creates the potential for people to be punished for advocating for themselves, retroactively, which could ultimately lead to a zero-sum culture. Additionally, if he didn\u2019t do a good job in the role - which by all accounts, even those advocating for a lower compensation package agree that he did - , why was a raise approved? Why were increased budgets for his team, and staff approved?   Compensation itself \u2192 People should be paid based on the job they are doing, not what they were doing before or what someone subjectively \u2018thinks\u2019 they should be making. Organizations usually create a range for what they consider a fair salary for a given position. Clearly David and his team fell in line with that range. The time for deciding whether or not a role had a fair salary range is WAY past due. If anything, there\u2019s an argument to be made here that both David and Artem were pulling in salaries LOWER than they could have commanded elsewhere. Both, because despite their \u2018lack of experience\u2019  they are highly capable and because they are in a high risk industry. People receive incredibly high salaries in crypto, partially because they can get fired or lose so much from the day-to-day. I can only imagine that David\u2019s connections and status within the broader community meant that he was being offered more money elsewhere, which he did not take. (Which as an aside, indicates his commitment to Maker.) a. As a note in favor of parity, I\u2019ll add that there are three other CU\u2019s being offboarded at the moment. There doesn\u2019t seem to be this level of tension in the offboarding proposals for those. I\u2019m curious why not?   Connecting with HR folks here seems both a little pointless and a little biased. Reasonable HR employees will look at these discussions and come up with various opinions, looking at the same information. The problem is that this situation IS NOT comparable to a traditional organization. MakerDao runs in a drastically different way from a traditional corporation and this ultimately becomes an \u2018apples to oranges\u2019 comparison. This is particularly striking in this CU\u2019s case because it specifically chose to not adopt a model for MKR compensation, because it was 1) hoping to see the community come to a consensus and 2) wanted to prove their worth before moving forward with a proposal. Other CUs did so, within an inflated market, to individual financial benefit (this is absolutely not a judgement on anyone doing that, btw.) Regardless, it doesn\u2019t seem like HR has routinely  (or maybe, even ever) been consulted in the past. So, why now? I\u2019m not privy to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes, but I think that this is a fair question to ask, especially given this communities commitment to transparency.   The comment about \u2018billons of people\u2019 seems entirely random. Who cares? Those people aren\u2019t in this discussion, and have no bearing whatsoever to either David/Artem\u2019s value-add (or, if we\u2019re playing that game) personal financial situation. I truly believe this is moving the goal post and doesn\u2019t add anything of value to this discussion. Unless this has been the consistent position by @flipflopflapdelegate every single time this situation has come up, I\u2019m curious to see why it\u2019s been brought into the equation, now. (And, I maintain that even if that WAS the position, it still has nothing to do with the conversation at hand.)   Now, to discuss what I think - and why I think it - should go into a compensation package here:   The DAO has yet to standardize how offboarding a CU should be handled from a financial perspective. That is clearly a missed opportunity, one that creates tensions, potential charges of favoritism, etc, etc. I personally think that when considering for something like this we\u2019d want to group CUs into categories of \u2018types of work\u2019 which then would get their own \u2018range\u2019 of payment. Why, because not all work is created equal and there is intense competition for some roles and not others - especially on the technical side of things. The other part of this should focus on longevity in the community. Personally, I think that the more dedication and care you\u2019ve shown, the more you should be rewarded, but I\u2019m willing to be moved away from that point of view. Regardless, because this hasn\u2019t been done yet it seems unfair to punish one CU, especially when recent CUs have not received that treatment. It\u2019s one thing to see this applied consistently across the board, but to me, this seems like a CU is being treated disproportionately harshly than others. (This is also exactly why a standardized process should be created and approved ASAP, so that we\u2019re not putting ourselves in this situation again.) |   Whether or not a CU\u2019s and its members are providing valuable support and are in good standing should matter, particularly for CUs like COM-001 which offers a more back-bone, operational type of support. This type of support enables team and organizations but often goes unrewarded and ignored. When things are going smoothly, no-one thinks to highlight these types of teams, and when they\u2019re going wrong, these teams are the first (generally) to take the brunt of the blame. From what I\u2019ve seen everyone here unanimously agrees that COM-001 provided valuable support and that David/Artem provided good quality work and were highly regarded. I think that when we consider what the value of the compensation package here should be, we take that into account.|   I think more broadly (in a world with an SOP for these situations) this shouldn\u2019t be taken into account, but I do want to elevate what a few others have said. David routinely put his CU and Maker above his own financial interests. If he had done what others had historically done this would not even be a conversation. This is NOT to condemn or judge anyone, BUT, I do think that this type of behavior should be acknowledged. If anything, this could theoretically serve to incentivize bad actors who try to secure their own financial security, at the expense of Maker, precisely because they\u2019re following what is happening here. Communities like this won\u2019t be able to succeed, let alone thrive, if those in charge of individual CU\u2019s are making sure they \u2018get-theirs\u2019 before anything else happens.|   The crypto world is small and while it\u2019s growing everyone is probably two degrees of separation from everyone else. And, people (being people) are going to hold grudges. Instead of good business dictating what happens, situations like this hurt feelings, ultimately creating \u2018Us vs. Them coalitions.\u2019 This could be especially true for \u2018Alumni\u2019 of Maker who are very possibly going to end up in the industry and similar capacities, and who will take with them their experiences. Having Alumni (or even current staff) leave feeling jilted out of their compensation (or their experiences being offboarded) will get around. In the long-run, I believe that\u2019ll be bad for Maker. It\u2019ll discourage people from boomeranging back to work at Maker and folks will consider avoiding Maker in their job process. Sure, that\u2019s a pretty bleak scenario, but it\u2019s one that plays out everywhere all the time. I\u2019d even argue that because we\u2019re so transparent and in such an inter-connected time that potential impact could be felt faster than other organizations might. But reverse is true, strong, empathetic and orderly offboarding processes could encourage people to come back to Maker and place it as an organization that top-tier talent wants to work at.   ",

You had probably the second most reasonable budget for what the DAO got.  I think GovAlpha may still be the lowest generally but debating what CU is the best value for the money is an exercise in politics imo. I think this DAO will miss you should you decide to go elsewhere. I agree with many of the comments and share many of the sentiments in the posts by @ACREinvest @csmith @brianmcmichael I completely agree with the following by @CodeKnight     CodeKnight:  I would argue David is getting penalized because he didn\u2019t try to loot MakerDAO.   I know for a fact David did quite a bit to shave budget proposals down, pretty much giving up COL increases to get a budget passed and in fact not seeking the best terms for his CU is basically hurting him and his team at this point. Not even going to get into the consistency and fairness issues here. One thing regarding value of MKR vesting for severance or golden parachute here: I agree with @omahalawyer     omahalawyer:  In the real world, if there was such plan for acquirement of the company\u2019s stock, it would be options to purchase at $X vesting on X date. Not creation of stock from thin air. My guess is had something formal been set up in advance, some of the options given would have been at $1k/MKR or greater, i.e., they would now be worthless.   The point is that MKR wasn\u2019t being given as options.   The debate on how to compensate in a way that encourages alignment of CU interests with MKR holders (in terms of value creation vs. destruction) imo wasn\u2019t optimal. My problem here is that the MKR vested is being equated to 1.7K DAI/MKR and that given every MKR holder has taken the ride down from 4K to now $550 and the vesting cliff would have been hitting around this price I don\u2019t think it is fair to equate MKR vesting value to a DAI value of 1.7K.   That part just won\u2019t fly for me. Give them MKR and let them sell it just like everyone else has to do to pay gains, but don\u2019t just manufacture a value more than 3x current market and pay out in DAI as I don\u2019t think that is fair to MKR holders and generally sets a bad precedent.   No-one gets paid in cash in lieu of stock on termination of employments unless there is some great buyout offer or some particularly good reason for a company to do so.   I don\u2019t see the overwhelming reason to pay out MKR vesting value in DAI unless you adjust this to market value of the MKR on day of vesting or payout or some such. Willing to hear cogent arguments here on this part. The rest regarding the total mistreatment of the people who are MakerDAO contractors, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and ache in my heart.   If work abuse is what Decentralization brings, I can\u2019t wait for regulation good or bad.   The fact that DAOs can\u2019t make enforceable formal contract agreements pretty much says it all to me at this point. ",

That part just won\u2019t fly for me.   @MakerMan, that\u2019s not how the formula works. Since the payout value is the multiplier x dai earned, the Dai value is fixed, only governed by the multiplier. MKR value only dictates how much MKR we would get paid out if we were to get MKR instead of DAI. I am happy to take MKR for our MKR comp but it seems there are mixed opinions on this front so I am not totally sure what to do. I guess I will set the proposal up to have two options.  payout in Dai payout in MKR  Leaving it to the onchain poll for the final decision. It doesn\u2019t hurt to run a sentiment poll so Recognized-Delegates I am once again asking for your opinions  EDIT: Closed Poll ",

MKR value only dictates how much MKR we would get paid out, not the Dai equivalent value.   So a key component missing is the MKR moving price. Under GovAlpha\u2019s model the multiplier is applied to DAI and then assigned to MKR based on the moving average. Without a moving average you get DAI at no discount. Not to say that may not be an appropriate way to do things, but worth noting with the model. In this example if a 6-month moving average was applied the MKR price point would be ~700 which would cut into the capital dispersed. Without a moving average for the MKR price-point, GovAlpha\u2019s model results in quite a bit of MKR allocation in present market condition. To David\u2019s point, if the transaction is being done in DAI then you just apply this idea to the percentage you support. But voters should be mindful that it won\u2019t be an apples to apples comparison with GovAlpha\u2019s model. ",

If work abuse is what Decentralization brings, I can\u2019t wait for regulation good or bad. The fact that DAOs can\u2019t make enforceable formal contract agreements pretty much says it all to me at this point.    What? You\u2019re pretty much saying: We cannot decide ourselves on some rules to treat people fairly and make sure no one loots the DAO, so someone else should come and do it for us, good or bad. Decentralization doesn\u2019t bring work abuse. The lack of pre-established agreements does, and we have people having different expectations (as a contributor or as a DAO-defender) hoping to get a good deal. For the longest time, we have left governance design as an afterthought, and we have had people waiting for someone else to come up with agreements and frameworks. ",

I had a longer winded response but to clarify what I am saying is that blockchain has codes that define rules for its operation.   When it comes to people DAOs do not.     In contrast when it comes to companies, there are well defined rules as to what is and IS NOT allowed in contracts and to personal treatment.  There are real rights and responsibilities that are enforceable by law.   Decentralization by its very nature in effect is trying to build a system where code is law and what we are beginning to see is that this doesn\u2019t apply well to people who are connected to these cryptographic keys, and the networks that operate to blockchain code machinery.

Since the payout value is the multiplier x dai earned, the Dai value is fixed, only governed by the multiplier. MKR value only dictates how much MKR we would get paid out if we were to get MKR instead of DAI.   Sorry @Davidutro  I probably don\u2019t understand the whole multiplier issue and ultimately you don\u2019t have to placate me at all because I won\u2019t be deciding this issue - delegates/rune will. I guess my point here is when it comes to any form of contractor (or worker) compensation in enterprise value (in this case MKR) converting this value to cash requires extra thought since this conversion rarely happens in real world cases.  These things have vesting times because these rewards have to have a longer commitment, and the value of them is directly connected to ALL investors.   To my mind it makes sense to just honor the existing agreed commitment in MKR and let people keep or sell it.  I personally find that watching whether people sell of hold will tell the DAO much more about how people that worked intimately with Maker feel about its future prospects than any other single measure. As a former contractor I understand that there are tax consequences that likely will force sale of some of the acquired MKR.  Whether the contractor decides to sell it all, ultimately up to their view on MKR represents any value to them or not longer term. ",

                    "content": "@Davidutro thank you for posting the chart. Here is what I don\u2019t understand.  The \u201cIf DAI to\u201d MKR column is effectively priced at 1.737K/MKR.   If I am governance and want the least expensive option it would be to pay you in MKR because this costs the protocol less in $$ terms and the preference would be to use MKR instead of cash since we are then selling it at 1.737K/MKR to you and Artem. Because of this say I felt you really should get $51K (or your 61%)  off boarding comp then if this was in DAI it would be $51K, if it was in MKR it would be something like $51K/current MKR price at time of execution.   (right now this would be like 90 MKR not 29.36). Do you see what I am getting at here.    Delegates while voting for compensation could vote you 100% in MKR (which basically at current Market prices is about $27K where as in DAI this would be a 30% compensation level.) This is my most basic issue here is that MKR vesting, vested at a significantly higher price than current and since MKR didn\u2019t perform your MKR vested value has decreased.  Based on the above I would be voting for MKR as the compensation method and then just having to decide on how much.  If I was voting it would be 100% MKR :).   170K/yrly rate seems steep to me (but hell the hazards of working at a DAO n\u2019 all that).  Unemployment would be at most 12 weeks which would work out to about 40K (12/52*170) which I think would be reasonably generous.  (this would come out to about 72.72 MKR if it was paid in MKR. (above your 100% mark). I will let the voters/delegates chime in a bit more here but I think my point (made by @omahalawyer ) basically stands.  If this compensation is basically the MKR vest, well then pay in MKR.  If this compensation is some sort of severance then pay in DAI based on some reasonable thinking but don\u2019t mix the two at this 1.737K/MKR value. ",

We\u2019re running this as a Ranked Choice vote with options for the multiplier. The payout is set to be in the DAI equivalent value. Contributor inclusion has been finalized. Minor format and wording improvements. Tables were added for the ranked-choice options of 80%, 100%, and 120%.      prose11:  So a key component missing is the MKR moving price. Under GovAlpha\u2019s model the multiplier is applied to DAI and then assigned to MKR based on the moving average. Without a moving average you get DAI at no discount.   Also, this was fixed. The DAI equivalent value takes into account the MKR moving price, drastically lowering the DAI payouts as compared what we originally had\u2013hence the higher multiplier choices. DAI payout from the original 25% multiplier is comparable to the DAI payout amount on the 80% multiplier with the fix to the formula. ",
