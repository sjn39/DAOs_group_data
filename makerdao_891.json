In light of these conditions, it no longer makes sense to consider cefi lenders as part of the competitive rates framework; centralized product terms and risk profiles are significantly different vs defi protocols. The following changes have been made to competitive rate calculations:  Cefi lenders (Nexo, BlockFi, and Celsius) have been removed from average rates and will no longer be included in data tables Aave AMM market has been removed from rates and data tables due to low borrow volume and stablecoin liquidity Euler Finance has been added to rates data beginning this month Protocols with over 3 months of operation on a relevant chain or L2, 50 million in stablecoins borrowed, and no significant insolvencies will be considered for addition to competitive rates data Average competitive rates are calculated using debt weighted average among defi protocols  The tables for June and July 2022 have been recalculated using debt weighted average and excluding cefi lenders.  Lending Market Overview The past month has seen stabilization and some recovery within the crypto markets. However, defi borrowing activity remains low and increasing collateral values have so far not led to significantly increased vault usage. Celsius, Voyager, and hedge fund 3AC have all filed for bankruptcy protection recently. It seems the market has absorbed much of these entities\u2019 toxic assets (such as GBTC and stETH), which has allowed for stabilization in prices and prevented further contagion for the time being. Celsius\u2019 large stETH position seems to have passed to Alameda or FTX OTC, while DCG has absorbed Genesis\u2019 exposure to 3AC\u2019s GBTC collateral (which is issued by separate DCG subsidiary Grayscale).  1440\u00d7490 41 KB  Source: ycharts GBTC premium/discount  1238\u00d7684 68.8 KB  Source: Coingecko stETH Defi rates have continued to decline over the past month, with Maker now considerably higher than Aave and Compound for ETH collateralized borrowing. This can also be seen in the recalculated, defi-only competitive rates data from April 2022 to present.  1464\u00d7898 101 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates - Updates for August 2022 Activity on perpetual futures shows some increase in leverage demand. Aggregate open interest on ETH perps has climbed back towards May levels, and funding has picked up in the past 1-2 weeks.  1600\u00d7734 97.8 KB  Source: Coinalyze  1600\u00d7616 122 KB  Source: Coinglass ETH  Proposed Changes  ETH-B: Reduce stability fee to 3.75%  1368\u00d7646 59.4 KB  The overall risk Maker faces on ETH-B vaults is very low, due to significant excess collateral held by many vault holders. This is shown in the below chart of calculated risk premiums over time. Reducing stability fee could encourage new users to open vaults or existing vault users to migrate from lower cost ETH-A or ETH-C vault types.  1340\u00d7772 84.8 KB  This stability fee change will reduce revenue by roughly 100,000 DAI per year, which could be made up with 2.6MM new DAI issuance from the vault (or 6.5MM migrated from ETH-A vault, 4.4MM migrated from ETH-C vault).  WSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%  1374\u00d7650 54.3 KB  As stETH liquidity conditions have generally improved over the past month, it is proposed to reduce WSTETH-A stability fee back to parity with ETH-A. WSTETH-A vault continues to have significant protection from insolvencies due to higher liquidation ratio. This proposed change may help Maker gain market share in liquid staking tokens. Total reduction in revenue at current exposure is roughly 115,000 DAI per year.  WSTETH-B: Reduce stability fee to 0%  1374\u00d7652 35.8 KB  The reduction to 0% stability fee is proposed to help significantly increase Maker\u2019s market share of stETH collateral. stETH and other liquid staking derivatives are expected to increase in prominence within defi as the merge and following upgrade enabling withdrawals take place. Gaining users now has the potential to drive significant long term value as adoption of liquid staking increases. Total loss of revenue at current exposure would amount to 220,000 DAI per year. Potential migrations from WSTETH-A could also cause additional declines.  WBTC-B: Reduce stability fee to 3.75%  1374\u00d7648 39.7 KB  Similar to ETH-B, the stability fee change for WBTC-B is proposed in light of low vault risks. This may also encourage new minting or migration from lower rate A and C vault types. This change would reduce revenue by roughly 15,000 DAI per year at current exposure levels, so even a small increase in usage or migration could fully offset the lost earnings.  GUNIDAIUSDC1-A: Increase stability fee to 0.02% and increase maximum debt ceiling to 1 billion DAI  1372\u00d7642 57 KB  The 0.05% fee tier GUNI vault has hit its maximum debt ceiling despite last month\u2019s rate increase (from 0% to 0.01%). This proposal would raise rates another 0.01% while increasing the maximum debt ceiling by 250 million DAI. This will allow users to continue increasing exposure to this vault type while driving Maker revenue.  1374\u00d7608 75.3 KB  The 0.01% increase in fees reduces annualized returns on a fully 50x leveraged position by 0.5%. Based on recent historical data, it is likely that user positions will remain profitable and higher yielding vs comparable stablecoin positions such as Aave or Compound.  GUNIDAIUSDC2-A: Increase stability fee to 0.06% and increase maximum debt ceiling to 1.25 billion DAI  1372\u00d7644 62.1 KB  The 0.01% fee tier GUNI vault has recently hit its maximum debt ceiling. This proposal would raise rates 0.01% while increasing the maximum debt ceiling by 250 million DAI. This will allow users to continue increasing exposure to this vault type while driving Maker revenue.  1372\u00d7606 94.1 KB  Similar to above, vault positions are likely to remain profitable and more yielding than comparable stablecoin positions despite the 0.5% reduction in fully levered returns.  UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Increase stability fee to 0.02%  1372\u00d7634 41.7 KB  While exposure is down from the peak hit in June, it has not decreased since last month\u2019s initial 0.01% fee increase. This proposal would add an additional 0.01% to stability fees to increase revenue.  1374\u00d7610 64.9 KB  While the long term viability of this position is somewhat questionable (due to low efficiency of swapping through Uniswap v2 stablecoin pools vs Uniswap v3 or Curve), recent historical data continues to show strong returns that are more than sufficient to bear the 0.5% increase in fully levered position cost.  MANA-A: Increase maximum debt ceiling to 17 million DAI  1374\u00d7648 43 KB  The MANA vault type has again hit its maximum debt ceiling. While DEX liquidity for the token is low, this risk is somewhat mitigated by relatively high CEX trading activity as well as the fact that the Decentraland team seems to be a large part of existing debt exposure. Proposed 2 million DAI increase in debt ceiling would yield roughly 120,000 in annual revenue if it is fully utilized.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through October 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A and WSTETH-B: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through October 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes would reduce annualized revenue by ~250,000 DAI (2%) assuming vault usage remains constant. Any increase in usage driven by lower rates or forward guidance commitments would help offset this. Current low exposure levels make these rate changes less costly and provide relatively more upside. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

Due to expectations of a POW fork airdrop, ETH borrowing activity was significantly elevated in the days leading up to the merge. It has since declined back towards normal levels, but due to the significant distortions caused by this event all ETH based competitive rates are quoted in the table above using a trailing 1 week average rather than monthly average.  1098\u00d7672 42.7 KB  Source: Blockanalitica Dashboard  1092\u00d7638 64.7 KB  Source: Coingecko stETH With the merge completing successfully, stETH discount has narrowed significantly and liquidity conditions on DEX have also improved with Curve\u2019s pool balance shifting from 25% to 47% ETH. Futures basis discounts (which were impacted by POW fork expectations) have also narrowed, which implies a higher cost to go long ETH on centralized venues and may lead to higher stablecoin rates in defi over time. However, they are still broadly negative through the end of the year which can continue to present a headwind to minting demand.  1002\u00d7632 50.6 KB  Source: Aave While Aave DAI borrow rates had been trending over 2.5% in the middle of September, they have since declined to only around 1.6% and no longer present an attractive opportunity to deploy funds through the D3M (supply rates would amount to 0.5% or less). Any changes to D3M parameters will be submitted from next month or later, after the conclusion of the current signal request on D3M parameter guidance.  Proposed Changes This proposal includes a single parameter change, and results in a negligible decline in revenue at constant exposure levels (~1,500 DAI per year or less). The primary difference between adopting this proposal or supporting no changes is the extension of forward guidance commitments from the end of October to the end of December. CRVV1ETHSTETH-A: Decrease stability fee to 1.5%  1482\u00d7646 38 KB  While the Curve ETH/stETH LP earns a slightly higher rate of return than wstETH, so far we have not seen significant adoption of this vault type. Lowering stability fees to parity with the WSTETH-A vault type may stimulate demand and allow this vault to reach sustainable levels of exposure. YFI: Reduce debt ceiling to 10 million DAI  1458\u00d7640 65.2 KB  Liquidity for YFI is fairly low, and the 25 million debt ceiling may be excessively risky if fully utilized, particularly considering the current low stability fee. Considering that YFI has not seen significant minting in the past few months, this change is unlikely to limit organic vault usage.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through December 31, 2022. This commitment may be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A and WSTETH-B: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through December 31, 2022. This commitment may be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes would have a negligible impact on revenue, with stability fees falling by ~1,500 DAI per year. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week. Because there are multiple options presented, this poll will be structured as a ranked choice vote between option 1, option 2, and no changes.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

It seems that a series of contributing factors, including the Terra UST collapse, declining stETH price and liquidity, and continued discount in Grayscale\u2019s GBTC closed end fund, have pushed several lenders and key borrowing counterparties to the breaking point. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) faced large liquidations and defaulted on undercollateralized loans to a range of counterparties. They were heavily exposed to each of the main risk catalysts above, with investments in this year\u2019s Luna Foundation Guard fundraise and heavy exposure to both stETH and GBTC. Their defaults have impacted a range of cefi lenders including Voyager, Babel, Genesis, and others. Celsius (a large Maker vault user) has also faced serious trouble, with possible losses from the Terra collapse, failure of Bancor DEX\u2019s impermanent loss insurance programs, as well as illiquidity issues related to stETH (and non tokenized staked Ether) exposure. This has resulted in Celsius freezing user withdrawals and hiring advisors for a potential bankruptcy filing. US bankruptcy proceedings convert all outstanding liabilities into USD denomination at the time of filing, which may be responsible for various short/hedging activity that Celsius is entering on tokens including BNT and SNX. Bankruptcy filing could also lead to further forced selling of client assets such as BTC, stETH, and ETH. Blockfi, another leader in the cefi lending space, is facing similar liquidity issues. In their case it is likely driven more by defaults or liquidity issues among institutional borrowing counterparties rather than defi exposure. Blockfi has also faced lingering exposure to the GBTC arb trade, where funds would borrow BTC to contribute to GBTC in the hopes of selling at a premium after a 6-12 month waiting period. This trade became overcrowded and the premium collapsed to a discount last year, saddling borrowers with negative equity and complicating loan repayments. FTX affiliated trading firm Alameda Research has proposed or issued credit lines to bail out Blockfi and Voyager. Rival crypto lender CoinFlex has also disclosed losses related to a large undercollateralized loan to BCH advocate Roger Ver. While Nexo (another large Maker counterparty) has so far been relatively unscathed, the levels of contagion risk facing Cefi platforms remain extremely high. Due to these issues at Cefi lenders, Celsius and Blockfi have been removed from average rate calculations for this month. We will consider further changes to methodology (eg. potentially removing Cefi lenders entirely from measured average rates) depending on changes in market conditions. Tether has seen continued redemption pressures in the past month, while rival USDC has gained significant market share. BUSD may also see increasing adoption, as Binance exchange seems to be pursuing a strategy of progressively replacing USDT margined derivatives contracts and trading pairs with BUSD. While Tether claims they do not have any undercollateralized exposure to crypto counterparties and minimal commercial paper exposure, general market fears and weak transparency continue to drive substitution of alternative stablecoins in place of USDT.  916\u00d7706 49.9 KB  Source: Coingecko Average defi borrowing costs have generally leveled off since last month. DAI rates were volatile mid month due to Celsius and other large borrowers shifting positions between Aave and Compound, as well as Maker removing liquidity from the Aave D3M. Compound USDC rates have significantly fallen towards the end of the month and are currently below 0% when considering the impact of incentives and yield earned on collateral.  1264\u00d7710 149 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard Perp funding rates were depressed during the market breakdown earlier in the month, but have recovered into a moderately positive equilibrium at the end of the month. There was a corresponding drop in perp open interest (total value of outstanding contracts).  1600\u00d7640 134 KB  Source: Coinglass BTC  1600\u00d7640 131 KB  Source: Coinglass ETH  1600\u00d7924 108 KB  Source: Coinalyze stETH faced increasing pressure early in the month, linked with high exposure held by Celsius and 3AC who faced immediate liquidity needs. Forced selling and panic pushed the price down to a low below 0.93 ETH. But disorderly liquidation cascades on Aave and other leverage platforms were avoided and the price has recovered some ground to trade around 0.96 ETH at time of writing. However, further sharp declines are still possible as liquidity grows relatively thinner the farther stETH price gets from parity with ETH (due to importance of stableswap exchanges including Curve and Balancer).  1244\u00d7694 66.9 KB  Source: Coingecko  Proposed Changes  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: Increase stability fee to 0.01%  1454\u00d7638 48.6 KB  Exposure has increased considerably in the past months after the stability fee was reduced from 0.1% to 0%. With increasing prospects of swapping stablecoin reserves into yield bearing instruments (such as US Treasury bonds), the relative value of maintaining high exposure through this vault type is declining.  1600\u00d7633 102 KB  The 0.01% increase in stability fee would reduce net yield of fully levered positions by 0.5%. Based on recent historical data this should not immediately push positions below profitability, but will help prevent excessive increases in exposure while the AMM pool utilization (and trade fee APY for LPs) is very low.  UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Increase stability fee to 0.01%, increase maximum debt ceiling to 300 million, and increase gap to 20 million.  1446\u00d7640 46.7 KB  Increasing stability fee from 0% to 0.01% is proposed for similar reasons as above increase in the GUNI vault type. With past week average levered returns of 1.5% to 4%, the 0.5% increase in fully levered cost will not immediately push positions into unprofitability even if trading volumes remain low. The increased debt ceiling and gap will allow users greater flexibility to take advantage of any increases in Uniswap v2 volumes and pool returns.  LINK-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 25 million DAI  1444\u00d7632 46 KB  Large users have unwound their link vaults, leaving less than $2 million in debt outstanding. In consideration of low usage and continued weak DEX liquidity for LINK, it is recommended to lower the maximum debt ceiling from 50 million to 25 million DAI. If demand remains low for an extended period and it is not possible to cover operating expenses from stability fee revenues, LINK may become a candidate for collateral offboarding.  WSTETH-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 150 million DAI and increase stability fee to 2.5%  1464\u00d7644 46.2 KB  stETH liquidity remains thin due to unbalanced stableswap AMM venues. Additionally, certain entities (eg. Celsius) could be forced to quickly sell holdings if they face further liquidity issues. Reducing the maximum debt ceiling to 150 million DAI will limit excessive growth in exposure while the market remains weak. Increasing stability fee (while leaving higher liquidation ratio WSTETH-B vault fees unchanged) will incentivize users to consider migration to the safer vault type.  WSTETH-B: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 100 million DAI  1464\u00d7644 32.4 KB  The maximum debt ceiling is proposed to be reduced by 50 million DAI, which will limit tail risk without impacting utilization (which has remained very low since launch). This should still provide enough available debt ceiling for users who wish to migrate positions from WSTETH-A or external lending platforms.  YFI-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 25 million DAI  1446\u00d7632 42.7 KB  YFI usage has continued to decline, with less than 20,000 DAI in remaining exposure. This debt ceiling change reduces tail risk without impacting likely usage. If exposure and revenues remain low and can\u2019t cover operating costs, YFI may become a candidate for collateral offboarding.  MATIC-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 20 million DAI and reduce gap to 5 million DAI  1456\u00d7640 37.2 KB  The Polygon vault partially repaid debt to maintain a healthy collateralization during the past month\u2019s price crash, and despite price partially recovering they have not yet made moves to increase exposure. Historically the vault has never seen more than 20 million DAI utilization, so this reduction in maximum debt ceiling and gap will help limit tail risk without significantly curtailing usage.  USDC-A: Reduce stability fee to 0% With the vast majority of USDC-A vaults below 100% collateralization, Maker has already captured the majority of the possible revenue from these abandoned positions. Leaving the stability fee at 1% is now creating \u201cphantom revenues\u201d, which don\u2019t cause serious issues for the protocol (revenue earned offsets future losses to be recognized) but can complicate financial reporting and analytics.  USDP-A: Reduce stability fee to 0% Similar to USDC-A, most USDP-A vaults are below 100% collateralization and it no longer makes sense to maintain positive stability fees.  DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Leave exposure at 0 DAI for the time being  1600\u00d7710 169 KB  Maker reduced exposure to the Aave D3M last month due to severe market stress and high exposure to Celsius and stETH collateralization. Since that time, Celsius and other borrowers have significantly bolstered their position health and collateralization, and stETH liquidity has improved as price moved back closer to parity with ETH. However, the D3M mandate specifies maintaining the bar (target borrowing rate) such that effective borrowing costs of DAI collateralized by ETH on Aave are no more than 0.5% below ETH-A borrowing costs. Given current Maker ETH-A rate of 2.25%, and Aave ETH deposit rate of 0.58%, this would equate to a bar of roughly 2.9%, which is significantly over current Aave DAI borrow rate of 2.66%. In this circumstance it makes sense to leave D3M off, as Maker would be exposed to possible tail risks without earning any revenues. The D3M can be reenabled when market conditions change such that exposure can be added within the mandated thresholds. Alternatively the community can consider changes to the mandate to allow for greater rate difference between MakerDAO and Aave (this would happen through a separate signal request or governance process), or future reductions to ETH-A stability fee.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes In last month\u2019s proposal, we introduced a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes, intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current view towards future parameter changes. The current status of previous guidance commitments are as follows. ETH-A, ETH-C, WBTC-A, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through August 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A: Stability fees The previous parameter change proposal included the following forward guidance commitment with respect to WSTETH-A stability fees: Fees on the WSTETH-A vault type should not be increased through August 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the rolling 7 day average indicative risk premium (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH. Due to stETH price falling below 0.97 ETH (as low as 0.93 ETH at certain points) and accompanying liquidity issues, this commitment has been voided and a small increase in WSTETH-A stability fee has been proposed.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes would not have a material direct impact on revenue. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee  Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi  1600\u00d7504 284 KB  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates - Updates for November 2022  Lending Market Overview Competitive DeFi lending rates have trended up somewhat over the past month. In addition to lower return on collateral (particularly ETH, which saw heightened borrowing activity during September during the merge), this was also driven by withdrawals of stablecoins from lending protocols.  1328\u00d71070 88.5 KB  Source: Blockanalitica Dashboard As USD risk free rate continues to increase, this removal of liquidity from stablecoin LPs and lending protocols may accelerate. Supply rates on Aave and Compound are already below short duration tbills, and with over 1% of further federal reserve rate hikes expected before the end of the year the defi ecosystem may see further withdrawal of liquidity for lending protocols and other stablecoin liquidity pools. While this would provide favorable competitive conditions for Maker (which currently enjoys a near 0% cost of funding), it may also lead to decline in circulating DAI supply, constraining capital allocation and possibly impacting net interest margin (through increases in dai savings rate or other mechanisms to support DAI demand).  1352\u00d7790 44.5 KB  Source: St Louis Fed stETH has shown full recovery in the past month, with prices consistently staying within the 0.99-1 ETH range. This was accompanied by large inflows into stETH decentralized exchange pools. These factors have driven significant reduction in stETH liquidity risk.  1104\u00d7614 70.4 KB  Source: Coingecko stETH Funding on ETH perps has shifted more positive in the past month after being consistently negative through September. This indicates greater market bullishness as well as unwinding of merge related delta neutral trades. However, quarterly futures are still backwardated with annualized negative basis of 1 to 4%.  1600\u00d7750 134 KB  Source: Coinalyze Defi lending protocols have faced heightened concern over the past month due to potential for market manipulation impacting long tail assets. Mango (based on Solana) and Moola (based on Celo) both faced exploits earlier this month from attackers manipulating the price of assets to inflate collateral value. While the immediate risk of attack is lower for top Ethereum based lending protocols, Aave and Compound are both considering steps to reduce exposure to long tail, illiquid collateral assets. This increase in perceived risk of pooled lending markets may lead to greater demand for Maker vaults, where users\u2019 collateral assets are not at risk from relending.  Proposed Changes This proposal includes proposed launch parameters for the Compound D3M, as well as changes to MANA-A risk parameters. Assuming constant DAI minting levels and borrow utilization levels at Compound, these changes could lead to 2.2 million DAI increase in annual revenue (roughly 22% gain). Activate Compound V2 D3M: Up to 160 million debt ceiling, 10 million gap, and 2% bar Compound\u2019s DAI market has seen consistent usage, and presents an opportunity for Maker to earn relatively high return through deployment of DAI through the new Compound v2 D3M. The proposed debt ceiling of 160 million DAI corresponds to roughly 30% of real DAI supply (excluding recursive positions). PE may recommend a lower initial debt ceiling, gap, and ramp-up path to reduce risk with the new Compound D3M mechanism. Gap of 10 million DAI with ttl of 12 hours will limit losses in the event the module has any issues, or if Compound faces sudden insolvency events. Proposed 2% bar (target borrow rate) is 0.5% above the stability for the ETH-A vault type, matching community preferences selected in this signal request. Based on current market state, it is expected that the full 160 million DAI would be deployed, resulting in a final supply rate of roughly 1.15% (0.55% native supply yield and 0.6% COMP rewards). This would bring around 1.8 million DAI in annualized revenue. No changes are proposed for the Aave D3M at this time, as current market conditions would only support roughly 5 million DAI to be deployed at 2% target borrow rate, and return earned would be only 0.78%, significantly below the level of total return available to the Compound D3M. MANA-A: Reduce debt ceiling to 10 million, increase stability fee to 7.5%   MANA has been causing significant increases to Maker\u2019s capital at risk metrics, due to relatively low liquidity and significant exposure to higher risk vault positions. Reducing debt ceiling from current 17 million to 10 million DAI, along with increase in stability fee from 4.5% to 7.5%, will help incentivize reduction of exposure to more manageable levels. If total capital at risk from MANA declines through better liquidity, higher vault collateralization, or drop in total exposure, reductions in stability fees can be considered in the future. YFI-A: Maintain current parameters  The YFI-A vault type has recently seen significant growth and maxed out debt ceiling, driven by usage from the Yearn treasury. Due to relatively low liquidity, it may be necessary to raise stability fees along with any increase in debt ceiling. With Yearn using the existing minted DAI to deposit into their yDAI vault earning ~2.5%, further increases in stability fee may be uneconomical and risk driving away the existing levels of usage. For these reasons, no parameter changes are proposed for YFI-A this month. Further debt ceiling increases will depend on YFI liquidity conditions and users\u2019 willingness to bear potential stability fee increases.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through December 31, 2022. This commitment may be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A and WSTETH-B: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through December 31, 2022. This commitment may be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH. GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A, and UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types are not being changed in this proposal, but may be increased in the future to ensure sufficient liquidity in PSMs and enable allocation to higher yielding opportunities. Stability fees are expected to be increased if DAI backed by PSMs falls below 40% of DAI circulating supply, and may face increases before liquidity ratios reach this threshold.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes would increase revenue run rate at constant exposure levels; excluding D3M changes, this would be roughly 450,000 DAI increase per year or 4.5%, while including expected revenue from Compound D3M would yield roughly 2.2 million DAI increase or 22%. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain polling next week. If approved, they will be included in the next available executive vote.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

Rates have diverged somewhat between Aave and Compound, with effective rates on Aave trending lower while Compound rates stayed relatively stable. On Aave, USDC borrowing costs have mostly rebounded while DAI rates remain low, driven by large deposits from the D3M.  1140\u00d7748 129 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard Specifically looking at Aave, the introduction of stETH as a collateral asset has significantly boosted demand for borrowing ETH (driven by users recursively leveraging their stETH position to increase yield). This has increased ETH deposit rates from near 0% to around 0.4%, which reduces the effective cost of borrowing stablecoins against ETH. We may see this effect increase if Aave adopts a proposed change to the ETH interest rate model, which would potentially see ETH deposit rates increase to around 1.9% before liquidity incentives. This would make Aave much more competitive on a simple cost assessment, but would also increase risk of Aave users losing their collateral if Lido experienced issues (eg slashing or , so impact on Maker\u2019s competitive position is somewhat unclear (Maker does not rehypothecate collateral so users face lower risk of loss).  882\u00d7590 29.8 KB  Source: Aave markets dashboard Compound recently passed proposal 92, which reduces existing COMP liquidity incentives by 50% across the board. This is likely to be followed in the coming weeks by another proposal to fully remove existing rewards and only offer incentives for newly added assets to help bootstrap liquidity. Perpetual futures funding rates are fairly even vs last month, but have increased slightly in the past week.  1434\u00d7914 124 KB  Source: Coinglass Bridge protocol Stargate Finance recently launched, and is offering high liquidity mining rewards on various stablecoins (no DAI pools offered for now). This may lead to additional borrowing demand at Maker as well as outflows from the USDC PSM. The USDC PSM peaked at 5,465,000,000 DAI on March 19 (shortly after farming began) before falling to the current level of 5,090,000,000 DAI (a decline of nearly 7%).  1600\u00d7704 155 KB  Source: Stargate  Proposed Changes  WBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 3.25%  1492\u00d7924 51 KB  WBTC-A has seen significant outflows over the past months, likely due to the large borrowing cost difference vs ETH-A and WBTC collateralized borrowing costs on Aave. This stability fee reduction should help reverse this trend and make Maker vaults a more competitive option for WBTC backed leverage.  WBTC-B: Reduce stability fee to 4.5%  1486\u00d7924 47.5 KB  This stability fee reduction is correlated with WBTC-A reduction, and will help grow usage of this vault type (which has remained relatively low since launch).  WSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%  1480\u00d7930 51.3 KB  Reducing WSTETH-A stability fee should help us maintain competitiveness with Aave (which has recently seen a large amount of stETH deposits) and attract new users as stETH total supply continues to increase.  CRVV1ETHSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%  1480\u00d7922 40.8 KB  This collateral type has similar risk profile to WSTETH-A (potentially even slightly less risky because roughly \u00bd of value is held in ETH), and earns slightly higher yield due to LDO and CRV rewards. Reducing borrowing costs could help us take market share on this collateral type from Abracadabra (the only other lender accepting this asset as collateral) without exposing Maker to excessive risk.  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: Reduce stability fee to 0%, increase debt ceiling to 750M, and increase gap to 50M  1490\u00d7918 60.5 KB  This stability fee reduction only marginally impacts Maker\u2019s revenue, but should help significantly reduce exposure to USDC through the PSM. This improves Maker\u2019s centralization risk profile at very low cost. Gap and debt ceiling are increased in expectation of growing demand.  GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A: Reduce stability fee to 0.05% and increase debt ceiling to 1B  1494\u00d7924 68.5 KB  Similar to above, this stability fee reduction only marginally impacts revenue while improving centralization risk profile. Debt ceiling is being increased to accommodate potential increase in demand above the existing 750 million DAI debt ceiling.  AAVE D3M: Increase bar to 3.5%  1478\u00d7924 83.7 KB  At the current bar of 2.85%, Maker\u2019s debt ceiling of 300M is being fully utilized which means we can\u2019t provide the benefit of borrowing rate stability (one of the benefits of D3M integration). This is also forcing down competitive borrowing rates and potentially reducing Maker\u2019s market share - this effect could increase due to previously mentioned changes in the Aave market which will increase ETH collateral deposit rates. Increasing the bar will help address these concerns, while also ensuring Maker adheres to the voter approved mandate of making up only 30% of real dai supplied and 0.5% maximum effective spread between Maker and Aave rates.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes, if confirmed, should reduce yearly revenue by about 6 million DAI (~8%), due to roughly 100M reduction in expected debt exposure to the Aave D3M as well as stability fee reductions on stETH and WBTC collateral types. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

GWintery:  Aren\u2019t there also oracle costs associated with this vault? would reducing the stability fee to 0% be making this vault more unprofitable?   My understanding is that these are some of the cheapest oracles to operate, because they only update once a day or so. Setting it to 0% will make it unprofitable though, obviously. @hexonaut or someone from @Oracles-Core-Unit can maybe tell you more precisely how expensive these are.     GWintery:  I was also under the impression that the 0.01% UNI vault is the intended replacement for this vault. I currently doubt the decrease of SF to this vault can garner any meaningful result, considering most liquidity is on the 0.01% fee vault.   I more or less agree with you, the one minor benefit is that the price range is wider which theoretically would be useful if DAI depegged more than usual. We did a similar thing with the UNIV2 DAIUSDC vault as well, setting the fee to zero to encourage liquidity. Realistically with these vaults there are two goals we can pursue:  Maximize revenue. Maximize DAI displaced from PSM / maximize UNIv3 liquidity.  This is a move towards the latter, given that there doesn\u2019t (currently at least) seem to be much scope for significant revenues with these vault types. ",

I mean I don\u2019t believe any of the Delegates are happy to read that the protocol will lose an estimated 6M in revenue. Personally I think the Story goes beyond the SF parameters. Opening a Maker Vault is not for the faint-of-heart (retail). Therefore, the focus should be on attracting Institutional Money to mind DAI with these Products (Specially Staked ETH). A great example why institutions should fall head over heals over stETH is best described by the write-up that Arthur Hayes posted 24-hours ago, pretty-much comparing ETH to an infinite duration Bond. And many in this community have felt that way. That same opinion was voiced 12-months ago by community members\u2013about the possibility of Staked ETH being a tool for not only institutions, but also Corporate Treasuries and perhaps even Central Banks.

                    "content": "I would like to point out the following.     monet-supply:  Rates have diverged somewhat between Aave and Compound, with effective rates on Aave trending lower while Compound rates stayed relatively stable.   Virtually every other asset change starts with \u201cAave\u201d.     monet-supply:  Specifically looking at Aave, the introduction of stETH as a collateral asset has significantly boosted demand for borrowing ETH (driven by users recursively leveraging their stETH position to increase yield). This has increased ETH deposit rates from near 0% to around 0.4%, which reduces the effective cost of borrowing stablecoins against ETH. We may see this effect increase if Aave adopts a proposed change to the ETH interest rate model , which would potentially see ETH deposit rates increase to around 1.9% before liquidity incentives.   I think there are two points here that I don\u2019t see any analysis on.  If users are using stETH to borrow ETH then I don\u2019t see how Maker can match this advantage.  On Maker stETH or ETH deposits only borrow DAI which means Maker stETH or ETH against DAI come under liquidation if ETH price rises this requires extra management.   I don\u2019t see how Maker can compete for these borrowers business. Additional rewards heaped into rates.  This provides a significant rate skew and absolutely needs to be accounted for when considering effective deposit/borrow rates.   Maker without any rewards also can\u2019t compete.  My conclusion is that we can reduce the stETH and ETH SF and this may slow the rate of decline but I don\u2019t think it will halt it, at least if the premise of majority of Aave borrowing is stETH borrowing ETH leading to the Aave ETH deposit return rising dramatically.     monet-supply:  Bridge protocol Stargate Finance recently launched, and is offering high liquidity mining rewards on various stablecoins (no DAI pools offered for now). This may lead to additional borrowing demand at Maker as well as outflows from the USDC PSM. The USDC PSM peaked at 5,465,000,000 DAI on March 19 (shortly after farming began) before falling to the current level of 5,090,000,000 DAI (a decline of nearly 7%).   The above is interesting and it seems like MakerDAO should pay attention if this is true\u2026  Is there any real source of data supporting the premise?  i.e. DAI moves through PSM that go directly towards Stargate Finance?     monet-supply:  WBTC-A has seen significant outflows over the past months, likely due to the large borrowing cost difference vs ETH-A and WBTC collateralized borrowing costs on Aave.   Some data on outflow moves supporting the thesis here would be helpful.  Though I have felt that wBTC rates would end up being a closer match to ETH anyway so I have been expecting these.  It will be interesting to see the results.     monet-supply:  GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: Reduce stability fee to 0%, increase debt ceiling to 750M, and increase gap to 50M   This one is the mystery.  Why would maker incentivize this vault vs. focusing on optimizing the .01% GUNI-DAI/USDC?   It looks to me like market participants are phasing this out. Example:  What is the real return on the .05% vs. the .01% as a holder?   From my own experience the next lower fee level tier tends to get something like 2-3x the fees of the one above but without data on these two specific vaults difficult to asses the situation. The argument that this vault only provides marginal revenue and that somehow it will reduce USDC PSM exposure is lacking data particularly in the context of other USDC statements related to Stargate finance I don\u2019t think makes a convincing argument for the suggested change here. 5B is significant USDC exposure but realize at any point if the markets shift these PSM could empty rapidly and leave the PEG undefended until governance can act. Regarding D3M generally\u2026     monet-supply:  Maker\u2019s debt ceiling of 300M is being fully utilized which means we can\u2019t provide the benefit of borrowing rate stability   and     monet-supply:  making up only 30% of real dai   Makes me wonder whether the 30% limit here will be applied to all D3Ms - which is going to significantly limit Maker ability to earn return while managing market rates.   It would be nice to see some sort of risk report relative to whether all the D3M work will end up being limited because of the low amount of \u2018real dai\u2019 being minted.   The point here is that SF rate management and hence the TVL locked in to produce \u2018SF paying DAI\u2019 is going to have a direct effect on the size allowed of the D3M.   I have not seen any risk or growth analysis discussing these seemingly conflicting requirements (i.e. how D3M rate management on other protocols affects maker SF pricing, and how this ultimately affects TVL and DAI minted thereby producing a negative feedback effect through this 30% real DAI D3M restriction). Realize I am not suggesting changing the 30% real DAI D3M limit I am just pointing out that SF, TVL locked to mint SF paying DAI is directly connected to ability for D3M management.  This is important when Maker is putting significant efforts into expanding ability to onboard more D3M facilities since if we are going to be limited in providing liquidity here and hence yield Maker PE and governance might do well to focus efforts on more productive TVL to produce \u2018real DAI\u2019 and increase TVL to be able to expand liquidity for D3M management. Not happy about these changes affecting our bottom line by estimated -6M and it is entirely unclear to me (except with wBTC) that these changes are going to do anything but slow the TVL hemorrhage.  Notice ETH and wBTC have gone up what 30-40% in the past month and Maker DAI is flatlined at best. ",

On ETH, we discussed at length to decrease rates to keep being competitive At the time of the meeting Aave was cheaper than Maker before rewards. But it was just too costly and unsure to decrease the rates. Moreover, rewards are going down to Compound and Aave. This is the most important decision we made I think (to do nothing here). On the WBTC decrease rate, it\u2019s due to loss of market share and Nexo that removed all WBTC from their vault (not seeming to use them for anything right now). While we were #1 on WBTC holding, we are now the last. Both Aave and Compound are growing meanwhile. The high SF on WBTC was questionable from the start (but made sense as we had a lot of Capital at Risk at the time).  image1849\u00d7586 61.2 KB  On the stETH related vaults, they are still small and stETH seems like to be the future. I fully recognize that there is little we can do against stETH/ETH leverage, yet we need to do something. On GUNIV3DAIUSDC, first it doesn\u2019t really matter revenue-wise. It was expected to scale linearly with the decrease of fees. Well that didn\u2019t work as expected (didn\u2019t checked why). My main interest in this move was that GUNIV3DAIUSDC is artificially increasing the DAI on makerburn vs the PSM. In one word marketing. On Aave D3M, we are tied by the community mandated. Therefore, while I\u2019m not pleased by decreasing revenue, I think we made the right choices. I understand the argument about raising rates in TradFi, but SOFR is still at 0.3% while we are charging 2.25%. It is my belief that ETH-A SF will be SOFR + xxbps at some point, so the direction is still down. ",

This seems to be driven primarily through removal of supplied liquidity, rather than increase in borrowing demand. Aave, Compound, and Euler have all seen reduction in TVL.  1358\u00d71080 94.2 KB  Source: Blockanalitica Dashboard The withdraw of liquidity can be related to a few factors. First, risk levels have increased as troubles at FTX and Genesis created unpredictable contagion effects and heightened asset volatility. Avi Eisenbergs \u201chighly profitable trading strategies\u201d (market manipulation) also put lending market suppliers at higher risk, incentivizing withdrawals; just this week Aave faced over $1 million in bad debt due to an attack on the CRV market, and the protocol is now considering remedial actions to reduce risk. And on top of this, expected path of risk free rates has somewhat increased over the past month based on hawkish signaling from the Federal Reserve, which incentivizes users to pull their funds from defi back into treasury bills.  1128\u00d7778 51.7 KB  1158\u00d7792 51.7 KB  Source: Treasury Yield Curve After a period of parity against ETH, stETH is once again trading at a small discount due to dislocations from the FTX and Genesis crises. Liquidity remains strong but further market stress could lead to a significant blow out in the discount similar to the liquidity crunch seen in June.  1062\u00d7666 59.8 KB  Source: Coingecko stETH Funding on ETH perps has shifted negative since the collapse of FTX and continuing issues with Genesis/DCG. Quarterly futures remain backwardated with annualized negative basis of 1 to 5%. However the negative funding across futures and perp contracts seems to be abating somewhat over time, after hitting peak bearishness during the FTX bank run.  1600\u00d7797 133 KB  Source: Coinalyze  Proposed Changes The parameter change proposal includes numerous updates to normalize debt ceiling IAM parameters against current bear market conditions. This should help reduce risk and unnecessary excess capacity. Changes to PSMs and stablecoin LPs will help realign Maker\u2019s liquidity position to maximize risk adjusted return and benefit to the protocol. Last month\u2019s launch parameters for the Compound v2 D3M are also adjusted to reflect current risk conditions at defi lending protocols. Accompanying images are gathered from Makerburn. ETH-B: Reduce line to 250 million DAI  1338\u00d7684 67.1 KB  The current line (maximum debt ceiling) of 500 million DAI was set in the bull market, and no longer conforms to liquidity constraints and usage patterns. Reducing line to 250 million DAI will help reduce tail risk and prevent excessive accumulation of risky debt. WSTETH-A: Increase line to 500 million DAI and reduce gap to 15 million DAI  1336\u00d7684 66.1 KB  The WSTETH-A vault has recently hit the maximum debt ceiling of 150 million DAI. Risk levels are limited and fully compensated by stability fees, and an increase in line to 500 million will allow for further growth in this important core vault type. Reducing gap (target available debt) by half to 15 million DAI will manage growth rate and also reduce maximum exposure to possible Lido tail risks such as major slashing. WSTETH-B: Increase line to 500 million DAI and reduce gap to 15 million DAI  1338\u00d7682 47.7 KB  While WSTETH-B is not near the current cap, its higher liquidation ratio provides relatively safer exposure to Maker and increase in line is intended to allow for further growth. Similar to A vault type, reducing gap will limit losses in tail risk scenarios. WBTC-A: Reduce line to 500 million DAI, reduce gap to 20 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours  1330\u00d7686 63 KB  The current line of 2 billion DAI was set in the bull market, and is not currently necessary to meet demand. Reduction to 500 million will help limit excessive exposure growth. Reduction of gap from 80 million to 20 million DAI, along with increase in ttl (cooldown period for making more minting available) from 6 to 24 hours will significantly reduce throughput, helping limit potential losses from Bitgo related tail risks. WBTC-B: Reduce line to 250 million DAI, reduce gap to 10 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours  1336\u00d7680 45.4 KB  WBTC-B has never seen high levels of usage, and reduction of line should not impact UX while helping mitigate tail risks. Reducing gap and raising ttl will limit potential tail risk exposure similar to A vault above. WBTC-C: Reduce line to 500 million DAI, reduce gap to 20 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours  1332\u00d7680 46 KB  The reduction in line and updates to gap and ttl will help normalize parameters against observed usage patterns and eliminate excess capacity. Combined with the changes to WBTC A and B vault types above, total throughput will be reduced to 50 million DAI per day, which should be enough to meet recent demand levels while significantly reducing Bitgo risk exposure. In the event of compromise, Maker may be able to disable minting with only 100-150 million DAI increase in exposure (due to 2 day GSM governance delay). This compares with previous 2 days maximum exposure growth of 1.26 billion DAI (a roughly 90% reduction). If these tight gap parameters begin to impact UX, Maker can consider additional safety features, such as WBTC vs BTC price checks or systems to disable minting that bypass the GSM delay. LINK-A: Reduce gap to 2.5 million DAI  1326\u00d7680 64.4 KB  With line reduced to 5 million earlier this month, existing 7 million DAI gap parameter no longer provides any additional protection. Reducing gap to 2.5 million should not impede vault holders based on recently observed usage patterns. MANA-A: Reduce line to 0 DAI  1334\u00d7674 51 KB  A recent proposal tightened MANA-A parameters to address extremely high observed risk levels. Liquidity and market risk remains elevated, and possible DCG related holdings also indicate potentially higher risk levels. For the time being it is recommended to reduce the debt ceiling to 0. In the future if risk conditions improve the debt ceiling could be reinstated, or alternatively the vault could be offboarded at the discretion of Maker governance if it no longer fits within overall protocol strategy. YFI-A: Reduce gap to 1.5 million DAI  1336\u00d7668 60.9 KB  Similar to changes proposed to LINK-A gap above, this change normalizes the YFI-A gap against recently reduced line parameter. Compound v2 D3M: Activate with 2% bar and line of up to 10 million DAI In last month\u2019s proposal, it was recommended to activate the Compound v2 D3M with up to 160 million maximum debt ceiling and 2% bar (target borrow rate). While bar is still suitable against current conditions, idiosyncratic risks have increased and lending protocols in the past month and a smaller line of 10 million is more appropriate. The initial line at launch is expected to be 5 million DAI or possibly less depending on recommendation of the protocol engineering core unit. GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI  1330\u00d7684 65.3 KB  As Maker gains access to more productive use of stablecoin reserves, the relative value of stablecoin liquidity based vaults declines. Reduction of line to 100 million DAI will prevent further growth and should also lead to gradual decline in exposure as users decide to close their positions. This should help achieve decline in exposure while minimizing UX impacts of potential increases in stability fee. GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI  1340\u00d7682 58.8 KB  Similar to above, reducing line will help realign Maker\u2019s stablecoin positions with current opportunities. UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI  1336\u00d7674 61.3 KB  Similar to above, reducing line will prevent excessive growth and help realign Maker liquidity towards optimal positioning. PSM-USDP-A: Increase tin to 0.1% and reduce line to 450 million DAI  1332\u00d7678 51.9 KB  USDP has relatively lower on-chain usage and liquidity versus Maker\u2019s primary liquidity asset USDC. And unlike GUSD, Paxos has not committed to revenue sharing or other additional benefits to Maker. Reduction in debt ceiling to 450 million and increase in tin to 0.1% should limit increases in USDP exposure, to concentrate Maker\u2019s liquidity position in assets that provide more value to the protocol. PSM-GUSD-A: Increase tin to 0.1% and reduce tout to 0.1%  1328\u00d7676 55.8 KB  Maker has rapidly become the largest GUSD holder, supported by the recent increase in debt ceiling and tout (fee out to swap DAI to GUSD) from 0% to 0.2%. Reducing tout to 0.1% should continue to provide a sufficient barrier to alternative stablecoin issuers \u201cvampire attacking\u201d by swapping their stablecoins in GUSD\u2019s place, while increasing tin to 0.1% should disincentivize further increase in exposure. This is particularly important as the externally owned GUSD has declined by roughly 200 million in the past month, and Maker holding an outsize portion of issued tokens could increase liquidity risk on the issuer\u2019s underlying cash investment portfolio.  DAI Savings Rate Adjustment With rapidly changing rate conditions in the traditional finance space, MakerDAO can consider making adjustments to the DAI savings rate (DSR). From an affordability perspective, Maker has several new sources of revenue coming on line including revenue sharing from the GUSD PSM, Monetalis short term bonds, various potential Coinbase related opportunities, and others. These opportunities may allow Maker to significantly increase protocol revenue enough to come out ahead even taking into account an increase in cost of capital due to raising the DSR. To be able to take advantage of potential revenue opportunities, Maker needs to ensure sufficient liquidity to maintain DAI stability. Allocating capital to revenue generating opportunities will reduce balances in the USDC PSM (Maker\u2019s primary liquidity position), and increasing risk free rates may also incentivize users to offramp their capital from defi into traditional instruments such as treasury bills. Increasing the DSR may incentivize retention or increase in DAI supply, which supports Maker\u2019s liquidity position. In the longer term, maintaining a non-zero DSR could also significantly increase integrations with DAI from lending protocols (eg. Compound or Aave could deposit idle unborrowed DAI into the DSR to improve supply rates), cross chain bridges, exchanges, and other applications. Option 1: Leave DSR unchanged at 0.01% At the current rate, only roughly 1 million DAI is deposited to the DSR, with a total annual cost of 120 DAI. This provides a negligible impact on DAI demand and protocol liquidity. Option 2: Increase DSR to 0.25% Assuming no increase in DSR deposits (unlikely), total cost would increase to 3,000 DAI per year. This level of DSR is significantly below alternative on-chain yield opportunities such as depositing to lending markets or providing stableswap liquidity, but bears lower risk. However, some external platforms may integrate the DSR particularly if further gradual increases are expected. A base case estimate of 10% of current DAI supply (580 million) deposited results in 1.45 million DAI in annual cost. Option 3: Increase DSR to 0.5% This is still significantly below on-chain lending or stableswap yields, but may offer an attractive risk vs reward tradeoff to conservative users. Assuming no increase in DSR deposits, total cost would increase to 6,000 DAI per year. With a more reasonable estimate of 20% of current supply deposited, total cost would be 5.8 million DAI per year. Option 4: Increase DSR to 0.75% These levels of DSR would provide significant benefit to integrators; for example Aave\u2019s current supply rate is 1.37% on 55% utilization, which would rise to 1.67% if idle capital was deposited into the DSR. Assuming no increase in DSR deposits, total cost would increase to 9,000 DAI per year. At 30% of current supply deposited, total cost would be 13 million DAI per year. Option 5: Increase DSR to 1% This DSR rate would be near or exceeding parity with many on-chain yield sources. This may lead to some short term removal of liquidity from lending platforms or other LPs due to competition for yield, but in the longer term would incentivize 3rd party integrations wich improve DAI utility within defi. Assuming no increase in DSR deposits, total cost would increase to 12,000 DAI per year, while 40% of current supply deposited would equate to costs of 23.2 million DAI per year. Higher DSR rates would significantly increase Maker\u2019s cost base, but may be more than compensated for by improved revenue generating capacity.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WBTC-C, WSTETH-A and WSTETH-B: Stability fees We are following prior guidance to not increase stability fees on the above vault types through December 31, 2022, subject to previously stated conditions on risk premia, PSM liquidity, and asset specific factors. We will reassess potential forward guidance commitments at the next meeting. Given possible increases to the DSR in the future, it is expected that stability fees on crypto collateralized vault types will be set at least as high as the DSR to avoid creating opportunity for risk-free recursive farming at Maker\u2019s expense. GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A, and UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types are not being changed in this proposal, but may be increased in the future to ensure sufficient liquidity in PSMs and enable allocation to higher yielding opportunities. Stability fees are expected to be increased if DAI backed by PSMs falls below 40% of DAI circulating supply, and may face increases before liquidity ratios reach this threshold.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps Given that no stability fees are recommended to be changed, this proposal would be revenue neutral at current exposure levels. However, depending on the DSR changes supported by voters and subsequent change in total DSR deposits, this proposal could significantly increase cost of revenue. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain polling next week. If approved, they will be included in the next available executive vote. Voters will be able to approve or reject proposed parameter changes, and separately select their preferred value for DSR via ranked choice voting.

                    "content": "Speaking personally, I\u2019m recommending MKR holders go for the highest DSR option (1%). There are a number of considerations at play here, so I\u2019ll attempt to articulate my thought process:  Monetizing the assets on the balance sheet is increasing rapidly. With Monetalis we can cover 4x the liabilities vs the amount in this vault as the yield is currently 4%. This means we are break-even at 1.5b exposure to Monetalis with all 6b DAI invested in the DSR. Our current exposure is 500m, but the ETF structure is now easy to scale up to any number. Even if we have to run a temporary deficit of a couple hundred thousand for a month or two this is not a huge expense.  To those who want to see Monetalis make their first payment before incurring these expenses, I posit that IF they fail to make interest payments this is similar to complete theft of the funds and we should just write off the full 500m. We have already committed to these vaults, and so we should plan for the likely scenario they start interest payments in January. If they fail to pay us then overpaying 1m or so for the DSR for a month is hardly the worst of our problems.   Halt / reverse capital outflows from DeFi. As the spread between DeFi and TradFi rates increases we will likely see acceleration in the decreases of outstanding DAI. Centralized stablecoin issuers are waking up to this reality and are now offering access to this risk-free yield via programs like Coinbase Institutional. We should do the same.   Yields have proven themselves to be the ultimate marketing tool. DeFi rates have cratered in the past few months, and so this seems like a great opportunity to show that DAI holders get premium access to yields that otherwise sit behind walled gardens. 50bps is cool, but 100bps is getting more into the range where average users will start getting excited.   Merge the TradFi and DeFi base rates. I firmly believe this will happen sooner or later. We should be the ones to do it as it will be a big win for the space to halt the capital oxygen leaving the room.   Increase decentralization. With the passing of the Protocol Owned Vault MIP, additional revenue we get from increasing DAI\u2019s market cap will be funnelled into staked ETH which will reduce our reliance on stablecoins for backing. More revenue = more resilience.   In general I find Maker can sometimes move too slow on these sort of opportunities due to the very human need to move slowly into uncharted territory. I completely understand and sometimes feel similarly, but would like to stress that existential exposure to a single counter-party is existential no matter if we are at 1b or 5b exposure. We might as well dial it up and get the benefit if we must have it. ",

This means we don\u2019t simply simulate costs, but also make predictions to be disproven. In order to evaluate the success of failure of a potentially costly experiment, we may want to clearly concretize a quantitative hypothesis with a proposed causal mechanism. For example, if we increase the DSR by X%, we believe Y will happen. Y can be measured by operationalization Z. Therefore, if Z changes in the hypothesized direction, we may consider it to be possible evidence for Y. However, if Z does not change at all, we can conclude the DSR change did not deliver the anticipated outcome, disproving Y (assuming Z was an appropriate measure of Y). By defining our hypothesis up front, we can minimize post hoc reasoning in our rates strategy. The scientific method will allow us to derive more value from the cost of our experiments. ",

Agree with this in principle, although we don\u2019t have the benefit of control group so it can be tough to tease out if changes were ineffective or if their impact was counterbalanced by external factors.     CodeKnight:  Is it possible to cap the expenditure of the DSR? So it would be 1% until X dollars are reached and then diminish as more is added?   Don\u2019t think this is possible to do this automatically in the current DSR mechanism. If governance wants to set a maximum annualized cost or target DSR total deposits, periodic parameter updates would probably be able to roughly approximate this.     Jiecut:  Is this some bad timing between DSR changes and parameter changes? There\u2019d be a 1 month lag between a DSR increase and future parameter proposals.   ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B might be a bit below the DSR for the next month but the margin would be only up to 0.5% and shouldn\u2019t cause too large of an impact in the next month.     brianmcmichael:  As long as there are stables in the PSM further increasing Dai demand is folly.   IMO the best argument for increasing the DSR is to incentivize more defi integrations for DAI, rather than a direct focus on increasing circulating supply. While I\u2019m a bit more optimistic about simple RWAs such as treasury bills or stablecoin partnerships, I think Maker currently has more than enough liquidity in the PSMs to meet immediate needs.

Strategic Finance CU also provided a Build you own ALM model spreadsheet you anyone can test his hypothesis and see the implications. There is no right or wrong answers here. We might get significant outflow if we don\u2019t provide a DSR, or we might not. We might get significant inflow with a DSR or we might not. Raising DSR too quickly my take an undue cost, while raising to slowly might hit the PR effect. Those are all unknown so wisdom of crowd is best. I stand by my view that by the end of 2023/early 2024, the base yield in DeFi will be at least close to SOFR (3.8%currently). @hexonaut makes a good point that while rewards on stablecoins might be at risk, the revenues we get from MIP65 are not. Or, more precisely, if anyone doubt MIP65 revenues (also applies to Centrifuge assets), it also doubt the principal. MIP65 is indeed scalable and I see no reason not to move to 1.5B in January. If having a DSR gives us significantly more DAI (compared to not having a DSR), as long as we reinvest 50% of that in MIP65-like assets, even at 1% DSR, it is a positive for increasing the Surplus Buffer and making the protocol safer. There is also the optic that currently we look greedier than TradFi. I mean even Wells Fargo is offering 15bps. ",

I still don\u2019t see how 1% makes a difference.  I would think the capital leaving defi is going to higher rate tradfi alternatives\u2026not big banks that give nothing.  I always thought RWA vaults like Monetalis was important for putting to use excess DAI demand but I don\u2019t think it should be the main driver of revenue.  MKR\u2019s liquidity constraints, operational expenditures, and complex processes to get RWA yield means parity with tradfi rates is not possible without riskier investments being made.  If you reach parity, you are almost certainly operating at a loss that will force you to lower your rates sooner or later.  You are at a disadvantage to tradfi internet banks.  IMO, we should not try to compete here. DAI\u2019s appeal has always been its prevalence in defi integration.  I think we just need to be patient for the environment to change.  The crypto lending side of things should be getting attractive right now because loan rates are much lower than tradfi rates.  It\u2019s being hit by uncertainty in the whole decentralized space right now but once we stabilize at a lower price point, I could see lending start to pick up there.  This is where MKR works best with least amount of friction and where the focus should be.  When crypto lending starts to pick up, that\u2019s when I would start talking about raising DSR rates because now we can raise rates on excess lending demand.  What MKR needs more than anything are people who believe in crypto\u2019s future and desire to hold assets in crypto.  I would focus on incentivizing these people to stick around.  Increasing the DSR is not going to make the current headwinds for the whole space go away.  Capital is precious in this environment and it gives you more options in every situation.  I say we save what we have and wait for the next bull market. If PSMs really start to deplete, you can start talking about defending DAI demand.  It would be cheaper with lower supply so you can really crank up those rates then. Also, I don\u2019t understand why we are okay basically being the only holder of gusd\u2026. If we\u2019re going to do this, let\u2019s at least push for higher yields? ",

For example, if Maker set DSR to 1% and Aave v2 and Compound integrated it for idle liquidity, this would increase supply rates by ~0.42% for Aave (from 1.3% to 1.72%) and ~0.48% for Compound (from 1.92% to 2.4% including COMP rewards).

I understand DAI demand is falling, even backing out the GUNI vaults unwinding; but the protocol is still operating around breakeven even when MIP65 is fully ramped up. Most importantly, we do not have the RWA infrastructure in place to scale to the degree that would benefit MKR and DAI holders that people are hoping for, and I would caution rushing into this especially while DeFi rates are so deeply discounted vs TradFi and sentiment is so negative. There has been a strong desire from MKR holders to begin accumulating stETH, a productive asset that could fund the DSR in perpetuity at scale. If we\u2019re turning on the DSR to a meaningful degree, we should have a stated quantitative objective to understand the market impact and ROI. ",

When else in Maker\u2019s history has the DSR been used to sustain excess demand over vault usage? However, in the space of 2mo, DAI outstanding has dropped by at least ~1bn. So I propose a simple heuristic: for a 1% increase in DSR, the amount of DAI outstanding, all else being equal, should evolve with at least a less negative slope. You could also reframe the hypothesis for proponents of the status quo. What is the change in trend in Dai oustanding you are expecting for the same 1bps level of DSR today? RWA Strategy Either we are A) comfortable with the idea that Dai can mediate organic demand for decentralized dollars (RWA) or B) we are not (brian). If A), it follows that using tools to allow Dai holders to capture value and stay in Dai is a worthwhile capital allocation choice. If B), we should avoid it. But if we claim to press A) and avoid sharing value capture with Dai holders, we are not really giving them a compelling reason to stay. This also impacts our RWA strategy. The goal, I presume, is to eventually develop on-chain RWA tokens that can onboard permissionlessly to Maker and to any other protocol. However, in the absence of any effort to sustain organic Dai demand, the only reasonable RWA vault type is a fully liquid on-chain one, if any, that can expand and contract frictionlessly along with the supply of outstanding Dai. I do not believe this exists yet, other than GUSD/USDP/USDC and similar tokenized dollar deposits. With a DSR, we can effectively buy time for these developments to take place, perhaps through our current onboarded partners. Without it, we are betting on the largesse of Dai holders alone. While we are still far away from the threshold at which we need to unwind illiquid RWA positions, Dai outstanding has been moving only in one direction lately. Expectation Signaling The reasoning that at some point in the future Endgame plan the DSR will be greater, funded by stETH, is an expectation signal. It is objectively not as strong a signal as having a DSR today, which demonstrates willingness to fund the program. Introducing a greater than 1bps DSR rate adds Dai holders to share in the value capture, which is a reasonable development given the extent to which RWA allocations/Pigeon stance depends on them. ",

This is down from the 3.5B from peak in March, but demand for USDT and USDC have both fallen significantly during that time frame as well (about 20% and 15% respectively). Not purely an apples to apples comparison, but I think it paints a different picture.     monet-supply:  The expected path of rates over the next 1-2 years is fairly well anchored, so I wouldn\u2019t expect the fed continuing to raise rates in line with expectations to have a huge impact. If the expected terminal rate at the peak of the hike cycle increases by 1% then this would likely cause an additional outflow incentive from defi.   The current Fed created one of the largest asset bubbles in history according to many valuation metrics and the highest inflation in over four decades; part of that was their communication that rates would be held at or near zero for the next few years. Now inflation has \u201ccome out of nowhere\u201d and we\u2019re approaching a 500bp Fed Funds Rate, so I would really caution the notion that the path of rates is fairly well anchored. To reiterate on my prior post - I think this decision deserves a lot more analytical rigor given the amount of DAI that would be could be paid out through monet\u2019s estimates, especially before the RWA infrastructure is in place to support sustainably growing it longer term. As we all know we\u2019re going through a restructuring of sorts and how the DAO looks and operates is transforming dramatically. Ramping the DSR in any meaningful capacity before we have better visibility into what that will look like seems quite risky to me. ",

Messaging that we are doing a trial period signals we don\u2019t know what we are doing. It seems best to move with intention and conservatively when we talk about a spend possibly in excess of 20mm. I think aes is being both conservative and humble. Paying out the DSR is contingent on having meaningful RWA revenues, which we are hearing has a margin of error that introduces uncertainty. That means it is possible we end up with a significant deficit for an uncertain ROI. His appeal for prudence seems warranted. ",

I share the concern expressed by several that we have not sufficiently scaled our ability to turn DAI supply into yield just yet. As such I share the view that 1% DSR at the current time is premature. It is easy and quick to raise it whenever other structures are properly in place. Consistency is a valuable commodity and I think we will harm our reputation. As a consequence I don\u2019t think Maker should raise the DSR before we are comfortable leaving it at a certain level for at least 12 months. While I appreciate that if the yields aren\u2019t coming from MiP65 then the principal should be assumed lost too, there are more minor issues that we might not have discovered that needs to be resolved prior to being confident we will have a steady revenue stream (a recent example being the transfer to HVB). There are also always the matter of unknown unknowns. ",

I sense there is some apprehension around the fact that the Pot is essentially bounded to total circulating Dai so our risk exposure could go anywhere from 0 DAI to ~50m DAI a year at the highest proposed DSR rate. Final smol brain thot from me on this, but if we had a way to offer fixed-size fixed-rate fixed-term vaults for the DSR we could test out appetite for it in a risk-managed way. e.g. stDAI Vault Max capacity: 10m DAI Term: 6mos Rate: 1.5% Over time it would be cool to set the rate, lot size and maybe even term length through a Dutch auction.

Once you hand out that rate, you stand to lose more than you gain if you end up needing to turn it off / down in 6 months.   With this in mind, instead of turning the DSR on for everyone to learn from it (which means potentially having to turn it off shortly after), can we deploy a permissioned version of the DSR instead for some segment of customers? I\u2019d suggest a representative segment, as we would be more apt to learn from them, but we could instead target a segment of customers we\u2019d like to especially reward. This way we could risk a hell of a lot less and learn the same amount ",

Contributing factors include reduction in token incentives at Compound, higher D3M rates at Aave, and increase in competition among stablecoin investments (which tends to draw supply away from key lending protocols towards new farms or cross chain opportunities). However, over time Compound reward decreases should lead to a reduction in utilization rate which would drive down competitive rates. We\u2019re beginning to see this effect over the past day, shown in the chart below.  1190\u00d7846 150 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard Aave\u2019s recent change to the ETH interest rate model has helped drive up ETH supply rates and this effect is expected to continue in the coming months. Equilibrium supply rates should grow to at least 1%, which will weigh on competitiveness going forward. Compound narrowly rejected proposal 100, which would have fully removed COMP incentives on existing markets. However, it\u2019s likely the proposal will be resubmitted or modified for a less severe reduction. This will tend to drive down utilization and borrowing rates on stablecoin markets. Perp funding rates are broadly down vs the previous month, particularly on BTC products. This may be a contributory factor for declining utilization of Maker\u2019s WBTC vaults, although specific rate factors between defi lenders likely played a larger role.  1600\u00d7710 201 KB  Source: Coinglass Near launched their anticipated USN algorithmic stablecoin, offering an 11% base yield funded through NEAR staking yields on backing assets. This may draw off some demand from other stablecoins, although it bears more similarly to UST and other algo stablecoins than collateralized assets like DAI. Tron is also planning to offer an algorithmic stablecoin structured similar to UST, but targeting a 30% yield vs Anchor\u2019s current 19.5%. Anchor is slated to begin their interest rate reduction program on May 1, with rates declining 1.5% per month until reaching 15% - note this is not sharp enough of a decline to significantly impact yield reserve depletion, which will occur within 2 months unless Terra tops up the reserve again. These developments are likely to shake up the algo stablecoin space but impact on DAI demand and usage is unclear (as these products are not close substitutes from a risk perspective).  Proposed Changes  WBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%  1360\u00d7912 73.4 KB  Despite last month\u2019s fee reduction, WBTC-A continues to see weak demand. Reducing rates to parity with ETH-A vault type should bring WBTC back into competitive range against Aave and Compound, and may encourage large users to migrate their vaults back to Maker. In the past, rates near 2% have led to significant inflows, and hopefully the loss of revenues from this reduction can be more than offset by higher vault utilization (this would require around 200-250 million DAI issuance).  WBTC-B: Reduce stability fee to 4%  1354\u00d7924 48.7 KB  This stability fee reduction is correlated with WBTC-A reduction, and will help grow usage of this vault type (which has remained relatively low since launch).  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes, if confirmed, would initially reduce yearly revenue by about 5 million DAI (~7.5%), primarily due to rate decreases on WBTC-A. This may be partly or fully offset by increasing vault utilization and debt issuance. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

                    "content": "The biggest change in WBTC utilization was caused by large user(s) migrating to Aave (I believe Celsius did this recently). I expect this was driven by interest rate differentials between Aave and Maker - our effective cost of borrowing was nearly a full % point higher. These changes would eliminate the rate differential and should hopefully lead to the large user(s) returning to Maker - if this happens then the negative impact on revenues would be reduced or eliminated. A bit of a risk (assuming they don\u2019t return to Maker, we will be out a large chunk of money with little to show for it), but I think it\u2019s the right move. We should also consider the possibility of additional WBTC outflows in the coming month if our rates remain uncompetitive vs the broader defi market. ",

That option may work short-term, until someone else finds a way to offer even lower rates . The problem is, it comes at a cost. Every time Maker reduces SFs, something has to be sacrificed. The quality and services of the DAO may drop, or the protocol may have to cut Core Unit personnel. We are pretty much slashing profit margins. And each time the DAO undercuts the competitors, I believe the value of Vaults lessens. Fighting the battle to be cheapest becomes an endless soap-opera of sacrifices, TBH. Sometimes in life you need to stand out by going against the grain. Don\u2019t fight to be below, strive to be above, right? ",

Large cap assets including ETH and BTC are down over 20% since the end of April. The key drivers of the market turn over the past month include macroeconomic headwinds and the Terra protocol crash. On macro conditions, USD rates have continued to rise on expectations of further monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve. This has pushed down asset prices across the board, with crypto and other growth sectors most heavily impacted. If tightening continues as planned, defi may begin to see larger impacts of liquidity withdrawals once tradfi cash rates (money market funds, short term treasuries, etc) begin to surpass current defi yields. The collapse of Terra\u2019s UST algorithmic stablecoin was a key negative catalyst over the past month. Several integrated protocols such as Blizz (lending protocol on Avalanche), Venus (lending and stablecoin protocol on BNB chain), and Kava (lending and stablecoin focused Cosmos app chain) faced losses connected to LUNA or UST price crashes. Several other assets including USDN and DEI also faced pressure due to loss of confidence in undercollateralized stablecoins more generally. Movement away from undercollateralized stablecoins presents an opportunity for DAI to gain marketshare across the stablecoin space, particularly in the Cosmos ecosystem where UST was most heavily integrated. Stablecoin fears also impacted USDT, which briefly fell as low as $0.95 during the Terra collapse before recovering to trade around $0.999 currently. Due to Tether\u2019s 0.1% redemption fee, this small discount is likely to persist until user demand for USDT increases organically as there is currently no arbitrage profit opportunity for redemption. A secondary effect here has been significant reduction in non-USDT liquidity available on Curve, with around 75% of the 3pool is currently held in USDT. While USDT has processed billions in redemptions without issue so far, there\u2019s some concern that continued withdrawal pressure could deplete Tether\u2019s most liquid assets and increase risk for remaining USDT holders.  1250\u00d7706 35.3 KB  Source: Coingecko Average defi borrowing costs are down sharply from last month. Many farming positions have been unwinding on Aave and Compound, which tends to reduce market utilization and borrowing rates. This also reflects the general bearish sentiment with lower leverage demand and lower borrowing capacity due to falling collateral values. At the time of writing, Maker\u2019s Aave D3M has fully removed liquidity with borrowing costs below the target rate. The Aave liquidity incentive program recently expired, which should increase effective borrowing costs in the short term but may lead to lower utilization and borrow rates as recursive leverage positions unwind.  1484\u00d7892 172 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard Perp funding rates trended down sharply during the depths of the Terra collapse, but have returned to relative equilibrium across both BTC and ETH.  1600\u00d7710 157 KB  Source: Coinglass BTC  1580\u00d7810 158 KB  Source: Coinglass ETH stETH faced a significant loss of peg following the Terra crisis, falling as low as 0.95 ETH before recovering to trade between 0.97-0.98 over the past week. This was driven by a combination of large LP withdrawals, fear over potential liquidations of leveraged staking users on Aave, and excess supply migrating from Terra\u2019s Anchor protocol. Lido helped facilitate price support by adding additional incentives to a new concentrated liquidity pool on Curve, but we could see renewed instability if these incentives are not renewed or if users are forced to deleverage in a further market crash. Maker has relatively high protection against stETH depegging with a larger liquidation ratio buffer vs comparable ETH vaults, and embedded overcollateralization in Aave D3M exposure.  1222\u00d7700 65.8 KB  Source: Coingecko  Proposed Changes  LINK-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 50 million DAI  1600\u00d7694 153 KB  LINK has faced declining liquidity and trading volumes for some time, which weigh on risk metrics. Reducing debt ceiling should lower risk from this collateral without significantly impacting user experience as the current utilization is well below 50 million DAI.  WSTETH-A: Reduce maximum debt ceiling to 200 million DAI  1600\u00d7706 140 KB  stETH has faced significant market stress over the past month. While Maker has relatively good protection against stETH losing peg, with WSTETH-A vault type using 160% liquidation ratio vs 145% for ETH-A, it is still prudent from a risk perspective to limit exposure until liquidity conditions improve. It\u2019s unlikely this would limit utilization over the next month as existing usage is below 100 million DAI.  WSTETH-B: Increase gap to 30 million DAI Increasing the gap makes it easier for users to open new positions or migrate positions to the WSTETH-B vault type. With current pressure on stETH peg and liquidity, it makes sense for Maker to encourage usage of the higher collateralization vault option.  MANA-A: Increase maximum debt ceiling to 15 million DAI  1600\u00d7705 113 KB  The 10m debt ceiling got fully utilized in the past month, mostly by MANA treasury minting from multiple vaults. Risk is limited as vaults have debt weighted collateralization ratio of 650%, but on-chain slippage of MANA is very poor (42% slippage when selling $5m MANA). We therefore suggest a cautious 5m increase in DC.  DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI: Reduce bar to 2.75% and reduce debt ceiling to 100 million DAI  1600\u00d7710 169 KB  The Aave D3M has entirely unwound over the past month, as borrowing rates fell below Maker\u2019s target rate (bar) of 3.5%. Reducing the target rate to 2.75% corresponds with rate reductions proposed on ETH-A and WBTC-A vaults, and should lead to roughly 25 million DAI generated assuming current supply and borrowing volumes. Reducing debt ceiling will limit tail risk and ensure the D3M stays within the 30% of real DAI supply target.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-C, WBTC-A, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through August 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the rolling 7 day average indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through August 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the rolling 7 day average indicative risk premium (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps The proposed changes would not have any direct impact on revenue, but may indirectly increase revenues if Aave D3M exposure increases. Offering forward guidance may also help increase borrowing demand but on the other hand could curtail near term prospects of rate increases if the market turns around. Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",

As AAVE rewards have been shut down a lot of DAI-supply(and demand) has vanished from AAVE, which makes it  necessary to reduce the line  possible to decrease the bar again as D3M-bar is internally competing against ETH-A stability fees - and since the reward-incentive at AAVE is gone, the effective rate is down as well.  Even with a low line the D3M does provide  soft-capped rates (as long as the line is not maxed out) for DAI-borrowers (which is a USP compared to other stablecoins) (some) revenue that we would otherwise not capture ourselfs as long as we don\u2019t cannibalize ETH-A  ",

                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee  Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi Option 1  1600\u00d7487 291 KB  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates - Updates for September 2022 (Option 1) Option 2  1600\u00d7487 291 KB  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates - Updates for September 2022 (Option 2)  Lending Market Overview While lending markets have largely stabilized from the impact of 3AC insolvency and Terra collapse, the upcoming merge is causing some disruptions across ETH based defi protocols. Direct impacts to Maker are relatively low, but pooled lending protocols including Aave, Compound, and Euler could see some disruption due to incentives to withdraw or borrow ETH liquidity from pools to claim possible ETHPOW fork airdrops. See this thread for more details.  816\u00d7674 51.3 KB  Source: Coingecko stETH This is partially reflected in continuing discount for stETH vs ETH, as stETH deposits are not expected to be redeemable on POW fork chains and would lose out on opportunity for fork token value. Possibility of spikes in ETH borrow rates on Aave and Euler (venues for leveraged staking trade) as well as withdraw of ETH liquidity from stETH DEX pools could cause increasing downside price pressure on stETH as the merge approaches (expected mid September). However, Maker\u2019s higher liquidation ratios (compared with ETH vaults) provides significant protection against losses from these vault types. Defi rates are fairly level with last month, but effective borrowing costs we track have declined primarily due to significant increase in utilization of Aave\u2019s aETH market.This has increased deposit yield for ETH collateral users on Aave and offset effective borrowing costs. It is unclear what direct impact this has on user preference of Maker vs alternatives, because the increase in deposit yield is accompanied by higher risk. This makes it more difficult to make direct comparisons between Maker vaults and competing products until the merge has been completed.  1338\u00d7742 75.9 KB  Source: Blockanalitica dashboard Despite a decent wipe of leverage in the middle of the month, open interest on Ethereum futures/perpetuals seems to be continuing its uptrend from the past month. This may indicate growing market confidence and leverage demand, or potentially greater hedging demand as some traders put on delta neutral (long spot ETH, short derivatives) trades in expectation of fork airdrops to ETH holders.  1600\u00d7807 113 KB  Source: Coinalyze Another key change over the past month is the US OFAC agency\u2019s imposition of sanctions on Tornado Cash smart contracts. This could indicate increasing risk for direct holdings of censorable assets such as USDC. While impact seems isolated for now, this may have further impact on Maker\u2019s overall parameter setting strategy, including a greater focus on reducing the share of DAI backed by PSMs.  Proposed Changes (Option 1) This proposal option includes a small number of parameter changes, and results in a relatively small decline in revenue at constant exposure levels (~225,000 DAI per year, roughly 1.5% of current revenue run rate).  WSTETH-B: Increase maximum debt ceiling to 200 million DAI  1190\u00d7514 34.3 KB  After last month\u2019s reduction in stability fees to 0%, this vault type has seen strong supply growth and is now approaching the existing 100 million DAI debt ceiling. The proposed increase will allow for further increase in usage.  CRVV1ETHSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 2%, increase GAP to 10 million DAI, and increase maximum debt ceiling to 50 million DAI  1192\u00d7516 34.9 KB  The CRVV1ETHSTETH vault has not seen significant usage, deposit offering the highest total yield available on stETH vaults (currently around 8%). This may be due to cost constraints, as well as relatively low debt ceilings preventing larger players from deploying significant amounts of capital. The proposed changes will allow for this vault type to scale up significantly and also encourage more usage with lower borrowing costs (2% vs previous 2.25%).  MANA-A: Reduce stability fee to 4.5%  1178\u00d7514 46.7 KB  Recently, a Decentraland contributor proposed a reduction in stability fee via this signal request. Reduction of stability fees from 6% to 4.5% is proposed, which implies a 25% reduction in effective borrowing costs. This is not reducing rates all the way down to 3% value mentioned in the signal due to relatively higher risk and lower liquidity versus other Maker collateral assets. In particular, recent price decline in MANA has pushed certain larger vaults to a lower collateralization level, as shown on Maker risk dashboard. This also flows through to greater expected capital at risk.  862\u00d7440 22.8 KB   1106\u00d7360 113 KB  Source: Maker risk dashboard  Proposed Changes (Option 2) The below changes for option 2 are proposed in addition to changes listed above. This option includes large reductions in stability fees for core vault types, and is intended to increase Maker\u2019s market share and collateralization from key crypto native assets. Recent experience with last month\u2019s reduction in WSTETH-B stability fee, and corresponding increase in exposure, show some evidence that vault users may be more rate sensitive, so these changes could lead to growth in exposure to revenue generating vault types. However, at constant exposure levels this would result in a larger decline in revenue (~2.8 million DAI, ~17.2% of current run rate).  ETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 1.5%  1188\u00d7510 43.9 KB  The ETH-A vault has seen significant outflows over the past months, and Maker has remained steady at 2.25% stability fee despite these declines in usage. The stability fee reduction is proposed to help reverse this downtrend and gain back greater exposure to ETH collateral.  ETH-B: Reduce stability fee to 3%  1186\u00d7514 50.3 KB  Similar to ETH-A change above, reduction in ETH-B stability fee from 3.75% to 3% is proposed to try to gain greater exposure to ETH collateral within the Maker protocol. This change is also supported by relatively low risk from ETH-B vault type compared with historical levels, where the proposed stability fee would still adequately compensate for risk.  WSTETH-A: Reduce stability fee to 1.5%  1188\u00d7516 47.9 KB  This stability fee change (from 2.25% to 1.5%) aligns with ETH-A and ETH-B changes, and is intended to increase usage of revenue generating, decentralized vault types. While stETH has greater liquidity and insolvency risk vs ETH, this is compensated via the higher collateralization ratio of the WSTETH-A vault (160% vs 145%) which should protect Maker against even significant expansions in the discount.  WBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 2%  1184\u00d7520 47.6 KB  This reduction in stability fee from 2.25% to 2% is proposed to incentivize greater vault usage. A spread between ETH and WBTC vault types is proposed to account for the greater centralization and custody risks inherent in WBTC.  WBTC-B: Reduce stability fee to 3.5%  1190\u00d7522 36.6 KB  The WBTC-B vault type has yet to see significant utilization, despite being a potentially compelling product for BTC collateralized borrowing. This rate reduction from 3.75% to 3.5% is intended to increase exposure to high revenue vault types while still maintaining a rate spread vs ETH-B to account for higher centralization risk.  RENBTC-A: Reduce stability fee to 2.25%  1180\u00d7504 47 KB  RENBTC stability fee reduction from 2.5% to 2.25% is proposed in line with above quarter percent reductions in WBTC vault types. While RENBTC has weaker liquidity and potentially higher risk of loss due to technical issues, this is offset with a higher collateralization ratio vs WBTC-A. Ren also has the potential to improve censorship resistance over time as they increase decentralization in their underlying bridging protocol.  Forward Guidance on Parameter Changes Below are a set of forward guidance commitments on future parameter changes. This is intended to give vault users and other system stakeholders greater confidence to interact with the Maker protocol, which should help improve utilization and monetary policy effectiveness. Forward guidance commitments are non-binding on either PPG-OMC-001 or Maker governance, and simply represent the committee\u2019s current intent towards parameter changes. We hope to build trust with stakeholders over time by adhering to forward guidance commitments wherever possible and clearly specifying conditions where guidance may be adjusted or terminated. ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, and WBTC-C: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through October 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply or (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee. WSTETH-A and WSTETH-B: Stability fees Stability fees on the above vault types should not be increased through October 31, 2022. This commitment will be terminated if (1) DAI generated from peg stability modules falls below 30% of total DAI supply, (2) the indicative risk premium of a covered vault type (as determined by the risk core unit) rises 2% or more above the vault\u2019s stability fee, or (3) the price of stETH falls below 0.97 ETH.  Proposal Impact and Next Steps While both proposals would cause a decline in revenues at constant exposure levels, impact depends on which option gains greater support among MKR voters. Option 1 would have a relatively negligible impact on revenue (~2%), while option 2 would have a more significant impact (~17%). Proposed changes will be submitted for on chain voting next week. Because there are multiple options presented, this poll will be structured as a ranked choice vote between option 1, option 2, and no changes.  Notes:  Risk premiums and maximum debt ceilings are calculated based on recent market conditions Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards on Compound and Aave, as well as interest and rewards earned on deposited collateral Lending products are not standardized across defi and cefi lenders, and therefore rates can not be strictly compared on a like for like basis  ",
