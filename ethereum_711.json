Ethereum ecosystem teams e.g. EF-funded projects, ConsenSys projects, etc. could get preferred access to the work, but have to pay far more than if they had granted full funding early-on. 3YTO units would be free to sell access to the work to anyone, including Ethereum competitors, but the 3 year open source release rule would have to be maintained.
