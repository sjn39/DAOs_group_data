                    "content": "MIP6 PEOPLES COMPANY Thread Title:  [P1-DROP] MIP6 Application: Peoples Company DROP: US Agricultural Real Estate This MIP6 Proposal will finance an special purpose vehicle (\u201cSPV\u201d) established by Peoples Company or owners or affiliates thereof (the \u201cIssuer\u201d) to acquire U.S. farm properties. Upon acquisition of a farm property, the Issuer will be the legal owner of the farm property and will hold the title to each farm property. This is the sixth MIP6 application to use Centrifuge\u2019s model.  1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The Issuer will source and manage farm properties. It will create and own non-fungible tokens (\u201cNFTs\u201d) that represent each farm property title. It will lock their NFT\u2019s into the Tinlake protocol to serve as collateral. The Issuer will pool its assets and offer ERC-20 tokens to investors, specifically DROP Tokens and TIN Tokens. Centrifuge: will provide the technology and framework for bringing real-world assets to MCD. The main contact on Tinlake for the application is Jason Jones (@Jason, [email\u00a0protected]) as well as Lucas Vogelsang (@spin, [email\u00a0protected]) of Centrifuge.  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Peoples Company farmland real estate is part of Centrifuge\u2019s real-world assets series. The Issuer will utilize MCD as a revolving line of credit to purchase new farmland. The Issuer expects to draw Dai up to its assigned debt ceiling in roughly six to nine months and will seek an increase to its debt ceiling once 75% of the initial line amount is disbursed. Farm land assets have the following characteristics: US Farmland offers several investment benefits including portfolio diversification, low to negative correlation with public equities and positive correlation with inflation. There is more than $3 trillion worth of farm real estate in the US and close to 400 million acres of cropland. The farmland asset class has been one of the best performing asset classes over the past twenty years.  631\u00d7541 39.1 KB  The following describes an exemplary use case  602\u00d7649 162 KB  In January 2020, SPV Larsen Farm, LLLP (the \u201cFarm\u201d), an affiliate of Peoples Company, acquired an 80-acre property located in South Central Iowa just outside of the Des Moines Metro area for approximately $320,000. The asset includes 70 acres of land suitable for transition to tillable farmland and a 5-acre building site. The Farm is eligible to receive USDA organic certification to produce organic fees grain products. Peoples Company owns and manages the farmland. Located in Madison Country, Iowa, the Farm was enrolled in a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) through the Farm Service Agency in 2009. Due to there being no application of synthetic chemicals or fertilizer on the Farm throughout the ten-year duration of enrollment, the Farm became eligible for organic production immediately after exiting the program in October 2019. The Farm is eligible to grow organically certified corn, soybeans, oats, and edible beans. Organic certification is actively being pursued by the Farm through International Certification Services, Inc. Being in the heart of the Corn Belt and just outside of the Des Moines Metro, the Farm is highly sought after by farm operators. This location is associated with strong agricultural production and therefore experiences consistent tenant occupancy. The Farm has been transitioned to tillable farmland through a ground preparation process that entailed controlled burning, clearing trees and brush, and discing the land to prepare for planting, while improving soil health and stimulating growth. Opportunities exist for yield optimization through soil drainage improvements that will improve crop health and provide better condition for completing field operations. This collateral application uses the Centrifuge model and proposes the DROP token [P1-DROP] of Peoples Company\u2019s asset pool as collateral. A detailed overview of Centrifuge\u2019s technology stack can be found here. Legal Setup While the specific details of the legal setup are forthcoming, at a high level Peoples Company will form its own SPV for the acquisition of farm properties. The SPV will enter into a service agreement with Centrifuge to get support from Centrifuge while using Centrifuge\u2019s open and decentralized infrastructure. The SPV will tokenize the titles of each of its farm properties into NFTs and will add those NFTs to Tinlake as collateral. The SPV will utilize Tinlake to issue P1-DROP and P1-TIN backed by the pool of NFTs that are locked in Tinlake. Peoples Company will purchase the P1-TIN tokens and will lock the P1-DROP tokens into a MakerDAO Vault. Find the documentation to the two-tranche structure here.  1298\u00d7641 47 KB   3. Provide a brief history of the project About Peoples Company  1153\u00d7272 87.1 KB  Peoples Company\u2019s history began in the 1960s and was established in the farm management department of Peoples Trust and Savings Bank in Indianola, Iowa. In 1972, the farm management department and real estate brokerage separated from the bank into what is now known as Peoples Company. In 2002, the current ownership team acquired the majority interest of the company. Peoples Company operates one of the leading farm land brokerages in the country, with annual transaction volume of over $400 million. Peoples Company offers land brokerage, land management, land investment, and appraisal services in 26 states throughout the US. The company has consistently been named a \u201cTop Brokerage in America\u201d and a \u201cTop 30 Auction House\u201d by the Land Report, an industry-leading publication targeted toward the American landowner. About Centrifuge Centrifuge has built a technology solution for businesses such as Peoples Company to use their assets as collateral, turn them into fungible ERC20 tokens and borrow money against them through DeFi protocols. With Tinlake Centrifuge has over 1M DAI locked in a number of different asset pools since the launch of v3 end of October and deployed capital from over 100 real people around the world. Over the past months we have worked closely with the different domain teams to onboard the first two of our partners, New Silver and ConsolFreight shortly. This MIP6 application is the sixth MIP6 application to use Centrifuge (see previous applications: NS-DROP, CF-DROP, HTC-DROP, PC-DROP, KF-DROP) and there are more in the pipeline. We intend to grow DeFi massively and generate DAI from many different uncorrelated asset originators. Our goal is that Maker will be backed 30% by real word assets by the end of 2021.  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Peoples Company mainnet deployment will be accessible via tinlake.centrifuge.io Technical documentation about Tinlake can be found here: GitHub - centrifuge/tinlake: bringing individual, non-fungible assets to DeFi and the Maker specific implementation here: GitHub - centrifuge/tinlake-maker-lib  5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Centrifuge has conducted several audits of its technology stack. The audits can be found here:  security/audits at master \u00b7 centrifuge/security \u00b7 GitHub   6. Link to any active communities relating to your project.   Centrifuge Discourse Forum Maker Collateral Onboarding Calls: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? The SPV will be financed by issuing DROP Tokens for 90% of the net asset value of the pool of NFTs plus cash on hand (collectively \u201cPool Valuation\u201d) and TIN Tokens for 10% of the Pool Valuation. The Issuer expects to launch with 10 million Dai increasing to 20 million Dai when 75% of the initial line amount is disbursed. It will initially seek 9 million Dai from MakerDAO, increasing to 18 million. The Issuer expects to invest in farmlands that have an average value of $500,000 to $1,000,000 and expects to hold farmland over the long period of time, potentially up to 30 years. Upon the sale of a farm property, the Issuer will repay the outstanding balance drawn against the farm property NFT and accrued interest thereon. All of the farms in the pool will have similar risk characteristics including high quality soil productivity, soil profile, slope characteristics, water availability and weather conditions. The Issuer will provide MakerDAO with a put option, which it can utilize if it ever needs to liquidate. After the first 6 months, MakerDAO will have the right, but not the obligation to sell its ownership of DROP tokens to the Issuer, in whole or in part, upon 90 days notice. The Issuer will work in good faith on a best efforts basis to find one or more buyers for farm properties and will only purchase the DROP tokens from MakerDAO if it successfully sells farm properties to a new buyer. If the farm properties are not sold within 90 days, then the Issuer will have another 90 days to sell the farm properties. This process will continue until the Issuer has fulfilled the MakerDAO\u2019s sell request. The Issuer has a proven long term track record of selling farm properties. Peoples Company completes about $400 million in farm auctions per year, which is about 400 transactions per year. Peoples Company average time to sell a farm is 90 days. The Issuer is able to obtain bank financing for a revolving line of credit at about 3.26% fixed with an 80% loan-to-value or 2.67% fixed with a 50% loan-to-value (as of November 2020). The Issuer will seek a lower Stability Fee from MakerDAO because 1) the Stability Fee is variable versus the bank rates, which are fixed rates, 2) MakerDAO has a put option, and 3) the Issuer will be taking early stage risk versus taking a loan from the bank.  8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Peoples Company will bear legal responsibility for the collateral. This SPV structure creates a bankruptcy-remote entity whereby owners, debt holders or interested parties of this newly created SPV are left unaffected by the parent\u2019s financial, operational and/or legal health.  9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The SPV enters into a subscription agreement with lenders who receive DROP from the SPV in turn for providing DAI. The DROP token can be redeemed against the cash flows of the underlying collateral directly from the SPV by any DROP holder. This is ensured by the Tinlake smart contracts and the primary way for interacting with these tokens.  10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We do not have any materials we can provide at this time.  11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  The issuance of DROP and TIN tokens is handled via Securitize, with AML/KYC procedures and compliance with US securities guidelines. Investors based in the US must be accredited investors (generally defined as having a net worth of at least $1 million). The SPV issues DROP tokens for the Maker vault, and Centrifuge will post legal discussion about potential implications for Maker.  12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. The Issuer will provide annual appraisals for each farm property, which will be used to value the NFTs. If an appraisal submitted by the Issuer shows a decrease in the total appraised value of a farm property then the value of the NFT will be marked down. If, as a result of such mark down, the outstanding value of the DROP Tokens increases to more than 90% of the Pool Valuation, then Tinlake will lock the Issuer from drawing any further Dai and will lock the TIN investors from redeeming. The Issuer may restore balance and unlock Tinlake by: (1) buying additional TIN tokens so that the proceeds will increase the cash reserve in an amount necessary to cause the value of outstanding DROP Tokens to be no more than 90% of the Pool Valuation or (ii) redeem DROP Tokens in an amount necessary to restore the value of outstanding DROP Tokens to no more than 90% of the Pool Valuation. If an appraisal submitted by the Issuer shows an increase in the total appraised value of all farm properties, the Issuer may: (i) draw additional amounts from the Financing Line to be funded by DROP Tokens up to the amount that would cause the total outstanding DROP Tokens to equal 90% of the Pool Valuation or (ii) withdraw TIN Tokens to restore the ratio of the value of the outstanding DROP Tokens to the value of the outstanding TIN Tokens to 90/10 or (iii) do nothing, which will effectively over collateralize the pool of assets by the excess value of the TIN Tokens.  13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. The Issuer will provide MakerDAO with a put option, which it can utilize if it ever needs to liquidate. After the first 6 months, MakerDAO will have the right, but not the obligation to sell its ownership of DROP tokens to the Issuer, in whole or in part, upon 90 days notice. The Issuer will work in good faith on a best efforts basis to find one or more buyers for farm properties and will only purchase the DROP tokens from MakerDAO if it successfully sells farm properties to a new buyer. If the farm properties are not sold within 90 days, then the Issuer will have another 90 days to sell the farm properties. This process will continue until the Issuer has fulfilled the MakerDAO\u2019s sell request. The Issuer has a proven long term track record of selling farm properties. Peoples Company completes about 400 farm auctions per year worth over $400 million. Peoples Company average time to sell a farm is 90 days. ",

If you look at the above chart the value of farmland is steadily growing and has since 1970 only had a few years with lower year-on-year prices. Farmland is however already used as fiat bank collateral so my question is more from a legal aspect: if a foreclosure should happen, what priority would be given to P1-DROP if Peoples Company already has fiat bank financing? Sidenote: @spin, @SebVentures, @mrabino1  I think maybe it is time to think about adding an abstraction layer to the Centrifuge real world assets. There are how many farms and businesses similar to Peoples Company? Multiple thousands in the US alone? There is no way Maker governance can handle this on a company level. I am going to make a bold suggestion: we need a fund with structure similar to 6s Capital but focused on agricultural real estate.  Then the Centrifuge applications go there instead of directly to Maker. At least the applications would have a chance of getting processed in a better timeframe. EDIT: I question the above rates of 2.67% - 3.26%. https://www.farmlandinvestorcenter.com/landowner-resources/farm-mortgage-rate-watch#:~:text=Banks%20charged%20an%20average%206.0,in%20the%20Minneapolis%20fed%20district the rates listed here are far higher.

Fully agree, soon, IMO, we will do wholesale and expect the SPV to be managed by an asset manager that has no link with the borrower. That is needed to avoid any conflict of interest and having strong diversification. Currently, the cleanest structure is NS-DROP. Adding a trust doesn\u2019t change much this problem. But I don\u2019t feel we are BlackStone ready to ask them to manage assets under a Tinlake pool. And I personally like the fact that we have asset originators who really know their business.

Farm Land is slightly less liquid but this is structured never the less with this goal in mind:  Quickly scale up DAI supply by offering an attractive interest rate Reduce DAI supply whenever necessary through by making the debt in the Vault callable within 90 days  There isn\u2019t really a comparable rate in the traditional world as all of these bank line of credits and traditional rates are for multiple years. The rates that are stated in the MIP6 above are the rates that Peoples Company is currently (as of November 2020) able to obtain depending on the LTV (3.26% with 80% LTV and 2.67% with a 50% LTV). As shown in the source you provided the average interest rate projection for December 2020 are at 3.55%. Peoples Company is asking Maker to be competitive with these rates as the loan would be callable by Maker short term (upon 90 days notice). This means for Maker that they have flexible Dai supply in substantial volumes and Peoples would profit making use of the low interest rates instead of the fixed rates they\u2019d get from their bank. This short term option to liquidate comes at a cost for Peoples: they can\u2019t just build up the portfolio and forget about it but need to have capacity to shrink the vault whenever necessary ",

Farmland has good properties that often diverge from other asset classes.  It is a decent hedge against modest inflation, but not sharp inflation, and has obviously been a very investable asset class over time.  The questions that I would ask are 1) this particular farm with CRP is going to be a higher risk fringe farm.  Which is why it was taken out of production to begin with.  Nothing wrong with that, as there might be huge upside to converting it to organic tillable, but it isn\u2019t the same as high quality Iowa farmground.  2)  My worry is that there is an inherent risk of peg breaking between dai and the real world asset.  In the case of farmground, would be lucky to get cash rents in the 2-3% range.  If the long term, dai appreciates vis a vi the dollar, there is a risk that the USD denominated rents can\u2019t keep up.  This is why, it might make more sense in the near term to focus on higher risk, higher return real world assets.  3)  I do think that Peoples company would be a very good and reputable partner for these types of \u201cproperty\u201d management.  4)  The asset risk of depreciation is mitigated by the leverage rate obviously.  For lack of better term, the industry standard is probably 65% loan to value, with some periods of loan to asset going as high as 75%.  My 2c ",

Growing global population and increasing wealth in developing markets provide strong demand fundamentals for high quality farmland that produces basic crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, etc.  Additionally, the U.S. is the #1 or #2 grower and exporter of key crops like corn and soybeans.  However, the supply of U.S. farmland is actually shrinking at gradual pace as cities/towns grow and land is converted to other uses.  These factors suggest (can\u2019t guaranty of course) that farmland will grow in value.  Also important to land value performance is technology.  As farmers adopt technologies for better seeds, cost management, soil improvement, higher crop yields, etc., farming margins will improve and this should boost land values.  Finally, sustainable agricultural practices and organic production are becoming more widely adopted due to consumer demands.  These practices will protect and improve long term soil health and water resources and support land values. ",

I suspect the reason for this is related to interest rates being sky-high. In a world where the ten-year treasury is at 1% or less, I do not see a way for farmland to drop 80%. If interest rates do hit 15% why would MakerDAO bother lending to RWAs? Might as well just invest in treasuries and call it a day. Furthermore, the Fed has signaled that interest rates will remain where they are for the next 4 years (at least). So I expect asset price inflation to go up and interest rates down.

But I don\u2019t really understand the explicit guarantees that are provided by the Tinlake system.  Maybe there is additional recourse to those assets drop/tin that I am not understanding.  Or maybe this is just a year to year revolver. ",

After the first 6 months, MakerDAO will have the right, but not the obligation to sell its ownership of DROP tokens to the Issuer, in whole or in part, upon 90 days notice. The Issuer will work in good faith on a best efforts basis to find one or more buyers for farm properties and will only purchase the DROP tokens from MakerDAO if it successfully sells farm properties to a new buyer.   I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand this at all - it\u2019s just not how loans work.

So far they have introduced their management team and the farmland asset class to the community. Peoples has brought in their CEO, their head of Asset Management, and a leading professor on farmland assets to talk to the Maker community. The purpose has been to give the community enough information to determine whether this team and this asset should pass the community greenlight process so that the Maker domain teams can work on structuring a deal. Hopefully Peoples has established that farmland assets are stable, that Peoples is a legitimate team, and that this project is worthy of a community greenlight. I think the community greenlight poll will start next Monday. If Peoples receives a community greenlight, then the next step will be to structure terms that work with Peoples and with Maker. Peoples will work through a framework for key terms with the RWA risk team with the premise that we should work together to design terms that will be conducive for the Maker community. We will look at how Peoples has previously structured deals with banks and then we will design something that works with Maker. We are at an early stage with this process and we invite anyone who wants to get into the details to join the risk team in these conversations as we focus on designing a term structure. Once we design the terms, then Peoples can present a proposed term sheet to the community for comments and we can iterate if the community generates legitimate ideas. We see the commentary in this thread and we will address every one of these concerns with the risk team as we design this structure. This is a collaborative effort. If we like the asset class and the team, then let\u2019s vote for a greenlight and get to work on structuring the deal. If you have an questions, please feel free to share here, reach out to me or other members of the Centrifuge team, or reach out directly to Mark at Peoples. Thanks all! Jason ",

If farmland as an asset class isn\u2019t performing then indeed the PUT option is not the ideal structure here, but would still work: Peoples (and other junior investors) stand to loose all of their junior investment if the senior investors (incl.

Why would you say the SPV is not bankruptcy remote? In case of an asset originator bankruptcy, the assets in the SPV can not be used to settle the AOs debts before any claims against the SPV are settled (this would be the junior & senior investors). A way to ensure these loans are serviced even when a the AO is not operational anymore is to instate a professional backup servicer to manage the SPV. This is a rather common structure used in the credit world. As @g_dip  mentioned, a rather interesting option for this collateral type could be to adopt the structure that MIP21 proposes. And in the long run this might be the safest option however there are still many open questions around it and to date I don\u2019t think the trust with MakerDAO as a beneficiary has been formed yet. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the progress here! ",

If you know anything about nutrition, you should know that vastly better health outcomes are obtained on a plant-based diet in comparison to a diet that includes animal products (see What the Health). Hence, I expect agricultural real estate to decline in value dramatically over the next few decades because plant-based food takes a lot less space and water to grow in comparison to animal-based food products. A lot of this currently occupied land can be dedicated back to nature, rewilding, even as human populations grow numerically. ",

I can not agree more that reviewing company by company is not gonna be a working model in long term. That is why we are working to provide a working solution for this problem and will submit an official proposal by the end of the month. However, our proposal is not gonna solve the problem with all potential RWA as our expertise is in Commercial Real Estate. Nevertheless, the right teams are going to be able to replicate the model in other RWA as well. ",

Its nutritional values and less presence of hormones, antibiotics etc compared to cage cattle farming will harvest a premium price. This requires more extensive agriculture leading to demand for quality pasturing land You assume that people will change behaviour because it is better for their health. Humans have been omnivores for millions of years, so I am not too sure easy it will be to go against evolution  ",

MIP22 provides for Tinlake to be the liquidation route, but isn\u2019t appropriate for this type of asset under management, and also hasn\u2019t actually been tested in the real world yet, I believe? Is the only liquidation mechanism proposed that the party borrowing directly from Maker (the SPV) is in charge of its own liquidation process? As far as oracles go, how can we make this easier on the Oracles CU? Because at the moment we have plans for Oracle price being adjusted by executive vote, and then moving towards the DAO taking on the overhead of independent auditors. This seems in the first phase extremely risky and in the second extremely expensive. Thanks in advance for clarification. Very excited to see farmland assets under management and farmland revenues as the DROP collateral. ",
