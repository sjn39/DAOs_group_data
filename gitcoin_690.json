            "body": "tl;dr - there are three core categories of changes we seek to ratify:\n1 - Foundation updates to adopt new M&A docs, new bylaws and to convert the foundation to an ownerless foundation\n2 - DAO updates to adopt the v3 gov process that was is live on the forums\n3 - Asset Transfer updates to approve the negotiations with Gitcoin Holdings to take ownership of the network, Gitcoin trademark, assets and liability for those assets, socials, etc.\n\nFoundation Updates:\nWe have a new set of proposed governing documents for the Foundation that would memorialize the Foundation\u2019s operating rules. These include a new Memorandum of Association and Bylaws. These docs have been reviewed by community members (including friends at LexDAO, and our own legal counsel) without any objections, and at this time we believe they are ready to be submitted for approval and ratification. These documents generally direct the Foundation to carry out DAO governance decisions (per our governance process - see update below), subject to statutory or other legal limits. They also allow the Foundation or its subsidiaries to spend capital within its control (ie assets transferred, not the treasury) to advance protocol development until Grants 2.0 is operational and comply with legal and other core requirements (like establishing AML processes, hiring accounting firms, etc).\n\nAs part of the ratification of the updated governing documents for the Foundation, it will also become \u201cownerless\u201d, meaning it will have no shareholders to whom fiduciary duties or other obligations are owed (one shareholder was initially required to be able to form it under Cayman law) and instead will be able to act in accordance with DAO governance without any obligations to any equity holders.\n\nOperating as an ownerless foundation will, however, increase the complexity for KYC purposes, including anti-money laundering and sanctions laws compliance, and also for certain other diligence purposes and interactions with the real world. But we believe that any such inconvenience is a worthwhile trade-off to establish a structure and environment where the DAO can truly direct the development of the Foundation long term.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation, we have formed 3 subsidiaries to help protect the Foundation\u2019s assets and structure its interactions with the real world. One of these subsidiaries will be a holding company for Gitcoin trademarks and certain other intellectual property (such as our monorepo). The second subsidiary will serve as our primary operating entity and will be responsible for activities such as paying for our domain names, safeguarding and allocating our treasury per DAO governance, engaging and paying ordinary vendors (such as Google and AWS), and serving as the counterparty to DAO contributor agreements. For those contributing to the DAO, this also means you will have a contributor agreement that we hope will help offer more structure, clarity and protection to both you and the Foundation when you perform work on behalf of the DAO); and (iii) a third entity that was created to custody the Gitcoin Grants Multisig (mostly to handle KYC and AML).\n\nWe are in the process of formalizing a few external service providers, such as a KYC/AML compliance officer and an accounting firm and we will continue to retain external legal counsel for any legal needs and questions that arise. As with starting any new entity, there are legal reporting requirements and business functions that will need care and feeding. For now, I am taking care of those things but we may want to consider hiring an operations person to manage much of the day to day.\n\nDAO Updates:\nA new v3 of our governance process has been posted for commentary and we will ratify this as part of this vote. This ratification process will enable us to memorialize the adoption of a process we are largely already following. \n\nAsset Transfer Updates:\nGitcoin Holdings is aligned with our interest in taking formal legal ownership of the various assets mentioned above (e.g. our Treasury, smart contracts, trademarks, SaaS contracts we need to operate) we as a community have created/maintained or advanced or need to grow so that they can then focus on revenue and delivering the best hackathon experience possible for those partners who entrust them to grow their communities (for simplicity, I refer to these as our Assets). This means that Gitcoin Holdings will be transferring these Assets to us, as well as some additional capital to ensure the Foundation and subsidiaries can pay their operating costs for some time and run as an independent and decentralized enterprise (which also solves certain legal capitalization requirements).\n\nSince Hackathons is built on the Gitcoin brand, Gitcoin Holdings will be granted a temporary license to use Gitcoin trademarks until they reestablish operations under a new name, and I imagine we will continue to share a community for some time.",

                    "content": " Introducing The Gitcoin Foundation - A proposal to represent the Gitcoin DAO IRL by a Cayman Islands Foundation. TL;DR: This proposal outlines why a foundation is useful, how the Gitcoin Foundation is structured, and what powers the DAO has over the Gitcoin Foundation (spoiler, the DAO will have virtually all the control!). This proposal also calls for the community to execute a transfer of ownership of various Gitcoin Holdings assets, including our DAO Treasury timelock contract and public goods funding IP, to the Gitcoin Foundation. Context: As some within the Gitcoin community know, I recently resigned from Gitcoin Holdings to fully join and focus on our DAO. While at Gitcoin Holdings, I had the opportunity to see our DAO community coalesce into vibrant and productive workstreams coordinating public goods funding thanks to GTC. I\u2019m excited to now focus my energies and experience where it matters most for public goods \u2013 within our DAO! In order for the DAO to fulfill its mission of building & funding public goods, I believe we should be intentional about its corporate structure in doing so. I\u2019ve done some groundwork on this front, and am excited by the prospect of structuring a legal entity around the DAO to better serve our mission. I am going to borrow some highlights from our friends at ENS regarding why the DAO should have a legal entity:  It provides limited liability to GTC holders for the actions of the DAO. Without a legal entity, holders may be personally held liable for anything the DAO as a whole does. It is capable of complying with taxation requirements - without a legal entity, the DAO and its participants may be held liable for a proportion of the DAO\u2019s income/gains, even if they are not able to access these funds. It is capable of entering into contracts with other \u201creal world\u201d entities, of holding assets (including IP rights), spinning up operating organizations, enforcing contracts and so forth.  Here are some high level details on the newly formed Gitcoin Foundation: The Gitcoin Foundation is a Foundation Company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Cayman Foundation Companies can be ideal structures for nonprofit enterprises like our flagship, Gitcoin Grants (see more here), since they do not require equity-like members and instead permit us to follow the wishes of a broader stakeholder pool (our entire community). Currently the Gitcoin Foundation has a single shareholder (a local service provider), but this \u201csubscriber\u201d will soon surrender its share leaving us with an ownerless foundation that can honor the wishes of our broader community. The Gitcoin Foundation currently has three directors: myself and two independent Cayman residents. The two independent directors are directors of other DAOs and are important to ensure we maintain our status as a true Cayman Foundation Company. Currently, Directors are in charge of the day-to-day management of the Gitcoin Foundation (though much of this will fall to me in the short term). The Gitcoin Foundation has one supervisor. The supervisor is an administrative role whose job is to make sure that the directors are doing their jobs in accordance with Cayman Islands law. The position of supervisor is filled by a Cayman Islands firm, Hamptons Limited. The Gitcoin Foundation currently has rather boilerplate Articles of Association, which empower the DAO to vote to (among other powers reserved to the DAO):  Appoint or remove a director, member, or supervisor; and Instruct the directors to wind up the foundation, and specify what charity or other foundation should receive the foundation\u2019s assets.  Though not specified directly in the Articles, the DAO may also instruct the directors to take action on behalf of the Foundation - such as signing a contract, engaging a company for a service the DAO requires, or delegating some of the directors\u2019 powers to a DAO working group (so long as a director is part of that workstream). The Articles of Association will likely be revised over the next 30 days to better match our intent to give the DAO nearly full control of the foundation.  The substance of the proposal: With The Gitcoin Foundation established, I propose acquiring Gitcoin Holdings\u2019 assets that serve public goods funding in a formalized way. The Gitcoin Foundation can host these philanthropic assets and ensure their independence from Gitcoin Holdings. Here is why this makes sense for our community and for Gitcoin Holdings:  Legal personality will help rather than undermine our decentralization \u2013 though we operate globally, we still need to be able to enter into contracts (for instance to host our Discord) and take ownership of our treasury and IP legally, and for these privileges to be recognized in the terraverse we need a legal face that\u2019s familiar to other legal entities, jurisdictions and their courts. A legal structure over our assets will showcase that we coordinate and collaborate across the globe We have global stakeholders \u2013 our contributors and our mission are global, which favors a neutral jurisdiction like the Cayman Islands (i.e., rather than a jurisdiction where any specific stakeholder contingent calls home) We need flexibility - Cayman ownerless foundations look and feel like non-profit LLCs (as compared with more restrictive corporations), which favors an evolving DAO like ours - activities within the DAO (grants, workstream funding) are constantly evolving and will continue to do so with future pivots, mechanism design innovations to accelerate automated public goods funding, treasury management needs, impactDAO vision We need a legal solution that is fit for purpose - our DAO\u2019s mission is charitable and its legitimacy depends on credible neutrality, and a foundation structure serves these ends by minimally intervening with the will of our community Our mission deserves tax efficiencies - the DAO\u2019s mission is charitable and should therefore benefit from maximal tax efficiencies, and securing tax exemptions under IRC 501(c) are challenging in the United States, time-consuming and not ideal for a global group like ours  The Gitcoin Foundation would acquire various domains, code repositories (incl. Treasury smart contracts), trademarks, social media accounts as well as some seed capital. Gitcoin Holdings could perform services for our DAO that we determine are in our best interest according to our normal governance decisioning process but would otherwise be formally separate from ourselves. Gitcoin Holdings will continue to operate as an independent organization but by virtue of this vote, if passed, The Gitcoin Foundation will now be formally recognized as a separate entity that represents our DAO and philanthropic efforts we undertake. Next Steps: All feedback and thoughts are welcome. Would love supporting the acquisition of the DAO Assets. Here is what immediate next steps would be:  A vote is proposed (once we hit the threshold set out in the Governance process) to adopt the Gitcoin Foundation as the legal owner of the DAO and its assets. If the vote passes, the directors of The Gitcoin Foundation would begin discussions with Gitcoin Holdings Inc. with the goal of obtaining the philanthropic assets Gitcoin Holdings currently controls, for the long term benefit of the DAO and Foundation now having ownership A second vote may be proposed with the final negotiated terms, but this proposal will entrust the Directors of The Gitcoin Foundation to fully negotiate this business transaction (while providing frequent updates to both Stewards, Workstream Leads and the community)  To be sure, there is no perfect legal structure. Although DAOs are a completely new frontier whose recognition varies across jurisdictions, this formalized structure will better protect our community assets and ability to use them to build public goods sustainably.

The later, is something we will still need to address and I agree that it is not yet represented in the proposal. You appropriately noted some of those concerns which needs more work. Protection for the workstreams is something I am researching to offer more guidance in the next couple of weeks.

                    "content": "Kyle, we give you kudos for constructing this important proposal, aiming to address a number of very real concerns. But one needs to look at these concerns separately, to validate the efficacy of the offering. Exempted Foundation Company in Cayman Islands, incorporated on February 11th, 2022, solves well, at least under current agreements between the UK and the US tax authorities, a typical tax liability, related to the receipt of a large number of fungible tokens, of non-trivial present value. It may also address joint liability issues, though to which extent that would cover semi-anonymous and passive token holders, as compared to the key DAO operators, is open to interpretation. This lack of clarity can be seen in ENS indicating \u201climited liability to DAO participants\u201d, and your \u201climited liability to GTC holders\u201d. As Gitcoin would continue to represent strongly that the tokens are not securities, and not related to any equity or income interest in the enterprise, the liability to the token holders is somewhat tenuous anyways. How well the Foundation solves joint liability concerns of the major DAO contributors would likely depend on the arrangement between the DAO and the Foundation. You describe it variously as \u201ca legal entity around the DAO\u201d, \u201cDAO may also instruct the directors to take action on behalf of the Foundation\u201d, \u201cownerless foundation\u201d, \u201cgive the DAO nearly full control of the foundation\u201d, \u201cpermit us to follow the wishes of a broader stakeholder pool\u201d, \u201cthe will of our community\u201d, \u201cGitcoin Foundation [] legal owner of the DAO\u201d, \u201cDAO and Foundation now having ownership\u201d. These sound great individually, but may not all to be possible at the same time. We need one set of precise language, that documents the structure and the interaction. Neither interpretation of limited liability universally protects against all types of actions originating with the token holders, DAO contributors, Stewards, or the DAO itself, and will need a separate treatment. My understanding is that today, the only firm legislative framework for on-chain votes to control an incorporated entity is the Wyoming LLC, with the \u2018blockchain\u2019 election. In the proposal you advance two additional causes, not immediately tied to the formation of the Cayman foundation and then capturing very specifically its relationship with the DAO, in a purpose-build set of Articles of Association, or similar.  \u201ccommunity to execute a transfer of ownership of various Gitcoin Holdings assets, including our DAO Treasury timelock contract\u201d. Also mentioned are IP, trademarks, repos, domains, accounts, and seed capital.  You want three Foundation directors, two of whom are unnamed and unrelated to Gitcoin, entrusted \u201cto fully negotiate this business transaction\u201d, confirming that \u201cmuch of this will fall to me\u201d.  By comparison, all three ENS Foundation directors are core team members. In combination with vague terms for the final approval vote, the Foundation having already been incorporated three weeks ago, and you assuming such an exclusive role, one may be concerned how well the DAO side of the negotiation has been or will be represented. It would bring more legitimacy to the process, for someone with less history and commitment to Gitcoin Holdings and more history and commitment to our DAO, to lead the DAO side of negotiation. Would also be wonderful if the contingent contributing full time to the DAO since August, 2021, is better represented among the Foundation directors, say 2 out of 3. By way of example, someone with a DAO-first outlook would ask about the GTC stuck in the airdrop. Some 2 million tokens, of the 15% designated for the airdrop, have not been claimed. Seems intuitive that the DAO would be better equipped to steward these tokens, than a commercial entity would. In the Voter Guide you indicate $100K of quarterly funding by Holdings to the DAO streams. Only dCompass and FDD apparently stand on their own financially. Before affecting the split, we need to figure out this impending severe budget deficit, compared to which entity formation is just window dressing.  Obliquely, you indicate a plan for carving-up Gitcoin into multiple \u201cnonprofit enterprises like our flagship, Gitcoin Grants\u201d. Similarly, there would be no issues for the workstreams, unless you see them operating independently, making their own deals and incurring their own liabilities. While these are curious ideas, there is no reason to drag them into the Foundation formation decision, particularly after creating a sense of urgency to get it approved. DAO can and will decide, at its own pace.  Your enthusiasm and drive are outstanding, but there are things that simply have to be done properly, for the lasting benefit of every party to this transaction. Can you guide structuring the DAO configuration with the Foundation first, including democratizing the directorship? Then, arrange and chair the DAO and Holdings negotiations, letting the sides work out the details. Everyone\u2019s already with you on the wants and the concepts, and may only want a bit smoother incremental process. Still only two steward votes required, and feels like it should all be doable before the month is over, even with some lawyer meddling. ",

I wanted to be more explicit that our foundation does better protect token holders, but does not offer full-proof protection for DAO contributors.     wkarshat:  My understanding is that today, the only firm legislative framework for on-chain votes to control an incorporated entity is the Wyoming LLC, with the \u2018blockchain\u2019 election.   This isnt exactly true. Any organization can put into its bylaws that no major action is taken without a vote of some sort. In most traditional organizations this is the vote of share holders, and in our case it would be token holders. The important part is to make sure the constitution of the foundation spells this out. FWIW, Wyoming LLC is not tenable given the 99 member limitation on specific protections (among lots of other reasons).     wkarshat:  By comparison, all three ENS Foundation directors are core team members.   I cant speak to why they decided to set up this structure. I can tell you this is not a structure we felt was tenable for Gitcoin. Having a major in the Cayman Islands is important to ensure the legitimacy of the structure IMO.     wkarshat:  the GTC stuck in the airdrop   These were returned to the DAO treasury when the airdrop experience expired.

I definitely agree that a DAO needs to have a real-life entity representing it. Even when we made \u201cThe DAO\u201d we had created a Swiss entity, DAO.LINK to get into \u201cmeat-space\u201d agreements for the DAO and be able to handle taxes and other obligations. For the liability part as a token holder and as a contributor I can\u2019t really tell. Depends on your jurisdiction. Here in Germany it\u2019s all unclear \u2026 but especially as a simple holder sounds farfetched to have any form of liability. If having a real life entity helps there (can\u2019t say \u2013 ask a lawyer in your respect jurisdiction) then that\u2019s good but I doubt you have consulted with lawyers in multiple jurisdictions. I have some questions on the details which I will outline below.  myself and two independent Cayman residents  Who are these residents? And what are their affiliations/credentials? I believe if we as a DAO are asked to choose someone to represents us in meatspace we should know who that someone is.  The Gitcoin Foundation has one supervisor. The supervisor is an administrative role whose job is to make sure that the directors are doing their jobs in accordance with Cayman Islands law. The position of supervisor is filled by a Cayman Islands firm, Hamptons Limited.  Afaik the supervisor\u2019s position is a paid one and Cayman firms charge a lot. How much does it cost and I suppose this will be expensed to the DAO?   We have global stakeholders \u2013 our contributors and our mission are global, which favors a neutral jurisdiction like the Cayman Islands (i.e., rather than a jurisdiction where any specific stakeholder contingent calls home)   Reading this the sanctions matter came to my mind. Would we eventually be able to get around having the need to block our crypto brothers from countries that suffer under repressive regimes with a Cayman islands foundation or the same problems we have with a US company would still persist? I assume it would still persist, correct?  Also have a question about the liabilities that Gitcoin holdings has. Unless my memory completely deceives me right at the launch of GTC it also received ~$10M USD in investment, right? Does it have any liabilities towards these investors or were they paid back in GTC tokens? Would transferring ownership of the assets of Gitcoin holdings to the Foundation in the Cayman islands also transfer any obligations to those investors that we, the DAO, would have to repay? On the same note would we inherit any other debt/liabilities from Gitcoin holdings as a DAO with this transfer? ",

They both work with multiple DAOs, but in an effort to prevent doxxing them, I need to confirm they are okay with me sharing details. The goal is to write the constitution such that it doesn\u2019t really matter who these folks are as they are merely following the will of the DAO (like myself). I will come back to this next week when I can confirm with them.     lefterisjp:  How much does it cost   This will likely be $30K a year. I will have more formal details once we get further along in the process. This number will fluctuate based on the services we ask them to provide, but this fee is really not that much more expensive than services other firms charge in my experience.     lefterisjp:  Would we eventually be able to get around having the need to block our crypto brothers from countries that suffer under repressive regimes   I am not sure. Most sanctions run through the global finance system and not just the US. I will have to speak with our cayman counsel for more details though.     lefterisjp:  Does it have any liabilities towards these investors   I dont want to speak too much for Holdings as I am no longer employed there, but I know this would likely be tenable to them as they are able to hand off the costs for the philanthropic work to the community and focus on becoming more profitable for shareholders. It reduces their cost footprint and helps them focus on core products that generate revenue, which is a win for shareholders.     lefterisjp:  Would transferring ownership of the assets of Gitcoin holdings to the Foundation in the Cayman islands also transfer any obligations to those investors that we, the DAO, would have to repay?   No, there are no string attached like that. They are absolving themselves of the assets and we would be taking them clear of any obligations from that organization. They have made it clear that the community needs to support this and that they are willing to begin negotiations once the community has made its will known. ",

I think this is a good step forward for the Gitcoin DAO and its token holders. I support the need for a legal entity, aligned with DAOs ethos, that can provide a space for the DAO to operate more \u201cfreely\u201d and efficiently. Reading the proposal and the comments below a couple of questions come to mind;     kyle:  The Gitcoin Foundation currently has three directors: myself and two independent Cayman residents. The two independent directors are directors of other DAOs and are important to ensure we maintain our status as a true Cayman Foundation Company.    From your previous response I understand the possibility of two of the directors remaining anonymous but I just wanted to emphasize that I believe it\u2019s important for the community to know the directors who play a great role to ensure the maintenance of our status as a true Cayman Foundation Company.      kyle:  Though not specified directly in the Articles, the DAO may also instruct the directors to take action on behalf of the Foundation - such as signing a contract, engaging a company for a service the DAO requires, or delegating some of the directors\u2019 powers to a DAO working group (so long as a director is part of that workstream). The Articles of Association will likely be revised over the next 30 days to better match our intent to give the DAO nearly full control of the foundation.    Regarding the Articles, I believe this is a very important part of the proposal. Could you please specify how are you envisioning this to shape up (timeline, accountable working parties, decision-making process, what are the specifics of \"giving the DAO nearly full control of the foundation, etc.)      kyle:      lefterisjp:  Would we eventually be able to get around having the need to block our crypto brothers from countries that suffer under repressive regimes     And lastly, I want to emphasize what @lefterisjp brought up which, I think, is one of the most crucial pain points of Gitcoin DAO as an exemplary organization that stands for Public Goods. And I believe this is the perfect timing to have this issue in mind and seek a solution (even if its temporary) if the proposal passes. Thank you, ",

The goal is to have all IRL infrastructure in place (Bank accounts, Operating Subsidiaries, etc.) ahead of this final closeout and ratification by the community.  There are a lot of details that we are still discovering as we go because this is not a well charted process, but I am committed to being as transparent as possible for both others to learn from, and for our DAO to understand what\u2019s happening.

I know we say that the DAO will nearly have full control of the foundation, but what kind of decisions would be controlled by the DAO compared to the Foundation itself in 30 days? 90 days? etc. This is likely a first for many of us in dealing with this kind of thing so examples would help a lot here for better context.   I definitely agree CSDO should help revise the terms but it\u2019d be worth ensuring that the Steward Council is also involved in this process. Can we amend the proposed flow to include them in discussions alongside CSDO since stewards should and will need to play a key role in relation to the Foundation?   ",

These articles are the boilerplate articles, that are then superseded by the foundation bylaws. I am working with a few other folks on the bylaws, but not all of these details are public from DAO to DAO. The goal of our Bylaws is to spell out what actions (from the AoA) Directors can take with or without a vote (and in a \u201cno vote required\u201d scenario, it would still require unanimous support from the Directors). Almost all of these actions would be actions only taken based on DAO votes (on-chain voting per our governance process). Some examples are below:  All structural changes to the Foundation will require a vote Change in Directorship (my position, and others) will be changeable through a DAO vote The directors will have the ability to \u201crun\u201d the foundation (accounting requirements, KYC requirements, reporting requirements) without a DAO vote, but will be required to present financials and transparency into the operations. This ensures we are in good standing with the relevant governments. Assets may not be transferred out of the foundation without a DAO vote  There are some structural pieces that are in place today to help us ease setting up bank accounts, subsidiaries, negotiations with Gitcoin Holdings, etc. that should not exist in ~150 days from now (assuming all of that infrastructure is set up). So it is my suggestion to offer more flexibility to me and the directors for the next 150 days to ensure we \u201cget it right.\u201d There is however always an escape hatch if we feel we need to exit me or another director. I would love for CSDO to review the bylaws before they are ratified, and also ensure Stewards review and weigh in as it would certainly require an onchain vote to legitimately adopt those new bylaws per our governance process. Let me know if you have any other specific questions, and I will be sharing the bylaws soon. ",

It would bring more legitimacy to the process, for someone with less history and commitment to Gitcoin Holdings and more history and commitment to our DAO, to lead the DAO side of negotiation. Would also be wonderful if the contingent contributing full time to the DAO since August, 2021, is better represented among the Foundation directors, say 2 out of 3.   I\u2019m actually ok with, and prefer having you in this role. I do think there is a need for DAO representation in the negotiation of assets. It isn\u2019t a deal breaker at this point, but I am concerned about fair representation for the interests of the DAO. Mostly because we should be a shining light of legitimacy in how we operate. ",

                    "content": " The Gitcoin Foundation Update - June 2 2022 It\u2019s been a while since I offered an update on the gov forums about our Foundation set-up and work to take possession of our collective assets. Here is how things are shaping up - there are three primary buckets to think about in this update:  Foundation updates DAO updates Asset Transfer updates   Foundation Updates: We have prepared a new set of proposed governing documents for the Foundation that would memorialize the Foundation\u2019s operating rules. These include a new Memorandum of Association and Bylaws. These docs have been reviewed by community members (including friends at LexDAO, and our own legal counsel) without any objections, and at this time we believe they are ready to be submitted for approval and ratification. These documents generally direct the Foundation to carry out DAO governance decisions (per our governance process - see update below), subject to statutory or other legal limits. They also allow the Foundation or its subsidiaries to spend capital within its control (ie assets transferred, not the treasury) to advance protocol development until Grants 2.0 is operational and comply with legal and other core requirements (like establishing AML processes, hiring accounting firms, etc). As part of the ratification of the updated governing documents for the Foundation, it will also become \u201cownerless\u201d, meaning it will have no shareholders to whom fiduciary duties or other obligations are owed (one shareholder was initially required to be able to form it under Cayman law) and instead will be able to act in accordance with DAO governance without any obligations to any equity holders. Operating as an ownerless foundation will, however, increase the complexity for KYC purposes, including anti-money laundering and sanctions laws compliance, and also for certain other diligence purposes and interactions with the real world. But we believe that any such inconvenience is a worthwhile trade-off to establish a structure and environment where the DAO can truly direct the development of the Foundation long term. In addition to the Foundation, we have formed 3 subsidiaries to help protect the Foundation\u2019s assets and structure its interactions with the real world. One of these subsidiaries will be a holding company for Gitcoin trademarks and certain other intellectual property (such as our monorepo). The second subsidiary will serve as our primary operating entity and will be responsible for activities such as paying for our domain names, safeguarding and allocating our treasury per DAO governance, engaging and paying ordinary vendors (such as Google and AWS), and serving as the counterparty to DAO contributor agreements. For those contributing to the DAO, this also means you will have a contributor agreement that we hope will help offer more structure, clarity and protection to both you and the Foundation when you perform work on behalf of the DAO); and (iii) a third entity that was created to custody the Gitcoin Grants Multisig (mostly to handle KYC and AML). We are in the process of formalizing a few external service providers, such as a KYC/AML compliance officer and an accounting firm and we will continue to retain external legal counsel for any legal needs and questions that arise. As with starting any new entity, there are legal reporting requirements and business functions that will need care and feeding. For now, I am taking care of those things but we may want to consider hiring an operations person to manage much of the day to day.  DAO Updates: A new v3 of our governance process has been posted for commentary and we seek to ratify this as part of our upcoming vote. This ratification process will enable us to memorialize the adoption of a process we are largely already following. We also have a newly proposed DAO Purpose and Essential Intents to align and focus our efforts. These will serve as our guiding framework when evaluating budget requests, workstream focus and overall direction into which to move the DAO.  Asset Transfer Updates: Gitcoin Holdings is aligned with our interest in taking formal legal ownership of the various assets mentioned above (e.g. our Treasury, smart contracts, trademarks, SaaS contracts we need to operate) we as a community have created/maintained or advanced or need to grow so that they can then focus on revenue and delivering the best hackathon experience possible for those partners who entrust them to grow their communities (for simplicity, I refer to these as our Assets). This means that Gitcoin Holdings will be transferring these Assets to us, as well as some additional capital to ensure the Foundation and subsidiaries can pay their operating costs for some time and run as an independent and decentralized enterprise (which also solves certain legal capitalization requirements). Since Hackathons is built on the Gitcoin brand, Gitcoin Holdings will be granted a temporary license to use Gitcoin trademarks until they reestablish operations under a new name, and I imagine we will continue to share a community for some time.  Next steps I am proposing we vote (in 5 days per our process) to ratify these changes, accept the transfer terms and start the life of the DAO as an independent legal organization (i.e., within the structure of the Foundation) in earnest. I will also work to build a reporting cadence for the Foundation\u2019s operations to ensure there is a pattern of transparency and sustainability long term. ",

It seems it went to snapshot but @krrisis wrote in discord the snapshot proposal is wrong and needs to be redone. Is this true? If so we should either remove it or have all vote no to it.  Hey all, so just to let you know there\u2019s been some misunderstanding here and we\u2019ll be tweaking this proposal slightly, new one will be coming up. Most important one is that purpose & intents wasn\u2019t supposed to be in this proposal plus there are some other minor tweaks to be made to the gov proposal as well. So consider this proposal to be cancelled, changed my vote to no, just to be sure.  ",

It looks like there was some misalignment on where the Purpose and Essential Intent should live (ie, in CSDO versus gov process). I took down the original vote at the request of @krrisis and @Pop and have now posted a new version that they feel better represents our final decision on where the purpose and Essential Intent should live. Thanks for flagging and I hope to get support on the new snapshot vote. Here is the latest vote: Snapshot ",

This means, the DAO now formally owns a vast number of gitcoin assets, and we are continuing to unplug from Gitcoin Holdings (whom is now rebranding as the Web3 Events company). There are no immediate impacts for the DAO, but now that assets, the brand name, and other items are transferred, it means we can start to formalize the relationship between the DAO contributors and the newly created operating company within the foundation. Thank you all so much for the support and enabling the DAO to move forward. This is a huge step for us, and for other DAOs who are looking to us for guidance on how to navigate the real world legal entity status for DAOs. ",
