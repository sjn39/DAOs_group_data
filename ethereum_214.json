The author obviously has a view of what that includes and doesn\u2019t include but the average reader will not come to the same conclusion when reading the EIP (as can be seen in the EIP discussion). The author insists on using a particular word (bailout) and redefining it to mean something that it doesn\u2019t mean to a native English speaker.  This is a tactic for poisoning the well that isn\u2019t conducive to technical discussion. The changes shouldn\u2019t be an EIP, they should be a PR against EIP-1.  @Arachnid may have more insight into what the intended process is for changing the process, but last I heard a PR against EIP-1 is that process.  If the author can fix these things then I think it should be merged, even though I also think it is not a good EIP for other non-technical reasons. ",

We should either update the title of this thread to refer to EIPs in general or move the EIP-894 discussion elsewhere.  @fulldecent \u2013 maybe you can clarify if your concern is with EIPs in general or ERCs specifically. Second, I think you are claiming that Nick is not following the EIP-1 guidelines (as opposed to claiming that the guidlines are wrong). Specifically, that he\u2019s ignoring this part:  If the EIP collaborators approve, the EIP editor will assign the EIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the EIP) and merge your pull request  Here, I think EIP-1 could stand to be re-worded; it\u2019s not clearly written.   What does \u201cIf the EIP collaborators approve\u201d mean? No objections, unanimous approval, something else? In my opinion, a single editor should be able to merge as draft because there\u2019s not really any significant risk associated with it.  That also aligns with what I seen/heard elsewhere, but the \u201cIf the EIP collaborators approve\u201d line is just adding to the confusion.   EIP-1 says \u201cPlease send all EIP-related email to the EIP Collaborators, which is listed under EIP Editors below\u201d. So \u201cEIP Collaborators == EIP Editors\u201d? Why have two names for the same thing? I\u2019m guessing it has something to do with distinguishing between the group and the specific editor assigned to an EIP.  In that case, I would recommend \u201cEditors\u201d  and \u201cAssigned Editor(s)\u201d in the context of a particular EIP. Also, capitalize terms that have a definition that is specific to EIP-1 and stop prefixing terms with \u201cEIP\u201d.   My original reading (without reading EIP-1 from top to bottom) was that \u201cEIP collaborators\u201d were the authors of the EIP in question, not the EIP repository collaborators. I think the main thing that confused me was that if \u201cEIP Editors\u201d was meant, then it would have said \u201cIf the EIP Editors approve\u2026\u201d, but it didn\u2019t.   ",

An outside collaborator is a person who isn\u2019t explicitly a member of your organization, but who has Read, Write, or Admin permissions to one or more repositories in your organization.

The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don\u2019t seem likely to be accepted.  The title should accurately describe the content.    Check the EIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style    If the EIP isn\u2019t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.
