                    "content": " Community Notice: PECU to Redeploy Teleport L2 Gateways Hi all, During user testing, PECU identified a minor issue in dss-teleport that can result in some teleport withdrawals on L1 being temporarily blocked until some of the debt incurred by TeleportJoin is settled, which can take up to 7 days on Optimism and Arbitrum. Details on this issue and its mitigation will be shared shortly in a forum post. Interim Detail: To prevent this issue, a new set of dss-teleport contracts will need to be redeployed. In the meantime, it has been decided to temporarily shut down the L2 side of the teleport bridge, in order to protect users from encountering any issue with their withdrawals. Specifically, ETH-MAIN-A will be removed from the validDomains mapping of authorised destination domains in the L2DaiTeleportGateway contract for each of the three supported L2 domains (Optimism, Arbitrum and Starknet). This action will be implemented by calling the L1GovernanceRelay contract of each domain in order to execute a special-purpose L2 spell (executed by the L2GovernanceRelay of the domain) that will take care of calling the file function of the corresponding L2DaiTeleportGateway. Below are the relevant deployed contract addresses:     Domain L1GovernanceRelay L2GovernanceRelay L2DaiTeleportGateway     Optimism 0x09B354CDA89203BB7B3131CC728dFa06ab09Ae2F 0x10E6593CDda8c58a1d0f14C5164B376352a55f2F 0x18d2CF2296c5b29343755E6B7e37679818913f88   Arbitrum 0x9ba25c289e351779E0D481Ba37489317c34A899d 0x10E6593CDda8c58a1d0f14C5164B376352a55f2F 0x5dBaf6F2bEDebd414F8d78d13499222347e59D5E   Starknet 0x2385C60D2756Ed8CA001817fC37FDa216d7466c0 0x05f4d9b039f82e9a90125fb119ace0531f4936ff2a9a54a8598d49a4cd4bd6db 0x05b20d8c7b85456c07bdb8eaaeab52a6bf3770a586af6da8d3f5071ef0dcf234    Planning: PECU is proposing to make these changes in next week\u2019s executive spell (week of the 30th of January).
