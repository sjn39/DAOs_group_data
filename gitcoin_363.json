I personally feel like translation tools are not yet at the point where they allow two people without a common language to comfortably converse, especially if the languages are very different (eg Chinese and English), but do not have definitive knowledge on the subject. Do you think have separate language communities with \u201cambassadors\u201d that can speak multiple languages bridging the gap makes for a more comfortable experience, or using tools, even if the translation can be less than 100%?
