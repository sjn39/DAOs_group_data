I am not a marketing guy so I am just going to give you my unqualified personal opinion. The best measurement is the number of outstanding dai, the number of accounts with dai in them and the number of Vaults. Preferably measured against competitors. The problem is trying to measure what effort resulted in which increase in account numbers etc. I think we maybe are in a too early phase for this type of measuring. ",

But as others said, I think a marketing campaign needs to follow a certain predetermined strategy. Considering that now:  the Vault limit is 5000 dai. Opening a Vault costs ~100usd in Ethereum fees, every DAI transaction costs >10 usd in Ethereum fees  I think it\u2019s pointless to advertise DAI as just a \u201cdigital usd\u201d for buying hot-dogs. People would just laugh at you, and call it a scam!, if they hear that to buy a hotdog with crypto-usd, you need to pay 10usd of Ethereum fees. I agree with @Aaron_Bartsch (can\u2019t find his post anymore) that the target today (and probably for the next year or more, until Ethereum scales) is:  young male (EU+USA, maybe also Asia not sure): 25-45 years hold, wishing to invest some of his money with profits generally open to the \u201cfuck the banks/occupy wall-street/FIRE\u201d movements, generally open towards innovation.  Essentially speaking, the millenials. To these we should advertise/teach/illustrate the following 3 key facts:  you can hold your Bitcoin/Ethereum and at the same time \u2018borrow\u2019 usd vs them (avoid tax events) \u2192 Vaults you can stay in the blockchain (leave banks to some extent) with a stable decentralised asset (DAI) you can make good money using DeFi platforms (Aave, Compound, yEarn, etc).  I think an effective campaign would involve:  A good influencer A good medium of diffusion (youtube, FB groups, etc) Some prizes.  For example helping some users setting up his first Aave (*) 1k DAI deposit and earning some good 8% APY. (*) it would be awesome to use the DSR instead of Aave. But it\u2019s currently only 0.01% APY and our GUI is not as nice as those of our competitors imho. EDIT: the target audience described above, typically already uses or know stuff like RobinHood, etc. We should basically show to them how DeFi competes with RobinHood (i.e., by being decentralised) and how DAI is the decentralised USD of Defi. EDIT 2/Proposal: Why don\u2019t we coordinate with Aave (or actually, Uniswap+Aave+other big DeFi) to make some advertisement campagin all together?  ",

There\u2019s some data on who who actually has/uses BTC. Given that they\u2019re a lot of long-term holders with a big concentration in N Am (especially most recent purchasers), it would be good to think about how to reach this base of collateral holders who already exist. Especially since apparently half of all US crypto holders entered the market only in 2020. So where does that leave us? Hunting existing collateral types to increase DAI supply? As far as tracking success metrics, once we know a wallet address, we can see if that address then opens a vault pretty easily, right? So we shouldn\u2019t boohoo the notion of handing out small amounts of DAI because then we\u2019d have known wallet addresses that had been touched by whatever marketing plan we made. ",

I suspect my personal skill set is most useful in growing the deposit base, but it doesn\u2019t seem super clear how far to try to go in reaching out to potential partners before coming back here for authorization. For example, say XYZ holds lots of crypto assets we already accept as collateral. If I wanted to pitch them a private vault with 1 or 2% lower SF to help them capture yield but with a fairly high dust/minimum, how much can I as a MKR holder go down that road? It would be nice to have a set of preferred terms to offer mid-to-large holders of crypto assets. Because then I think it\u2019s just a matter of knocking on enough institutional doors to rapidly grow the supply of DAI \u2014 and the markets are screaming for more DAI, if interest rates are any indication.

Goal #1 is to drive demand for Dai. This means pursuing integrations and encouraging people to use Dai and the Maker Protocol by helping them understand the value it can provide to them. Different people use Dai for different reasons, so this is where things get tricky. As others have pointed out in this thread and elsewhere, decentralization as a USP differs in places like North America from places with less developed and stable financial infrastructure. North Americans aren\u2019t using vaults as a substitute for financial infrastructure, they\u2019re using it as another tool among many. I also generally agree with iammeoh\u2019s assessment that the audience in North America leans heavily on tech-savvy millennails with an anti-bank/corporation attitude and have found that messaging around financial literacy, data privacy, and anti-bank/corporate sentiment can resonate with this crowd (in the right contexts). Prizes, influencers, paid ads, etc. can be useful but it\u2019s critical that we employ tactics in ways that encourage the informed use of Dai and the Maker Protocol rather than one-off engagements with the campaigns themselves. Coordinating with other DAOs is a topic that\u2019s come up between Content and GovComms; how that works and what the goals are will need to be developed as we get further along in the transition to Core Units.

We are reaching a whole generation and their kids, who are at their most receptive. If Dai is associated with positive connotations in the present, this could generate a stable and valuable user base in the medium and  long term future.

However, much like many of the other strategy-related discussions, it seems to come with the lack of data-driven hypotheses. Coming from an analytical perspective, we may want to work the other way around \u2014 from data to goal \u2014 rather than backward (goal to data). In a nutshell, I think these are the steps to set meaningful goals:  Stats and Analytics \u2014 gather intelligence around the project\u2019s current status across all verticals and regions (yes, quite an endeavor) Hypotheses \u2014 based on the above stats and data combined with our global crypto market insights, create different hypotheses on how to best fulfill the project mission and vision Strategize \u2014 based on the above hypotheses, each core unit builds a strategy to supercharge the change we want to see happen  Right now we do not have point 1 nor 2. There are conversations around stats and analytics on the forum and other channels but it seems like we still have a lot of work to do to improve this \u2014 we may need a Core Unit to continuously provide market insights via Stats and Analytics.
