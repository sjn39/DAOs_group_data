What if their power goes out and they lose internet connection for an extended period of time? Depending on how long it goes down, wouldn\u2019t their staked ether be slashed due to this?   If the people staking 32eth are still having to run a client on their computer 24/7 to validate, is it really saving that much more energy compared to what PoW is doing?   Thanks in advance. I\u2019ve been doing my best at doing my own research like advised when first joining the space, but I\u2019m just starting to confuse myself at this point.  ",
