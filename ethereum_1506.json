I believe we can start with HackMD(https://hackmd.io/). And, infrastructure wise, probably great for Magicians to get a \u201cConference\u201d edition of HackMD under our own namespace \u2013 eg. notes.ethereum-magicians.org and use that instead of Google Docs. Reading the IETF Working Groups material I find useful. Start at their IETF About WGs page and then read RFC2418 which talks about how to form and run WGs. I believe that we need to create the equivalent of RFC2418 as the Ring Formation EIP. I also believe that the Magi can provide some \u201cdefault infrastructure\u201d to make it accessible to create Rings, which starts as simply as having a Category here on the forum and/or private categories for collaboration, per some of the discussion of useful work being done by smaller groups. Let\u2019s use this thread for discussion, and HackMD for collaborative editing. At some point, we will move it to a pull request on Github. Starting with HackMD can make it more accessible, as this is a memo / process improvement that is not restricted to just developers. Link to HackMD: https://hackmd.io/s/Bkxcd1c7m (all are welcome to contribute \u2013 let\u2019s discuss here and @Jason_C and I will take initial lead as editors) See also:  Wallet Developers Ring directory  ",

                    "content": "2418 gives a good reference for thinking through criteria for Ring formation. We can discuss whether FEM criteria need to be as formal or more or less formal in its own criteria. As I imagined it during discussion, this criteria is simply for a label of \u201cFEM certified ring\u201d or something to that effect. Philosophy: It should be noted (as I imagine it) that this is purely for the definition of \u201cring\u201d within FEM, and that this effort does not exclude the possible existence of rings or WGs formed outside of FEM or the FEM-definition. Ultimately, I hope to see more organizational structures or bodies as coordinated and organized as the FEM efforts are (at least as they were this weekend) that take different approaches/philosophies to leave room in the Ethereum ecosystem for philosophical disagreement without forcing a split at the \u201cWG layer\u201d if that makes sense. I do not want the FEM philosophy and effort to become \u201cone ring to rule them all,\u201d but rather one standard that (hopefully) becomes successful, important, and useful for a certain set of group efforts and circumstances within the larger community. Proposed Purpose: FEM-certified rings are entitled to certain benefits as bestowed by FEM. These benefits may include a dedicated channel in FEM communication forums, FEM-funding (if that ever becomes a thing), and other entitlements that manifest under FEM\u2019s abilities. Entities may simultaneously be both FEM-certified and compliant with other bodies\u2019 standards (if they differ). BTW this might be where I might disagree that whatever is determined in this discussion should be an EIP itself. I do not see the benefit of an EIP recognizing FEM-defined rings if this FEM-local purpose is adopted. But happy to think about possible benefits or a formal-EIP proposal if @boris or someone else has some in mind. Proposed Minimum Criteria as stated at the Berlin meeting (this may be articulated in a \u201ccharter\u201d as outlined in RCF2418 - 2.1, or something as simple as listed on an appropriate FEM intake form):   A FEM-certified ring must have a purpose to produce and deliver EIPs to the greater Ethereum community. The Ring\u2019s goals (as reduced to tangible form in EIP form) must be clearly and articulately stated; whether it needs to be as structured as the 3 criteria in RCF2418-2.1, or more or less so I am not sure, but this is a starting point to know that this criterion is desirable.   A FEM-certified ring must have at least 3 members upon certification. This requirement follows the logic that 1 person is an individual, 2 is a partnership, 3+ is a group. They must be reasonably identified in a way so that contacting them is easy and FEM can reasonably certify that all three are in fact distinct individuals. One of those 3 members will be an \u201corganizer\u201d type, though I don\u2019t want to imply that the organizer is an important decision maker for the ring\u2019s strategic/development efforts. They are simply the key contact person and charged with organizing and administrative functions (e.g. the on-the-ground planning for a web-conference and maintaining communications with FEM and the rest of the community). Whether roles must be as defined as \u201cchair,\u201d \u201carea director,\u201d etc. as outlined in 2418 is up for discussion.   A Ring must have a dedicated area in cyberspace where interested people may be directed to learn about the ring, its purpose, its ongoing efforts, and contact information. Whether this is a website, a reddit page (with appropriate sidebar), a Telegram channel with a pinned message explaining, or whatever, I think is good to leave to the discretion of the Ring. Point is that the field on the intake form/charter cannot be blank and the destination must exist.   RFC2418 has some other criteria that I think may or may not be useful for FEM\u2019s purposes, such as a mailing list, milestone requirements, and others that I am interested in the communities thoughts. Look forward to reflecting on what everyone else has to say. ",

                    "content": "I just read through RFC 2418 and found that it relies quite a bit on the organizational structure of the IETF. In particular the hierarchy IESG -> Area Director -> WG Chair -> WG. I don\u2019t think this amount of hierarchy is appropriate given the current size of the Ethereum scope. And it may never be appropriate given our preference for decentralization instead of hierarchy. Another thing that struck me is the emphasis on a working group working towards a specific deliverable. An RFC2418 working group has a limited lifetime and works towards a single RFC, or perhaps a few strongly related standards. Longer-lived working groups are mentioned as an exception. When I look at the list of active WGs it seems that longer lived WGs are more common than RFC2418 would suggest. There are a few WGs for \u201c[\u2026] Maintenance and Extensions\u201d and some long lived once such as TLS. But all of them are very specific in scope. When I look at the current list of Rings they do not appear to match well with the RFC2418\u2019s idea of a working group. They are do not have as goal of a single standard in a clear limited timeline. In fact, it seems to match closer with the RFC2418 concept of an Area. I suggest we combine the concepts and allow a Ring to be anywhere on the spectrum between Area and Working Group. We can then allow for some organic hierarchy where, for example, the Token Ring would create a subring for a particular token standard. This would only be required if that particular standard is complex enough that it is beneficial to form a subring. An simple extension of this is to allow multiple membership. A Ring for a wallet-aware token standard could then be part of both the Token Ring and the Wallet Ring. Formation can thus also be bottom up, where a more-specific Ring is formed that later becomes member of a more general ring that covers it. ",

Glad you read through for context. Also, I need to get back to this, but likely defining a way to create Rings is less useful than just working on the Ring template in Scrolls wiki. ",

There are some technical bits, like figuring out that we might want to form a Discourse group for Rings, since that gives a number of capabilities:    Notifying members of a ring and ring colors   There IS a groups ability, too, but that would mean Ring Makers have to actively manage group membership. We may want to do that to show Wallet Ring members, AND you can @-mention groups which notifies all the users. This probably needs a tracking Github issue if we want to go this direction.   I still need to post my notes \u2013 including the group generated list of \u201cWorking Groups\u201d that exist already. As noted already @Recmo Topics vs. Areas is tough.
