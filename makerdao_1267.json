                    "content": "Hey guys, last week TUSD submitted a MIP6 application and as a result we have done a risk evaluation for governance to consider onboarding it into the Maker Protocol. Tomorrow we\u2019ll do a presentation on the governance call as well. Overview The primary use case of stablecoin collateral types is to increase Dai liquidity, particularly in times of distress or when Dai is trading at a significant premium. Stablecoin collateral helps generate Dai that is then used to push the market price down, supply liquidity to secondary lending platforms, or provide keepers with adequate liquidity during auctions. As a result, the appetite for stablecoin collateral tends to be conditional on market environments. Based on USDC vault usage, we can infer that Dai is not typically generated unless there is a sufficiently high premium on Dai or when there are short term bursts of Dai demand (i.e., collateral auctions, Vault deleveraging in distressed situations, or debt auctions). Otherwise, the debt ceiling is likely to remain unutilized. Oracles and Liquidations Similar to USDC, we are proposing that TUSD maintain a fixed oracle price of $1. Until a more robust keeper ecosystem emerges, it is potentially risky to liquidate stablecoin collateral. Due to what would likely be a very narrow distribution of collateralization ratios, large blocks of collateral could be auctioned off in short periods of time and overwhelm keepers. Additionally, on-chain liquidations may not even be desirable at this stage, and therefore we propose disabling liquidations altogether from the start. Until the community has a better understanding of counterparty risks and the potential off-chain mechanisms that may be needed to resolve any disputes, auctions might accidentally result in unnecessary firesale prices. Liquidity Analysis and Metrics A volume analysis shows that TUSD has low volumes on decentralized exchanges, both in absolute terms and in comparison to USDC. Volume is more competitive on centralized exchanges, however. This introduces a risk when users would potentially need to acquire Dai by exchanging their collateral to close out their Vaults. However, we note that such an event may be unlikely given that stablecoins are generally not expected to trade away from $1. Nonetheless, liquidations would be disabled, mitigating liquidity risks.      USDC TUSD     Marketcap 708,112,192 137,882,778   Daily Volume CEX - median 90d 39,708,401 17,932,161   Daily Volume DEX - median 90d 1,337,859 59,995   Supply + Borrow DeFi 48,500,500 1,597,564    TUSD has also slowly been losing market share compared to USDC photo_2020-05-06 22.46.331212\u00d7748 96.2 KB photo_2020-05-06 22.48.221200\u00d7737 90.5 KB Daily volume for various DEX protocols vs other stablecoins  Secondary Lending activity for TUSD vs other stablecoins  Counterparty Risk Given that USDC already exists in the Maker Protocol, the primary benefit of adding alternatives such as TUSD is the diversification of the stablecoin set. However, it is difficult to quantify the extent of the diversification benefit without a comprehensive due diligence of the issuing parties. Due to lack of relevant legal precedent, we omit a counterparty risk analysis. However, we encourage the community to consider the following discussion points:  If USDC and TUSD are issued from the same jurisdiction, the diversification benefits might be limited. From that perspective, could other stablecoins such as USDT provide better utility? What are the mandates for blacklists, freezes, or seizure of TUSD? Would stablecoins tied to currencies other than USD provide better diversification?  Risk Parameters Given the significantly lower volumes, DeFi presence, and relative usage compared to USDC, we are proposing a debt ceiling of 2 million for TUSD. This amount could be raised in the future based on improved liquidity metrics or Vault adoption. Additionally, governance may want to consider putting a cap on total debt ceiling exposure to stablecoins (and potentially reduce the USDC debt ceiling simultaneously). The stability fee would normally be a function of the counterparty risk and liquidity. Given that we are ignoring counterparty risk, the stability fee should track higher than USDC due to reduced liquidity. However, given the current campaign of easy monetary policy, we propose a stability fee of 0% until the Dai peg concerns have been fully alleviated. Afterward, governance may charge a stability fee comparatively higher than USDC. We propose the same liquidation ratio as USDC for TUSD: 120%. Lastly, for auction parameters, we propose the same set as USDC. However, as noted above, liquidations will be disabled for the foreseeable future. ",

From that perspective, could other stablecoins such as USDT provide better utility?   I don\u2019t think USDT reserves being held outside the US provides meaningful regulatory risk diversification. The US Treasury can blacklist foreign entities, which prevents any other financial institutions from transacting with the affected Tether reserve holders or acting as correspondent bank to process USD wire transfers. This would lead to immediate halt of USDT creation and redemption, and the underlying Tether banks would probably default almost immediately due to being unable to issue or repay USD debts.

From that perspective, could other stablecoins such as USDT provide better utility?    One distinction I\u2019d make here, and more generally, is that the counterparty risk of TUSD is relatively low given that the money is held in escrow for the benefit holders of the tokens and not by our company. This is a distinguishing feature of our token versus some other US $ stablecoins. We work with multiple trust company and banking partners to custody the respective USD. Our company does not have a legal claim on their funds     cyrus:   What are the mandates for blacklists, freezes, or seizure of TUSD?    You can review our Terms of Use  for our AML-CTF standards and our prohibited uses to get the clearest answer to this question. I addressed this question in my initial post on the forum. You can find the answer here.     cyrus:   Would stablecoins tied to currencies other than USD provide better diversification?    We do also have tokenized versions of HKD, GBP, CAD, AUD, though they have limited usage compared to TUSD. We\u2019d love to speak further about how we could collaborate on these, as well. ",

Community Greenlight and the like) to get this on-boarded and I am curious to the reasons why. Basically if you check the recent presentation from the risk team there are several concerning metrics in the way of market cap growth stagnation and low trading volumes that sort of all roll together to be a bit of a cause for concern pertaining to TUSD\u2019s long term viability. For pretty much every metric that they showed TUSD basically was ranked last among the stablecoins they presented. Based on that presentation I\u2019m a bit surprised to see that we seem to be fast tracking this app. Especially given that based on the fact that the risk team seemed to imply that the main risk here is a non-diversifiable regulatory one. Is there some bit of context that I am missing on this? I understand that we are saying that the debt ceiling will be set appropriately low, but that still doesn\u2019t seem to explain why we are going outside of the established process for a particular asset that we don\u2019t even feel THAT bullish on.

My question here is why are we doing this? What is the benefit that the foundation seems to be pursuing? If it isn\u2019t diversification and it isn\u2019t DAI liquidity what\u2019s the point? Hell hard to even make the argument that we need more liquidity to bring dai back to peg these days (trading on coinbase currently @ ~$0.002 over peg atm). If HK banking is the reason then let\u2019s hear the justification. Ultimately, my point here is that unless the foundation has a strong reason for expediting this it just seems like it should be going through the MIPs process just like any other asset, and by not doing that they are SORT OF acting in bad faith as that is the process that was ratified via executive vote. Just seems like they should have to abide by the MIPs process the same as the rest of the community. All of that said, there might be something that I am missing here. I would love to hear any thoughts from the foundation concerning why we are planning on polling for this collateral next week as opposed to the many others that have been suggested. ",

(For example, the proposal for USDC-B is something that we want in there sooner rather than later. I don\u2019t think we should sacrifice safety for the sake of governance right now.) One of my jobs (literally) is to help bootstrap collateral onboarding and get the flywheel spinning, which is why TUSD and USDC-B are coming this month as part of a \u201cpseudo-MIPs\u201d process. But to the broader question of \u201cWhy TUSD in the first place?\u201d Well, the Maker philosophy from the start has been to add any and all collateral types so long as they are not literal scams.

                    "content": "Given the pre-MIPs extensive community discussions and apparent interest in and request for this collateral type, we are proposing to add a second USDC collateral type to the Maker Protocol (\u2018USDC-B\u2019). The purpose of this additional variant of USDC is to act as an emergency credit facility during times when keeper liquidity is overwhelmed (such as busy liquidation periods with large amounts of collateral being auctioned). This is in contrast to how USDC-A is currently being utilized (primarily as a tool to arbitrage the Dai price back down to $1.00). Ideally, the USDC-B collateral type should remain unused unless there is a severe and acute liquidity issue in the Dai markets. To incentivize this behavior, an abnormally high stability fee is being proposed to discourage long-term usage. There have been numerous prior discussions in the community regarding the risks of USDC as a collateral type. Here is a compiled list of prior analysis for governance to review. Original USDC discussion thread: Onboarding USDC as collateral to mitigate liquidity risk Original USDC onboarding proposal: Proposal for Collateral Onboarding of USDC Discussions on the need for both a USDC-A and USDC-B collateral types: USDC: Peg Arbitrage vs. Auction Liquidity Governance call discussing USDC risk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZFfGlp01q0 Other related threads: Summary of USDC protocol risk [USDC plus additional Stablecoins] Risk Parameter Request for Comment What's the point of adding stablecoins as collateral? As is the case for USDC-A, liquidations will be disabled for this proposal, and the oracle price would be fixed at $1. Metrics for USDC can be found in our TUSD proposal [TUSD] Proposal for Collateral Onboarding Risk Parameters We propose a 120% liquidation ratio for the same reasons as USDC-A. Specifically, the goal is to strike a balance between keeper capital efficiency and debt ceiling abuse through recursive leverage (which is made easier at lower liquidation ratios). We propose a debt ceiling of 10 million. This number is slightly lower than what we might have preferred, but due to a) the OSM risk, and b) the 20 million debt ceiling of USDC-A, we are wary of the total counterparty exposure towards USDC. Additionally, for the time being the unutilized portion of USDC-A can also be used for emergency liquidity. In the future, the usage of Instant Access Modules will allow governance to keep this debt ceiling low, only to be increased on the go as needed. We propose a stability fee of 50%. This high stability fee is designed to discourage long term sustained usage of USDC-B. Otherwise, during a liquidity crunch the keeper community may come to find that their emergency credit facility has already been used up for other purposes. At the same time, the stability fee should not be so high such that keepers\u2019 Vaults would quickly become undercollateralized and liquidated. Even though liquidations would be disabled at the start, there is always the possibility that they will be enabled at any moment. The USDC-A Vault behavior shows a median collateralization ratio of ~125%, implying that Vault owners are targeting roughly a 5% buffer over the liquidation ratio. If we assume USDC-B Vault owners will also keep a 5% buffer, then we would be interested in knowing how quickly Vaults would become undercollateralized at various stability fees. Screen Shot 2020-05-21 at 10.44.27 AM1248\u00d7258 33.3 KB At the proposed stability fee of 50%, keepers would have roughly 1 month to close out their Vaults before liquidation would occur (assuming they begin with at 125% CR and do not add additional collateral). This proposal will go up for a governance vote this Monday. ",

It may work better in a ax + b form.  A 3% vault fee with a base rate of -2%, makes a big difference with a 3% vault fee with a base rate of 10%. (Assuming ETH-A has a 2% vault fee).

On collaterals where a fixed rate is desired, FRF would be set to 0, and the Stability Fee would rely solely on the Risk Premium. Innitially I would see the FRF either being set at 0 or 1. But it could be later set to any positive (or negative) value. Note that this is still a y = ab + x model, just that the a in the equation is usually set at either 1 or 0. When it\u2019s set at 1 the equation becomes SF = base fee + risk premium. When set at 0 it becomes SF = risk premium. ",

It\u2019s sole purpose is to provide emergency liquidity in the case of a market crash. It has no bearing on monetary policy. My understanding was always base rate = primary monetary policy lever.

Users gain exposure to these assets by depositing their Ethereum digital assets (e.g. DAI USDC) into the DMM Ecosystem and receive back a corresponding mToken (e.g. mDAI mUSDC) representing a claim on their deposit (like Compound cTokens). A portion of these deposited funds are then used to purchase interest generating real-world assets and the rest is left in the contract for withdrawal liquidity. Users can hold, transfer, and trade mTokens in any Ethereum wallet as tokens are fully ERC20 compliant. There is a blacklist, but there is no whitelist for mTokens. Users can redeem their mTokens to withdraw their share of the underlying digital asset that was originally deposited plus interest generated. mTokens are overcollateralized in terms of both the valuation of real-world assets (collateral worth \u2265100% of mToken value) and in the interest streams those assets generate (generates more than 6.25% APY). As such, mTokens are stable and predictable in value compared to cryptocurrencies such as ETH, making it an excellent addition to the MakerDAO credit system as an uncorrelated collateral option for users and the DMMF to mint DAI against real world assets. mTokens are currently overcollateralized with $8.5M in automobiles within the United States. More information can be found on-chain or on our Explorer page. 3. Provide a brief history of the project The DeFi Money Market (DMM) was launched in March 2020 in partnership with Chainlink to bring real world assets into Ethereum\u2019s DeFi ecosystem. DMM has also been backed by Billionaire Tim Draper\u2019s Venture Studio who purchased a stake of the DMM DAO. Since release, over $245k worth of mTokens have been purchased on the Swap app with mTokens now supported on the Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet. The DeFi Money Market is built to enable anyone to earn a stable yield on their digital assets in a permissionless and borderless manner, requiring nothing more than an internet connection and an Ethereum address. The DeFi Money Market Foundation (DMMF) is currently overseeing the DMM protocol, but ownership of the protocol, real world assets, and off-chain fiat holdings will be transferred to the DMM DAO which will be run and managed by a distributed group of DMG governance token holders. Decentralization of DMM is a continual work in progress, but we are working to ensure DMM is as transparent and trust-minimized as possible. 4.

DMM is currently undergoing a Smart Contract security audit which is being performed by the security firm SECBIT who previously audited Loopring, DDEX, and more. The audit process thus far has been positive with no critical issues found and the final report will be published publicly once complete. 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Discord Telegram Twitter 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? mTokens (mDAI mUSDC) are currently being used by Ethereum users to earn 6.25% on their digital assets by gaining exposure to interest-generating real world assets. As mTokens are ERC20 compliant, they can be transferred using any regular Ethereum wallet. We are working with various DeFi protocols, aggregators, and portals so mTokens can be utilized by the most users. We believe adding mTokens as collateral in the MakerDAO credit system (Vaults) can boost the overall liquidity of DAI and help act as a peg stabilizer as these assets are uncorrelated to cryptocurrencies such as ETH and have minimal opportunity cost as mTokens are interest generating enabling users to get the most utility out of their deposited funds, namely stablecoins. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Currently the DeFi Money Market Foundation (DMMF) holds and owns the contractual rights to the underlying collateral (real world assets) through a first lien, senior-secured position meaning it is above all other rights and has first priority in the event of lack of payment. The DMMF was established and has an office in the United Arab Emirates in cooperation with the UAE government\u2019s Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). The DIFC is home to an internationally recognized, independent regulator and a proven judicial system with an English common law framework being the leading financial hub for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia regions. However, ownership of the protocol, its real world assets, and fiat currency reserves will be transferred from the DMMF to the DMM DAO which will substantially reduce any single points of failure. The beginning process to the decentralization of governance, starts with a transitional DAO acting as custodian, essentially the role the DMMF\u2019s core team fulfilled in the ecosystem at implementation. This initial transition will remove central points of control and help ensure that the protocol is unable to be captured or censored, while also moving control of the treasury from the core team members to a DAO. Functionally, this will look like multiple independent teams financed by revenue from the DAO to maintain critical functions for the ecosystem\u2019s protocol. The DMM DAO will be established after the transitional DAO, and while the structure is to be determined, the core team\u2019s initial view is to develop a representative democracy. The ultimate goal is to decentralize control of the DMM Ecosystem and its collateral as much as possible. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Wrapping and unwrapping of mTokens occurs on the DMM Swap app, but we are working with 1inch.exchange to get listed and enable any token <-> mToken swapping capability. The underlying digital assets that can be wrapped in mTokens or redeemed from mTokens like DAI and USDC are already highly liquid in DeFi applications and exchanges. The redeeming process is subject to the digital asset liquidity available in the mTokens contract (portion not sold for real world assets), but secondary markets can be created on various decentralized exchanges to fuel extra liquidity as needed. An easy way to bootstrap this is with uniswap v2 pools, e.g. DAI/mDAI and USDC/mUSDC pairings. 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We do not have a legal opinion or memoranda at this time. 11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. We do not have any regulatory registrations for mTokens at this time. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. A simple oracle to use would be the exchange rate built into each mToken that relays how much underlying digital assets each mToken can be redeemed for. For example mDAI can be redeemed for DAI, mUSDC to USDC, and then the stablecoins can either be assumed to be $1 in value or can be priced by using a price feed such as Chainlink\u2019s DAI/USD reference network. In summary, valuation can be calculated by multiplying the built-in exchange rate in the mToken contract by how many mTokens are used as collateral and then multiplied by either a static value 1 or by the Chainlink/Maker price feeds for DAI/USD and USDC/USD. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. This is a function that the DMM Foundation could help perform and bootstrap, but a distributed set of liquidators would be the ideal solution. Liquidations of mTokens have the interesting property that the liquidator can redeem their received mTokens for the underlying digital asset (DAI for mDAI, USDC for mUSDC) given that there is enough reserve liquidity of digital assets that haven\u2019t been withdrawn. Initially the reserve ratio for withdraw liquidity is currently set at 50%, but is currently residing at 100% as to grow liquidity. If there is too little liquidity in the mToken\u2019s digital asset reserve (due to user withdraws), liquidators can then either trade their mTokens on secondary markets or redeem their mTokens at a later date when the liquidity has returned due to either user deposits or the Foundation (eventually DMM DAO) liquidating a portion of the real world assets to purchase back the underlying digital asset and deposit it into the mToken contract. We\u2019re excited to work with the Maker community as we believe adding DMM\u2019s mTokens would be a mutually beneficial relationship for both projects.

I have a background in consumer lending and securitization so I have a few questions about your underlying product:  In your explorer, a value is listed for each underlying asset. It looks like this is the value of the loan, not the vehicle value. Is this correct? What sort of loan to value ratios do you allow into your underlying loan portfolio? What sort of credit and income underwriting requirements? What is the weighted average interest rate, FICO, DTI, and LTV of the portfolio of underlying assets? If you can point me to any further resources where this information is available that would be appreciated. Do you originate the loans yourself, or service and collect on the loans? If not your organization, how is this managed? How do you mitigate the risk of loan contracts being invalidated due to violations of US consumer lending regulations? What concrete ownership rights or legal claims do mToken holders have on the underlying collateral pool (loans and liens)? Is there an SPV or trust structure in place to ensure that the Tokens are \u201cbankruptcy remote\u201d in the even that DMMF or DMM DAO became insolvent? mTokens would clearly be considered securities by US authorities, yet you do not preform any KYC before directly offering tokens to users. How are you mitigating the risk of selling unregistered securities to US persons? Could you conceivably be forced to retroactively require KYC before permitting redemptions? Auto loans are a fundamentally illiquid asset. How would you be able to meet large redemption requests on short notice if most of your funds are invested in loans?  ",

                    "content": "My understanding of DMM in it\u2019s current highly-centralized iteration:   DMM allegedly owns liens on used vehicles in the US (although proper proof has not been provided to the public)   Users purchase mTokens from a pre-minted amount owned by DMM using ETH, DAI or USDC   DMM converts the crypto to USD which is allegedly used solely to service the used car loans, and repurchases the crypto when the user/depositor wants to redeem their mTokens (supposedly on demand)   DMM manually purchases ETH options from Deribit to protect against volatility in ETH after they convert it to USD.   Among the areas of major concern that I would like to see DMM satisfactorily address before this application goes anywhere:   DMM has not provided proof that it actually owns the liens on the used cars. This is critical since it is supposedly the way that APY is being generated for users/depositors. There are scans of car titles posted on their website however all personal info is redacted and \u201cDMM Foundation\u201d is photoshopped on to each scan (example).   It has not been proven that 100% of user deposits are used to service the actual car loans. There is no transparency offered into the usage of the funds after they are converted to USD.   No additional info has been provided about these loans, including the creditworthiness of the lendees, if the loans are even being paid off, or DMM\u2019s ability to repossess vehicles if loans go unpaid. It is highly likely that a large number of the loans are delinquent, but users have no idea how that may affect their ability to earn interest or get their ETH/DAI/USDC deposit back.   The conversion of ETH/DAI/USDC to USD and vice versa, as well as the purchasing of ETH options, are currently being done manually. This system has not been thoroughly tested and has a high likelihood of failing in periods of major volatility.   With its (alleged) direct connection & interaction with real-world assets, it seems highly likely that DMM will face regulatory issues in the very near future that could force major changes in the way that it is structured and the way that mTokens are sold/redeemed.

Concrete Data: Token Contract Address: mDAI - 0x06301057D77D54B6e14c7FafFB11Ffc7Cab4eaa7 mUSDC - 0x3564ad35b9E95340E5Ace2D6251dbfC76098669B Circulating Token Supply:  13,916.2556* mDAI 136,084.893* mUSDC  Token Market Cap of Circulating Token Supply ( TMC ):  mDAI => 15,419.50 mUSDC => $138,886.40.  Total Number of Holders:  mDAI: 33 mUSDC: 22  Token Distribution:  mDAI: Top 5 holders hold 89.6% of Circulating Token Supply mUSDC: Top 4 holders hold 90% of Circulating Token Supply  Avg Collateralization Ratio of Maker Protocol ( avgCR ): 361.38% *this excludes: DMM mDAI Token Contract DMM mUSDC Token Contract Assumptions:   Assume a reasonable minimum collateralization ratio ( minCR ) based off empirical values in collateral portfolio. Since mDAI and mUSDC is likely to be at least as risky as ETH/BAT, let\u2019s assume minCR = 150%. Note that the reason the risky isn\u2019t on the same level as USDC with a minCR of 120% is that the issuer can withdraw the DAI and USDC deposited in the contract to purchase loans and as such there\u2019s no guarantees there will be sufficient liquidity to redeem and mDAI/mUSDC into its DAI/USDC counterpart.   Market Cap Utilization ( MCU ), the amount of the TMC that can reasonably expect to be deposited in the Maker Protocol, is bounded by empirical values in collateral portfolio. Currently the lowest and highest MCU in the Maker Protocol are [0.73%, 3.73%]   Formulas: Estimated Lower Economic Impact = TMC * MIN(MCU) / avgCR  Estimated Lower Economic Impact  = $154,305.90 * .0073 / 3.6138 = 311.70 DAI  Estimated Upper Economic Impact = TMC * MAX(MCU) / minCR Estimated Upper Economic Impact  = $154,305.90 * .0373 / 1.5 = 3,837.07 DAI  Due to the average of the estimated lower and upper economic impact, the Oracle Team is assigning DMM a Low Economic Impact label Given the distribution of token holders relative to the total number of token holders, how many users with significant sums of the proposed collateral are we reasonably targeting with this integration? ~8 people (90th percentile) Technical Complexity Determine how complex integrating Oracles for this collateral type would be and how long it would take to implement such a solution. Is a solution currently not possible because of a key missing component? Coming up with a way to price mDAI and mUSDC would be exceedingly difficult as the Oracle Team could not identify and reputable exchanges trading significant volume of mDAI nor mUSDC. Are there enough high quality data sources available to construct a reliable, resilient, and secure Oracle for the proposed collateral asset? No, see above. Can the current tooling support the types of data sources that are needed? N/A Can the current tooling support the types of data modeling that are needed? N/A Does adding these features interfere with ongoing or planned development of new tooling on the Oracle Team roadmap? R&D to develop a secure and reliable data model given the lack of exchange liquidity would require significant resources which would detract from Oracle protocol development and other collateral onboarding applications. What dependencies (both technical and system), risks, costs, and latency are added to the Oracle Protocol as a function of these added features? High Oracle risk would be associated mDAI and mUSDC given the constraints mentioned above. Does adding these features require work from other stakeholders such as the Smart Contracts Team(s)? No. How long would it take to design, implement, test, and deploy such a solution? 2 months to develop and test. Given the complex nature of the mDAI and mUSDC integration the Oracle Team considers these a High Technical Complexity project. Evaluation The combination of Economic Impact mapped against the Technical Complexity of onboarding a new collateral type can paint a picture of whether an Oracle Team ought to accept, decline, or defer a collateral onboarding application.      Low Technical Complexity High Technical Complexity     Low Economic Impact maybe decline   High Economic Impact accept maybe    Low Economic Impact x High Technical Complexity => decline Reccomendation Considering this project is fairly new it\u2019s not surprising that it hasn\u2019t accumulated a critical mass of users yet. As it stands at the moment, the amount of Dai that could be generated from the inclusion of mDAI and mUSDC is extremely low, while the complexity of creating Oracles for tokens that haven\u2019t gained much if any liquidity on exchanges is significant and comes with high risk of Oracle failure or manipulation. The combination of extremely low economic impact and high technical complexity to implement an Oracle inclines the Oracle Team to decline the mDAI and mUSDC colalteral onboarding application. ",

The community is seeing that these tokens are problematic if the real-world legal/regulatory questions aren\u2019t answered correctly (like deciding on a means to white list auction participants). That said, I hope the teams do not interpret the push back as anti-security token. Far from it, I think those, in part, are vital to the system\u2019s growth and ability to thrive.

                    "content": "Hey all, Due to the on-going liquidity situation and Dai price instability, we need to make a quick decision on risk parameters such that the executive can go on-chain as quickly as possible. We are targeting getting the executive vote on-chain as soon as the GSM delay is changed to 4 hours. The contents of said executive vote will be influenced by the outcome of these polls. First, the Interim Risk Team presents a note on oracles and liquidation given the nature of USDC as collateral. Then we follow with a brief summary of the tradeoffs for each of the major risk parameters (Stability Fee, Debt Ceiling and Liquidation Ratio) with respect to the emergency onboarding of USDC collateral as part of the effort to increase Dai liquidity. Following a description of the tradeoffs, the Interim Risk Team presents a number of polls that will be used to gather community sentiment and feed into the risk parameters included in the executive vote. Initially, the plan was to present combined risk parameter packages, however, after consideration, separate polls for each of the key risk parameters were determined to be more appropriate. The main goals that MakerDAO should aim to achieve with the introduction of USDC as an emergency collateral type are as follows:  Increase Dai liquidity specifically for keepers taking part in both FLIP and FLOP auctions. Increase Dai liquidity such that the Dai peg moves closer towards $1.  Oracles and Liquidation Due to the nature of the collateral and the time constraints, it is proposed that the oracle price of USDC be set to $1 for the purposes of this Vault. The governance community can consider migrating to another oracle solution in the future. Under normal circumstances setting the oracle price to $1 would still allow liquidations due to accrual of stability fees. However, the collateral type will launch with the new \u201ccollateral liquidation freeze\u201d component switched on. Vault users will not be subject to any liquidations in the short term, even with the accrual of stability fees. Please note, however, that Vault users may be at risk when the liquidation freeze is removed in the future. As always in a non-custodial, permissionless and decentralized system, users alone are responsible for their Vaults. Debt Ceiling There are three main drivers to consider for the USDC debt ceiling. The primary use case is to provide keepers with access to Dai liquidity should they need it to participate in ETH flip auctions. Based on an analysis of the current structure of the Vault portfolio, if Eth were to fall into the $60-$80 range, the set of keepers would collectively need to raise ~20 million Dai amongst themselves. The secondary use case is to provide liquidity for Dai markets, where the Dai price has been trading as high as $1.10. A high debt ceiling would allow market makers to absorb the excess Dai demand seen on centralized exchanges as well as on supply shortages seen on secondary lending platforms such as Compound and dYdX. Thirdly, the community may want to allow additional debt ceiling room to facilitate DeFi users to refinance their outstanding positions from secondaries back to Maker Vaults. The benefit of this is that Maker governance would be able to more directly influence the liquidity situation for the broader ecosystem. A final consideration for debt ceiling is the risk of \u201cblacklisting\u201d by the issuer of USDC or another entity in control of this function. If such a situation were to arise, MKR holders could conceivably need to mint additional MKR via the debt auction in order to cover any potential shortfall from a blacklisting event. Depending on how aggressively the community wants to address these three issues, the debt ceiling could conceivably range anywhere from $10 million to $40 million. Please keep in mind that a more conservative or more aggressive debt ceiling can always be increased / decreased through governance (subject to the 4 hour GSM delay). This will allow the Interim Risk Team and MKR Holders to reevaluate a highly evolving situation, at a tradeoff of governance overhead. Liquidation Ratio Liquidation ratios are typically expected to be fairly low for fiat-backed stablecoins due to their low volatility. However, in this particular instance, governance is targeting highly specific use cases, and the community may be susceptible to a rationing risk. For example, a 102% LR allows for 50x recursive leverage. This means that a user with only 1 million USDC could deliberately soak up the entire debt ceiling through recursive leverage. Spreading the USDC over multiple users should mean that on average more of it will go towards the intended use-cases. Similarly, too high of a liquidation ratio (such as the 150% LR for ETH) is a potentially inefficient use of collateral. As a comparison, secondary lending platforms typically target a 125%-135% range. As a result, a 125% LR is suggested. Stability Fee The stability fee should be set with the community\u2019s specific use cases in mind (auction keeper liquidity and Dai peg management). The primary consideration is that the stability fee should be set high enough so that the limited debt ceiling is not utilized for any alternative use cases that don\u2019t alleviate keeper liquidity or the Dai peg. Too low of a stability fee could cause just a few Vault owners to utilize the entire debt ceiling. Therefore, a high stability fee can price out these Vault owners. Another consideration is secondary lending platforms, which currently carry a 17%-45% lending rate for Dai due to the high utilization rate. If the stability fee is below these amounts, then a significant amount of Dai will be generated to immediately lend to these other platforms. This is not necessarily undesirable, but it is not one of our primary goals, and the debt ceiling could be hit very quickly. At the same time, too high of a stability fee may cause fewer Vault owners to take advantage of this collateral type, reducing the effectiveness of the collateral type. Due to the competing dynamics, governance should be vigilant in adjusting the stability fee appropriately based on changing market environments. The community should be aware, however, that it will be easier to start high and lower the stability rather than the opposite. Liquidations would be disabled at the launch of the collateral type. However, the following are proposed auction parameters subject to the removal of the liquidation freeze. Liquidation Penalty The liquidation penalty is suggested to remain at 13% for similar reasoning as other Vault types. The liquidation penalty cannot be too low due to the auction grinding attack vector. Auction Lot Size An auction lot size of 50,000 USDC is proposed for similar reasoning as other Vault types. Lot sizes that are too low cause significant friction with respect to network congestion and usage. Lot sizes that are too high price out many individual smaller keepers. To strike a balance between network congestion and participation, a 50,000 USDC lot size is suggested. Auction Bid Duration A bid duration of six hours is suggested for similar reasoning as other Vault types. Too low of a bid duration can be dangerous due to potential network congestion issues. Too long of a bid duration means the keeper will incur additional price volatility risk Minimum Bid Increment A bid increment of 3% is suggested for similar reasoning as other Vault types. Maximum Auction Duration A maximum auction duration of 3 days is suggested since liquidations might occur under uncertain circumstances. For example, if the market price of USDC is trading at $0.50 (yet the fixed oracle is still displaying $1), then Vault owners are incentivized to max out their Dai generation, which would lead to mass liquidations soon after. In such a scenario, the community might want to keep auctions running for several days in order to facilitate the liquidation process. Dust Limit A dust limit of 20 is suggested for similar reasoning as other Vault types. This decreases the risk of spam Vaults being created. ",

                    "content": "As I stated in governance and risk - using one option here and not doing a second or even third one at the same time centralizes blacklisting risk.   It increases this as a hazard and basically kills the whole scenario as a valid option.  Doing two more means one of them should work (TUSD since they applied and maybe PAX as possible options) same parameters but spread DC\u2019s should suffice. If we see they all go we can manage the DC\u2019s appropriately. Secondly with respect to starting up liquidations - please make sure to give enough warning time before turning those on - 48hrs minimum. I have a problem with 15% SF but honestly want this to start low vs. high as suggested.  You guys actually want people to use this don\u2019t you? I also want to urge to start the DC on the low side vs. going high immediately and to urge putting up a new executive with MCD DC going from 100M to say 80M to limit any sort of MCD minting attacks.   Even $75M would not be unreasonable. The other hazards is that PEG quickly reverses hard and the hope is the users of the facilities will mop up the excess DAI at profit\u2026   This will need to be watched carefully and is a real risk here.  This is particularly true if markets fall and collateral is auctioned at some point when/if vault collateral is cleared in auction the need for DAI will dry up faster than it is being created the reversal move here is going to have to be swift as well - probably by using the USDC SF to mop it up and a looming turning on liquidations announcement which may whipsaw liquidity again. I want to urge the community here.  Start and try to move slower than you think because fast moves could just drive this system to an unmanageable state. MKR market cap is $170M, TOTAL outstanding here is $83M  If I have correct number - even if all collateral liquidates at 50% the hook here for MKR is at most $30M and falling.   EDIT ADD: 83M*.63 = 52.3 which leaves about $30M potential gap.  .63=.5(avg sale price) - .13 liquidation fee. I also would urge a better control over auction mechanics and an absolute minimum floor on ETH price that Maker would rather choose to ride the collateral with vault owners than liquidate it. I have this price around $30 ETH but have no clue where MKR cap will be then perhaps $50-60M frankly at that point most people are en effect pretty wiped out except everyone trying to participate in a growing USDC/DAI fund to stabilize these markets and MKR will have ~10M or so of USDC in coffers to cover as well. I also want to note from what I\u2019m seeing it looks like ES is completely off the table here - so basically no-one is talking about conditions for ES which is the alternate approach to consider here while the OSM and market prices are still rather \u2018intact\u2019 and not \u2018dis-located\u2019 - thinking one can do an ES with OSM live market price dislocation is probably the worst time to ES this. Maybe rather than go through all these convolutions an ES is better.  Honestly on the fence here and about all I have to say at this point.   Seriously consider adding at least one more stable coin to this endeavor than USDC to spread the blacklist event risk. ",

Basically what I leave the SCD alone here as this requires SAI not DAI and everyone was warned to get out of that long ago.   SO if I just look at the MCD we are basically at 83M including the SCD.   Liquidate at 1/2 value - apply 13% liquidation fee and one lands around $30M max Maker is on the hook for here.   Sorry the 107M was just incorrect. Also the only way to deal with a liquidity crunch is to supply liquidity - we want to decrease demand not increase it.   When markets are falling people and there is a confidence crisis in the system everyone will be trying to find DAI to close their loans.   It really is a real hazard with these systems is that one has to find liquidity in only a single thing to pay back a loan vs. having multiple options for how to pay down a loan - particularly when liquidity in what one needs to pay with is low.

I may be too late to the conversation to be considered. But I\u2019ve long felt that the perfect collateral would be Uniswap Liquidity Tokens. They are redeemable for a reasonably stable value after you factor in for the impermanent loss. You also could create some novel feedback loops if, for example, ETH-DAI were to be selected as the accepted liquidity token. Each minting of new tokens adds additional price stability to the ecosystem. Then regardless of what happens to the price, approximately the same value can be recovered at scale. One other consideration would be to use USDC-ETH pair, then you get the stabilizing aspects of USDC without the centralized tradeoffs of USDC. It\u2019s like adding a DeFi wrapper to USDC. ",

                    "content": "Bringing Bitcoin (and Bitcoiners) to Maker Hello everyone, I\u2019m Matt Luongo, the project lead for tBTC. We\u2019ve built a Bitcoin sidechain to Ethereum, meant to give Bitcoin the full superpowers of Ethereum and bring additional collateral to DeFi. While I believe BTC can be great collateral for DAI, more importantly, I believe a native BTC on-ramp into the ecosystem can grow the protocol\u2019s user base. An on-ramp into DAI and Ethereum that avoids centralized gatekeepers and unnecessary third parties is the best way to introduce Bitcoiners to the Ethereum ethos en masse and bridge the two cultures. I\u2019m excited to share what we\u2019ve been working on for the past year and a half, tailored to the usecase of MCD. I\u2019m looking forward to feedback from the community on how we can best serve the protocol, strengthen the peg, and work together to build our new financial system. Application  Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  Matt Luongo of Thesis and the Keep project is interested in submitting the following tBTC collateral application.  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  tBTC is an ERC-20 pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin. Instead of relying on a single custodian like wBTC or federation of custodians like Liquid, tBTC is supported by a decentralized bonded multi-federated peg model. The system is a supply peg designed so that tBTC can be minted or redeemed for BTC at any time without 3rd party friction. Each time a Bitcoin is deposited into the system, the underlying Keep network\u2019s random beacon selects a new random set for signers to form a federation. This signers set is bonded 150% the value of the deposit in ETH. The signers generate a key, BTC is sent, and after 6 block confirmations, depositors can post a BTC SPV proof to the Ethereum chain and mint TBTC. Redemption is the reverse: TBTC is sent to the system along with a small fee (5 bps) to pay the signers and once received, BTC is released and the TBTC is burned.  Provide a brief history of the project.  The Keep team grew out of Fold, a popular Bitcoin app first launched in 2014. Keep has been building a system for decentralized signing and custody since 2017, and in late 2018 started building tBTC as the first app to launch on the Keep network. The tBTC technical spec was released in August 2019 by Keep, Summa, and the Cross-Chain Group. tBTC has been live on the Ropsten testnet since January 2020, and will launch live on the Ethereum mainnet on May 11th, 2020.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.  tBTC and Keep underwent a 6 week audit by ConsenSys Diligence, and is entering into an additional audit with Trail of Bits. ConsenSys audit report: https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/2020/02/thesis-tbtc-and-keep/ For context, check out our head of engineering\u2019s summary of the results, and one of our auditor\u2019s reflections on the system design and process. We\u2019ll share the additional audit results from Trail of Bits when they\u2019re available.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Keep & tBTC Discord: https://discord.gg/wYezN7v Cross-Chain Group Telegram: https://t.me/crosschaingroup  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  At launch tBTC will be used as BTC-pegged collater in a number of DeFi apps like Compound, Nuo, Set, and Aave. tBTC allows native BTC to be used directly in these projects, without any redirects or special places to mint or burn.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  tBTC as a protocol enables any KEEP holder to act as a partial custodian of the underlying BTC. No single organization bears legal responsibility for the collateral.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  After May 11th 2020, tBTC will be listed on OasisDEX, Uniswap, Radar Relay, Loopring, and Kyber, among other exchanges and DeFi projects. tBTC can also be directly minted and redeemed using the BTC and ETH chains.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  It has, but providing private legal memos risks waiving attorney-client privilege. Intuitively, our understanding is that as a commodity-backed token, TBTC appears to be favorably treated in the US and similar jurisdictions. Additional Consideration We recognize that tBTC hasn\u2019t existed for as long as candidate collateral like WBTC, and of course agree that confidence in security and market behaviour that comes with time must be a factor in approving assessing collateral MIPs. Because we believe that a non-custodial model for Bitcoin collateral better fits the risk profile of Maker\u2019s design, we\u2019re proposing an additional guarantee on tBTC\u2019s safety as collateral. If tBTC is accepted as collateral, the Thesis team will additionally escrow $15M in KEEP (~12.5% of the supply) for the first 6 months to further backstop tBTC collateral for a debt ceiling up to 10M DAI. We\u2019ll also pursue additional insurance for that period covering up to 500K DAI. ",

If ETH does drop severely relative to BTC, deposits will be redeemed or signer bonds will be seized. Any drop under 33% in ~3 hours won\u2019t have an opportunity to threaten the peg, and a bigger drop than that won\u2019t impact the peg unless signers are also malicious and aren\u2019t worried about losing their work token. Happy to put together a spreadsheet to show what I mean if that\u2019s helpful  EDIT: To put a finer point on it, tBTC isn\u2019t a synthetic. The same design can work without the ETH if signers are assumed honest or if the work token is valuable enough- the ETH is a \u201csecond layer of defense\u201d. ",

I agree that it seems more in line with Maker\u2019s principles than other types of collateral (though I am all for multiple kinds/approaches). I have two questions:  I\u2019m not sure you answered @monet-supply\u2019s actual question (s/he did also specify ETH/BTC, not USD). This spreadsheet would certainly help plebs like me.      mhluongo:  Happy to put together a spreadsheet to show what I mean if that\u2019s helpful    Why the rush? I\u2019m inclined to agree with some of the Foundation devs that letting the contracts exist for ~3months on mainnet is a good way to provide at least some surety that they won\u2019t get hacked. The CD audit is thorough, but it does show up the inherent complexity in the system, and time is a much better test of this than any human, no matter how gifted. I suppose that the MIP process properly executed is at least 3 months, so that could be a vlaid reason for starting now\u2026  ",

I\u2019m in favor of using risk mitigation in the very early stages (ie: smaller DAI ceiling) than sitting on the sidelines for months.  First mover advantage is really important.  If Matt is saying 2k ($20mm) by the end of 2020 and 100-200 ($1mm-2mm) in intial phases why not start with a $500k DAI cap and see how it works.  We adjust it weekly so we can evaluate in real time.  It keeps the downside really small.  And to be fair we should really be shrinking the wBTC cap as well. ",

On the contrary \u2013 I\u2019m very happy the team found this over the weekend, and that it was so early in tBTC\u2019s life on mainnet, leaving room for a redeploy. A couple details, though I\u2019ll leave the rest to the post-mortem.  This was a vulnerability the team found from odd behavior one of our signers was experiencing. We found it ~11:30P ET Sunday, and had mitigated if by ~2:45A ET Monday. No funds were lost. In fact, it appears no depositor funds were ever at risk, and TBTC holders were fully able to redeem. Instead, one of our signer\u2019s funds was put at additional risk. That risk has been mitigated on mainnet, but it remains in the code base\u2026 \u2026 which is why the the emergency pause was invoked. We don\u2019t believe the existing contracts should continue to be used, and plan a full re-deploy.      The_Ratj:  Has their been a post mortem yet on the issue?   We\u2019ll have a full post-mortem out later today \u2013 I\u2019ll update the thread with details. ",
