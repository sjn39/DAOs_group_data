For more information about the history of the development of the Starknet and the ambition of Cairo going forward, you can watch the talk of Eli Ben-Sasson at Starknet sessions last month. The Starknet bridge has been experimental due to a tight limit (1Mn DAI) and the fact that we have been waiting for Regenesis. Most protocols are holding off post-Regenesis to deploy their work and hence the demand in DAI has stayed flat. However, Regenesis will make DAI on Starknet enter a new phase as liquidity is foreseen to pick up after the migration. The ecosystem is vibrant and a lot of teams are building. In terms of absolute github repository with 10+ stars, Starknet is slightly below Arbitrum, and in terms of growth, Starknet is by far the first rollup.
