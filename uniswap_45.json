I\u2019m sure I\u2019m low on the totempole but that\u2019s just for now until I can get on a level that matters to UNISWAP and its people. Any suggestions or advice is welcomed. I believe in crypto currency as a whole and of course want to see it all succeed whether it takes over all fiat or not. ",

I think one of the most useful things that can be done for a base protocol like Uniswap is building on top of it - something that Uniswap Grants Program aims to promote. If you are new to crypto, one advantage you may have over crypto veterans is ability to relate to newcomer\u2019s difficulties and help them better. ",
