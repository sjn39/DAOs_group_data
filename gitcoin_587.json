            "body": "Summary:\n\nIf this proposal passes, we plan to distribute 32,717.33 GTC using WhalerDAO\u2019s Astro-Drop tool to the users below who were eligible for the GTC Airdrop in May 2021, tried to claim their GTC during the airdrop window, but were not able to claim due to an error in the system ingesting their transactions.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe GTC airdrop earlier this year was a great step towards the decentralization of the Gitcoin ecosystem. Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the cut-off date for the airdrop. However, due to an error in the transaction validator these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. After speaking with users and investigating online, it seems that those transactions were incorrectly dropped before the airdrop period. After some of these users reported it, they eventually had their transactions re-added, but after the cut-off date. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate those users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. \n\nWe will compensate the users linked below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We had two criteria in order to show eligible proof:\n\n1) Proof of original donation which meets the original airdrop requirements\n2) Proof of an attempted claim during the original airdrop period\n\nIf passed, we wish to distribute the specified amount (view linked pdf for exact amounts) through WhalerDAO\u2019s Astro-Drop. The total amount of GTC to be distributed to these users is 32,717.33\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n- List of users: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5botoxZ4vd5XpVbZzusyiqxZGfB8SaU/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Budget breakdown:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjNKqpz3iWM5qtXoD58W37ZtDq1ZnETj/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Read the full proposal: \nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-redistribute-gtc-to-individuals-who-could-not-claim-due-to-error/8782\n\n- Distribution tool: \nhttps://whalerdao.github.io/astrodrop/create",

                    "content": "I. Overview The GTC airdrop earlier this year was a great step towards the decentralization of the Gitcoin ecosystem. Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the date of the airdrop, however, an error in the transaction validator ingesting their transactions meant that these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate the users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. II. Proposal Details Since understanding this error involves many fine details and retroactive date tracing, we will look at one user\u2019s experience (@haj199) in order to show how everything unfolded:   February 14th 2021: @haj199 donated a grant (Figure 1) to the project Delta Prize.   ~ March 4th 2021: The project\u2019s name changes on the Gitcoin website from \u201cDelta Prize\u201d to \u201cForce DAO\u201d.   ~March 10th 2021: The Gitcoin bot drops (Figure 1)  haj199\u2019s original transaction to Delta Prize / Force DAO from his Gitcoin account. We examined the Gitcoin code base and did not find a clear reason for this.   May 1st 2021: Cutoff date for transactions factoring into the GTC airdrop. Unfortunately for @haj199, his transaction no longer meets the cut off date because the Gitcoin Bot had already dropped it.   May 25th 2021: The 1-month window for the airdrop opens.   ~June 7th 2021: @haj199 attempts to claim GTC tokens, but is not able to claim the allocated percent of GTC tokens from his donation to Delta Prize / Force DAO. @haj199 lets Gitcoin know by filling out this form. Gitcoin recognizes that his original transaction before the cut-off date was valid and reposts it (Figure 1) on @haj199\u2019s account. Due to the posting of the transaction occurring after the cut-off date (but not that transaction itself), @haj199 is still unable to claim his GTC reward.   This proposal is asking for a rolling period of 4 weeks for \u201caffected individuals\u201d like @haj199 to resolve inconsistencies with activity shown on their Gitcoin profiles by providing \u201cvalid proof\u201d to their eligibility claim. During this 4-week period, users would receive GTC from the DAO treasury upon proving their eligibility. III. Qualifications and Criteria Qualifications for \u201cAffected Individuals\u201d:  Donated to Delta Prize / Force DAO before April 1st 2021 - the cutoff date for the original airdrop. Was not compensated by GTC for those donations. Attempted to claim GTC within the 1-month airdrop window starting on May 25th 2021.  Criteria for \u201cValid Proof\u201d:  Etherscan receipt for transactions before the airdrop cutoff date showing: a. Transaction hash b. Interaction with the Gitcoin: Bulk Checkout smart contract c. Amount sent d. To address (0xe5b5514e0618f4b55736c0c0c78ccd6f8ac14631) e. From address Proof of Wallet ID matching Gitcoin Account a. Our workstream will ask the Gitcoin Core team to look into their database to verify that the wallet ID that made the original donation matches back to the Gitcoin user claiming they are an affected user. b. We are assuming that having a transaction re-added during the 1-month airdrop period is proof that the individual attempted to claim GTC within the window. This is because individuals who re-added their transactions were ones who reached out to Gitcoin via the form, thereby interacting with the Gitcoin website at the time.  IV. Distribution After proving that an individual is an \u201caffected user\u201d and has shown \u201cvalid proof\u201d for their GTC claim, we will use the same formula used to calculate their new GTC allocation as was used in the original airdrop: Formula: GMV per user / GMV Total (in USD, $22,000,000) * GMV Allocation Percent (10,080,000) (see Figure 2 and 3) After calculating the GTC allocations, the process of distributing the actual GTC tokens from the Gitcoin DAO treasury to the \u201caffected users\u201d is a straightforward one, and would be done using Whaler DAO\u2019s AstroDrop application. To learn more about Whaler DAO and their reliability, feel free to check out their grants page. V. Motivation and Benefits By implementing the proposed solution, we uphold the integrity of the Gitcoin ecosystem, ensure equity for all members, and set a positive precedent moving forward. Gitcoin prides itself in empowering participants and emphasizing collaborative behavior. As shown above, it is evident that certain members have not received GTC during the airdrop period despite meeting all requirements and attempting to claim GTC, while other users received their allocation successfully. This proposal aims to retroactively support those members by giving them the GTC they were eligible to originally receive. This allows Gitcoin to stay true to its founding principles while also ensuring all participants are being valued. Finally, this will also set a positive precedent moving forward as it shows that the Gitcoin community through its governance is willing to accommodate and adapt when needed, prioritizing equality and fairness. VI. Drawbacks A potential drawback that might prevent people from voting \u201cyes\u201d on this proposal is that it is asking for GTC tokens to be withdrawn from the DAO Treasury, thereby increasing the circulation of GTC in governance. However, as explained above, these tokens should have been distributed to the users from the treasury earlier during the original airdrop as they were eligible. Another drawback in this proposal is that it does not address what the original bug was that caused the original transactions to be dropped by the Gitcoin bot. However, as proven above, it is clear that regardless of what the error was, it\u2019s explanation is not necessarily needed for remedying the solution, as proof of eligibility can be determined without it. It would be useful to eventually find the root cause and identify the bug to prevent future occurrence of this problem, but it is not needed for this proposal. VII. Voting Yes: Open up a 4 week-rolling period for \u201caffected users\u201d to resolve inconsistencies with their GTC claims mentioned above. If an affected user is able to prove that they were in fact eligible for a GTC allocation from their donation to Force Dao (using the proof criteria above) and did not receive it, then send them their GTC from the DAO treasury. Voting yes only covers the above use case. It does not cover cases for users who forgot to claim their GTC within the original 1-month airdrop. No: No 4-week rolling period of GTC drops for affected users who should have received an allocation but did not due to the error in the transaction validator.     Yes No     0 voters     VIII.

If there\u2019s 100,000 that\u2019s quite a different thing.

Solving this problem once and for all would seem better than opening up a continuing stream of similar claims. Related to 4, is there a plan to broadly announce that this policy is being enacted? If not, then how are you to know that all potential claimants (with similar but different claims) have come forward?  ",

                    "content": "Hey - thanks for the input! I would like to preface this by saying that I am not part of the Gitcoin team, so much of the information obtained had to be acquired by scurrying the website, the forums, discord, etc. As outbound workers on this project, we do not have access to the internal database and had to rely on the Gitcoin core team helping us on a few occasions by providing us with information from their database. That being said, even as outbound workers, we were able to acquire enough proof to show that some individuals would have been eligible for the airdrop, but never received their allocation specific to FORCE DAO. To answer your first 3 questions, we went through the FORCE DAO donation list and were able to identify the list below as all users who had their transactions dropped at the same time by the same error. This is not a big list, as it is specific to the project mentioned above. However, not all the users listed had their transaction re-added during the airdrop window, therefore, using our outbound method of proving attempt to claim GTC, not the entire list might have proof to show that they attempted to claim the GTC during the 1-month window. Therefore, since some individuals from this list can\u2019t even prove attempt to claim during the 1-month window, they would not be eligible for the compensation as they missed the airdrop window entirely. This proposal does not address users who missed the airdrop window entirely. Regardless of who on this list ends up being compensated based on the proof supplied during the rolling window, if you look at the list size and the total amounts donated, we will only need a very tiny portion of the treasury to compensate the individuals affected.   @sitnyaga 7.00 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @drmtaha 0.200 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @jindevilfruits 3.000 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @kumotaro 2700 USDC 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @haj199 50000 USDT 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @andmilj 0.70 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @dekutree1314 0.50 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @angelom777 1.50 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @fdanso 0.60 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @zombiehobbes 1.0 ETH 6 months, 3 weeks ago  @fruktozamin 26000 DAI 6 months, 3 weeks ago  To answer your 4th question, I agree and think solving this problem once and for all for all cases of individuals affected, even across other projects, is a smart decision. However, I also think making an all-encompassing proposal will be harder to get a vote to pass on right now, as a decision that big might appear risky to many voters as it will involve more GTC being distributed. I think that starting small by taking on this project first, seeing how it goes, and then using it as a guide to structure a future all-encompassing proposal would be a wiser decision. Especially considering that the informal workstream we have for this proposal right now consists of mostly outbound workers. For a more encompassing proposal, I think we would need more members from the Gitcoin core team on the workstream, and right now based on my understanding, most of the team is busy with others matters. If an all encompassing proposal ends up happening in the future, I would also be happy to help lead that as I think solving this problem and helping the affected users is a worthy cause. To answer your final question, I think the way to announce this policy would be to directly reach out to the users affected. Since we have narrowed in on a very specific problem within a specific project, we were able to identify the exact people who are affected. I also think making the window for this policy enactment be rolling for 4 weeks, will also give people more than enough time to come forward. Furthermore, we can also announce this policy on the relevant Discord channels pertaining to GTC to let people know about it. ",

To address your first point, I think filtering out sybil users would have been a great idea. However, as you mentioned to me on Discord, and for everyone here to also get in the loop, Blockscience does not have an API right now that we can use for the anti-sybil model. Since they plan to release it much later in the year, we won\u2019t be able to use it for the anti-sybil model. Would definitely be open to any alternative ways to address potential sybil users. However, if we are not able to find a way to do this, I do not think it would be detrimental to the strength of the proposal. Since we are working with a very small list size as seen above, I don\u2019t think this will be a major problem for us. I think your second and third points are closely linked to one another. We will not include users that are banned from github as affected users for this proposal. I also think inviting users to opt in by inputting their info (like tx, gitcoin handle, etc.) will filter out for inactive users as well, so we can definitely make it an interactive process. I believe we can do this by sending out a form for the users to fill out. ",

This should also be especially easy to do given there are enough tokens left unclaimed (IIRC) from the initial distribution to cover these impacted donators. However the response also establishes a bit of a precedent for similar errors in the future and this should be kept in mind. That said, I think it should be imperative to identify the core cause of the error instead of just fixing the result for the loudest party.  We examined the Gitcoin code base and did not find a clear reason for this.  It might be reasonable to designate some minimal workstream funds to throw together an \u201cofficial\u201d/public resource allowing the community to audit the issue (really just an official pdf that says it happened, with tx logs for public investigation, links to reviewed code). This would help the community identify other affected parties/grants and ensure that the topic isnt brought up multiple times, as well as add to the public legitimacy of any new distributions. ",

                    "content": "@David_Dyor Thank you for your positive support towards the proposal. @JTraversa Really appreciate your feedback here. You touch on a really important point: the bug that is the core cause leading to this error for many users. I think finding a permanent solution to prevent an error like this from happening in the future would be the optimal last stage step towards putting this issue to bed. However, we are currently facing a few obstacles preventing us:  The current team tackling this proposal is very limited in size. The team already spent extensive time and effort trying to identify the bug without clear-cut success. The team does not contain any Gitcoin core members / individuals who were part of the group that wrote the original code. Those members are already jammed up with work and have other things on their plates right now.  Since it is possible to prove failure to claim without identification of the bug, we can, and I personally believe we should take the necessary steps to remedy the situation, hence the proposal. That being said, I think your suggestion of creating a public resource sharing all the ground we\u2019ve covered so far with regards to identifying the bug is a smart supplementary idea. We will put that together if this proposal passes. Hopefully, with the help of more people within the community we can identify this bug once and for all. I also agree that a proposal like this will set a precedent, but I do not think that it will be a bad one. I think having the community, without any monetary incentive to do so, come together and show support to retroactively help those who were unfortunate victims of an error in the system will demonstrate strength in integrity. Although there might be other parties with similar problems, I think creating an all-encompassing proposal for everyone is the ideal scenario. However, I also think that getting a proposal like that to pass, given the team size we have right now and how much money we would need from the treasury, will not be feasible and probably won\u2019t pass right out the bat. That is why I still think that starting small by passing this proposal first, and then gaging its response might be the safer and wiser approach to structure a future all-encompassing proposal with more hands on deck.

In addition, some of the largest single distributions already went through to the creators of this DAO but they have not been active or meaningful participants in its success (which was in many ways the meta-goal of distribution).   This proposal risks opening up a larger pandoras box that will likely distract stewards or other participants for more pressing issues around how we push forward our mission to grow and sustain public goods. I should also stress that it would be incumbent on the DAO to operationally execute on this from start to finish as the core team would not be allowed to assist in the way they did to set up the initial claim.   In many cases, the amounts of funding we\u2019re talking about could be attained by joining a workstream for less than 1 quarter, I would argue the fact that we are talking about very small amounts is in fact as much of a reason to not spend time here as it is to move forward.   Again please don\u2019t take this the wrong way, I think the claim experience could have been executed better, but I think we\u2019re chasing a zero-sum versus positive-sum game here. ",

                    "content": "Hey Scott - thanks for your input here. I spoke to a few of the community members and we understand where you are coming from, and as such I would like to clarify a few things in regards to the points you bring up. I don\u2019t think the first point presents a strong enough case to argue against the passing of this proposal. Although transactions to Force DAO were outside of the grants round, they still technically occurred before the cut-off date, and the original GTC drop did cover Force DAO contributors when the tokens were being distributed. The fact that some Force DAO donators received their share of GTC while others did not due to the error demonstrates that Force DAO contributions are in fact eligible contributions. As such, I believe all the evidence points towards them still being eligible. While some of these users have not been very active participants, I don\u2019t think it diminishes their eligibility claim. I personally think it\u2019s harsh to expect reciprocated contribution to the community from their end when they felt left out of the community by not being included in the drop. And I don\u2019t mean to point fingers when I say this, I am just trying to make sure their voices are also heard in this discussion. What happened with the error happened in the past and is nobody\u2019s fault, but I think it\u2019s the steps we take moving forward which are more important. I think compensating these eligible individuals is a positive gesture Gitcoin can make to reintegrate these marginalized individuals back into the community. After working with them on this proposal, I can tell you that many of them are fantastic individuals with great minds and ideas who can be a real asset to this community. To address the second point taking Kevin\u2019s input into consideration, we will ensure that the implementation of this proposal will require minimal assistance from the DAO\u2019s part. I will work with the rest of my team on generating a final list of individuals (and their addresses) who have demonstrated valid proof of eligibility, so that we can present this information, and with the approval of the community, distribute the GTC ourselves. We have been working on this proposal for weeks and have covered most of the ground work ourselves already, and I am confident we can bring this past the the end-line ourselves as well. I think if this proposal passes, it reinforces the already strong notion that Gitcoin is truly a decentralized entity. To address your third and final point, I do not think the suggestion that working elsewhere to earn tokens they were already eligible for is convincing enough. I think it\u2019a a matter of principle rather than token amount here. Regardless of how big or how small X\u2019s contribution was, if X is eligible for GTC from the drop, I do not think X should be told to work elsewhere to receive the amount they were eligible for from the drop. It just seems like disincentivizing ask in my opinion. The time and effort being spent here is time and effort spent by these affected individuals which could pave the way for the re-forming of a strong relationship between themselves and Gitcoin moving forward. Furthermore, some of these contributions are way larger than any amount that could be earned in a quarter, and especially for these individuals, it seems harsh to suggest joining a work stream for a quarter. I tried my best to avoid coming off as hostile the points you bring up, so my sincerest apologies if I do seem antagonizing - that was not my intention. I think the points you bring up are strong rebuttals to the proposal. That being said, I ultimately do not believe that these counter-arguments are enough to justify the failing of this proposal. ",

Here are the final amendments based on your feedback:  Rather than open a 1-month window for allowing users to supply proof as qualifying for the \u201caffected user\u201d category, we will now only compensate the users listed below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We have obtained this list by doing the following steps:a) Reaching out to all members who had dropped transactions from FORCE DAO donations. This was done through discord and/or posting on their gitcoin page.b) For those that responded, we ensured proof of the original donation (through an etherscan receipt) and attempted a claim during the original airdrop period.  *Given that this proposal has been posted for 1-month+ we will no longer be adding any new users. We have personally reached out to all affected users on the Gitcoin website and on the Gitcoin discord. Thus, unfortunately it does not make sense to add more users given the original airdrop period was only 1-month long and we have given all affected users at least that long to get back to us.

I understand where you are coming from, but personally, I\u2019m not sure if I ultimately agree that the opening of a Pandora\u2019s box of future requests justifies not compensating eligible users. For the other potential voters on here, I would like to explain why I think so. I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of us here are on the same page about the fact that these users have demonstrated that they are in fact eligible. The main worry is this potentially shifting focus away from other matters. I do not think this will be an extra burden on the community, especially the Gitcoin Core team. As demonstrated by this proposal, the proof of eligibility can be arrived at without the need to trouble the core team, and the carrying out of this redistribution can be done using tools that do not require much extra work from the team\u2019s part. WhalerDAO\u2019s Astrodrop tool is such an example. The people actually putting in the work to build a proposal like this one are mostly affected users who want to to do some little bit of work because they are personally affected by the matter. The biggest ask we are making from the team\u2019s part is simply voting on Snapshot or Tally. If you look at these requests on a case by case basis, for users who have proven eligibility, I don\u2019t see how an option that chooses not to compensate them aligns with Gitcoin\u2019s core mission. If the aim is to empower a whole community of builders and individuals, then letting a few cases of misfortune slip by the cracks hinders us from fulfilling that mission to its truest nature. That is why I think voting yes on this proposal is important: it shows that the larger community can come together to support a smaller subset of that community. If that is not inclusive community empowerment, I don\u2019t know what is. Again, thanks for your input and taking the time to read the proposal, Kris. I hope other people are able to see this proposal from the different light I have just mentioned. ",

Is there a record of the accounts who donated actually using or being active contributors to ForceDAO? I think this is my primary reason as it is a considerable allocation of GTC and I am weary of its impact on the treasury (while we wait for a dashboard to be build showing a real time health of the treasury which I am trying to push forward). I also cannot see, and please let me know if I have missed it, any indication that the GTC will not be offloaded immediately. I understand your points, Tardigrade and on the surface I was definitely going to vote yes because I do believe in fair distribution - but digging into it a little bit, I have a few concerns that I am unable to resolve from the info available/in the proposal. Hence my vote - I know you reached out to me on Sunday to go through the proposal and my apologies for missing a reply over the weekend. ",

I think they are healthy in bringing us closer to fully understanding the nature of the problem. I spent a lot of time the last few hours researching more about this project and speaking to the affected users. I also tried reaching out to the Force team to get a better idea of the situation. Here are some of the things I was able to uncover to address your concerns: \u201cIs there an instance where the \u201cdonors\u201d were in effect purchasing their share in ForceDAO?\u201d The research I found shows that Force and Gitcoin partnered together to host the Force prize which was an ongoing competition scheduled to take place every 6 months in the form of Gitcoin Hackathons. The grant was set up at the time to fund an operation/org to build yield strategies, and never a membership in a DAO. Based on the different sources, this appears to have always been a grant, and the team set it up in conjunction with Gitcoin. There was no portrayal of any equity compensation when it happened, contrary to speculation. \u201cIs there a record of the accounts who donated actually using or being active contributors to ForceDAO?\u201d I spoke to some of the eligible members to ask about their contributions to Force, and the two users who make up the largest share of this proposal\u2019s GTC pool (haj199 and sitnyaga) have both been active members to Force DAO. Although Force turned out unsuccessful, both these users played a part in the project. Members of the Force team who I was able to get in contact with confirmed this, noting how Haj199 was consistently active in advisory and strategy assistance, while Sytnyaga is actively assisting with the project\u2019s recent pivot to a new direction following its past difficulties. At the end of the day, I\u2019d prefer not place words in other people\u2019s mouths by making claims about what they will or will not do, but if my word as the creator of this proposal counts for anything, here\u2019s what I think: I personally do not believe these users will offload the GTC upon claim if this proposal passes. There is no way to guarantee this and I say this based purely on gut instinct. As an optimist, I always try to see the truth and good in people\u2019s words. Based on their past behavior contributing to Force and based on my interactions with them over the last few months, I think these users truly want to be active in helping govern Gitcoin. I know I said this before, but having worked with some of these users for months on this proposal, and after listening to their great ideas and plans to contribute to Gitcoin, I think the community will benefit from their future involvement. These users are great workers and I am very grateful to have met them and learned from them in this time period. I understand there is some headwind against the proposal right now, and this saddens me. I have dedicated much time and effort to this proposal because I truly believe in it, and I tried my absolute best to get people to share my enthusiasm towards it as well. It\u2019s been a tremendous journey working on this project for so long and learning so much about how Gitcoin operates during this time period, and I can\u2019t wait to undertake new projects moving forward as well. I just ask for those of you who voted against this proposal, to reevaluate your vote based on my findings above. And if there are still those who disagree or have any other new information that I haven\u2019t been made aware of to add to the discussion, I gladly welcome it and ask that you please leave a comment. The more angles we cover, the clearer I believe a decision to vote can be made. ",

Seeing that the majority of votes on the snapshot voted yes, however a minority with sizable GTC allocation have flipped the vote, I feel obliged to chime in as I am a major benefactor here. Responding to @Pop\u2019s concern about the GTC being offloaded immediately, I will pledge to lock-up 50% of my GTC for a period of 12months and pledge the other 50% to be donated to future Gitcoin Round grants. Hopefully that also addresses @DisruptionJoe\u2019s concern about my activity and benefit to the network. I would also like to say that I worked pretty closely with ForceDAO in the early days after the donation, and though the project has failed, I do not take that as a reason for this proposal to be penalized here. Performance of projects that took part in the Gitcoin Grants was never a metric that was ever used when the original airdrop was put in place to begin with. Hope this addresses some issues and hopefully the community can come through!  ",

Maybe I wouldn\u2019t be so perturbed if we weren\u2019t building the Green Pill and other regen concepts in this DAO, but we are doing that, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here in the first place. In other words, I\u2019m a bleeding heart here for the hope WAGMIT provides to all members of the community. I don\u2019t want my good name and honourable reputation that I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot to maintain over the years attached to a degen community pretending to be regen, a community of good rhetoric but not good substance; that\u2019s worse than a degen community being honest about being degen. Moloch won this round hands down! Merry Coal Pill Christmas y\u2019all. Sincerely, bestape ",

Alberto Cevallos, the founder of the project recently announced that the project will be unwinding their operations, and will be redistributing their possession of GTC to users who were disproportionately impacted by the project\u2019s failures, and users who were mentioned in this proposal are included in that list. I am in contact with Alberto and he asked me to compile a list of eligible users. To preserve confidentiality, if you are one of the users mentioned in the above proposal and would like to be reimbursed, please find me on the Gitcoin discord channel send me a private message with the address you wish to receive your allocation in. I will personally reach out to all of you on discord as well, but I am just bumping this message here in case you don\u2019t see my message on there. For more information about this redistribution process, feel free to check out the link below. A massive thank you is owed to Alberto and the Force DAO team for going out of their way to make things right for the users on here who were victims of an error in the redistribution process. Awesome work!  Medium \u2013 4 Mar 22    Winding Down and Redistribution A Letter to the Community  Reading time: 4 min read       Hope this news provides some sense of closure. Best wishes, ",
