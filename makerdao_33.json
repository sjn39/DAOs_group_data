MakerDAO initiates delegate compensation With the passage of the December 2nd Executive Vote, MakerDAO has transferred a total of 35,834 Dai to four Recognised Delegates:  FlipFlopFlap Delegate LLC Feedblack Loops LLC ultraschuppi Field Technologies Inc.  This is in accordance with the three-month Delegate Compensation Trial outlined in MIP61 and voted on in this Signal Request. Please see MIP61 and the Ratification Poll for more details.  Sorbet Finance UI vulnerability discovered A vulnerability has been discovered in the Router contract used by the Sorbet Finance UI, and funds have been whitehat hacked to a secure location. Unfortunately, some wallets still have the contract approved to spend tokens. This does not directly affect MakerDAO\u2019s integration with G-UNI, but the Gelato team is requesting that all G-UNI users revoke token approvals for wallets that have interacted with the Sorbet Finance UI. For reference, the contract can be located at: 0x14e6d67f824c3a7b4329d3228807f8654294e4bd.

Adjust minimum bid increase(beg) and lot size (bump) on flap-auctions - Signal Closes December 31st - Data shows that there are some inefficiencies when it comes to how we buy back MKR, such as buying 3.62% over market price. @JustinCase proposes to lower the beg to retain more value to be burned. In order to offset some of the disadvantages, @JustinCase would, at the same time, propose to increase the lot size.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Votes  Active Executive Votes Flash Mint Implementation, Debt Floor Changes If this proposal passes, the following will occur;  The Flash Mint Module will be activated and authorized to flash-mint DAI. The Debt Floor (dust) parameter for all vault types excluding PSM-USDC-A, ETH-B, and ETH-C will be increased from 5,000 DAI to 10,000 DAI. The Debt Floor (dust) parameter for the ETH-B vault type will be increased from 15,000 DAI to 30,000 DAI.

Signaling for community support to delay voting on additions to the PSM to get a clearer understanding of what Paxos and other stablecoin PSMs can offer. Raise SF On RWA When Issuers Unilaterally Change Terms Based on the discussion around the term changes from New Silver, @PaperImperium is signaling for support to raise Stability Fees 3% when such changes occur. Adjusting ttl(bid-duration) on flap-auctions The ttl is the amount of time an auction runs after the last bet, essentially predicting the MKR price in one hour. This signal is asking if this parameter should be reduced within the protocol. Shorten the PPG process @alexis is proposing to shorten the timeframe of rates changes by cutting the poll and passing directly to an executive vote.  Last Week The Friday executive vote last week was delayed after conversations with @Protocol-Engineering and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit. The reasons for doing as are as follows:  The only item slated for the spell was Adopting DC-IAM for the PSM-USDC-A.  Casting a spell requires quite a bit of labor and resources. The Executive spell from last week still had not passed.   Team Updates  GovAlpha  GovAlpha Weekly Update 2 Weekly Polls passed. Skipping this week\u2019s Friday Executive Vote. A couple of new team members being onboarded with some starter tasks. Delegation date solidifying, reach out to GovAlpha if you are considering becoming a delegate.   Protocol Engineering  SushiJoin: ensuring correct behavior in the event of ES. CropJoin: gas optimizations and improved manager contract implementation. D3M final round of cleanup. 1-year expiry added to the vote delegation process. Bug with auction demo keeper around gas, causing it to consume max block gas. We worked on a fix for that, PR being merged soon. Kurt put together a document defining magnitude and ranges for PSM-USDC quantities. Worked on risk scenario analysis for Oracle tail risk; it\u2019s not public yet. DSR entity-relationship and system modeling with BlockScience. Considering pivoting to focus on collateral onboarding short-term. Looking into concepts of permissionless versions of institutional Vaults. Working on technical analysis around stETH. Sam is reviewing gUNI as potential collateral. Working on L2 risk framework, a document describing different L2 & scaling solution architectures outlining their risks. Optimism bridge almost fully complete. We are testing it along with things like cross-chain votes. Arbitrum is finalizing their standard bridge; we are working on creating a Dai version of the bridge. Two new team members! Julien Martin and Talbaneth.   Oracles  Began production rollout for the gopher tool. It\u2019s a pricing tool that we use to get the prices of assets, and it serves as redundancy for an existing tool that we\u2019ve called sensor. Rolling out a tool called spire within the coming weeks, which adds an extra layer of redundancy similar to scuttlebutt. Finding footing on legal structures. Figuring out staffing, projects, and internal structure. Reviewing oracle code for stETH deployment.   Risk  Working on two collateral evaluations: MATIC-POLYGON and stETH, running simulations with reports published soon and available on the dashboard. Risk Dashboard development being worked on addressing labeling for vault owners so that we will have a structure of vault users (if vaults are related, what apps they used to open the vault if they are protected with Defisaver) and so on. We added better charts for CEX trading volume for each collateral asset; in addition to aggregated volume, now there are two more charts; aggregation by exchange and trading pairs.   Real-World Finance  Published a post mortem about the notification issue. Begining audits of Centrifuge structure next week. Next Centrifuge batch contains four assets. Christian worked on solutions on the legal side involving Caymen Islands. Three law firms are now working with us in Caymen Islands and internationally. Began creating on-chain data providing more information with Dune Analytics.   Growth  Growth CU weekly update: June 18 - June 24 Had a conversation with Circle involving the Risk CU to access Circle\u2019s yield account. Spoke with Syndicate Protocol to provide legal compliance through the DAO. New MakerGrowth twitter account.   Content Production  Content Production Bi-Weekly Update: June 10 - June 24, 2021 New hires, including a video producer and writer. Working through our backlog, expect a lot more content from us within the coming weeks. Having conversations with CUs regarding the portal, issues involve Gatsby and Github. Outlining storyboards for educational video requests. Reach out if you have any MakerDAO branding to share. Looking for another writer, so we are still onboarding new team members. Capybara won as the mascot for MakerDAO.   Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling  Approaching the initial budget forecast, we may be posting a budget modification soon, increasing our incubation and grants spend. Project\u2019s sandbox discussion with Nikolaj tomorrow in the weekly SES update. Speaking with different CUs to do a side-event in ETHCC.io that Growth CU is leading. Working with the Dai Foundation on a MIP Set. LexMaker series #2 coming soon Call about Liquidations 2.0 coming soon Incubation Side dTalent is helping reach for talent. Get in touch! Development & UX(dUX) core unit will be doing a short demo today. NewSilver Call last Friday. Video on YouTube. Monachil Collateral Call tomorrow. Next Wednesday will have a Launch Pod Session with AmaZix Marketing Core Unit.   Current Events  New Governance Facilitator in Town The GovAlpha Core Unit welcomes its second active Governance Facilitator, Payton Rose! This comes as no surprise, GovAlpha aims to create sufficient redundancy, representation, and balanced decision-making by aiming to have three active governance facilitators, as stated in their mandate.  Rates Working Group Evolves The current Rates Working Group wants to form themselves as a Parameter Proposal Group as outlined in MIP46. They would expand coverage to:   Line, gap, ttl for DC-IAM-based vault-types.  Debt ceiling for other vault-types.  Stability Fee for all vault-types. Debt Ceilings (line), Fee In (tin), and Fee Out (tout) of PSMs and their corresponding DC-IAM parameters if applicable. Dai Savings Rate   RWA: New Silver Incident Report Sebastien Derivaux, Facilitator of the Real World Finance Core Unit, published a \u201cPost-Mortem\u201d on the New Silver Executive Summary Change detailing exactly what happened, what was learned as a result, and the solutions moving forward.

Next steps: Risk/Growth/PR discussions.  Testnet  No objection to Goerli. Thanks to Schuppi we have 20k goETH.  This Week: EthCC  Sam, Derek, Bartek, and Kris will be there! A variety of meetings are planned with StarkWare, Nexo, and others.   Oracles  Migration of oracle feeds to the new LibP2P architecture is ongoing. The rollout is slow because this is a big change. Everything looks good so far. Will be fully transitioned within 2 weeks. Scrutinizing the Dai Fast Withdrawal Bridge. Reviewing and evaluating the trust assumptions and incentives associated with the bridge and how they relate to our Oracle assumptions. L2 oracles are a huge business opportunity. We are asking teams if they would be interested in using Maker Oracles there. Published Collateral onboarding Oracle assessment for MATIC. Will push back on the executive vote until the week of August 6th. Still waiting for the current Executive to pass so that the Oracles Core Unit can receive its initial funding.   Risk  Published the D3M Risk Assessment. Please, read the report, test the module, and provide feedback. Began focusing more on other stuff in our backlog, such as simulations for lowering LRs. Ongoing work towards proposal around institutional Vaults.   Real-World Finance Real World Finance Core Unit Report for June  Updated budget from @aes is not public on the Forum yet.

Current Events  Lower Stability Fees Acting on the proposal by @SebVentures to lower stability fees and encourage \u201cDeFi Summer 2021,\u201d Maker governance has implemented several rate changes significantly lowering stability fees. The changes make MakerDAO\u2019s rate more competitive with platforms like Aave and Compound. Rate changes for each collateral type can be seen in the \u201cVoting\u201d section above or on the vote itself.  MakerDAO goes to Paris The MakerDAO community converges in Paris this week for Ethereum Community Conference 4 (ECC). The conference lasts from July 20-22, but community members will be hosting and attending events throughout the week. Join the MakerDAO community for Keeping up with the Maker Mafia a free event at Ground Control, Wednesday, July 21.  Delegation Soft Launch Coming August 2nd GovAlpha has announced that vote delegation will be soft-launching on August 2nd. Delegation reduces the cost of governance and improves efficiency by allowing individuals to delegate their MKR tokens to delegates. MakerDAO\u2019s delegation system includes Recognized and Shadow Delegates. Recognized Delegates agree to share limited amounts of information about themselves, while Shadow Delegates can participate anonymously.  Executive Vote Correction and Replacement An error was discovered in the July 16th Executive Proposal and reported to the community on July 17th by community member @spin, who made a post in the #governance-and-risk chat citing the concerns. Namely, that there was an element missing in the code necessary for MIP21 to allow the Asset Originator (in this case, New Silver) to utilize the increased Debt Ceiling. Within the next 10 hours, this omission in the executive was confirmed, and we deployed a new executive. For more details, read Payton Rose\u2019s write-up.  Mixed Results in Core Unit Ratification Polls So Far This month four Core Units have formally submitted their proposals and are currently up for a vote. Each has received unique results so far.   COM-001 has a 99% positive vote but currently falls ~600 MKR short of the 10,000 positive participation requirement.  CPM-001 has a very split vote with ~7,500 for and ~10,000 against.  CES-001 also has a split vote, with ~1,200 for and ~16,500 against.  AMZX-001 received ~17,700 no votes with only ~43 MKR on yes.   \u201cTaming Wildcat Stablecoins.\u201d The Federal Reserve, in tandem with the National Bureau of Economic Research, released a paper detailing their current view on stablecoins. In a recent thread, regulatory action was cited as one of the Maker\u2019s primary risk factors. Similar conversations have popped up on r/MakerDao. Since the paper\u2019s release, the discussion has become more focused, and can be followed here or via RocketChat.

It will ultimately be up to governance to decide how the tokens are used, with plenty of discussions already taking place.  Another Contract Transferred to the DAO May 3, 2021, the Foundation has transferred technical ownership of the redeemer contract to Maker Governance. The redeemer contract holds a remaining 19,587 MKR that permits addresses to swap their old MKR for new MKR. This redemption process is possible via the makerdao.com/redeem page. Please note that this does not change the current mechanics for users who wish to redeem - that process remains the same, and interested parties may visit https://makerdao.com/redeem/.

Risk The team is currently working on collateral evaluations for the October cycle: BAL, YFI, PAXG, and LEND. @Primoz published a Help Wanted Thread looking for a person who is interested in building Risk Monitoring Tools and working with the Risk Domain Team.    Wanted: Risk Domain Monitoring Tools   In order to have a clear understanding of the current state of the Maker ecosystem, we need to develop monitoring tools, specifically for Vault users, DAI liquidity and competitive landscape. This should give us a better understanding of DAI primary issuance and how DAI flow between AMMs and secondary lenders is affecting the peg.

In summary, the proposed changes are:  Suspend the usage of MIPs 8, 10, 11, and 12 effective immediately. Explicitly allow collateral onboarding to be a flexible process that can adjust to the demands of reality. Publish and maintain a public document with all collateral types listed and prioritized according to their varying risks and benefits. Provide Foundation-funded grants for collateral onboarding to allow the community to take more of a role in this process.

State of the Peg  Peg1235\u00d7570 151 KB   DAI peg still just above $1.01. It\u2019s worth mentioning that there has been a long term floor on Dai price at about $1.01. As the price goes closer and closer to peg, it tends to bounce back when a new opportunity pops up. Each jump coincides with unique yields; Vishesh referred to this trend as the \u201cDai roller-coaster\u201d in the Governance and risk call on September 17.

Can MakerDAO offer a better version of the StableCredit Protocol? @gdip kicks off a discussion about StableCredit and whether or not aspects of the protocol might be useful to MakerDAO.    Can MakerDAO offer a better version of the StableCredit Protocol?   While credit systems like MakerDAO serve traditional borrowers that are seeking liquidity on their assets very well, the community has perhaps overlooked whether it is properly serving those who borrow with the intent of providing liquidity themselves . I believe Andre\u2019s system has both strengths and weaknesses, and that the Maker Protocol can be the solution to those weaknesses.   Using DAI in \u201cblacklisted countries by USA government,\u201d and USDC legal compliance @smaugho raises important issues over the accessibility of Dai in countries blacklisted by the U.S. government due to the inclusion of USDC in the collateral portfolio of MakerDAO, asking:    Using DAI in \"blacklisted countries by USA government\", and USDC legal compliance   Which is the stand of MakerDAO community in front of USA Embargo against countries (including their citizen) like Cuba, and us Cubans which suffer the \u201cbad luck\u201d of have been born in a communist country? Which is the position of the community to support the usage of DAI in Cuba even at the expense of increasing the possibility to have USDC Vaults blocked and who knows which other actions could be taken by the USA government?

Wanted: Risk Domain Monitoring Tools   Para tener una clara comprensi\u00f3n del estado actual del ecosistema Maker, necesitamos desarrollar herramientas de monitoreo, espec\u00edficamente para los usuarios de los Vaults, la liquidez del Dai y el panorama competitivo. Esto deber\u00eda darnos una mejor comprensi\u00f3n de la emisi\u00f3n primaria de Dai y c\u00f3mo el Dai fluct\u00faa entre los AMMs y los prestamistas secundarios afectando la paridad.    Eventos de Actualidad  Compensaci\u00f3n de Vaults La Encuesta de Aprobaci\u00f3n del Plan de Compensaci\u00f3n de Vaults termina el martes 22 de septiembre a las 16:00 UTC. La opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s votada con un 51.7% de los votos, es de 18% de compensaci\u00f3n. En segundo lugar se encuentra la opci\u00f3n de 0% de compensaci\u00f3n con un 47.22% de los votos. \u00a1Aseg\u00farate de votar y de ser escuchado!

Esta es la subvenci\u00f3n m\u00e1s grande emitida por la Fundaci\u00f3n hasta la fecha. Una Discusi\u00f3n sobre las mejoras del Marco de Incorporaci\u00f3n de Colaterales ha comenzado, en resumen los cambios propuestos son:  Suspender el uso de las MIPs 8, 10, 11 y 12 con efecto inmediato. Permitir expl\u00edcitamente que la incorporaci\u00f3n de colaterales sea un proceso flexible que pueda ajustarse a las demandas de la realidad. Publicar y mantener un documento p\u00fablico con todos los tipos de colaterales listados y darles prioridad de acuerdo a sus riesgos variables y beneficios. Proporcionar subvenciones financiadas por la Fundaci\u00f3n para la incorporaci\u00f3n de colaterales para permitir que la comunidad tome un rol m\u00e1s importante en este proceso.

Vale la pena mencionar que ha habido un piso a largo plazo en el precio de Dai alrededor de 1,01 d\u00f3lares. A medida que el precio se acerca m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s a la paridad, tiende a rebotar cuando aparece una nueva oportunidad. Cada salto coincide con rendimientos \u00fanicos; @Vishesh se refiri\u00f3 a esta tendencia como la \u201cmonta\u00f1a rusa del Dai\u201d en la llamada de Riesgo y Gobernanza del 17 de septiembre.

Tech Intersect #34  El consejero general de MakerDAO Brian Avello y Tonya M. Evans discuten sobre el rol de la ley en relaci\u00f3n a blockchain, criptomonedas y DeFi.  Maker Forum Deep Dai-ve  MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes  @LongForWisdom expone una visi\u00f3n de conjunto de los procesos de Gobernanza actuales, incluyendo informaci\u00f3n sobre solicitudes de opini\u00f3n, declaraciones de intenci\u00f3n, y Propuestas de Mejoras de Maker (Maker Improvement Proposals, MIP).  \u00bfMakerDAO es capaz de ofrecer una mejor versi\u00f3n del protocolo StableCredit?  @g_dip da comienzo a una discusi\u00f3n acerca de StableCredit y sobre si algunos aspectos del protocolo pueden serle \u00fatiles a MakerDAO o no.    Can MakerDAO offer a better version of the StableCredit Protocol?   Aunque los sistemas crediticios como MakerDAO son de gran servicio a los prestatarios tradicionales que buscan liquidez en sus activos, es posible que la comunidad haya pasado por alto la cuesti\u00f3n de si est\u00e1 sirviendo apropiadamente a aquellos que toman pr\u00e9stamos con la intenci\u00f3n de proveer ellos mismos liquidez. Creo que el sistema de Andre tiene puntos fuertes y otros d\u00e9biles \u2014 y que el Protocolo Maker puede solucionar debilidades.    El uso de DAI en \u201cpa\u00edses puestos en la lista negra de Estados Unidos\u201d y conformidad legal al USDC  @smaugho resalta puntos importantes sobre la accesibilidad de Dai en los pa\u00edses que est\u00e1n en la lista negra del gobierno de EE.UU. debido a la inclusi\u00f3n del USDC en el portafolio colateral de MakerDAO y pregunta:    Using DAI in \"blacklisted countries by USA government\", and USDC legal compliance    Cu\u00e1l es la postura de la comunidad de MakerDAO frente al embargo de EE.UU. hacia algunos pa\u00edses (incluyendo sus ciudadanos) como Cuba, y nosotros cubanos que sufrimos la \u201cmala suerte\u201d de haber nacido en un pa\u00eds comunista? Cu\u00e1l es la postura de la comunidad para soportar el uso de DAI en Cuba a\u00fan con el riesgo de aumentar la posibilidad de tener Vaults USDC bloqueados y qui\u00e9n sabe qu\u00e9 otras acciones que podr\u00edan ser tomadas por el gobierno de EE.UU.?

For an in depth discussion on yETH vaults check out last weeks Governance and Risk call. Expect more amazing output from @Primoz, like his post on rate setting below.   Smart Contracts  We\u2019ll miss the chief triforce officer, the yam whisperer, @Mariano_Conti !! Liquidations 1.2 spell passed. The spell for PaxUSD and tether are slotted for September 4th, there are modifiers to not cast on a spell on Labor Day so between Tuesday and Friday. Dark spell is up for comment until September 9th.   Current Events  MIP6 Collateral Onboarding - yEarn @paraficapital submitted an application to onboard YFI as collateral, raising discussion of whether or not the community should establish rules for including newer tokens. SebVentures comments:    [YFI] - MIP6 Collateral Onboarding - yEarn   I think that listing every shiny startup doesn\u2019t make much sense. What\u2019s the point of using a startup that test in prod and can die in a second? The experience from KNC and ZRX isn\u2019t support for it anyway. LRC didn\u2019t even pass the inclusion poll. There is already a backlog of bigger DAO projects. Maybe we should set a standard like $500M market cap of free float and $10M annual earnings for DAO adoption? The project is really young and already 4 of 9 members of the multisig are leaving (they stayed active what? 30 days?). Isn\u2019t that a red flag? Not that I\u2019m against putting it on the backlog. But it would be sad for it to front run some collaterals that have more strategic value for Maker Protocol.   @befitsandpiper responds:    [YFI] - MIP6 Collateral Onboarding - yEarn   WBTC did not meet all these requirements, and it has been one of our best collateral types. I don\u2019t think the market cap minimum should be higher than 50 mil, and I think the daily volume average should be heavily discussed. Do we even want collateral with such high turnover as 20% of market cap?    More Information MIP6 Collateral Onboarding - YFI  Vault Compensation @monet-supply provided an update:    Vault Compensation Plan v2   Folks we\u2019re still moving along, making some last preparations before we can put up the final poll - I expect we should be ready to go for next week or the following week, and will update everyone here once it\u2019s on the schedule.   LongForWisdom echos @monet-supply\u2019s update:    Vault Compensation Plan v2   The poll is currently being discussed by the working group to make sure that the calculations make sense and are as easy as possible to understand and explain prior to the poll going live.   @lateot comments:    Vault Compensation Plan v2   I think the plan will be rejected by MKR holders for this reason. People will still sue and there is no way to stop them. Most of the people making demands are also completely blind and dismissive about their own responsibility for having a basic understanding of the risks involved before taking out a loan and then expect other people to bail them out.    More Information Please see Vault Compensation Plan v2  Peg Stabilization @Primoz weighs in on issues in setting the base rate in Different Approach to Rate Setting.    Different Approach to Rate Setting   Discussion around this proposal, specifically:  Is the general strategy of introducing more business policy logic into governance sound enough and doesn\u2019t affect our approach to risk and peg? Is governance willing to change the way how rates are set? How does governance view low LR on USDC and associated risks with potentially increased exposure? Do we want to use low LR on USDC only when peg escalates or do we put a ceiling on DAI price immediately by implementing it? What is the peg deviation tolerance on DAI to assess proper LR for USDC should we decrease it immediately to defend against price appreciation?    Quantitative easing to fix the peg sebventures    [Signal Request] Quantitative easing to fix the peg (aka Manual PSM)   Creation a USDC-M vault with no stability fees and a liquidation ratio of 100%.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Dai Supply in PAX PSM Triples to 150 Million Over Last Week The number of Dai generated from the PAX PSM (Peg Stability Module) has tripled over the last week from 50 to 150 million Dai. The PAX PSM has a debt ceiling of 500 million Dai, which means plenty of Dai is still to be generated. First proposed in MIP29, a Peg Stability Module enables users to trade Dai 1:1 with other dollar-denominated stablecoins for a small fee.  MakerDAO Covered in The Economist @jacek notes in this thread that MakerDAO was featured in a cover article in a recent edition of The Economist. Down the rabbit hole: The promise and perils of decentralized finance details the rise of DeFi, characterizing Dai as \u201cthe biggest \u2018on-chain\u2019 stablecoin\u201d and explores how DeFi aims to improve global financial networks.  Meet the Regulators Recognized Delegate @PaperImperium has scheduled a meeting with US Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday, September 20th. Senator Warren is a democrat representing Massachusetts as a Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs member. She is well-known for championing progressive causes. Warren is among the regulators who have recently expressed concern regarding the usage of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins by retail investors, and has been pushing for regulations. @PaperImperium explains, \u201cThis is expected to be a fairly mid-level meeting with the senator\u2019s advisors on banking issues.\u201d and the main goal \u201cis to further open the channels of communication.\u201d We eagerly await an update and will report on how the meeting has gone!  Should MakerDAO Mint MKR for Vesting? In the MIP proposing DSSVest, a module to automate token vesting distributions, @Wouter notes that the first usage of DSSVest will result in new MKR minted to cover Core Unit MKR vesting plans and thereby asks whether this was the intention of the MIP or should it be revisited.  Transitioning from Rocket.chat to Discord In response to the Maker Foundation\u2019s announcement to shut down Rocket.chat, the community has decided to move its official chat channel to Discord. @GovAlpha, @Content-Production, and Tech-Ops are collaborating on a plan for the channel implementation. @LongForWisdom posted a thread seeking feedback on proposed roles and channels and @seth has a thread seeking discussion on strategies for mitigating spam and other potential issues. The current goal is for the new Discord to go live on Monday, October 18th, two weeks prior to the October 31 deadline for shutting down Rocket.chat.

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Votes  Executive Votes There was a lot of executive activity last week to move the Dai peg back toward equilibrium. Most recently, the Base Rate was reduced and DyDx was whitelisted on the ETHUSD Oracle On Thursday, the Dai price was relieved when the debt ceilings were adjusted:  ETH-A increased from 260 to 340 million USDC-A increased from 80 to 140 million USDC-B increased from 10 to 30 million W-BTC increased from 20 to 40 million BAT-A increased from 3 to 5 million  On Tuesday, the Monthly Governance bundle was ratified which included an increase the ETH-A Debt Ceiling from 220 to 260 million and the following proposals: Proposals  MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle MIP18: Meta-Parameter Adjustments MIP19: Liquidations System 1.1 Upgrade  Sub-Proposals  MIP18c4-SP1: Subproposal for Modifying Meta-Parameter Adjustments MIP12c2-SP3: Domain Work Requirements for the Onboarding of MANA   Governance Polls   New Base Rate Adjustment    Last Weeks\u2019 Meta Parameter Polls     Poll Name Vote Discussion Results Unique Voters     Base Rate Adjustment Vote  -4% 23   Adjust the TUSD Debt Ceiling Vote Signal Request Fail 18   Adjust the WBTC Debt Ceiling Vote Signal Request Pass 19   Add dYdX on ETH/USD Oracle Vote MIP10c9-SP5 Proposal Pass 15     Closed Community Greenlight Polls Community Greenlight Polls for new collateral closed on 2020/08/03 at 0400 UTC.

Increasing the \u2018dust\u2019 amount Add ETH-B Vault   MIPs Updates The Maker Improvement Proposal (MIPs) Framework provides a clear process for Maker governance to change the Protocol as needed. This is Week 1 of the August governance cycle. Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:  MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module-(Vox) MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling and Actual Risk Premium Adjustments MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism  MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer  Could be championed by a new author from the community    MIP-13: declaration-of-intent-forward-guidance  Updated by Akiva to include a Vault Holder Advocacy Group with the aim to provide more guidance and transparency, and the reassurance that the risk parameters will follow some established patters. Video here      Current Events  Debt Ceiling Raises Last week saw two Governance and Risk meetings (7/29/2020 & 7/30/2020) focusing on raising the debt ceiling and risks to the system. Demand for Dai from yield farming is putting pressure on the Dai peg, which went down to 1.01 but currently hovers around 1.03. The debt ceiling was recently raised and its capacity was utilized in ~48 hours. These raises create a significant amount of tail risk for MakerDAO with so much ETH and USDC collateral in the system. ETH creates liquidation issues in a market crash and USDC has some centralization concern. @hexonaut added a thread to articulate base rates and the poll winner was a move to -4% which passed on Friday\u2019s executive vote.  MIP17 - Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium Adjustments MIP17 Working Group Community Call Summary & Action Items from MIP Editor @charlesstlouis:  \u201cMIP17 was initially rejected from July\u2019s Governance Cycle due to both the solution\u2019s timing and the lack of consensus towards it being the clear path forward for Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium Adjustments.\u201d  The current plan is try and re-architect for two different MIPs: altering MIP17 for simple Debt Ceiling Adjustments and a future MIP for Risk Premium Adjustments. The team is hustling to get MIP17 revisions in before this week\u2019s Governance cycle begins. Respond to the thread or message @charlesstlouis if you want to help.

The Target Rate Feedback Mechanism: An Introduction   At a minimum, three new components would be required to fully implement an automated TRFM in the present DAI Credit System:  a DAIUSD price oracle a target price calculator a target rate controller    MIP20 describes a Target Price Adjustment Module called Vox. Vox is an implementation of a TRFM that adjusts the target price of DAI according to a governance defined rate, allowing the institution of negative effective interest rates. @equivrel notes that Kurt\u2019s introduction doesn\u2019t address the implication of changing the Target Price for monetary policy (from the current target of $1.00).    MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox)   Once we have credibly commited to pursuing the new Target Price as the monetary policy price target, only then will Target Rate Adjustment serve as an effective negative real interest rate.   @FourthStreet summarizes the state of discussions around the PSM in in What?, So What?, Now What? PSM Solution:  \u201cHow does MakerDao scale while also defending the Peg and restoring confidence in the system in a manner that is sustainable and limits exposure to collateral risk (mainly USDC is the current focus)?\u201d  FourthStreet goes on to describe four major cons with current plans for the PSM to open discussion on how the issues might be mitigated.

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Governance  Executive  An executive proposal has been added to increase the ETH-A debt ceiling from 140m to 160m. The previous executive proposal passed July 3. As a result, Maker:  Increased the WBTC Debt Ceiling and Risk Premium Lowered the Base Rate to 0%  Whitelisted Oracles  DeFi Saver on ETHUSD, BATUSD, and WBTCUSD MCDEX on ETH/USD   Appointed Light Feeds  Kyber Network Infura Etherscan Gitcoin       Polls Polls use instant run-off, so you can select multiple options and ranked-choices will be prioritized.   New Base Rate poll is up, including options between -4% and 4%. This will set the base stability fee for all collateral types. Last week 0% was the winner, so the rate is decreasing in this week\u2019s executive.  New DSR Spread poll is up. DSR Spread options are 0% to 4.25%  Polling was unanimous to raise the WBTC Debt Ceiling from 10m to 20m and the Risk Premium from 1% to 2%.   Collateral Inclusion Most of the collateral inclusion polls concluded on Monday July 6, 2020 at 4PM UTC.   KNC is a special case since it carried over from the last governance process. It runs until Monday July 13, 2020 at 4PM UTC.  Passing: LINK, PAXG, WKT   Not Passing: ENJ, LEND, MATIC    MIPs Updates The July Governance Cycle begins today. Two proposals are in the Request-For-Comments phase.   MIP16 defines and formalizes the Weekly Governance Cycle adding a predictable framework for Governance decisions.  MIP17 builds on MIP16 to define a process/solution for weekly Debt Ceiling and utilization based Risk Premium adjustments.  Learn more about Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) in the Maker Forum  Governance Cycle  The formal submission period for the July governance cycle ends July 8th. If you have any proposals in progress, post them in the forums to get review sooner rather than later.  Formal submissions clarifier     Want to refresh your voting knowledge?

Domain Teams  Smart Contracts  Token Smart Contract Assessments The two latest evaluations found that both LEND and MANA are low risk contracts. Read more here:  LEND MANA   Risk  COMP Summary and Risk Overview  Cyrus shared a mental model for \u201cnegative stability fees.\u201d A practical translation to Maker Governance norms and vocabulary. From the Governance and Risk meeting:  \u201cimagine if some third party service was offering a very high DSR, then you could see a potential huge influx of demand for Dai. And at the same time the same third party is providing a source of very negative stability fees, which makes borrowing very attractive there\u2026\u201d \u201ca large influx of demand to get this external DSR and refinancing (from Maker to Compound) requires sourcing Dai on the secondary market.\u201d This creates nuanced complexities and incentives, it also implies some risk to the Maker protocol coupling higher demand for Dai with recycling leverage.  Compound Governance Proposal 11 passed, updating COMP per block allocation in each market. The formula is now: totalBorrows * USD Value and thus, follows natural borrowing demand. Discussions, updates, Pull Requests, and comments can be found here. Concentration in one market subsided, Maker Governance discussed more options to handle threats to the protocol, there were no emergency executive votes.     COMP links on the forum  Summary of issues and poll by Planet_X Signal Request- USDC-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments Upcoming COMP farming change could impact the Dai peg Anticipatory poll about Debt ceiling and risk premium   Highlights from Makerchat Join the conversation in #governance-and-risk @Maker_Man \u201cI think a distinction between dealing with COMP problem vs. dealing with general PEG stabilization mechanics is also a good distinction in discussion.\u201d @brianmcmichael \u201cSeems to be a lot of demand for ETH vaults, but discussions are focused around stablecoins right now. A more aggressive debt ceiling raise for ETH-A should be on the table, IMO.\u201d @rune \u2018what\u2019s important is that the PSM gives maker governance the option to truly fix the peg with stablecoins, should MKR holders decide they are willing to take on the risk. This means governance isn\u2019t forced to pick between abandoning the peg (Which could cause the system to death spiral) or work towards implementing negative rates, but that a third option will be on the table.\u2019 @Maker_Man \u201cHigh PEG is good for DAI savers as when they need to buy something they get it at discounted prices. Good for borrowers when they do borrow because they get more $$ value for their DAI loan. Bad for anyone looking to pay down debt (borrowers) as it is an extra fee. I can see why certain applications really want a constant PEG or one really tight to whatever they are PEG\u2019d to. But even PM\u2019s the supposed \u2018safe haven\u2019 asset has price fluctuations. same with bonds though they can be held to maturity\u2026 I think the real issue is that every stable coin has a redeemer that will give $1USD for the coin BUT Maker.\u201d  Working groups  Vault Compensation Analysis Team The self-organized group led by Monet_Supply and MakerMan released a Vault Compensation Plan Proposal for Governance discussion. In addition, they added an informal forum poll to move forward with their plan.

The solution? A special permissionless circuit breaker. It allows anyone to disable liquidations instantaneously any time the next price for collateral is lower by a configurable percentage than the current price. Liquidation 2.0 will be released as is, with an additional permissionless circuit breaker and a commitment to making this future upgrade, which \u201ccan be safely deployed within a couple of weeks without affecting the core auction code.\u201d More robust mitigation options may exist and should be implemented according to the Smart Contracts team, but it will take a few months from research to rollout.   ETH-C Vault is live!  The latest vault type to service ETH collateral is live! Following in the footsteps of ETH-B, this new ETH-C vault type experiments with a different liquidation ratio of 175% and has the initial stability fee set at 3.5%. The community has big plans for this configuration, setting an initial maximum debt ceiling of 2B DAI. Plenty of users have already opened ETH-C vaults, and you can track the progress of the vault type over at MakerBurn.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  MakerBurn Launches NFTs Celebrating MakerDAO Milestones MakerBurn, one of the community\u2019s go-to sites for MakerDAO analytics, launched a collection of NFTs commemorating important events in the history of MakerDAO. Events include the launch of MakerDAO, the 100 million SAI milestone, and the release of Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD). The collection is available on OpenSea. Users can make offers to purchase the NFTs, though MakerBurn hasn\u2019t specified whether or not they\u2019re for sale yet. If you\u2019re going to make an offer, make sure it\u2019s one they can\u2019t refuse!  G-UNI hits Debt Ceiling; raise proposed G-UNI, an ERC20 wrapper around the NFTs representing the Uniswap v3 G-UNI DAI / USDC pool, quickly hit its debt ceiling of 10 million Dai. Launched on September 21, 2021, the G-UNI Vault helps MakerDAO reduce its reliance on USDC. As @hexonaut explains, \u201cLooking at recent Uniswap numbers, APRs on this pool is around 4% based on the 140M TVL. If we offer 100x leverage (101% CR), this APR raises 400%, attracting more capital. This should be enough to attract a couple of billion TVL into the pool (depending on the SF), which will indirectly unwind the PSM as minted DAI is sold for USDC.\u201d Dai generated by USDC is currently at 47.7% and Protocol Engineering Core Unit Facilitator @Derek proposes raising the Debt Ceiling from 10 million to 50 million Dai.  The Case for Clean Money The Case for Clean Money was posted by @rune on Monday, October 4th. This proposal considers switching priorities of the DAO towards addressing and aiding to help fight against climate change. This proposal includes the addition of the Sagittarius Engine. The goal of the Sagittarius Engine is to direct value flows of the Maker Protocol towards long-term governance participants, a core of MKR holders that participate based on a genuine interest in the project. Governance Facilitator, @LongForWisdom, has followed this with a Signal Request asking if this is something the community agrees with.  State of DAI  Peg861\u00d7611 95.1 KB   DAI peg with some limited slippage over the past week.

GovAlpha is laying out the next steps concerning governance on this issue. @LongForWisdom is asking the community whether they would like to see MakerDAO move in the general direction indicated by the post \u2018The Case for Clean Money\u2019? Restarted poll Raise the ESM threshold to 15% and increase the Governance Delay to 4 days -  Maker is reaching a point where the core Maker security is so battle-tested that the emergency shutdown feature (ES) is beginning to become a risk rather than a solution; with only 75,000 MKR currently needed to trigger ES, it is the most likely place for someone to try to damage the system. @rune proposes to double the trigger amount to 150,000 MKR, which will reduce the risk of a sudden ES and make the system more reliable. Set PSM fees to 0% - @SebVentures has been diligently pushing the idea to set PSM fees to 0%; which is also suggested in The Case for Clean Money. If their signal were to pass, Sebastien provides many long-term pros and cons and discusses how setting PSM fees to 0% would anchor the perception that 1 DAI = $1. Turn off the burner, fuel up Sagittarius Engine - In reaction to @rune\u2019s post, @Planet_X signals to turn off the Buy and Burn, keep the surplus buffer at 60 million DAI, and direct excess funds of the Surplus Buffer to the Sagittarius Engine.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  The European Union\u2019s Latest MiCA Report Europe\u2019s latest draft crypto regulation MiCA limits use of stablecoins like DAI Per the article: \u201cYesterday the European Council published a significantly expanded proposed \u2018Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets\u2019 (MiCA) document. This means the legislation progresses to the next step, a three-way negotiation between the Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament. Our interpretation of the expanded document is that a stablecoin like the DAI could be heavily restricted.\u201d In the MiCA report, crypto-assets were divided into three buckets: asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens, and other crypto assets. The important distinction here is \u201casset-referenced tokens,\u201d which refers to cryptocurrencies backed by an index of assets. The article speculates that \u201casset-referenced\u201d tokens and stablecoins will face stout regulation under the EU\u2019s current proposal. The usage of Dai could be restricted within the European Union because of this distinction. If this scenario were to play out as the article suggests, asset-referenced tokens would be limited to an activity level of fewer than 1 million transactions per day, with the total value of those transactions capped to $224mil USD \u201cwithin a single currency area.\u201d The article purports that this total would include on-chain transactions and off-chain trading through Centralized Exchanges.  9B Dai in circulation Another exciting milestone for MakerDAO! In addition to exceeding 9B Dai:  Over 10,000 MKR have been burned Dai collateralized by USDC is under 30% Estimated annual profits are over 132MM Dai   GUSD-PSM now live With the successful passage and execution of the November 26th Executive, individuals can now trade Dai for Gemini USD (GUSD) using the Peg Stability Module (PSM). The GUSD-PSM is launching with a debt ceiling of 10 million Dai and a 0% fee, meaning users only need to worry about the transaction fee when exchanging Dai and GUSD.  Proposal   State of DAI  Peg856\u00d7611 96.5 KB   DAI peg experienced some slippage on the 23rd and some wider price bands for very large trades. The mid-line stood strong through the madness, and the overall range continued to tighten.    Max and min at 1.03 to 0.94 with 481 million DAI traded.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Community debates RWA Foundations proposal Following the Pre-MIP discussion on RWA Foundations @SebVentures has posted MIP58: RWA Foundations to propose how MakerDAO can establish legal entities to manage real-world assets. The Real-World Finance team seeks feedback, notably around how much power the DAO retains when structuring these deals. Several community members have weighed in so far (here and here) and @christiancdpetersen provides more information in Real World Asset Legal Structures - A comparison.

Lower Flash Mint Fee to 0% - Signal Request Following up on the Initial Flash Mint Module Fee Signal Request @hexonaut resurfaces the subject, asking the community whether we should implement 0% Flash Mint Fees. Since the Flash Mint Module is around a month old and still not getting much use, @hexonaut suggests following dYdX and permanently removing Flash Mint Fees helping improve both arbitrage for DAI and front-end UX. Although there is a risk for potential loss of revenue, dYdX has shown its liquidity pool increase from 138k to ~10M, which is large enough to cover most use cases.  Risk Team proposes lowering Liquidation Ratios on Existing Vaults to encourage Dai supply growth MakerDAO has never adjusted the Liquidation Ratios of existing Vaults. This week, Risk presents the first adjustment proposal along with some analysis backing up the recommendation. This proposal comes on the heels of growing USDC dominance in the collateral portfolio as one approach to increase non-USDC Dai supply. For a quick refresher: the liquidation ratio of each Vault tells you at which point the system will turn around and sell your collateral to pay down your debt. It is effectively the minimum collateral requirement per Vault type. For example, 150% LR means that the Vault owner must uphold a minimum of $1.50 in collateral for each $1.00 of Dai generated, or else the system will sell the collateral and pay down the debt. Adjusting this parameter downward gives Vault users more bandwidth to generate Dai. Unlike adjusting downward, adjusting upward does the opposite and could cause instant liquidation of vault users unaware or unprepared for the change. This proposal only makes downward adjustments.  State of DAI  Peg901\u00d7624 129 KB   Some slight peg slippage on August 8, but the peg quickly recovered back to the baseline we have seen for months.   Uniswap V3 liquidity903\u00d7512 18.4 KB   It is worth mentioning that the ETH/DAI pair usually has the outsized trades affecting the peg. That pool has the most liquidity concentrated above the peg. This is not particularly a surprise, but it is worth pointing out.   Dai Supply1366\u00d7749 68.7 KB   6 billion is so so close; we have 12.1 billion in TVL Little victories as USDC dips below 60% of Dai generated. Slightly.

                    "content": " Maker Relay 30  Hey everyone, thanks for checking out Maker Relay! Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Votes Check our Governance Tools Resource for links to things like system status, Dai stability, collateral & liquidation metrics, protocol analytics, auctions, and governance history.  Executive Vote Add ETH-A to the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)  Currently has 57,388.55 MKR in support, needs another 10,020.17 MKR to pass. If passed, this will activate the DC-IAM on the ETH-A Vault type, with the following parameters;  Maximum Debt Ceiling (line): 1.5 billion DAI Target Available Debt (gap): 30 million DAI Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl): 12 hours     More Info  Original Signal Request: Adjust ETH-A Debt Ceiling (2021-03)  Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module Community Portal Information  The main benefits of the DC-IAM are the reduced governance overhead in the setting of debt ceilings and mitigating risk when there is a large decrease in collateral price. The downside is that the DC-IAM enables a griefing attack on the Debt Ceiling of collateral types using it. The outcome of this attack is to prevent DAI from being minted using a given collateral type. The severity and likelihood of this attack are minimal, and the mitigation strategy is to disable the DC-IAM for the attacked collateral type.     Weekly Governance Cycle Some polls use instant run-off voting, so you can select multiple options, and ranked-choices will be prioritized.

MIP13c3-SP7: Governance Communications Domain (Declaration of Intent) moved to Accepted status.  MIP7c3-SP5: Domain Team Onboarding (Risk Domain Team) onboarded S\u00e9bastien Derivaux as a Risk Domain Team Facilitator.  MIP7c3-SP6: Domain Team Onboarding (Smart Contracts Domain Team) onboarded Sam MacPherson as a Smart Contracts Domain Team Facilitator.  MIP28c7-SP2: Subproposal for Operational Support Domain Facilitator Onboarding onboarded @juan as an Operational Support Facilitator.   Signal Requests [Signal Request] Adjust the Surplus Buffer (2021-2) This is attempting to decide how high to set the Surplus Buffer and what to do with fees: diverting some into MKR-burning or filling the buffer more quickly. @ultraschuppi also breaks down some charts to show benefits, as well as potential drawbacks of various options. [Signal Request] Raise DSR Lays out the statistics (DAI and revenue) and what raising the DSR would affect (by percentage).  Updates  MIPs Weekly MIPS Update #26 Feb. 1, 2021 Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign  This MIP defines DssGov, a contract replacement for DSChief that comes with improved security, usability, and functionality for holders of the Maker governance token (MKR).    MIP31: Active Reserve AMM (dss-ara)  A technical proposal for an active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract.    MIP32: Peg Stability Module for Compound Mixed Exposure  Provides an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via dai using cdai. It also converts USDC to cUSDC using the same join adaptor (lending join).    MIP33: Maker Stability Price Module  This proposal allows Governance to defend an MKR price by pre-allocating dai to buy at a pre-defined level.    MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module  The Keg is a tool for streaming ERC20 DAI to a preset group of addresses from out of the Surplus Buffer.    MIP35: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure - With Farming  This proposal defines a new Peg Stability Module, which converts USDC to DAI and DAI to USDC, using Compound to generate leveraged yield.    MIP36: Peg Stability - Compound Governance Dai Leverage  This proposal defines a Peg stabilizer controlled by governance, which uses the flash minting technique for Dai lending to leverage MakerDAO\u2019s position on cDai.    MIP37: Static Reserve For Governance  Defines a static reserve that can receive any tokens from anyone as any contract and allows Maker Governance to withdraw them.    MIP38: DAO Primitives State  DAO Primitives State is a MIP that contains all the status related to Core Units, Budgets, and Facilitators.    MIP39: Core Unit Framework  Contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP40: Budget Framework  Contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP41: Facilitator Framework  Contains a framework with subproposal processes for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP42: Proposed Compensation Addendum for MakerDAO Contributors  Proposes to pay contributors partially in time-locked MKR to increase value returned to contributors and directly align their interests with those of MakerDAO.    MIP43: Term Lending Module (TLM)  Proposes an integration with Yield Protocol. Authors Allan and Alberto are employees of Yield, Inc., a company working to build Yield Protocol. Lev is an advisor to Yield, Inc.    Sub-Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP13c3-SP9: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol (Declaration of Intent)  An experiment is proposed for a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B or ETH-C, with lower CR than WBTC-A or ETH-B (respectively), which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop.    MIP4c2-SP10: MIP0 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP0 that makes it compatible with the newly proposed Domain Framework MIP set.  The main difference is that it removes the inbuilt functionality of MIP0 to onboard core personnel. Instead, it uses the DAO Primitives State to determine who have been onboarded as Governance Facilitators by Maker Governance and then introduces logic that allows Governance Facilitators to designate MIP Editors.    MIP4c2-SP11: MIP5 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP5 that makes it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to the Governance Facilitator Emergency Vote process, which directly deals with onboarding and offboarding Facilitators.    MIP4c2-SP12: MIP16 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP16 that makes it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to clarify the Governance Powers of Facilitators.

There are other opportunities like Sushiswap for liquidity, but the rewards there come from the underlying Sushi you don\u2019t get with just the LP tokens in Maker.  @Marcandu put in serious work on 17 starkware oracles for DyDx. We\u2019re testing those. The poll should go out Monday for whitelisting.  The Exec we\u2019ll delay a few weeks out to coordinate with the SC team. This is the first oracle work on L2       Risk  2 UNI LP evals done, both in review and will be published in the coming days (DAI<>USDC & USDT<>ETH). On the docket next are more LP pairs with high liquidity and volume: UNI<>ETH, LINK<>ETH, AAVE<>ETH We might need to increase rates (Stability Fees) soon to offset the risks. Especially since Liquidations 2.0 is still in the works and not live yet. Rates are currently the only tool to lower debt exposure.

More than 60,000 MKR tokens have now been delegated.  Recognized Delegate \u2013 me  \u2013 made an informal poll to explore issues around compensation for Recognised and/or Shadow delegates by inquiring about time commitments, whether compensation is appropriate, how much compensation is appropriate, and which delegates should receive compensation.  @Spidomo questions whether compensating delegates would result in scrutiny from regulators by creating a separate poll.  @MakerMan suggests improvements to MakerDAO\u2019s vote delegation system.   Introducing the PAX Peg Stability Module (PSM) Last week\u2019s executive vote has successfully passed and onboarded the PSM-PAX-A Vault on Friday, August 27, 2021.  This vault will allow users to swap DAI for PAX tokens and visa versa, which gives people a chance to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities and help Dai maintain its peg.   Assessing Real-World Asset (RWA) Structure   @christiancdpetersen posted a comparison of RWA Legal Structures.   @SebVentures posted an audit of New Silver, including a road-map for the improvement of on-chain securitization.   @PaperImperium has posted a proposal to reform MakerDAO\u2019s Real-World Asset program. This proposal ultimately suggests splitting the Real-World Finance Core Unit into two separate Core Units, geared towards business function and risk analysis.

The currently running oracles have spent $30.69M on gas so far, with the top 14 feeds paying $1.93-2.14M each. This cost is something to take into consideration for off-boarding the unprofitable collaterals. https://t.co/ozzukGEKRl   12:25 PM - 28 Aug 2021           150                19             Forum Insight   [Informal Poll] Brand Research Results + Seeking Opinions on New Messaging  After their initial poll asking what the community felt would improve the DAO\u2019s brand messaging, @JerryAG released a follow-up poll that aggregated responses, better gauging the DAO\u2019s best possible approach.    Mindmapping MakerDAO Discussions  @Derek of the PE Core Unit provides a visualization of the DAOs most discussed topics.    Check out the latest Forum at a Glance | Video Version  Articles   Utopia Launches DAI-Backed Anonymous USD Stablecoin  Utopia USD (UUSD) is a stablecoin native to the Utopia chain that\u2019s backed 1:1 with DAI. The token\u2019s principal feature is anonymity, as \"every transaction is private and no metadata is visible.    Vaults Can Store Your Cryptocurrency, but Are They Safe?  An article discussing the use and security of vaults in DeFi. The author uses the Coinbase vault (\u2026LOL) and MakerDAO as examples of vaults containing security mechanisms.      Team Updates  GovAlpha GovAlpha Weekly Update  LongForWisdom was on vacation, so everything is fine  Posted the Quarterly Review for Q2 2021. Synced up with DUX to go over how GovAlpha uses the Voter Portal and what tools and additions could help GovAlpha Sebix is working on the forum organization task, classifying the many tags and finding new Discourse Plug-ins to make finding information more accessible. Delegation is showing up strong this week, with 2 Executives passed and over 55k MKR delegated to our Recognized Delegates.   Protocol Engineering  GUNI Oracle:  Joined by the Gelato team, we added tests and are now ready for the next executive, which will target a DC of 1-3M.   Staked ETH:  PE work here is done - targeting mid/end of September to align with the Oracles sprint.   Related to StakedETH is the stETH/ETH Curve Pool:  Had a conversation with Nik/Sam discussing using CropJoin to integrate with such a pool. Keep an eye out for that one!   Aave D3M:  Aave team completed their review. We have one outstanding PR waiting to merge. We\u2019d like to get a formal audit. Therefore, we\u2019re talking to auditors about timing.   Collateral Assessment  SolarX. DssCharter. Published the Formal MIP submission supporting Institutional Vaults. Had many conversations about fixed-rate solutions, which we\u2019ll be taking some time to review as alternative options. Deco, Akiva, and Sense.   Layer2 work:  Arbitrum. We did a high-level review with the team. We had a call with Arbitrum and are doing a deeper dive.   Optimism:  No updates on the Optimism front as we\u2019re gearing up for the Arbitrum launch.   Other News:  PAX Token Name changed from PAXUSD to USDP. PAX-PSM-A will remain unless we create a new ILK.      Oracles  New Balancer pool for stETH and ETH provides another place to query staked ETH price, not just one. Adding the LP token for stETH and ETH in Curve would align well with Cropjoin. Since Cropjoin hasn\u2019t been utilized, this may be an opportunity to maximize rewards on stETH, curve, and LIDO rewards. Core unit internal discussions: products and expansion.  Primary focus is other L1s and L2\u2019s. We are evaluating things like Optimism, Arbitrum, and some L1s like Solana Avax, etc. Anything EVM compatible is relatively easier. Non-EVM compatible requires contractors or teams to port oracle contracts over\u2014plenty of collaboration opportunities.   Another discussion: Bridges.  Optimism fast Dai withdrawal requires an oracle. Potential to create a standard for router contracts on every chain that works like message handlers. It\u2019s many to many compatible. Since it looks to be a cross-chain world, bridges will be a great product. Additionally, the economics are better since you don\u2019t have to push prices continuously. Charging margin on transaction costs is locked in profit.     Risk   Vault protection analysis posted today:  Plan is to track these metrics in time, automated dashboards. Combine these metrics with vault\u2019s DAI borrowed utilization data we started collecting. Short to Midterm goal: assign risk scores to Maker\u2019s vault owners and track scores in real-time.   Polygon 100m treasury loan offer with terms included sent to Polygon team, awaiting feedback. Plan to create a framework for institutional and treasury types of permissioned loans. Proceeding with Nexo institutional vault risk evaluation, but first awaiting feedback from the community on loan terms. KNC-A offboarding parameters are coming soon. Post following on final timeline and steps regarding other collateral offboarding.   Real-World Finance  Matt Robinowitz gives everybody a huge thanks for everyone\u2019s support for 6S. 6S executive passed. Risk assessment of Solar X thanks to Christian. Gov Poll expected on Monday.  SolarX Collateral Onboarding Risk Assessment. Financial analysis of the institutional vaults by Mark.  Institutional Vaults Economic Terms. Expanding the team. Partnership with JST Capital.  @luca_pro will work on an audit on FortunaFi. Full-time position to be onboarded.   Growth Growth CU weekly update  Growth follows the partnership strategy created by Greg in the Foundation times. We will be helping BanklessDAO to create a proposal that will bring to Maker, a team that will help us create and propagate the Maker message. Loopring will launch EthPort, which will provide cheap L2-L1 composability. EthPort allows users to interact with Maker directly from Loopring L2. We joined forces with the DUX team and started having conversations with the leading custodial solutions to integrate the Voting Delegation system to increase participation in the Maker governance. Tokocrypto will list DAI next week against major cryptos, and then DAI/BIDR (Indonesian Fiat) will be listed later.

New Silver [NS-DROP] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation   @Primoz posted his MIP29 - Peg Stability Module (PSM) Risk Assessment    Oracles  There was an oracle outage the last week of Nov; no oracles were updated for 3.5 hours (between 22:46 UTC and 2:23 UTC).  The cause of this was related to a bug in the Scuttlebutt network, a dependency in the stack. No liquidations were affected as a result of the oracle outage, as far as the team is aware.

This trend could be from price appreciation.     1351\u00d7907 143 KB   1343\u00d7916 135 KB   1346\u00d7159 20.8 KB   VWAP1390\u00d7568 36.9 KB   Volume at around $260 million this last week. Average VWAP (Volume-Weighted-Average-Price) places Dai at $1.005    The largest ETH vaults collateralization bucket is 210%, and the risk seems well protected from there.    Significant Liquidation Walls (30 million dai) start at $419 ETH.    YFI may test in prod, but they yield in safety. 220% is the biggest collateralization bucket.   1092\u00d764 8.12 KB   The largest vault, more than half of YFI debt, is at 220%, which likely skews the distribution.    Price appreciation in Bitcoin helps to push WBTC vaults over 200% collateralization too.

This is signaling for support of a tip value of 300 DAI, as well as a potential increase in the Debt Ceiling for PSM-USDC-A. New vault-type for YFI with a higher LR Following discussion from Nadia and the growth core unit, this is signaling for support of a YFI vault type with a higher liquidation ratio and a lower stability fee. The idea behind this is to create a vault for Yearn specifically to use with currently undecided parameters. Reduce the USDC PSM tout to 0 We have ~800M USDC currently sitting in the PSM, which creates a lot of systemic risk. This signal is seeking quorum on whether the tout should be reduced to 0 to encourage actors to more quickly arbitrage this USDC for DAI. By reducing the spread between tin and tout, arbitrageurs can more easily profit when DAI<USDC which will reduce the amount of USDC on our books.  Last Week Parameter Changes and Oracle Updates Passed on May 23, 2021, 13:05 UTC. Available for execution on May 25, 2021, 13:05 UTC.

Oracles  Oracles did considerably better with the heavy market volatility last week than we did on Black Thursday. High volatility made for many Oracle alerts, as they were updating every few minutes due to price movements outside the updated band. Last Wednesday\u2019s gwei prices hit 3500, highlighting the difficulty in predicting Oracle costs for the DAO.

Liquidation Performance Call it a stress test? Last Wednesday, the protocol weathered wave after wave of liquidations caused by market turmoil. The results: outstanding. @Primoz gave a presentation on last week\u2019s Governance and Risk call detailing the performance of the new liquidations 2.0 system.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  MakerDAO\u2019s Peg Stability Module (PSM) fees lowered to 0% With the passage of the November 4th Executive, the fees for using PSM-USDC-A and PSM-USDP-A have been lowered to 0%. Users may now swap Dai for USDC and USDP (formerly PAX) 1:1 with just the Ethereum transaction fee instead of the additional fee assessed by MakerDAO, though @PaperImperium has published a Signal Request to set the fee back to 10 basis points (bps). PSM Smart Contract Smart Contract PSM-USDC-A Smart Contract PSM-USDP-A Front-end on IPFS  Aave Direct Deposit Module (D3M) live, community asks: Wen Compound? The Aave D3M went live with the execution of the October 28th Executive, hitting its 10M debt ceiling almost immediately. Proposed by @hexonaut in MIP50: Direct Deposit Module, the D3M mints Dai backed by Aave\u2019s aDai and deposits it in Aave to cap the variable interest rate borrowers accept when borrowing Dai on Aave. Following the initial success of the Aave D3M, @Primoz proposes increasing the debt ceiling to 50M and @PaperImperium has created an informal poll soliciting feedback from the community on whether or not to prioritize a D3M on Compound  MakerDAO surpasses 8 billion Dai in circulation Over 8.6 billion! In addition, the USDP-PSM, GUNI-DAI-USDC, Aave D3M, MATIC, stETH, MANA, and GUSD vaults are all near their debt ceilings, and the proportion of Dai collateralized by USDC is at 30%.  State of DAI  Peg866\u00d7610 93.7 KB   DAI peg was ultra-solid this past week. According to @aburban90, we\u2019re in up only times. Check out speculation for more tea leaf reading sessions; Like horoscopes, but for degens.    Volume at around $804 million this last week. Average VWAP (Volume-Weighted-Average-Price) places Dai at $1.000325. Max price was on Uniswap V2 1.04 and min .59 on bittrex. Here\u2019s to hoping those are just API issues?

Current Events  Vault Compensation Update Vault Compensation V2 This update (posted Aug 7 2020), breaks down the updates in the Compensation plan after the failure of the vote from July 13th-16th. New polls will be structured to differentiate between MKR voters opposed to a specific plan, or compensation in general. This also lays out financial plans for funding and discusses some operating expenses. The compensation that will be distributed to vaults will be in MKR instead of DAI. These main updates came with some goals & principles as well:  \u201cCompleteness\u2026Fairness\u2026Consensus\u2026Simplicity\u2026Economic Soundness\u2026\u201d   Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade This post contains technical details and a timeline for the poll/executive vote for this potential \u201csimple system update.\u201d    Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)   With the amount of Dai outstanding in the Maker Protocol, if there were a price crash, there would not be enough liquidity available to manage a large amount of auctions properly. In this case, the circuit breaker is not the right solution as it is subject to the system delay in addition to other complications. The Liquidations 1.2 Upgrade will allow Maker Governance to control the total amount of Dai that can be in auction at any one time.    Peg Stabilization Module (PSM) Discussion around the PSM continues. Please see last week\u2019s Maker Forum Deep Dai-ve for background. Thoughts On The Peg, And A Fundamental Problem With The Current Stability Fee Design raiden4 created this Reddit post, cited by @FourthStreet, in a Forum post, weighing in on how to fix the peg:    Subreddit Repost: Reducing Dai Redemption Value To Fix Peg   the more immediately useful DAI is, the less Maker (and MKR holders) will benefit since the stability fees will tend to go down      Subreddit Repost: Reducing Dai Redemption Value To Fix Peg   What\u2019s a solution? Assuming we don\u2019t want to hurt DAI usability (e.g by introducing negative rates or demurrage) and assuming the stability fees cannot be lowered any more (because they are at 0%, like right now - https://daistats.com), the only other piece in the equation is the value of redeemable collateral. If we make it slightly less than $1 (at global settlement), we can lower the price TO $1   How much demand is there for DAI? @OliverNChalk asks:  \"How much demand do they see realistically? Do they envision a scenario where supply manages to outpace this demand (only using 0% SF and not introducing negative rates?\"   Lowering the Base Rate Interim Forward Guidance for Base Rate    Interim Forward Guidance for Base Rate   With the base rate now at -4%, all collateral asset stability fees (except MANA) are at 0%. Despite this accommodative monetary policy, we have yet to see much improvement in the peg or additional utilization of available debt ceilings.   @monet-supply turned a chat into a forum post, laying out some of the pros and cons of further reducing the base rate. Relating to @hexonaut\u2019s post from last week. Find more discussion on this topic in We Should be Lowering the Base Rate.  Real World Assets in the Maker Protocol Initial Thoughts and Questions for Including Real World Assets in the Maker Protocol @g_dip lays out an initial dive into this subject, elaborating on this point:  \"Conceptually there are two ways two think of the structuring process that allows a token to represent a claim on an asset in the Maker Protocol:    Tokenize a claim on a particular underlying asset itself Create and tokenize a debt instrument which represents a claim on proceeds of the underlying asset in the event of a liquidation\"   g_dip goes on to ask questions about the benefits, potential risks and outcomes, and general opinions on the subject. In \u2018How MakerDAO can be a competitive lender in the Credit Tenant Lease marketplace,\u2019 @mrabino1 begins a discussion on how it may be sensible for MKR to be setting up a revolving credit facility for a Lender. The comments are full of more useful information; answering initial questions as well as providing this diagram of the proposed structure for this general idea.

Next up is work on liquidations 2.0 and a formal submission of the Dark Fix MIP.  Oracles Much of the oracles work went into the executive as lightfeeds. tBTC is about to relaunch their new version, so they had to  deploy new contracts. We need to do a polling vote to swap their oracle whitelisting from the previous address. Hot off the press: LinkUSD assessment  Risk cTokens research from Primoz is up. COMP and Chainlink evaluations coming soon. Chainlink\u2019s evaluation came from an independent risk grantee. Much of these analyses can be used for other similar assets in the future. PAXG will have to wait until next cycle, unfortunately.  Domain Team Proposals Two initiatives this week on autonomy for the DAO, these will hopefully add structure and longevity as the Foundation decentralizes:  LongForWisdom submitted MIP23 to provide a flexible and consistent structural framework for personnel working for MakerDAO within any domain. There is a working group exploring autonomous MakerDAO.   Current Events  Vault Compensation The Vault Compensation Plan Approval poll is now live. Please vote on whether or not to support any of the plans to auction MKR and DAI to compensate vaults affected by liquidations during the March 12 market crash.  More Information  Vault Compensation Plan v2 Error in Vault Compensation Poll   Peg Stabilization @Primoz summarizes the current strategy being pursued by the community:    Different Approach to Rate Setting   This strategy is basically stating to 1) Determine rates more on market/competitive landscape basis 2) Make less frequent changes to rates by keeping Base rate stable and Risk Premium used only to assess risk compensation 3) Defend the peg through lower USDC liquidation ratio.   @hexonaut responds:    Different Approach to Rate Setting   I think we should take care not to eliminate the usefulness of the Base Rate as a monetary lever when the supply starts outstripping demand again. I can appreciate that the Base Rate is nearly useless with these huge farming APRs, but I worry that when we re-enter positive interest rate territory we will need to rapidly adjust each of the Stability Fees again which I want to avoid. It may make sense to keep the spirit of the Base Rate, but adjust the formula so it doesn\u2019t have the same size effect on all collateral types.   The conversation on peg stabilization continues in Different Approach to Rate Setting. Wil Barnes, a smart contract developer with the Maker Foundation, wrote an article on Restoring the Dai peg with the triforce yETH/MKR/Dai yVault to explore how Yearn\u2019s innovative new yETH/strategy products have the potential to restore the Dai peg. As Wil explains,  \u201cthe yVault-ETH, StrategyMKRVaultDaiDelegate, and yVault-DAI contracts cooperate to deposit latent ETH, draw Dai against, and deploy that Dai into an interest earning yVault, with realized profits being recycled through this process to maintain a pre-determined leverage ratio.\u201d   Gas Fees @ccc begins a discussion proposing to Automate Base Rate Adjustment, a potential fix for the current issue of gas cost in governance. As @ccc  explains:    [Discussion] Automate Base Rate Adjustment   Voting is now expensive. The recent spike in gas prices pushed them to a level that is, frankly, absurd. Should this occur again, it could be detrimental to the usability of system; it seems to have harmed the price of ETH at any rate. Voting on the Base Rate every week incurs gas costs that are unnecessary and could be reduced.   @Jtathmann proposes a fix in Using Snapshot to Improve Signaling and Polls:    Using Snapshot to Improve Signaling and Polls   Snapshot allows for off-chain vote signaling. It is 100% gasless. Anyone can participate by creating proposals and voting for them. You are able to select start and stop times, as well as a block height which will be used to gather on-chain data for the front end    You can now test voting on Snapshot here!   State of the Peg A thread worth reading on peg options and fees:  twitter.com    Ser Jeff Garzik @jgarzik  @hasufl Status quo:  High demand for DAI keeps price above peg.  These moves reduce demand, cooling down the high-demand issue, and thereby assisting in maintaining the peg.   5:36 PM - 8 Sep 2020           1             Peg1175\u00d7551 194 KB  Building on the conversations around peg management, the DAI peg is under duress with recent ETH price movement, forked yield farms, and some market drama.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates. This week, we have an urgent vote to set the PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling, as well as MIPs that have been formally submitted for this month\u2019s governance cycle!  Votes Check our Participation Tools page for protocol analytics, Dai analytics, collateral & liquidation metrics, governance history, and auctions data.  Executive Vote Urgent Executive: Increase PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling  Check out Primoz\u2019s post about stablecoin volume through the 3pool in Curve. The PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling will increase to 1 billion DAI from its current value (around 247M at the time of writing). The USDC-A Debt Ceiling will decrease from 555 million DAI to zero DAI. This is a step toward fully replacing stablecoin vaults with PSM options for Maker.  Rates Updates, UNI-V2-DAI-USDT Onboarding  ETH-A Stability Fee parameter will increase from 4.5% to 5.5%. ETH-B Stability Fee parameter will increase from 7.5% to 9%. PSM-USDC-A Fee Out parameter will decrease from 0.1% to 0.04%. UNIV2DAIUSDT-A vault type will be added with the parameters listed below:  Stability Fee: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 3 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Debt Floor: 2,000 DAI     Weekly Governance Cycle Some polls use instant run-off voting, so you can select multiple options, and ranked-choices will be prioritized.     Poll Name Vote Discussion Type     MakerDAO Supports EIP1559 (ETH fork) Vote  Discussion, Proposal from ETH  ETH Response   Add ETH-C Vault Type Vote  Proposal, Risk Eval  Vault Onboarding   Collateral Auction Parameter Updates Vote Discussion Risk Parameters   Increase the ETH-A Target Available Debt (gap parameter) Vote Discussion Risk Parameters     Last Week Onboarding Uniswap V2 LPTs, Parameter Updates Passed on Feb 23, 2021, 15:09 UTC. Executed on Feb 25, 2021, 15:11 UTC.  Collateral Onboarding  The UNIV2WBTCDAI-A vault type has been added using UNI-V2-WBTC-DAI as collateral. The UNIV2AAVEETH-A vault type has been added using UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH as collateral.   Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM)  The DC-IAM has been activated for LRC-A The DC-IAM has been activated for BAT-A The DC-IAM has been activated for BAL-A The DC-IAM has been activated for MANA-A The DC-IAM has been activated for ZRX-A The DC-IAM has been activated for KNC-A The DC-IAM has been activated for RENBTC-A   Other Changes  ETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling has increased from 1.5 billion DAI to 2.5 billion DAI. System Surplus Buffer has increased from 10 million DAI to 30 million DAI. DAI Savings Rate has increased from 0% to 0.01% The Liquidations Circuit Breaker permissions over PSM-USDC-A have been revoked. The Liquidations Circuit Breaker permissions over UNIV2USDCDAI-A have been revoked.     Signal Requests Adjusting Dust Parameter  The dust parameter is the minimum possible debt for a vault. You can learn more about the dust / \u201cdebt floor\u201d in the documentation here. The dust value of all vaults is currently set to 2,000 DAI, and this signal is asking what value, if any, the parameter should change to.  Increase PSM-DC and set Debt Ceiling for USDC-A/B to 0 As the stability fees collected from USDC are all 0, this signal proposes an adjustment of the Debt Ceilings and stops the lerp parameter.

That being said, an 18% drawback on LINK would wipe out the second biggest vault.    Last week, we neglected to include the largest vault in ZRX. Sitting at 220% collateralized with a liquidation price of 1.03. The market has been frothy, and ZRX went down by 30% recently so hopefully, the OSM is kind.    https://daistats.com | http://dai.descipher.io | https://makerburn.com  Community  Maker Forum Deep Dai-ve   Could Dai be short squeezed like Gamestop?  *A great thread discussing market dynamics and how DAI accruing is different from \u201cshort interest.\u201d *    euroDAI Discussion  A Declation of Intent has officially been filed for pursuing a stablecoin pegged to the Euro.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  MakerDAO Welcomes Four New Core Units The close of this week\u2019s Ratification Polls signals a number of new beginnings here at MakerDAO! The DAO is happy to welcome the following Core Units into the fold:  Collateral Engineering Services Development and UX StarkNet Engineering Strategic Happiness   The Offical DAI Bridge to Arbitrum One is Live Protocol Engineering Core Unit Facilitator @Derek announces the launch of the official Dai Bridge to Arbitrum One. The bridge lets users trade, lend, provide liquidity, and yield farm with DAI on the Arbitrum One network. Maker Vaults do not currently exist on Layer 2, although this new development does enable the use of DAI on Arbitrum.  Gelato Network G-UNI DAI-USDC Uniswap V3 Pool Now Live @hexonaut announced the launch of the Gelato Network G-UNI DAI-USDC Uniswap V3 Pool this past week. He explains in the thread that G-UNI gives MakerDAO exposure to Uniswap V3 via the DAI-USDC pool, which helps MakerDAO reduce its direct exposure to USDC while earning stability fees. The pool is launching with a Debt Ceiling of 10 Million Dai, which will likely be raised once the security of the pool has been tested.  Updates From Real-World Finance @mrabino1 of 6S Capital reports successful completion of the circuit test to ensure a proper flow of funds! 50,000 Dai was sent to the Trust, of which 30,000 was returned. The remaining 20,000 Dai can be viewed on MakerBurn. @williamr of the Real World Finance Core Unit is requesting funds from the Special Purpose Fund to conduct a feasibility study of Singaporean debt securities frameworks.. As the proposal explains, \u201cSingapore is a cornerstone financial hub for the Asia-Pacific and is expected to lead the credit expansion in the fastest-growing region of the globe this decade.\u201d Conducting this study will help MakerDAO understand what it takes to onboard Real-World Assets from Singaporean-based issuers. Last but not least, we have the monthly update from Harbor. Over the past month, Harbor \u201crecently closed on a supply chain finance program for an injection molding facility in Mexico\u201d and \u201cis open for investors looking to allocate funds towards the TIN tranche (junior), which will be reserved for investments of 100,000 DAI or more. Please contact [email\u00a0protected] to inquire about investing in TIN.\u201d In addition, Harbor has welcomed Michael Gilhuley as their Head of Portfolio Management.

That is likely for the folks living on the edge at 160% collateralization, and the rest of ETH-A is either 180% or 320%.    Those risky WBTC vaults have 2 million in exposure.

PaperImperium Supplemental Compensation - In response to the proposed delegate compensation, @PaperImperium is signal requesting a one-time lump sum of 50,000 DAI outside of any delegate compensation that may or may not be forthcoming in the future when both @PaperImperium and the community feel that he has delivered value to the DAO.  Last Week Adjusting Auction Parameters and Testing Layer 2 Components - September 24, 20210 This executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  Increase the ETH-A Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) from 30 million DAI to 40 million DAI. Increase the ETH-B Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) from 15 million DAI to 25 million DAI. Increase the ETH-C Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) from 20 million DAI to 30 million DAI. Increase the WBTC-A Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) from 15 million DAI to 25 million DAI. Decrease the Auction Price Multiplier (buf) for ETH-A, ETH-C, and WBTC-A vaults from 1.3 to 1.2. Multiple test actions will take place for Layer 2 DAI solutions on Optimism and Arbitrum, with the intention of denying the Protocol Engineering Core Unit\u2019s Deployer Keys if successful.

NewSilver Sees Support for Debt Ceiling Raise New Silver has been working with MakerDAO for close to 2 years to bring high-quality, real estate collateralized short-term bridge loans to the protocol. After successfully utilizing almost all of the current 5M debt ceiling and making numerous improvements to their model, they ask for 20M and have been getting support from several key DAO participants.  Community Exploring PSM Alternatives To address the protocol\u2019s growing USDC exposure, Sam started a signal request and conversation about creating a high-leverage Vault using Gelato Network\u2019s tokenized Dai<>USDC fixed-range UNI v3 position, called G-UNI. G-UNI can generate yield while being used as collateral; Sam believes such a vault could attract a couple of billion in TVL, which will indirectly unwind the PSM as minted DAI is sold for USDC.  New MKR Compensation Guidelines Published Last month, Planet_X withdrew MIP53: The MKR Compensation Guidelines on behalf of the working group, citing a need to develop the proposal further.

Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Protocol Engineering saves lost ETH! In an incredible testament to the skill of our Protocol Engineering team, 63 ETH (~240k USD) mistakenly sent to a non-existent address on Arbitrum have been recovered and returned to their owner. As @hexonaut explains, \u201c\u2026we can replicate any smart contract address on L2 that has previously been deployed by an L1 EOA. - Luckily, one of the Maker team members still had access to the deployer private key. This would allow us to insert arbitrary smart contract code into the address that the user sent the funds. - Once we have the Proxy deployed at the target address, we can issue a command to send the ETH back to the original user, and voila, we recovered the ETH!\u201d Read the full story on Twitter.  Two Recognised Delegates reconsider commitment to MakerDAO In light of recent developments, Recognized Delegates @PaperImperium and @Planet_X are reconsidering their commitment to MakerDAO. In response to the failure of his Supplemental Compensation Proposal, PaperImperium has notified the community of his intention to take an offer with another organization. In addition, Planet_X announced he would be taking an extended sabbatical. While we are disappointed to see community members leave or reduce their commitment to the DAO, the Maker Relay team wishes them the best of luck in their endeavors.  MKR lost in Indexed Finance hack Indexed Finance suffered a $16 million hack last week from two pools, including 516 MKR tokens. According to the project, the hacker has been identified, and the team is reassessing how to handle the situation due to the hacker being \u201csignificantly younger than we thought.\u201d Indexed Finance is a DeFi protocol offering Index Pools, lending, and staking.

Adjust WBTC-A DC-IAM-line - Demand for WBTC-A vaults has risen sharply in the last couple of weeks. According to makerburn, we will hit the max debt ceiling within just about two weeks.@makerburn is signaling to increase the WBTC-A DC-IAM-line to 1 billion to collect more fees, DAI in circulation, and keep up with the demand on DAI-from-WBTC-A. Restarted poll [Signal Request] Raise the ESM threshold to 15% and increase the Governance Delay to 4 days - Maker is reaching a point where the core Maker security is so battle-tested that the emergency shutdown feature (ES) is beginning to become a risk rather than a solution; with only 75,000 MKR currently needed to trigger ES, it is the most likely place for someone to try to damage the system. @rune proposes to double the trigger amount to 150,000 MKR, which will reduce the risk of a sudden ES and make the system more reliable. Crank DC, DC-IAM, & Liquidation Parameters [Preparation: Parabolic Stage] [NFA] [Second Attempt] - In response to the Governance and Risk Call during October 14th, @aburban90 signals a second attempt to raise the debt ceilings for ETH-A, ETH-B, WEBTC-A, and others along with raising the liquidation penalty for ETH-A and ETH-B vaults. Set PSM fees to 0% - @SebVentures has been diligently pushing the idea to set PSM fees to 0%; which is also suggested in The Case for Clean Money. If their signal were to pass, Sebastien provides many long-term pros and cons and discusses how setting PSM fees to 0% would anchor the perception that 1 DAI = $1. Would you like to see MakerDAO move in the general direction indicated by the post \u2018The Case for Clean Money\u2019? - In reaction to the initiative for Clean Money, @LongForWisdom creates an initial signal asking the community whether they would like to see MakerDAO move in the general direction indicated by the post \u2018The Case for Clean Money.\u2019  Previous Executive Offboarding Vaults, MKR Vesting, and Core Unit Budget Distribution - October 8, 2021 this executive proposal passed, the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol: Vaults Offboarded:     Vault Poll     BAT-A Poll   LRC-A Poll   ZRX-A Poll   UNIV2AAVEETH-A Poll   UNIV2LINKETH-A Poll    Core Unit Budget Distribution:     Core Unit Amount Poll     RISK-001 700 MKR Poll   CES-001 1,223,552 DAI Poll      Community Deep Dai-ve  Tweet of the Week   twitter.com    Hasu\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 @hasufl  stETH going up for vote as collateral in @MakerDAO https://t.co/IHtXEiZiPB   10:01 PM - 14 Oct 2021           300                42             Forum Insight   [Discussion] Build a US Political Strategy  @PaperImperium opens the discussion for the development of a US-based political strategy.

Eth-C vault positions1054\u00d7272 33 KB   ETH-C is a good example. The positions step down from one large vault, and the ilk(Vault type) is growing fast.   Liquidations ETH C at 583694\u00d7376 18.5 KB   You can already guess that for ETH-C vaults, ETH price would have to crater to $577 for liquidations to get troublesome.   Price drop page1307\u00d7820 96.4 KB   Thanks to @primoz, we can get granular on price drop impacts.    At 21% down, ETH-A starts to accelerate alongside ETH-C in green, and WBTC in the lighter purple. Cascading liquidations are an industry-wide issue. Liquidations 1.2 and 2.0 include mechanisms that mitigate the shock to MakerDAO. That being said, the collateralization is well balanced for these vault types.

LongForWisdom is back after a well deserved holiday Meeting with Talent-CU to onboard more gov-alpha team members.   Protocol Engineering  Centrifuge assets might be pushed back a bit to consider Debt Ceiling sizes following some audits.  DSSProxy actions received changes to support Sushi LP tokens. Continuing to work on Sushi Adapter, waiting on MasterChef v2. Tidying up DSSVest, the module for distributing MKR to teams. D3M Discussions ongoing with Aave, starting to think about the different cases around that, including Emergency Shutdown. Vote Delegation is completed, currently passing RPC tests, with an audit completed by ABDK.  DSS-Flash-Mint module is getting code finalized.  Reference Keeper Bot published, we intend to keep it up to date. Admin stuff; We transferred audits and tooling agreements from the Foundation to the DAO. We\u2019ve been evaluating stETH and its implications. Lots of L2 work is happening. We\u2019ve been talking to every L2 provider in the space about what it would look like for MakerDAO to be there.   Oracles  Oracle Core Unit MIPs live in the June Governance Cycle  Looking to move ahead with a proposal to give the Oracles Core Unit special permissions around Oracle whitelisting. Lots of talks around staked ETH. stETH is hard to make a reliable Oracle for since there is only liquidity in the Curve pool. We recommend that UNIV2DAIUSDC CR shouldn\u2019t be set lower than 102% We are leaving Liquidations off on UNIV2DAIUSDC.   Risk  We are finishing the last two evaluations for SUSHI. Next potential collateral onboardings are being discussed; we will be focused on stETH, D3M implementation, and Polygon collateral. D3M risk evaluation will require more attention than regular collateral onboarding. Adding new metrics to our risk dashboard. Auctions metrics are coming soon!

Current Events  Liquidation Ratio Adjustment to UNIV2DAIUSDC-A The most recent executive features some adjustments to the Uniswap DAI<>USDC LP Token vault type, including an adjustment from the Oracles Domain Team. While the 101% Liquidation option won out in this poll, the executive vote features a drop to 102%. This is due to some concerns over how the price oracle for Uniswap LP Tokens estimates fee inflow, with Nik Kunkel of the Oracles team explaining on the risks on last Thursday\u2019s Governance and Risk Call.  LongForWisdom Returns, Protocol Still Standing Governance Facilitator @LongForWisdom is back from his one week holiday. In his absence, @prose11 was put in charge of Governance happenings and managed not to break the protocol entirely. Despite many contentious conversations, a couple of urgent items for the executive, and a slew of important meetings, Prose is still standing. GovAlpha has taken a big step toward decentralization.  NewSilver Changes and Process Under Question Sebastien Derivaux, facilitator of the RWF Core Unit, identified a discrepancy between the Risk dashboard and the Risk Assessment. The LTV max was written as 80% but the executive document at the time showed 85%; Since then, the executive document was updated to 90% max LTV; The actual Vault remained at 72% LTV. A few community members inquired about how these changes were made and whether adequate notice was given. Greg Di Prisco, the founder of RWA Co., argues against Vault\u2019s where any changes to material parameters can be made without an on-chain vote. Additionally, @PaperImperium inquires about the CFG subsidy that other NewSilver partners get. All parties involved agree to improve oversight and process.  Alternative Marketing Core Unit Proposed Following the first rejection of the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit, competition is heating up, with the proposal from the AmaZix Marketing Core Unit. @Kathleen and the team have resubmitted a new version of their proposal, removing the controversial $5 million \u201cmoonshot fund,\u201d committing to alignment with MKR voters.  Be Mindful, Update to the Monthly Governance Cycle MKR voters heads up! The monthly governance cycle has officially changed to a more accomodating setup. Instead of three rounds of voting, MIPs and Subproposals will go through individual two-week Ratification Polls. Check out the latest MIPs Update for a view of the updated calendar.

[quote=\u201cjuanjuan, post:1, topic:4838\u201d] Collateral Onboarding Framework is a model that attempts to compare and prioritize collateral types in an as-objective-as-possible way, in order to seed intelligent discussions. [/quote] The Framework was created to allow Domain Teams, Working Groups, and external contributors to have an overview of the collateral types, their onboarding status, and their different characteristics. It aims to provide transparency to the broader Community and a common ground for discussions and potential future collaboration.     New Governance Portal Revealed   @derek presented the new Governance Portal redesign on the Community Call and there\u2019s a replay of his deep dive presentation. The new governance portal introduces many new features including:  A new landing page with a quick overview of available actions, system stats, and highlighted recent votes. The polling page has been revamped to allow batched polling. The executive voting page now  displays past executive proposals and their respective execution dates and amount of MKR still in support. Users are also able to add comments along with their vote so the community can better understand the rationale behind why people vote a certain way.

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Governance Governance Polls Summary Thread @MakerMan pointed out the experience for voting could be aggregated and @LongForWisdom delivered a more concise voting thread with Forum context and the voting portal unified. Governance at a Glance  MIPs Updates The Maker Improvement Proposal (MIPs) Framework provides a clear process for Maker governance to change the Protocol as needed. Note that the MIPs editor keeps an excellent board of the MIPs process on github. Also note that @charlesstlouis began adding one liners for MIPs in the updates.   Weekly MIPS Update #9 7/13 - 7/14  Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP20 Target Price Adjustment Module  MIP13c3-SP1 Declaration of Intent for Forward Guidance  Learn more about Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)  Domain Teams  Smart Contracts and Risk  Token Smart Contract Assessments  MANA1388\u00d7745 244 KB  MANA Risk evaluation forum thread  LEND1382\u00d7730 228 KB  LEND Risk evaluation forum thread TUSD - Poll still ongoing about TUSD upgrades and effects to the Maker Protocol  Risk Signal Request: Should we raise the ETH debt ceiling?  180 million was the winning poll option, was placed in Monday\u2019s Executive Vote, and passed.  Signal Request: Increases in the ETH and USDC-A debt ceilings  The farming trend is taking another turn towards YFI farming, the community signaled on what the new ETH and USDC-A debt ceiling should be.  220 million for ETH with 68 total votes. 80 million for USDC-A with 56 total votes.     Working Groups  Vault Compensation Analysis Team A recap from @adrianmcli  The Initial Compensation Plan was voted against by MKR holders. It appears there is still interest in moving forward, so if you have feedback on the current plan please provide it in the threads. The team is wrangling feedback to understand how to proceed and may propose another vote.   State of the Peg  Peg1360\u00d7591 111 KB   DAI peg down very slightly from last week at 1.013.   Dai Supply1243\u00d7854 108 KB   218 million total Dai.   VWAP1359\u00d7668 45.6 KB   Volume at around $33 million this last week. Average VWAP over seven days places Dai at $ 1.015   1382\u00d7417 38.5 KB   ETH vaults collateralization ratio continues to grow in the 200-300 and 250-300 buckets. ~$67 million in the first bucket and $46 million in the second. Slightly more risk-on behavior as the ETH-A debt ceiling climbs.   1579\u00d7402 21.7 KB   ETH at $150 nets out to ~34 million Dai liquidated but an even steeper curve at around $148 where $75 million in Dai would be liquidated.   697\u00d7397 9.38 KB   WBTC Collateralization ratios even more bimodal, with 10 million at 200-250% and ~$9 million at 150-200%   1559\u00d7387 21.8 KB   First significant liquidation wall for WBTC at $8226.  Dai Stats | http://dai.descipher.io/  Governance and Risk Observation 1:11:36  Vishesh: Considering the lifecycle of Dai is a little bit missing (in our calculus) but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that if the goal is bringing down peg you have to target use cases of Dai that will put more liquidity on the open market and help drive that price down.

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.

Token Smart Contract Assessments  tBTC Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment renBTC Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH Oracle Smart Contract Technical Assessment   Risk  The Risk team published Collateral Risk Evaluations for UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH, and CF-DROP. A risk assessment of the Peg Stabilization Module (PSM) has been published in the forum and plans to focus on real-world assets (RWA) in the coming year.   Oracles  The Oracles team published a post-mortem for the oracle outage that took place on November 25. The team also published oracle collateral assessments for UNI-V2-DAI-ETH, UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH, and UNI-V2-USDC-ETH    State of the Peg  Peg1427\u00d7564 173 KB   DAI 24 hour price creeping ever lower towards peg, sitting at 1.002.

Liquidation wall703\u00d7386 17.1 KB   Liquidation Walls get pretty steep at $418 ETH, where 121 million Dai would be up for liquidation.

Dai Stats | http://dai.descipher.io/ | makerburn.com  Community  Articles   In Defense Of Burning  @textrapperr opens a discussion on privileging Maker\u2019s existing burn model over proposed \u201cdividend/fee\u201d models.    Unlocking compliant cryptocurrency flows  This case study profiles MakerDAO\u2019s use of Request Network to pay contributors.     Maker Forum Deep Dai-ve   Strategic direction - integration with defi or protocol base layer?  @Planet_X says: \u201c\u2026integration with other defi projects could possibly be the way to go forward, but it is in direct opposition with the intention of Maker becoming the Linux of money . So what I am proposing is that we have a principled discussion on the direction of Maker.\u201d    [Discussion] MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm  SebVentures opens a discussion on how to compensate contributors directly from Maker funds.    Introducing DssGovRewards  @hexonaut\u2019s explains; \u201c\u2026Maker is not secure if there is more MKR available to borrow than there is locked in Chief/DssGov. The simplest and probably most robust way to solve this is to pay people to lock their MKR in chief and thus keep their MKR off the market.\u201d    Let\u2019s launch Oasis on IPFS!  @MagoCrypto seeks input on the domain to be used for hosting Oasis on IPFS.    [Signal Request] Vault Compensation Working Group Payment  @Monet_supply asks MakerDAO governance to consider funding payment for time contributed to the vault compensation project, despite the fact the plan ultimately failed to pass.

If most forum voters (excluding abstain voters) support changing the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC liquidation ratio, I\u2019ll follow up with an on-chain governance poll for the selected parameter update.  Last Week\u2019s Executive Vote System Surplus Buffer Increase and Burn, Parameter Changes, YFI-A Addition to Liquidations 2.0 Passed on Apr 26, 2021, 22:06 UTC   The System Surplus Buffer will be increased from 30MM to 60MM over a period of 99 days, targeting 25% of incoming revenue used to burn MKR.  Target 25% of the stability fee revenues to be used in Surplus Auctions to burn MKR. This will be achieved by increasing the System Surplus Buffer over 99 days starting on April 30th using a linear interpolation smart contract (lerp), instead of directly setting it to the target value of 60 million DAI. The 25% target assumes constant fees and no additional revenue over the time period. It should not be viewed as a guarantee of a specific percentage of revenue burn.   YFI-A will be added to the Liquidations 2.0 framework. Multiple changes to stability fees and debt ceilings will be made to various vault types   Liquidations 2.0 Contracts, Increase Emergency Shutdown Threshold Passed on Apr 22, 2021, 01:32 UTC | Executed on Apr 26, 2021, 14:02 UTC  Add contract \u201cMCD_DOG\u201d - The liquidation module contract, a full upgrade to the previous cat contract for liquidations. Replace contract \u201cMCD_END\u201d - Contract for executing a shutdown of the protocol. Replace contract \u201cMCD_ESM\u201d - Emergency Shutdown Module contract that enables burning MKR to shut the protocol down. Replace contract \u201cILK_REGISTRY\u201d - Contract defining the different vault types within the protocol. Add contract \u201cCLIPPER_MOM\u201d - Contract that enables a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d for Liquidations 2.0 if the price of collateral drops too severely. Add contract \u201cMCD_CLIP_LINK_A\u201d - Contract containing the LINK-A auction module. Add contract \u201cMCD_CLIP_CALC_LINK_A\u201d - Contract that contains the Auction Price Function for LINK-A.

Lower PSM-USDC-A tout Parameter  @hexonaut posted this to signal a possible rate decrease for trading Dai into the PSM for USDC.     Updates  MIPs Latest MIPs Update #26 Feb. 1, 2021  No MIPs have been formally submitted for the February cycle.   Proposals in Request-For-Comments   MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign  This MIP defines DssGov, a contract replacement for DSChief that comes with improved security, usability, and functionality for holders of the Maker governance token (MKR).    MIP31: Active Reserve AMM (dss-ara)  A technical proposal for an active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract.    MIP32: Peg Stability Module for Compound Mixed Exposure  Provides an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via dai using cdai. It also converts USDC to cUSDC using the same join adaptor (lending join).    MIP33: Maker Stability Price Module  This proposal allows Governance to defend an MKR price by pre-allocating dai to buy at a pre-defined level.    MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module  The Keg is a tool for streaming ERC20 DAI to a preset group of addresses from out of the Surplus Buffer.    MIP35: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure - With Farming  This proposal defines a new Peg Stability Module, which converts USDC to DAI and DAI to USDC, using Compound to generate leveraged yield.    MIP36: Peg Stability - Compound Governance Dai Leverage  This proposal defines a Peg stabilizer controlled by governance, which uses the flash minting technique for Dai lending to leverage MakerDAO\u2019s position on cDai.    MIP37: Static Reserve For Governance  Defines a static reserve that can receive any tokens from anyone as any contract and allows Maker Governance to withdraw them.    MIP38: DAO Primitives State  DAO Primitives State is a MIP that contains all the status related to Core Units, Budgets, and Facilitators.    MIP39: Core Unit Framework  Contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP40: Budget Framework  Contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP41: Facilitator Framework  Contains a framework with subproposal processes for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP42: Proposed Compensation Addendum for MakerDAO Contributors  Proposes to pay contributors partially in time-locked MKR to increase value returned to contributors and directly align their interests with those of MakerDAO.    MIP43: Term Lending Module (TLM)  Proposes an integration with Yield Protocol. Authors Allan and Alberto are employees of Yield, Inc., a company working to build Yield Protocol. Lev is an advisor to Yield, Inc.    MIP45: Liquidations 2.0 (LIQ-2.0) - Liquidation System Redesign  Proposes a new method for Liquidations in the MakerDAO echo system, including a shift to a \u201cDutch Auction\u201d style of liquidation.    MIP46: Parameter Proposal Groups  Proposes the formalization of Parameter Proposal Groups. These groups are tasked with evaluating information produced by contributors and domain teams and using this analysis to produce parameter change proposals for governance consideration.    MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management  Defines the requirements for creating a Multisignature wallet that Maker Governance recognizes.    MIP48: Streaming Payments via the Keg  Describes how to utilize the Keg, a method of streaming DAI to various addresses, at a defined rate.    MIP49: Governance Rewards  Proposes the creation of Governance Rewards, allowing the Maker community to reward MKR holders for locking their MKR tokens in Governance.    Sub-Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP13c3-SP9: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol (Declaration of Intent)  An experiment is proposed for a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B or ETH-C, with lower CR than WBTC-A or ETH-B (respectively), natively backed by a B.Protocol backstop.    MIP4c2-SP10: MIP0 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP0 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Domain Framework MIP set.  The main difference is that it removes the inbuilt functionality of MIP0 to onboard core personnel. Instead, it uses the DAO Primitives State to determine who have been onboarded as Governance Facilitators by Maker Governance and then introduces logic that allows Governance Facilitators to designate MIP Editors.    MIP4c2-SP11: MIP5 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP5 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to the Governance Facilitator Emergency Vote process, which directly deals with onboarding and offboarding Facilitators.    MIP4c2-SP12: MIP16 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP16 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to clarify the Governance Powers of Facilitators.    MIP39c2-SP1: Adding Core Unit (Real-World Finance)  This Core Unit is designed to pursue Real-World Asset work and more generally helps MakerDAO take over the traditional finance world.    MIP39c2-SP2: Adding Risk Core Unit  Onboarding Risk Core Unit ensures Maker Protocol can continue to grow safely by having proper risk management parameters and risk mitigation tools applied.    MIP39c2-SP3: Governance Core Unit - GOV-001  Proposed because MakerDAO requires a consistent and well-run governance process managed by elected facilitators to remain stable and secure as it grows.    MIP40c2-SP1: Modify Core Unit Budget (Real-World Finance)  Remuneration for the Real-World Finance Core Unit    MIP40c2-SP2: Add Core Unit Budget (Risk Core Unit)  Remuneration for the Risk Core Unit    MIP40c2-SP3: Core Unit Budget - GOV-001  GovAlpha needs a budget to be able to fulfill its mandate.    MIP41c4-SP1: Facilitator Onboarding (Real-World Finance)  Real-World Finance needs a budget to be able to fulfill its mandate.    MIP41c4-SP2: Risk Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding  Risk needs a budget to be able to fulfill its mandate.    MIP41c4-SP3: Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding   @Longforwisdom is applying to be a Facilitator of GovAlpha due to his current position as Governance Facilitator.

Weekly MIPS Update # 12  Proposals that are in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP13c3-SP2: Declaration of Intent - Dai Flash Mint Module   Signal request passed next step is to submit MIP13 process for September\u2019s governance cycle.    MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer  Needs a new champion.    MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism  Feedback cycle ends in August.    MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling and Actual Risk Premium Adjustments  Work continues, it could be introduced for September\u2019s Governance cycle.    MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox)  Here is last week\u2019s section of the Governance and Risk call focusing on MIP20.    Learn more about Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) in the Maker Forum  Current Events  Vault Compensation  Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade  Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)  The proposed change lets Maker Governance control to some extent the amount of simultaneous auctions that can occur at once. Mariano Conti clarifies,    Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)   \u201cAccording to http://makervaults.descipher.io/  the largest ETH-A vault has 37m Dai debt, second largest has 30m. If any of these 2 vaults were to be liquidated (they\u2019re pretty safe right now) we\u2019d see an immediate liquidity crunch, as keepers try to bid on an extremely large amount of auctions. I believe the risk to the system would be high, since in case of the first vault, 290,000 ETH would be auctioned, in up to 2900 different and simultaneous auctions.\u201d    SourceCred Trial Update  Week 10 DAI Distributions, new instance system & payout mechanism - SourceCred trial  This update marks Week 10 of the trial of SourceCred trial. 2500 Dai were distributed in the preceding week and July\u2019s payouts have been distributed.

Should the Maker Community Reimburse MKR Voters for the ETH Transaction Fees Incurred when Polling and Executive voting?  @ElProgreso notes:    Should the Maker Community Reimburse MKR Voters for the ETH Transaction Fees Incurred when Polling and Executive voting?   This week it will cost anywhere from $20 to $50 to Poll on the current nine (9) open polls. And perhaps this is the reason why we have had such a low, low, turnout. More than likely\u2014it is.    Annualized Earnings Hit Zero @RyanWatkins_ published a tweet commenting on Maker\u2019s earnings, citing the following graphic from Messari:  \"While Dai\u2019s supply is going parabolic, Maker\u2019s annualized earnings effectively just hit zero.   Interest rates can\u2019t get up and MKR holders aren\u2019t being compensated at all for their crucial role in managing and backstopping the MakerDAO system.\"   Messari Analysis800\u00d7450 89.8 KB   State of the Peg 08-17-2020  Peg1518\u00d7569 265 KB   DAI peg still above $1 though it\u2019s come down since last week.

Dai Stats | http://dai.descipher.io/  Community  Articles and Thought Pieces  Ethereum Emission Debate Sparked by MakerDao Developer Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dumas\u2019s Script   \u201cThere has always been speculation about the coin limit of Ethereum, and recently, it has been stimulated again with the release of a script by MakerDao developer Marc-Andr\u00e9 Dumas. The script in question projects the size of the issuance of the second largest cryptocurrency via capitalisation.\u201d   Who Uses the Maker Protocol and Dai, and Why?  A resource for all types of projects that involve Dai, and explanations of some of the interesting things that can/have been done with it.  \u201cEvery day, people all over the world derive value from generating Dai and, in doing so, provide value to the Maker ecosystem. The number of people that use Dai will only grow in the coming years, as more and more individuals, businesses, developers, and other parties grasp the advantages of decentralized crypto assets.\u201d   Huobi Launches Consortium of DeFi Providers and Platforms With MakerDAO, Compound  The \u201cGlobal DeFi Alliance\u201d includes Huobi, MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX, and DeFi price oracle network Nest.

Adding Real World Assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) as DAI collateral is a critical step for Maker to stabilize the peg\u2026   @mrabino1 goes in depth discussing the addition of RWA and the potential effects that might have, also highlighting some of the points of potential failure, and ways to avoid that.       Adding Real World Assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) as DAI collateral is a critical step for Maker to stabilize the peg... and in doing so, we change the world   \u201cReal world assets as collateral is a natural progression and a complement to the existing DAI collateral. In many ways, it is an evolved symbiotic relationship, as both truly need the other, even as neither realizes yet.\u201d    Help MakerDAO respond to a media inquiry from Cryptonomist  @seth is looking for feedback from any and all users in relation to a media inquiry. The community-led Governance Communications (GovComms) team was given a list of questions and the decision was made to bring some of these to the rest of the community.  Twitter   twitter.com    kain.eth @kaiynne  I\u2019ve criticised DAI early, scalability, and later with centralised collateral. But one thing I never criticised was the power of the community and belief @MakerDAO built. You cannot easily replicate this, and it\u2019s critical to adoption, as a lot of new designs will soon realise.   4:05 AM - 17 Aug 2020           170                12             Meetings and Events  MakerDAO Open Calls  Community Call  There is no community call this week.

Someone in Decentraland is doing well; total debt outstanding grew from $2.5 to $4.9 million    ZRX has seen two 500K additions in the past two weeks plus one more 300k addition in the past few days.

Active Governance Polls There are no active governance polls at this time, but there are greenlight polls.  Community Greenlight Polls     Collateral Vote MIP6 Application     RARE (SuperRare) Vote Application   RAI (Rai Reflex Index) Vote Application    Check out an 'at-a-glance view of the current Vault types and their parameters on MakerBurn  Active Signal Requests Offboard KNC Legacy Token - Following community support and discussion, @monet-supply signals to offboard the KNC-A vault type with the parameter changes outlined in the post. Nexo Institutional Vault - Following many discussions around Institutional and Long-Term Vaults and their financial implication, @Nadia is signaling by asking the community by asking whether we should launch the Nexo Institutional Vault. Activate DC-IAM for PSM-PAX-A and adjust DC-IAM gap parameter for PSM-USDC-A - PSM-PAX debt ceiling increased to 500M, but currently does not have the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module activated. In order to maintain a healthy DC-IAM gap that includes PSM-PAX, @rema proposes to adjust the DC-IAM gap parameter for PSM-USDC-A. Adjust the Surplus Buffer (September 2021) - @ultraschuppi is signaling to adjust the Surplus Buffer to prevent it from filling up in the case Liquidations Penalties collected during a significant market drop.  Last Week Vault Onboarding, 6s Updates, and Reducing Vault Liquidation Ratios - August 20, 2021 This executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred:   Debt Ceiling for 6s Capital (RWA-001) will be increased from 1,000 DAI to 15 million DAI and the Broker-Dealer address updated.

MakerDAO\u2019s Timeline for Launching DAI on Arbitrum One  @bartek and the Protocol Engineering CU provide a brief roadmap for Dai\u2019s launch on Arbitrum.    Gas spent on voting & polling  @tbone shares an impressive summary of the gas spent on voting and polling since the deployment of the current DS-Chief contract.    Check out the latest Forum at a Glance  Articles Risk and Regulation in DeFi  King & Spalding briefly explore the risks of DeFi as it grows and, in turn, draws increasing scrutiny from regulators. The article explores an array of risks; technological, asset, and compliance. It also covers SCC and CFTC guidance.    Team Updates  GovAlpha GovAlpha Weekly Update  Onboarding has been going particularly well this past week. Got a new member, @TheExistence, who started doing some work for us.  @LongForWisdom is exploring how Core Units can better understand Project Priority from voters/the community at large.   Protocol Engineering  Layer 2:  Arbitrum\u2019s Layer 2 launched. We\u2019re running a final audit and should have the DAI Gateway launched within a few weeks. Reason: it\u2019s a custom gateway that allows us to have fungible DAI. Met with Optimism Team. They are planning an upgrade in October, making deployments feel very much like L1. Keeping regular Sync with Proposed StarkNet Team. Check out their Pod session this week; I also had Bartek give a good discussion on some of the potential relations with the PE team. Synch with Oracles to discuss opportunities for sending messages over to L2. Message passing infrastructure - requirements documentation.   Wrapped up several FV tasks - using Certora:  L2 DAI - writing specs, the inclusion of the permit function. DssVest - FV and fuzzing (automated software testing technique).   Other work this week:  Adding MATIC support to the auction keeper. Goerli Deployment work - All complete except for Centrifuge RWAs (sharing goETH). GUNI - we completed the internal team audit and have ABDK doing an audit later this month.   Ongoing Audits:  B.Protocol auditing DssCharter to support institutional vaults.     Oracles  Continuing development for stETH, which should be complete within the next few weeks. Thinking about long-term roadmap planning; looking at bridge alignment and overlap of needs for products and services.  Want to develop the Fast Withdrawal Bridge for Optimism first before applying it to other areas. Want to create a standardized interface for cross-chain communication. This is all still early and under initial research for ideas.   Hired a design firm to generate logos, typography, and more. Discussed with TechOps to continue infrastructure monitoring for us. Entity formation underway; will complete setup within the next two weeks.  Making progress on finding a banking partner - may take a few months.     Risk Risk Core Unit Month in Review: August 2021  New Dashboards and planned features. KNC-A offboarding parameters posted. Other collateral will follow next with similar steps or parameter adjustments proposed to offboard them. Still working on the Nexo Institutional Vault risk assessment; in the meantime, waiting for the poll\u2019s outcome to confirm or adjust loan terms.  Evaluation is 80% complete and adding few new sections. Still thinking about auction parameters for this kind of vault and thinking of limiting auction throughout because of the size of the loan and at the same time increasing liquidation penalty. Evaluating DssCharter implementation - might have some risks if the borrower doesn\u2019t know how to use flash loans or doesn\u2019t have external capital available to perform top-ups or repays.   PSM-PAX-A evaluating proper DC IAM parameters, which are currently disabled. We could decrease gap PSM USDC-A and at the same time increase it for PAX - that will lower tail risks of particular stablecoin failure, plus diversification benefits. Looking into stETH/ETH Curve pool as next collateral evaluation.   Growth Growth CU Weekly Update  Posted a signal request for launching the Nexo Institutional Vault. Nexo posted a financial analysis of these kinds of Vaults. Speaking with institutions who know how to handle and protect their positions. Suggest that we should not offboard Loopring, BAT, and MANA tokens. They are interested in using the Maker Protocol  Loopring and MANA opened positions in Maker Protocol. Discussing with them to continue using these vaults.   Strategy for Maker Growth:  Thinking about how to involve DAI in NFT and Metaverse solutions appearing. Working with various artists and popular gaming tournaments to implement DAI. Continuing strategy with Metaverse working on NFTs.   PAXOS team began using the PSM and are interested in increasing the DC.   Content Production Content Production Bi-Weekly Update   New six-month budget. Engaging with a lawyer to better understand our communication boundaries. Hosted AMAs with Planet_X and Nadia. Updated Maker Relay videos by replacing Current Events with Forum at a Glance Syndicating Maker Relay updates with Substack. Posted update on brand research that was conducted. Results show that people focus on the value of the community. Feedback on this would be appreciated. Alec has been working on a dashboard that tracks MakerDAO metrics and beginning production on another to help consolidate Dai on Different Networks.   Governance Communications GovComms Bi-Weekly Update  We received Dai, setup with AccountAble is in progress. Our accounting actuals will begin getting posted starting the first week of October. Summary Team now has coverage of every public call except CU Tools & CU Rituals. Hunt for an Engagement Lead continues. We started an internal people list, with a public version of this resource planned for the future. We cleaned up the old Emergency Communications Process document and formulated a plan for this document. The plan is to make this into an all-encompassing Emergency Playbook that contains information on Emergency types, MakerDAO\u2019s threat monitoring practices, the various coordination tracks(and associated processes.) What began as a Team update audit has expanded into a general \u201cinformation output\u201d audit. We are continuing work on this, expecting to have a complete set of information by the end of the month. Forum at a Glance now has a project overview document. You can also find the F-a-a-G presentation that Artem does on Youtube, thanks to Content Production!

Should we increase Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144k DAI for the initial three-month delegate compensation trial? - Signal Closes November 4th - In response to previous signals and discussion, @LongForWisdom proposes a higher compensation for Delegates and asks the community whether we should increase the Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144,000 DAI for the initial three-month Delegate compensation trial? Increase The MakerDAO NS-DROP maximum to 85% when AO TIN participation is at least 50% - The New Silver AO pool on Tinlake has been live for ten months and approved as the first RWA with MakerDAO for six months. Therefore, given the seniority of the MakerDAO debt and many other protections, including borrowers\u2019 equity on every loan, we hope the community would consider adjusting the maximum share of DROP tokens that the DAO is holding. @prankstr25 is asking the community whether we MakerDAO should increase its\u2019 maximum share of NS-DROP to 85% when AO TIN participation is at least 50%  Last Week  Last week contained no active executive vote; The previous executive on October 8th passed on Oct 9, 2021, 12:32 UTC, and was executed on Oct 11, 2021, 14:00 UTC.    Community Deep Dai-ve  Tweet of the Week   twitter.com    lucasvo \uaa5c @lucasvo  NewSilver's pool of real estate loans, NS-DROP, generates $300k in stability fees for @MakerDAO  & climbed to the 8th spot of collateral by annual fees. This is just a fraction of how much more RWA are out there bringing real revenue to DeFi protocols.\ud83c\udf00 https://t.co/GOffdrRbWZ   11:58 AM - 22 Oct 2021           120                27             Forum Insight Adding utility to MKR token (discount stability fees for vault owners who hold MKR) - @sasa believes there should be more utility benefits to the MKR token to help MakerDAO benefit from new DeFi developments and increase our dominance in the lending market. @sasa presents an idea for discount stability fees for vault owners who hold MKR. This can help incentivize asset managers to own and store MKR. Check it out and leave your feedback. Issues with our governance process and delegate compensation - Delegate compensation continues to be a controversial and critical topic for discussion. @AstronautThis posts a thread addressing some issues with the governance process being followed for Delegate compensation. Astro believes that the MIP61 process should be followed and polled on-chain along with any successful signal requests. Astro also believes that Delegates should abstain from polls and votes involving their Delegate compensation. Finally, the post contains some thoughts for long-term solutions. Check it out!

Available for execution on Jan 20, 2021, 23:14 UTC. ETH-A Stability Fee will increase from 2.5% to 3.5%. ETH-B Stability Fee will increase from 5% to 6.5%. WBTC-A Stability Fee will decrease from 4.5% to 4%. YFI-A Stability Fee will decrease from 9% to 6%. MANA-A Stability Fee will decrease from 10% to 5%. AAVE-A Stability Fee will decrease from 6% to 4%. Set Protocol will be whitelisted on the AAVE/USD Medianizer Oracle. Set Protocol will be whitelisted on the LRC/USD, YFI/USD, ZRX/USD, and the UNI/USD Medianizer Oracle. Gnosis will be whitelisted on the BTC/USD, LINK/USD, ZRX/USD, YFI/USD, and the COMP/USD OSM Oracle. The Minimum Bid Increase (beg) for FLAP auctions will increase from 2% to 4%. The Bid Duration (ttl) for FLAP auctions will increase from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The System Surplus Buffer will increase from 4 million DAI to 10 million DAI. Liquidations Circuit Breaker permissions over USDC-A, USDC-B, TUSD-A, PAXUSD-A, and GUSD-A will be revoked.   Signal Requests   Adjust ETH-A Debt Ceiling  Poll for two things here: changing the DC to allow more DAI from ETH-A. and to find out if we want to switch over to IAM 5 for ETH-A    Interim DAO Operating Budget  Poll is closed with a large majority saying Yes to proceed. We will go to an on-chain vote for Feb 1st.    New vault-type for ETH with a higher Liquidity Ratio  Will highly reduce the risk of the protocol losing money on liquidations, while on the other hand offering a lower Stability Fee for people who want to stay heavily overcollateralized.     Updates  MIPs Weekly MIPS Update #25 Jan 18, 2021 Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign  This MIP defines DssGov, a contract replacement for DSChief that comes with improved security, usability, and functionality for holders of the Maker governance token (MKR).    MIP31: Active Reserve AMM (dss-ara)  A technical proposal for an active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract.    MIP32: Peg Stability Module for Compound Mixed Exposure  Provides an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via dai using cdai. It also converts USDC to cUSDC using the same join adaptor (lending join).    MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module  The Keg is a tool for streaming ERC20 DAI to a preset group of addresses from out of the Surplus Buffer.    MIP37: Static Reserve For Governance It defines a static reserve that can receive any tokens from anyone as any contract and allows Maker Governance to withdraw them.  MIP38: DAO Primitives State  DAO Primitives State is a MIP that contains all the status related to Core Units, Budgets, and Facilitators.    MIP39: Core Unit Framework  Contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP40: Budget Framework  Contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP41: Facilitator Framework  Contains a framework with subproposal processes for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    Sub-Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP13c3-SP9: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol (Declaration of Intent)  An experiment is proposed for a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B or ETH-C, with lower CR than WBTC-A or ETH-B (respectively), which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop.    MIP4c2-SP10: MIP0 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP0 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Domain Framework MIP set.  The main difference is that it removes the inbuilt functionality of MIP0 to onboard core personnel. Instead, it uses the DAO Primitives State to determine who have been onboarded as Governance Facilitators by Maker Governance and then introduces logic that allows Governance Facilitators to designate MIP Editors.    MIP4c2-SP11: MIP5 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP5 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to the Governance Facilitator Emergency Vote process, which directly deals with onboarding and offboarding Facilitators.    MIP4c2-SP12: MIP16 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP16 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to clarify the Governance Powers of Facilitators.    Learn more about Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs)  Smart Contracts  Liquidations 2.0 is the top priority right now.  PWC is currently auditing the Liquidations 2.0 code work first, then Quantstamp will take a look.   Working on MIP 21 (Real-World Assets(RWA)), which is close to being done, and MIP 22 (Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module) is next. RWA adapter currently has 2 different approaches; if we want to scale, we\u2019ll need to standardize them going forward. Community executive (community writes it\u2019s own spell) is set for January 22nd.   Risk  Budget proposal and roadmap for Risk Domain are coming to the forum soon.   Oracles  Two proposals passed last week, whitelisting Gnosis and Set Protocol on multiple oracles. dYdX has 17 proposals in the pipeline, and we expect to have deployment in testing by the end of the week. There is a slight challenge with baking layer-2 in. We have leads for auditing firms for Uniswap LP oracle, will be meeting with them to discuss the scope for start date toward the beginning of February.   Current Events  Road to the DAO   Road to DAO: the Core Unit Operating Model  A MIP Set proposed by @juan, with contributions from @flipflopflapdelegate and @iammeeoh, designed to ease the separation from the Maker Foundation by paving a path towards putting people in charge of groups, paying contributors, and keeping projects accountable. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it is entirely possible to achieve the Target Operating Model in the first iteration. The MIPs model allows us to discover the shortcomings of the current MIP Set, amend it, and integrate the temporary measures built around its weaknesses.\u201d     Removing Circuit Breaker from Stablecoin Vault Liquidations   Limiting Governance Attack Surface for Stablecoins  The smart contracts domain team suggests reducing the governance attack surface by removing the liquidation circuit breaker from any Vaults that have liquidations explicitly set to off.

Tweet of the Week   twitter.com    Brian McMichael \ud83d\ude42 @brianmcmichael  \"Maker isn't cool\" is not a valid criticism. We should not be judging a project with $4.28B TVL by how \"cool\" it is. It is a financial product. Is your money safe? That's what I think about, that's what keeps me up at night. Not whether the project is \"cool\".

State of the Peg  Peg at one and three zeros1565\u00d7540 151 KB   DAI 24-hour VWAP has been adding zeros upfront, getting ever closer to peg parity: 1.000679.   DAI peg bump to 1.0041599\u00d7567 99.8 KB   Even with the biggest moves on Sushiswap, corresponding to this weekend\u2019s airdrop festival, the peg still held at 40 bips and below.   1643\u00d7514 26.1 KB   Volume at 575 million with Sushiswap again leading a huge part of the trading. VWAP over the whole week is 1.001.    Digging a little deeper, you can see that most of the volume ends up back to curve 3pool.    Which had a whopping amount of volume on Saturday, mostly capitulating two-to-one with USDT.   Dai Supply876\u00d7903 128 KB   Dai supply 2870\u00d7777 102 KB   Dai supply at 3.1 billion. We feel it\u2019s silly to keep saying \u201call-time high in Dai supply,\u201d so we\u2019re calling it now: 5 billion is the next milestone. Then the march to 50 billion. We can get beers with @NikKunkel at that point. Uni LPs begin to diversify with that extra debt ceiling room, alongside some larger moves in LINK and YFI.

ETH-B1190\u00d7455 54.5 KB   ETH-B has two large vaults at the top with similar collateral.

ETH-C is a little healthier, with the largest vault sitting at 640%.    LINK had a large vault splash in this morning, sitting at 240% collateralized.    LINK price at 22 would impact that position significantly.   YFI Vaults1192\u00d7305 37.4 KB   YFI vaults are a little more diversified, with a second large position up top. It\u2019s always good to see additional diversification (beyond the big  energy of yield farming against the debt from an exploit).

Available for execution on Mar 9, 2021, 10:11 UTC.  ETH-A Target Available Debt (gap) will increase from 30 million DAI to 80 million DAI. Bid Duration (ttl) parameter will decrease from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types where liquidations are enabled. Max Auction Duration (tau) parameter will decrease from 6 hours to 4 hours for all vault types where liquidations are enabled.  box parameter will increase from 15 million DAI to 20 million DAI. Minimum Bid Increment (beg) parameter will increase from 3% to 5% for the ETH-B vault type. Minimum Bid Increment (beg) parameter will increase from 3% to 5% for the UniswapV2 Liquidity Pool vault types. RWA001-A vault type will be added using RWA001 (6s Capital) as collateral with preliminary, non-final parameters for testing purposes.  Increase PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling Passed Mar 2, 2021, 15:16 UTC. Executed Mar 4, 2021, 15:17 UTC.  PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling has increased to 1 billion DAI USDC-A Debt Ceiling has decreased from 555 million DAI to zero DAI   Active Signal Requests Increase the bump / ttl parameters of FLAP auctions    [Signal Request] Increase the `bump` / `ttl` parameters of FLAP auctions   Now that the protocol is bringing in over 250k DAI per day, I wanted to open discussion/action on whether we should increase the lots (bump) of FLAP auctions.   Adjust WBTC-A DC-IAM-line    [Signal Request] Adjust WBTC-A DC-IAM-line   At activation of DC-IAM  for WBTC-A we set the initial line  to 350 MM . Shortly after, the demand for DAI-from-WBTC-A picked up speed significantly, it slowed down a bit during last week\u2019s sell-off, but I think it makes sense to get prepared.   Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-2)    [Signal Request] Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-2)   Governance most recently raised the dust parameter in January, when it was increased from 500 DAI to 2,000 DAI due to increasing gas costs and rising ETH price. Since then, the potential costs of participating in auctions has grown, as evidenced by the recent market drawdown where sustained gas prices reached well over 1200 gwei.   Adjust ETH-A DC-IAM-line (2021-05)    [Signal Request] Adjust ETH-A DC-IAM-line (2021-05)   The appetite for ETH-A hasn\u2019t slowed down, the current exec raising the line to 2.5B is most probably executed after we hit it.

Letting Keepers know about the upcoming changes to auction parameters following this week\u2019s executive vote Looking to raise WBTC Debt Ceiling following this risk report.   Oracles  LP oracles update: no major issues found!  Will need to make a few minor patches, but this should clear the oracle hurdle for LP vault Debt Ceilings. Still need to make a plan for liquidations, as there have been problems with low participation in collateral auctions so far. Looking into adding Curve LP tokens as well!   Oracle sensitivity has been lowered on less utilized collateral types to save money on Oracle spend.

Las opiniones sobre la implementaci\u00f3n de los esfuerzos de marketing han sido variadas: aqu\u00ed y aqu\u00ed, pero muchos est\u00e1n de acuerdo en que los esfuerzos de marketing adicionales son necesarios. La opini\u00f3n actual parece estar dividida entre las Core Unit (CUs) que gestionan el marketing internamente y la incorporaci\u00f3n de una CU centrada en el marketing. Participa en el hilo.  MIPs Actualizaci\u00f3n MIP#45  Varias CUs potenciales, junto con el MIP52, no pasaron sus encuestas de ratificaci\u00f3n.   Estado del Peg   DAI se mantiene ocasionalmente por encima de la prima con algunas operaciones grandes que generan deslizamientos, aunque el repunte de este fin de semana ha tra\u00eddo hitos bienvenidos.    La TVL supera los 10.000 millones con 5.500 millones de DAI en circulaci\u00f3n.    El volumen se situ\u00f3 en torno a los 1.980 millones de d\u00f3lares esta \u00faltima semana, liderado de nuevo por los DEX.    El DAI en L2 ha crecido de forma constante durante el \u00faltimo mes.

Parece que el cambio de las tasas de UNILP lleva al techo de deuda a su m\u00e1xima capacidad en un par de d\u00edas, justo sobre el 21-22 solo 20 millones de DAI acu\u00f1ados.     Los muros de liquidaci\u00f3n para todas las garant\u00edas se encuentran en una banda mucho m\u00e1s segura, en la que una ca\u00edda del 25% del precio de la garant\u00eda es el objetivo amenazante.     En general, la colateralizaci\u00f3n de la ETH-A est\u00e1 por encima del 300%, con la deuda media aumenta.    El mayor grupo de garant\u00eda de ETH-A es el 200%.   daistats.com | dai.descipher.io | makerburn.com | maker.blockanalitica.com  Comunidad  Tweet de la Semana https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1417626182875586563  Art\u00edculos   MakerDAO ha cerrado el c\u00edrculo *Un post de Rune detallando la disoluci\u00f3n de la Fundaci\u00f3n y el viaje de MakerDAO hacia la descentralizaci\u00f3n total.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Maker Wormhole The Protocol Engineering team is excited to introduce Maker Wormhole! This is a new module for transferring and minting Dai on different blockchains. Users can currently transfer Dai between Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Ethereum mainnet. Support for transfers across more L2s and minting on chains (besides the Ethereum mainnet) is coming soon! More details are available in the Forum Announcement and promotional video.  Annual profit tops 100MM; Surplus Buffer burns MKR MakerDAO\u2019s annual profit is now estimated at over $100MM, and the Surplus Buffer reached its capacity on November 14th, with 65.4 MKR burned thus far. Annual profits are calculated by MakerBurn and include annualized stability fees, liquidations, and fees from the Peg Stability Module (PSM) and Dai Savings Rate (DSR) minus Core Unit expenses. As the Surplus Buffer is explained on MakerBurn:  If all debt to the system were instantly repaid, a surplus of 60M DAI would remain. The surplus increases with time as fees on debt accrues, DAI enters/exits the PSM, and liquidations net a profit for the system. The system aims to keep a buffer of 60M, and when the surplus surpasses this buffer, the exceeding amount is used to buy back and burn MKR. Whenever the DAO has expenses, these are paid by pulling DAI from the surplus.   Peg Stability Module (PSM) fees set to 0% on PSM-USDC-A and PSM-USDP-A With the passage of the November 4th Executive, trading fees have effectively been eliminated on the USDC and USDP (formerly PAX) PSMs. Users still have to cover gas fees; this change lowers the Fee In (tin) to 0%. According to @rema of the Risk Core Unit,     Over 1 Billion less \"DAI\" per USDC    Celsius is even using PSM directly to acquire USDC, which is not surprising given that 3Pool on Curve, which has been the dominant and most important pool in terms of stablecoin price determination for quite some time now, has dai with a discount compare to USDC or USDT. Bascially dai is currently trading with a discount compared to USDC and USDT on the largest market, thus, PSM is the prefered vanue.      State of DAI  Peg866\u00d7624 89.8 KB   A little turbulence on the 11th, but the overall DAI price range is tighter this week.   Dai Supply1357\u00d7747 56.3 KB   The total supply took another nice leap this week, and the TVL is creeping its way to 20 billion. All this while USDC exposure continues to dip, now down around 12% in the past 30 days.     MKR burns are back on the menu!   VWAP1831\u00d7444 72.4 KB   Volume at around $990 million this last week. Average VWAP (Volume-Weighted-Average-Price) places Dai at $.999992.   Nov 11 Dex trades929\u00d7427 34.8 KB   The 11th was a big day for Dai, with over 473mil changing hands through Uniswap alone.

He asks the community where we want to set the Surplus Buffer and keep burning some profits. New vault-type for WBTC with a higher LR - Signal Closes November 19th - DAI minted from WBTC has recently been increasingly popular with the amount of DAI being tripled within the last month. A large market downturn on WBTC vaults running with a higher Liquidation Ratio is less likely to undergo liquidations, resulting in a loss for the protocol and the vault owner. In response, @ultraschuppi signals to the community, asking whether we should add a new WBTC-based vault type with a higher LR. Burn Baby Burn! [Burn The MKR Treasury] - Signal Closes November 26th - @aburban90 asks the community to burn half of MKR in the treasury and use the remainder to vest Core Units. Should We Mint New MKR for Protocol Expenses or Fund Them With MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury? - Signal Closes November 27th -  There is no clear indication about what should be the source of the MKR used for future expenses. @Patrick_J presents two options: Use MKR from the MakerDAO Treasury or Mint new MKR using the PauseProxy. Adjusting Dust Parameter (2021-4) - Signal Closes November 25th - With gas and ETH prices continuing to go up, our dust limits offer less protection against losses. In response, @monet-supply proposes whether we should increase dust limits for all Vault types.

Very cool initiative!    The stablecoin boom will not continue without decentralized interoperability  The article stresses the need for decentralized stable options as the DeFi landscape continues to grow.

Domain Teams  Smart Contracts The Base rate will remain unchanged this week at -2%, and Dark Spell is in a formal submission. There is an ongoing signal request to increase the USDC-A debt ceiling on the forum. There is a proposal to onboard the four members of the smart contracts domain team: Lucas, Brian, Chris, and Will.  Oracles There was a whitelisting proposal for TBTC on the ETH-BTC Oracle. They were whitelisted before, had a bug, and they fixed that. This proposal did pass.  We shut down Single Collateral DAI after warning people six months in advance, and after a healthy amount of time, we will be shutting the Oracles down as well.  OPYN sold \u2018put options\u2019 against ETH that don\u2019t expire until June 2021, and they have no way of changing which Oracle these use. Options are being discussed here.  Risk  Research for cUSD and cDAI  Collateral Evaluation LINK compiled by community risk analyst @williamr  Collateral Evaluation COMP  Both LINK and COMP are reasonably liquid and have conservative initial risk parameters in the analysis. It\u2019s up to Governance to determine the final parameters. COMP has high DEX volume, which bodes well for liquidations. More work is coming on a different rate-setting approach and understanding the current risk exposure of vaults. Ideally, this will help Governance know what users are doing with DAI before setting rates. There is an opportunity to pitch in and become a contributor to risk.  Current Events  Peg Stabilization  Expedited Executive Vote (09-14-2020) An Executive Vote has been expedited to help fix the Dai peg. As @LongForWisdom explains:    Expedited Executive Vote: 2020-09-14   \u2026an emergency signal request  was posted over the weekend and has resolved in favour of action. Given this outcome, an executive vote will go on-chain on Monday. However, for a number of reasons that are detailed below, the parameters included in the on-chain executive will not directly match those presented in the emergency signal poll.

Executive Vote Mitigating Flash Loan Risk (currently has 98,654.35 MKR in support): If this passes, the following will occur:  The GSM Pause Delay will be increased from 12 hours to 72 hours.  As per this forum thread, this change is being proposed to allow governance sufficient time to react to a governance attack on the Maker Protocol.   The Oracle Freeze Module will be deauthorized.  As per this forum thread, this change is being proposed to prevent the freezing of the Oracle price feed by an attacker using flash loans. This change will also prevent Maker Governance from freezing the oracle price feed without waiting for the GSM Pause Delay of 72 hours.   The Liquidations Circuit Breaker will be deauthorized.  As per this forum thread, this change is being proposed to prevent the freezing or unfreezing of vault liquidations by an attacker using flash loans.

Current Events  New Governance Portal Last week we introduced the new governance portal and shared one of the new features, Mobile Wallet Deep Linking. We\u2019ll be highlighting an awesome new feature every week.  Executive Hard Hat The way executive governance currently works, a proposal simply needs more MKR than the current \u201chat\u201d proposal (usually the most recent proposal to be executed) to pass. The danger comes when too many voters move from the current hat to a new proposal because that lowers the amount of MKR needed to pass something potentially malicious. To guard against this, the new gov portal has a \u201chard hat\u201d checkbox that allows voters to vote for both the hat and the new proposal at the same time. This helps keep the threshold needed to pass something from getting too low and protects the system.    https://i.imgur.com/gq12qMh.mp4    Flash Loans Flash Loans and securing the Maker Protocol forum post led to an executive vote, here.

Current Events  Societe Generale-Forge submits MIP6 Collateral Onboarding application European investment firm Societe Generale-Forge has submitted a MIP6 application to onboard OFH - tokenized bonds regulated under French law - as a new collateral type for the Maker Protocol. Societe Generale, a subsidiary of Societe Generale-Forge, is a French multinational investment bank with 1.78 trillion in assets (as of 2020). According to the proposal, the OFH tokens represent debt securities and \u201care issued by Societe Generale Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Financement de l\u2019Habitat (SG SFH), a specialised credit instritution duly licensed by the Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel.\u201d  6s Completes Successful Circuit Test of Funds @mrabino1 of 6s Capital reports successful completion of the circuit test to ensure a proper flow of funds between RWA Company and the Trust set up to manage those funds. 50,000 Dai were swapped for USD and sent to the Trust, $30,000 of which was returned and swapped back into Dai.  Does the DAO want a Market Maker? @YM_Wintermute has submitted a proposal to provide market-making services to MakerDAO. The proposal involves loaning 10,000 MKR to Wintermute Trading, who will either return the loan in full or provide 50 million USDC, representing a 100% premium to the current price.  Self-Insurance Fund @layerzero from Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit introduces SES Legal used for legal and regulatory topics and initiatives. He also announces their Self Insurance Fund, which will cover legal costs, economic damages to third parties and can be used as a legal reserve for obtaining a legal opinion or advice.

Last Week Offboarding USDT Collateral, Core Unit Budget Distributions - October 1, 2021 This executive proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  The USDT-A vault type was offboarded with the following details:  Lower the USDT-A Liquidation Penalty (chop) to 0%. Increase the USDT-A Liquidation Ratio from 150% to 300% to trigger liquidation of all remaining vaults. Liquidations will be enabled for USDT-A.   A total of 972,706 DAI was transfered upon proposal execution to the SES-001, DUX-001, SNE-001 and SH-001 core units as part of their initial DAI budgets.

This MKR is sourced from the MakerDAO treasury.    Community Deep Dai-ve  Tweet of the Week   twitter.com    powvt.eth @pow_vt  It's interesting how the Maker protocol is the only defi protocol which turns a profit. Some of the first to introduce token burns and create the ultra sound money idea. Been around since 2015 and seen it all. We are still very early. #MakerDAO #DeFi   4:26 PM - 29 Sep 2021        Forum Insight   Create an FEI PSM  @bpm6867 and @joey present their case to add FEI as an alternative PSM to further diversify DAI collateral with the addition of a decentralized USD stablecoin.    Maker and negotiations  @Planet_X opens the discussion with a detailed breakdown of the current Governance workflow, as well as ideas to streamline the process. He proposes a sequence of solutions by splitting up incoming proposals to help prevent binary offerings and automate the function of negotiation, leaving it up to the MKR holders on how badly they want the deal.

Last month, we saw a request from the community to speed up the parameter proposal process that had a healthy amount of support. As a result, our governance facilitators decided to expedite this month\u2019s proposed rate changes. However, some thought that we moved too fast, since the rate changes dramatically affect MakerDAO\u2019s cashflow and because there was not enough time for community feedback. Longforwisdom articulates his reasoning for expediting the changes. This brings to the forefront the issue of bundling multiple changes together in single Executive Votes as the DAO continues to refine the governance process. A possible remedy, of course, being the coming governance contract redesign.  Community Exploring PSM Alternatives To address the protocol\u2019s growing USDC exposure, Sam started a signal request and conversation about creating a high-leverage Vault using Gelato Network\u2019s tokenized Dai<>USDC fixed-range UNI v3 position, called G-UNI. G-UNI can generate yield while being used as collateral; Sam believes such a vault could attract a couple of billion in TVL, which will indirectly unwind the PSM as minted DAI is sold for USDC.  New MKR Compensation Guidelines Published Last month, Planet_X withdrew MIP53: The MKR Compensation Guidelines on behalf of the working group, citing a need to develop the proposal further. Following up, Aes and LongForWisdom published the Alternative MKR Compensation Guidelines which use a different approach focusing on domain groupings and revising the initial distributions based on them. In the meantime, some Core Units have already moved forward with budget proposals containing MKR compensation package details; see ORA\u2019s SP15, SES\u2019s SP17,.

Several Recognized Delegates have already posted their delegate platforms in the Maker Forum, and more will follow soon.  Fixed-Rate Vault Proposal Following the discussion proposing to include Institutional and Long-Term Vaults in the Maker Protocol, a proposal has been issued to implement fixed-rate vaults using Deco Protocol. As the proposal explains, the implementation would enable Vault owners to purchase \u201ca pure-yield token which earns a yield that offsets the entire stability fee on the vault.\u201d  Maker Foundation Transfers Social Media Channels to the Dai Foundation With the rise of Core Units and the Maker Foundations formally dissolving, MakerDAO tweeted that it will hand over its social media channels to appropriate Core Units following a community vote. In the meantime, the MakerDAO Twitter account, along with the Maker Blog, telegram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, will be used only for important messaging needs.

ETH Rally changes liquidation game1207\u00d7792 81.8 KB   With the ETH rally, liquidations only get hairy closer to a 30% price drop, with the larger risks being ETH-A.

As wallets roll out support across the space, we\u2019ll follow the average base fee, tips, and volatility to source relevant details to the largest vault type. Less ETH around will likely lead to more vaults, but time will tell.  daistats.com | makerburn.com | maker.blockanalitica.com   This Week in Governance  MIPs Weekly MIPs Update #48 Ratification Polls for formally submitted proposals went live Today, Monday 09, 16:00 UTC, and will run for two weeks until Monday, August 23.

New vault-type for YFI with a higher LR Based on the discussion from the Growth Core Unit Yearn would like to see a YFI-based vault-type similar to ETH-C with a higher Liquidation Ratio to get a lower Stability Fee. Should we add new PSMs? Starting the polling on whether we wanted to add any new PSMs for other stablecoins or not. Stablecoins specifically being polled include; BUSD, USDT, PAX, TUSD, and GUSD. Adjusting the dust parameter(2021-3) dust is the minimum permitted debt for a vault - you can learn more in the documentation here. Higher dust  values make vaults less accessible for smaller users and protect Maker from the risk of vaults being too small to liquidate profitably. There are separate polls for the ETH-C, ETH-B, and all other vault types, so make sure you read through all. Lower the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Liquidation Ratio     [Signal Request] Lower the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Liquidation Ratio   Now that we have liquidations-2.0 online, we get some flexibility with stable collaterals that previously needed larger buffers because they couldn\u2019t be liquidated. One such collateral that I think is a good candidate is UNIV2DAIUSDC-A.    Last Week Urgent Changes, Oracle Whitelisting, Liquidations 2.0 Activations Passed on May 31, 2021, 04:31 UTC. Available for execution on Jun 2, 2021, 04:31 UTC.  The PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling will increase from 2 billion DAI to 3 billion DAI. The Flat Kick Incentive tip will increase from 0 DAI to 300 DAI for all vault types with active liquidations. B.Protocol will be whitelisted on the WBTC OSM and Medianizer Oracles. The UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2ETHUSDT-A, UNIV2WBTCDAI-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2LINKETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, UNIV2AAVEETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDT-A vault types will be added to the Liquidations 2.0 framework   Updates  MIPs Weekly MIPS Update #38  Submission Highlight   The Updated MIP39c2-SP8: Governance Communications Core Unit Mandate, COM-001    GovAlpha   Weekly Update.

Optimism DAI bridge development continues. Check out Derek\u2019s post on Multi-chain/L2 solutions.   Oracles  Getting the remainder of LP Vaults onto Liquidations 2.0. Exploring pricing/monitoring for RWA collateral types. L2 solutions are coming online. We will need to look out for competitors, exploring oracle options there as well.   Risk  Made a few parameter proposals last week, higher dust limit and a signal work USDC PSM and a flat tip for kicking vaults. Adding Sushi LPs, looking into adding xSushi as collateral as well.   Real-World Finance  Centrifuge collaterals will be pushed back until the 18th. Posted new risk assessments: 6s & Farmland Partners.  Published paper on liquidity. Looking to onboard larger RWA types (50M DAI+) next year  @mrabino1 led an emphatic and informative speech about the RWA process for 6s capital, which has committed hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours towards an unknown outcome.   Growth  Weekly Update Talking with other L2 and L1 networks to get DAI on there, e.g., Polygon and Solana.

The monthly governance cycle has officially changed to a more accomodating setup. Instead of three rounds of voting, MIPs and Subproposals will go through individual two-week Ratification Polls. Check out the latest MIPs Update for a view of the updated calendar.  Global Debt Ceiling Reached  PSM Inflows1127\u00d7327 43 KB  Following accelerated growth in the PSM(), we\u2019re waiting on the global debt ceiling raise that just passed to free up more DAI generation. Due to the \u201coffice-hours\u201d modifier, an execution delay that ensures keepers will be present when the Executive goes live, the update is eligible for execution tomorrow, June 2, at 14:00 UTC.  Protocol Engineering Affirms Commitment to Multichain Strategy Derek Flossman, of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit, posted a thread outlining the multichain landscape as their team sees it now, Maker\u2019s unique opportunities and challenges, and a proposed roadmap for community discussion.  State of the Peg  Peg1172\u00d780 18.4 KB   DAI peg super stable this week.    Pretty tight band for the DAI price.   Dai Supply1360\u00d7611 50.5 KB   DAI Supply is still awaiting a global DC increase. Currently capped at 4.6 billion.    PSM inflow on 5-29 was 203 million.   708\u00d7411 26.1 KB   USDC is eating quite the share in Curve, likely accompanying the PSM raise.   884\u00d7909 125 KB   872\u00d7912 115 KB  USDC PSM has officially flippened ETH for the time being.

ETH-B vaults have the largest bucket at risk since the biggest vault has a 140% collateralization ratio.    Liquidation walls kick in significantly for ETH-B & C and WBTC at 15% drawdown. I guess it would be fitting if there is a NgU conference that number go down.

Liquidation System Upgrade Liquidation 1.2 is in progress, with a lengthy discussion from Thursday August 20th\u2019s Governance and Risk call. As @charlesstlouis explains:    Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)   With the amount of Dai outstanding in the Maker Protocol, if there were a price crash, there would not be enough liquidity available to manage a large amount of auctions properly. In this case, the circuit breaker is not the right solution as it is subject to the system delay in addition to other complications. The Liquidations 1.2 Upgrade will allow Maker Governance to control the total amount of Dai that can be in auction at any one time.      Liquidations System 1.2 Upgrade (Timeline)   Note that this was postponed for the time being so that the smart contracts team has time to write more tests before it is put to an executive vote.

Including Real World Assets (RWA) in the Maker Protocol @g_dip explains:    Initial Thoughts and Questions for Including Real World Assets in the Maker Protocol   For the past year, the Maker Foundation has been researching and experimenting how to generate additional value from the Maker Protocol by providing collateral which does not originate on the blockchain. This post intends to kick-off discussions on including \u201creal world assets\u201d (\u201cRWA\u201d) in the Maker Protocol and highlight questions we believe projects should consider if they are interested in seeing these assets on-boarded.

Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Governance  Polls Some Polls use instant run-off so you can select multiple options and ranked-choices will be prioritized.

ENJ KNC LEND LINK MATIC PAXG WKT   MIPs Updates There are no new MIP-related votes or polls this week, as the July Governance Cycle will launch the following week. The June MIPs proposal Executive vote, ratifying a bundle of proposals, was passed.

Want to refresh your voting knowledge? Check out our voter onboarding guide!  Domain Teams  Smart Contracts Team  Small bug in the Flopper Contract  A small bug was discovered in the flopper contract. We have also realized that the three different auction contracts: the flip, flop, and flap (or collateral, debt, and surplus auctions) require double liquidity when interacting with them in certain cases. It has been already fixed, tested, and formally verified. We plan on fixing those in the next governance cycle, deploying new versions of all of these contracts.   Impact  This is a change that impacts everybody running a keeper or Maker protocol UI (E.g., DeFi Saver). The only impact is that the interface needs to point to a new smart contract. Nothing in the interface changes. This is not an emergency but an upgrade.   Working groups  Vault Compensation Analysis Team The self-organized group led by Monet_Supply and MakerMan have released a Vault Compensation Plan Proposal for Governance discussion.  The extensive plan addresses possible ways of compensating victims of both zero-bid auctions, and sub-optimal self-liquidated vaults around the period of Black Thursday. It includes 5 phases (zero through four) and includes calculations, examples, and indicates what steps MKR holders need to agree upon to move this forward.  5-phase Plan936\u00d7338 35.3 KB     More information  Compensation Plan Document MakerDAO Vault Compensation Plan Presentation   State of the Peg  DAI price remains just slightly above peg, trading at $1.002.

Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Real-World Finance Hosts AMA in Maker Forum The Real-World Finance (RWF) team announced an AMA addressing questions on the development of RWF and the onboarding of Real-World Assets as collateral in the Maker Protocol. Check out the thread to learn more about the team\u2019s strategy on developing RWF and ask any questions you might have for the team.  Offboarding Collateral Types Offboarding unprofitable collaterals has been discussed and led to a poll to offboard the Kyber Network token (KNC). There is also a discussion about offboarding USDT as a collateral type. Additionally, a signal request asks for community input on collateral types we should consider to offboard.  Exploring Risk and USDC The SEC investigation into Coinbase has raised concerns in the Forum. The investigation targets Coinbase\u2019s plan to release a \u2018Lend\u2019 feature on their platform. @PaperImperium asks whether or not MakerDAO should engage legal representation.

Available for execution on Jan 27, 2021, 01:02 UTC. UNI-V2-USDC-ETH-A vault type will be added. UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH-A vault type will be added. LINK-A Debt Ceiling increased from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI. MANA-A Debt Ceiling increased from 250 thousand DAI to 1 million DAI. PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling increased from 30 million DAI to 80 Million DAI. PSM-USDC-A Debt Ceiling increased linearly from 80 million DAI to 500 Million DAI over the next 12 weeks. BAT-A Debt Ceiling decreased from 10 million DAI to 2 million DAI. TUSD-A Debt Ceiling decreased from 135 million DAI to zero DAI. Global System Debt Ceiling decreased by 126,250,000 DAI. The dust parameter was increased from 500 DAI to 2000 DAI. Instadapp is now whitelisted on the ETHUSD OSM Oracle. DAI will be transferred from the Maker Protocol to MakerMan, Monet-Supply, Joshua P, Befitsandpiper, and Vault 2288 for services rendered as the vault compensation working group.  Signal Requests Adjust ETH-A Debt Ceiling (2021-03)  Since the last urgency exec raising the DC of ETH-A to 1000 MM, almost 65M of DAI-from-ETH-A were created (within 3 days), this is to decide if the community would like to raise the debt ceiling once more.  New vault-type for ETH with a higher LR  Proposes the idea of creating a new vault-type for ETH with a higher Liquidation Ratio, which will highly reduce the risk of the protocol losing money on liquidations, while on the other hand offering lower Stability Fees for people who want to stay heavily overcollateralized.  Check out the community curated Governance Tools Resource for system status links, Dai stability, collateral/liquidations, protocol analytics, auctions, and some of the history of governance. Updates MIPs Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign  This MIP defines DssGov, a contract replacement for DSChief that comes with improved security, usability, and functionality for holders of the Maker governance token (MKR).    MIP31: Active Reserve AMM (dss-ara)  A technical proposal for an active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract.    MIP32: Peg Stability Module for Compound Mixed Exposure  Provides an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via dai using cdai. It also converts USDC to cUSDC using the same join adaptor (lending join).    MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module  The Keg is a tool for streaming ERC20 DAI to a preset group of addresses from out of the Surplus Buffer.    MIP37: Static Reserve For Governance  Defines a static reserve that can receive any tokens from anyone as any contract and allows Maker Governance to withdraw them.    MIP38: DAO Primitives State  DAO Primitives State is a MIP that contains all the status related to Core Units, Budgets, and Facilitators.    MIP39: Core Unit Framework  Contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP40: Budget Framework  Contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP41: Facilitator Framework  Contains a framework with subproposal processes for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.    MIP42: Proposed Compensation Addendum for MakerDAO Contributors  Proposes to pay contributors partially in time-locked MKR to increase value returned to contributors and directly align their interests with those of MakerDAO.    MIP43: Term Lending Module (TLM)  Proposes an integration with Yield Protocol. Authors Allan and Alberto are employees of Yield, Inc., a company working to build Yield Protocol. Lev is an advisor to Yield, Inc.    Sub-Proposals in the Request-For-Comments phase include:   MIP13c3-SP9: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol (Declaration of Intent)  An experiment is proposed for a native integration between B.Protocol and the MakerDAO system, by on-boarding a new collateral type, namely WBTC-B or ETH-C, with lower CR than WBTC-A or ETH-B (respectively), which will be natively backed by a strong commitment from B.Protocol backstop.    MIP4c2-SP10: MIP0 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP0 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Domain Framework MIP set.  The main difference is that it removes the inbuilt functionality of MIP0 to onboard core personnel. Instead, it uses the DAO Primitives State to determine who have been onboarded as Governance Facilitators by Maker Governance and then introduces logic that allows Governance Facilitators to designate MIP Editors.    MIP4c2-SP11: MIP5 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP5 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set. The main change is to the Governance Facilitator Emergency Vote process, which directly deals with onboarding and offboarding Facilitators.    MIP4c2-SP12: MIP16 Amendments  Proposes edits to MIP16 that make it compatible with the newly proposed Core Unit Operating Model MIP set.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Team Updates  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  Governance Holiday Break Announcement GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator @LongForWisdom has announced the winter holiday schedule for non-emergency governance processes. Coverage will be normal until the week of December 13th, when non-emergency Executive Votes will be paused, meaning the last Executive will likely take place on December 10th. The final Maker Relay of the year will be published on December 13th as well. The last Governance and Risk call of the year will take place the following week on December 16th.  Harbor makes the world\u2019s largest trade finance transaction funded with a stablecoin in its initial use of a MakerDAO credit line MakerDAO\u2019s Real-World Finance Core Unit is excited to welcome Harbor (HTC-DROP) as the fourth active Real-World Asset. Harbor borrowed 2MM Dai and currently has a debt ceiling of 7MM. According to Harbor, this represents the world\u2019s largest trade finance transaction funded with a stablecoin.  October 2021 Update MIP6 Application Collateral Onboarding Protocol Engineering Assessment Collateral Onboarding Risk Assessment Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment   Dai trades at a premium in Argentina Pointed out in CryptoPotato and confirmed by the Maker Relay team, Argentinians who want to buy Dai with Pesos are paying a significant premium for their purchases. The Argentinian government limited the number of US Dollars citizens can purchase with pesos to $200 a month in September 2020. Limiting the number of US dollars that can be purchased makes stablecoins like Dai more attractive. A lot more attractive. Argentinians purchasing Dai with dollars are paying between $1.05 and 1.12 at the time of writing; those purchasing Dai with pesos are paying anywhere from 207.80 to 250.18 pesos for Dai compared with ~100 Argentinian pesos to convert to US dollars.

He provides proposed tick ranges and asks the community whether they want to onboard a G-UNI DAI/USDC 0.01% pool. One-time Payment to COM-001 to Cover Missing DssVest Funds - Signal Closes November 26th - The original DSSVest stream for the Governance Communications Core Unit was configured incorrectly, resulting in an unclaimed 39,300 Dai. Initially, the team believed they could slide through their 4-month stream period using the buffer and other savings. However, legal services and additional expenses recently arose, which pushed @Davidutro to formally ask the community whether they support a one-off governance request for a one-time payment of 27,058.33 Dai. Burn Baby Burn! [Burn The MKR Treasury] - Signal Closes November 26th - @aburban90 asks the community to burn half of MKR in the treasury and use the remainder to vest Core Units.

Adjusting Dust Parameter - Signal Closes November 25th - With gas and ETH prices continuing to go up, our dust limits offer less protection against losses. In response, @monet-supply proposes whether we should increase dust limits for all Vault types.

This week, Josh Levine highlights another awesome feature, On-Chain effects.  On-Chain Effects Proposals can be complex \u2013  stability fees, dust limits, debt ceilings, DSR, etc., are liable to be changed within a single proposal. Because of that, it hasn\u2019t always been easy to audit what changes have resulted from past proposals and what changes would result if new proposals were to pass. The On-Chain effects tab shows the precise, smart contract state changes that, if already passed, resulted from the execution of the proposal, and if not already passed, would result from it passing. A community member, Destiner, created Catflip with a \u201cchangelog\u201d that showed past proposals and what they changed. His project laid some of the conceptual groundwork for this feature.

The goal for raising the tin to 20 bps has been met, and there is no reason to favor inflows to a PSM that is nearly at capacity. And due to this lack of capacity in the USDP PSM, it is time to equalize PSMs tin fee. In response, @PaperImperium signals to the community whether both USDC-PSM and USDP-PSM tin should be set to 10 bps. [Signal Request][P1-DROP] Change of covenants for P1-DROP (farmlands) - Signal Closes November 10th - @SebVentures from RWF presents an update for P1-DROP and requests to increase their acquisition price to $2.85M which would provide MakerDAO exposure of 2M per farm. The expected Debt Ceiling is 20M, and the TIN+equity tranche would be 8.5M. In addition, the signal requests to add Arkansas as a possible state. [Signal Request] Should we increase Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144k DAI for the initial three-month delegate compensation trial? - Signal Closes November 04th - In response to previous signals and discussion, @LongForWisdom proposes a higher compensation for Delegates and asks the community whether we should increase the Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144,000 DAI for the initial three-month Delegate compensation trial? MIP 55 Signal Request - RealDAO SPF (to make Moloch-based SPV\u2019s) - Signal Closes November 11th - @jameskmccall from RWF presents a detailed MIP55 signal request to the community for support in their RealDAO Special Purpose Fund. The RealDAO SPF is a unique approach to express a willingness to experiment with other ways to handle Real-World Assets. The RWF Core Unit asks whether MakerDAO would signal a 50,000 DAI SPF (with conditions) to build a decentralized SPV infrastructure. [Signal Request] Offboarding MATIC, COMP, AAVE, and BAL - Signal Closes November 08th - MATIC, COMP, BAL, and AAVE vaults have shown poor performance and difficulty covering Oracle gas-costs (with addition to other issues presented in the post,) @NikKunkel from Oracles Core Unit signals to offboard these vaults. [Signal Request] Increase The MakerDAO NS-DROP maximum to 85% when AO TIN participation is at least 50% - Signal Closes November 04th - The New Silver AO pool on Tinlake has been live for ten months and approved as the first RWA with MakerDAO for six months. Therefore, given the seniority of the MakerDAO debt and many other protections, including borrowers\u2019 equity on every loan, we hope the community would consider adjusting the maximum share of DROP tokens that the DAO is holding. @prankstr25 is asking the community whether we MakerDAO should increase its\u2019 maximum share of NS-DROP to 85% when AO TIN participation is at least 50%  Last Week Aave D3M Onboarding and Core Unit Budget Transfers  The executive on October 29th passed on October 31st, 2021 09:31 GMT-4 and is available for execution on November 2nd, 2021, 10:00 GMT-4.

This is a result of research work including expert interviews, team surveys, desk research & data benchmarks with valuable contributions from across the industry. GovAlpha Budget Return - GovAlpha is ready to return our unused DAI budget. They published a post to document the return of 218,059.10 DAI to the Pause Proxy. These funds have accumulated through over-budgeting, and the GovAlpha team has contacted @Makerburn to aid with the UI accounting of these actions. GovAlpha intends to continue the process of reviewing and returning unused funds at the end of our budget period. [WBTC-B] and [WBTC-BProt-A]: Review and Plan of Action - Recent forum discussions imply a bullish market outlook and a consequent increased demand for DAI minting, suggesting that several parameter changes and vault upgrades may be necessary. The Risk Core Unit believes that the time is right to introduce a WBTC-B vault with a lower liquidation ratio, which will help absorb the increased demand for WBTC capital and generate more DAI. In addition, the Risk Core Unit believes that we should also onboard the WBTC-BProt-A vault supported by the community. These vaults can be worked on in tandem.
