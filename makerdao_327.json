Burn half Use the remainder to vest core units   Bump surplus buffer to 130M Big burn makes everyone happy!      Overview There\u2019s been a lot of back and forth about whether or not we should raise the Surplus Buffer or focus on restarting the MKR burn. Personally, I see both sides. We need a higher Surplus Buffer to fund development, operations, etc., and to cover (a sliver of) any black swans that may come up. On the other hand, we should be burning, especially while MKR is dirt cheap, and the burn can be more effective. The debate about all of this, though, has gotten to be pretty heated, but it\u2019s silly and unnecessarily divisive. We can have the best of both worlds\u2026 today!   The Signal Request Let\u2019s burn the MKR in the treasury! There\u2019s about 84k MKR in the treasury, generously given to us by the foundation. We\u2019ve used zero of it. We should burn half and use the remainder to vest core units. At the same time, we can bump the Surplus Buffer to 130M!  Pros & Cons  Cons  By burning MKR from the treasury, we\u2019re not actually burning revenue and taking MKR off the market. Since we can mint MKR at will, it\u2019s technically a net-neutral action.  The reality is, though, we\u2019ll likely never mint MKR to fund anything, but we may spend the MKR in the treasury to fund things. Burning that MKR ensures we\u2019ll never spend it and the true supply is reduced.     Pros  Have our cake and eat it too! Reduce the supply of MKR   Our supply on Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, etc., will update too!   We can still raise the Surplus Buffer Make everyone happy!     Burn Baby Burn!      Burn the MKR in the treasury? (Select all that apply)  Burn Half (42k MKR) Burn a Quarter (21k MKR) Burn (Some other amount) No (Why would you even propose this? ) Abstain     0 voters        Re-Run @ultraschuppi\u2019s Surplus Buffer Signal Request?  Yes!   No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will close on Friday, November 26. If the majority wants to burn some of the MKR in the treasury, we should settle on how much exactly to burn. Also, it would make sense to re-run @ultraschuppi\u2019s Signal Request to increase the Surplus Buffer with this new idea in mind. ",

                    "content": "@spidomo I think the reason behind Burban\u2019s timely suggestion is two-fold. First, we are not doing much with the treasury, aside from allocating a small amount for CU MKR vesting, and have no foreseeable plans to do so. Second, with the debate about buy/burn and increasing the SB, why not burn a portion of the MKR already in the till gathering dust? Burning half or a quarter of the treasury will permanently remove that amount from circulation, thereby lowering the \u201ccirculating supply\u201d (note: CMC and other trackers will change the circulating supply for MKR). We underestimate the positive psychological impact on the market of seeing the MKR supply go down by 42,000 or even 21,000. Given the debate on burning v increasing the SB, why not burn part of the treasury, get the SB to a more comfortable amount (130mm, perhaps) and wait for the next burn to occur with flaps at some point in the not-too-distant future? I see no downside in a \u201cBurban Burn,\u201d notwithstanding Mooney\u2019s statement about legal/reg concerns, and only regulatory positives from having a larger SB. As a counterpoint \u2013 having the DAO mint and sell MKR on the market strikes me as more concerning behavior from a legal/regulatory perspective than a relatively small one-off burn of the treasury.

Burning MKR from with excessive income when the SB is full, I think it is much more effective because it takes away the actual supply in the market.for that, the burner has to burn for as long as possible Actually you have a really good point it doesnt make much sense when we are sitting on 84k MKR and increase the SB way over 100M to prevent a \u201cblack swan\u201d event. Because we have this security against failure, I would just raise the SB a little or keep it short term at 60M and let the Bruner do the work for the current price! I would continue to use those MKR for CU MKR vesting, or put them into \u201cwork\u201d.

What if we did OTC trade on the DAO level ie. exchange MKR for AAVE. This should align both parties together long term.     makercaesar:  So we would sell for a lower price fill up the SB and burn for probably for a higher price, the causality makes no sense to me, particularly when we are now net profit and self sustaining, we could fill up the SB with regular income.   TBH I am pretty sold on the idea of stopping the burn and replacing it with a better version of the Sagittarius engine. ",

                    "content": "A relevant piece written by Hasu and @monet-supply: A New Mental Model for Defi Treasuries. This is just a breakdown of some relevant snippets. The full article has all the meat and charts. Hasu argues that padding a DAO Treasury with a native token like MKR, UNI, and COMP is superficial and often disingenuous. While they may be financial resources, it\u2019s stressed that counting them as assets on their balance sheets does more harm than good. While there\u2019s no 1:1 comparison with any Tradfi vehicle, there are some primitive guidelines.  \" The float (all shares available for public trading) and restricted shares (employee shares that are currently vesting) together make up a company\u2019s outstanding shares.\".   \u201cThese outstanding shares are a subset of authorized shares \u2013 a self-imposed soft cap on total issuance. Crucially, shares that have been authorized but not issued are not counted to the company\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d  The article then breaks down five treasuries (Maker, Lido, Aave, Compound, Sushiswap, and Uniswap) into three categories:  stablecoins blue chip crypto assets and other non-stable crypto assets  When viewed through this lens, Uniswap has ~0 assets in its treasury, and only Maker and Lido have a total greater than $50mil. The Black Thursday event is used as an example of the need to reevaluate the handling of DAO treasuries. The end result for Maker was $6 mil in credit losses, erasing three years - or $10mil - in accumulated earnings. The article argues that the losses could have been mitigated or avoided entirely if more of the treasury was composed of stable assets like Dai. The 500,000 MKR held in the treasury that day represented only a .35% capital buffer covering $140 mil in loans, whereas most traditional financial institutes maintain at least a 3-4% risk capital buffer. It then proposes six rules to better manage large Defi treasuries, but I think I\u2019ve probably already bored everyone enough. The full article is definitely worth a read. @krzkaczor Accidentally direct replied rather than post to the Ether - but fully agree with your proposed options. ",
