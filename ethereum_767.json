He\u2019s simply stating the obvious fact that the Magicians are merely a minor force within a much broader community. I share his perspective, so let me add a few more remarks. In terms of population size and publicly-perceived legitimacy, I believe the Magicians fall somewhere between the core devs and non-core devs (with some overlap in-between). They seem like a decent civil-minded and technically-oriented forum for the \u201cdevelopment community\u201d. However, it should come as no surprise that the devs (and those in auxiliary roles to the devs) are not the totality of the community. The broader Ethereum community of stakeholders also includes users, students, researchers, miners, validators, state actors, organizations, enterprises, business owners, investors, traders, holders, and countless other groups. Basically, anyone who sacrifices their time, energy, or capital for Ethereum is a stakeholder, in my opinion. That point aside, I actually think Ethereum has an absolutely massive global scope. I see it impacting potentially millions to billions of people who have no obvious share, interest, or voice in the present community and ecosystem. They deserve and require representation as well. For this reason alone, I prefer using the far more neutral and inclusive term \u201cpublic interest\u201d or \u201cglobal community\u201d; foregoing \u201cstakeholders\u201d entirely, as it implies a rather narrow subset of vested interests. I\u2019m very much against reinforcing the prejudices of certain groups over others. The above is largely why I don\u2019t participate with the Magicians. I don\u2019t think your beliefs, values, and norms are a good proxy for the true global scope of the community. The same could be said for all the back channels around the development community. The devs are a specialized class and they tend to their own unique group mentality. I believe it\u2019s for the best that the community at large keeps a healthy distance from most of you. They require the autonomy to form their own independent standpoints; and yes, even clash with the developers where necessary. The last thing we want is a lazy community that just follows the devs blindly off a cliff; and vice versa. Some spirited conflict here is inevitable. ",

I think I \u201cknow\u201d Scott relatively well and get what he was saying, it was just a useful springboard that got me thinking about how participants here self-identify. \u201cknow\u201d in the sense that I\u2019ve interacted with him a fair bit online     Introspectre:  I believe the Magicians fall somewhere between the core devs and non-core devs (with some overlap in-between). They seem like a decent civil-minded and technically-oriented forum for the \u201cdevelopment community\u201d.   Great useful description. The legitimacy part is interesting \u2013 I know that Greg intended this to be in part what it has become \u2013 the long form discussion forum to accompany technical issues around protocol governance from the EIPs process.     Introspectre:  I don\u2019t think your beliefs, values, and norms are a good proxy for the true global scope of the community.   I don\u2019t actually know what these are  One of the tenets here is people participate as individuals AND that no one speaks \u201cfor\u201d the Magicians \u2026 because there is no organization to speak for. People take on certain roles or may have control over some assets \u2013 eg. I have been Lead Organizer of some events, and I\u2019m one of the sigs on the multi-sig wallet as part of Operations. I do think there are a lot of open source developers here, and there tend to be more implementors shipping various Ethereum adjacent applications (e.g. wallets) or dapps and smart contracts \u2013 whereas core client developers work mostly on the core infra and don\u2019t build stuff for end users. So many of the participants here are development \u201cconsumers\u201d of the protocol. OK, so maybe I could say that my belief is that standards work and protocol governance is one of the beliefs/values/norms here, as well as a platform for open source \u201cstyle\u201d collaboration and cooperation. The big take away I have from various recent discussions is whether \u201csomeone\u201d should do active outreach. The request seems to be \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear who should do this or how they would be compensated. Do you think people with shared interested from the global community should self-organize to participate in governance directly? Whose responsibility do you think it is to solicit representation from the global community? ",

I believe the Ethereum protocol and ecosystem should be subject to a global decentralized democratic process, which is admittedly impossible currently due to the identity bottleneck. However, I can foresee a time when this will be achievable, e.g. when we have a reliable mesh of interoperable DAOs with the right kind of popular appeal and political culture to support collective network intelligence at scale.  Whose responsibility do you think it is to solicit representation from the global community?  I don\u2019t know if we need representation actually. I haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility of a direct democratic system or other emergent grassroots governance scheme. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anyone\u2019s responsibility to solicit political leadership. I\u2019d argue that\u2019s more or less contrary to the goals of decentralization. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think the Magicians are a bad influence.

It does not seem like a place which really welcomes much discussion about Ethereum as an social / economic network, or ETH as an economic asset- topics many in the community care about.  Instead, that discussion occurs in poorly coordinated and noisy ways on forums like Reddit and Twitter.  There are many dapp developers and investors, who focus on these dynamics and feel they are critical for Ethereum advocacy and adoption.

Regarding this Forum, and EthMagicians in general. It is one of the useful places to have discussions, technical or not. Though, as with any other big places, it feels like it only has one lobby, and it creates the first impression. Ideally, what you would want is for people to be able to start discussions spontaneously, attract enough people, and then gradually structure them into movements and sub-movements. We are not there yet technologically and financially. Perhaps something like virtual reality combined with instant conferencing abilities would work, but it requires lots of work and money. So far we have a web site and a few volunteers that are trying to host discussions. We should be grateful to them. ",
