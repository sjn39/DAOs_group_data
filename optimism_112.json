Same steps will happen for Phase 1 projects when voting will end for Phase 1. Similar to Phase 0 proposals, I have gone through all the Phase 1 Proposals, I have followed them, suggested them something and learned something from them. Now, I will cast my vote and would like to know how the project(s) are spending those token given to them. Some are saying I can follow the token recipient address on-chain (here I can only see the amount and address, what I want to know is whether the amount was given for Dev/Marketing/integration and so on\u2026)while other are giving privacy reason (valid reason)as not to share the spending data. Why I want to know:-  As a delegate, I am passionate about this gov model and I want support this ecosystem but I need tools, this data is the tool,  I trust data more than words It will help me in making better decision. We can see and learn from them. If same project is submitting another proposal, their past data will help us decision making. Without accountability, there are chances that fund might not be used at right places. This will help me become a better delegate, with data to support my judgement call, I will learn from them and use them as tool to make better judgement call.  If projects(s) are not willing to share he data directly to me, will they share it with OP Team and they can anonymize and share it with us. I want to know your opinion  and team opinion on this. ",

For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application. For marketing and content creation (for example 80% Marketing proposal of Kromatika Proposal): - This depends on content creator(s), if they are willing to make their address public then the project can share otherwise sharing address is against privacy. But then in this case, at least they can share the content that was created, and the token distributed. For airdrop and incentive for LP, they dont need to share the addresses as the number will be huge but here, I am thinking about a dashboard (Dune may be) where I can filter the data on weekly/monthly time frame. For Development Budget (such as  candide wallet ):- Again, it depends on individual developer if s/he is willing to share their address otherwise the project team need to share their combined monthly overall spending. There are many proposal that falls under those category, I am using those names as I was actively involved there. What do you think? How can be get collect the data without compromising privacy ? ",

I think the best would be having projects keep basic records and provide a quarterly update on the usage of the funds, either to delegators or the Optimism team to allow some accountability on the usage of funds and ensuring they are actually used! Edit: Another thing I just thought of is projects depending on how they are setup and where they are based may be liable to pay tax on any funds they receive. This could be up to 50% depending on the country, meaning projects when asking say 1,000,000 OP may only be getting 500,000 OP as an example. ",

I think in this regard we should work out a system that allows the protocols to be transparent with us and not require us to do so much work to verify that the funds have been spent correctly. In an extreme case designate a work unit for this particular issue that tracks all the protocols and submits a weekly, monthly or quarterly report on how the protocols are spending the $OP tokens correctly. I also believe that instead of sending the total amount of tokens in a single transaction, is to ask in the next phases that the protocols provide a payment plan by goals or dates and gradually release the funds. This taking into account that: 1. Tokens can be stolen from your treasury by a hack, carpet or exploit. 2. The protocol can misuse the funds and in that case cut off the supply of $OP tokens. 3. The protocol may be delayed with development or even abandoned (Applies to protocols that are under development). 4. Protocols where funds have to be approved by their DAO, may vote on a proposal that is not aligned with the Optimism Vision. For point 4 in particular, I think that protocols that rely on the DAO for the use of tokens, we should establish that the proposal must first be approved by their DAO and then request the phases in Optimism. These are just some ideas, I think it would be wise to take some time to think and come up with better systems for the next phases. Let\u2019s keep in mind that the ecosystem is intended for the long term, there is no need to consult the Governance Fund quickly. ",

There\u2019s multiple ways we can do that, and I echo @lefterisjp in that the work done in each area (dev, marketing, incentives) is what should be tracked. As a collective, we want projects to succeed and achieve the Optimism grant goals. That\u2019s why I also suggest that each project that receives a grant can ask for a delegate to become their advisor, specifically for the grant they are asking. The delegate will be able help the project grow and achieves its goals that was stated in the grant proposal. The delegates will also offer advise on transparency and can act as link between the grantee and the voters. Ongoing communication is the key to the success of any project. How we setup delegates as advisors for projects is up for a discussion and I would love to see this coming for phase 0 and phase 1 projects. ",

Generally speaking, I think there should be some public company wallet(s) that shows the flow of tokens received from Optimism. That can be easily tracked with something like zapper.fi, though as mentioned, this doesn\u2019t necessarily show what the tokens are being used for. A quarterly or semi-annual report seems reasonable to me. The team can communicate how many tokens have been allocated and what they have to show for the particular areas of spending. Of course this can be checked against the public wallet(s) to verify it is all valid. This report can be a public release or limited to some group of Optimism representatives that can validate the claims. It should be pretty easy to check and see if the goals are generally being achieved, even without a formal report. Ideally teams should be encouraged to have some sort of public dashboard to track whatever metrics are relevant to their project. Speaking as a new project that isn\u2019t very well known yet, we are ready to prove ourselves and we are trying to figure out the best way to unlock funds as we verifiably achieve our goals. I would personally like to have some representative or group of representatives from Optimism that have the ability to unlock those funds via a multi-sig. This way, once we have achieved the outlined goals, we could initiate a transaction, notify the representatives, and only if verified that transaction would be approved, sending those tokens into our team wallet. It would be ideal to have multiple representatives that can sign off on a transaction to avoid a situation that could infinitely lock up the tokens. Another option for verifying outcomes might be to use something like kleros court (https://court.kleros.io/), especially if a team is applying for repeat funding. They would submit whatever evidence was sufficient to prove the previous amount was appropriately spent and outlined goals were achieved, then a decentralized jury would approve or reject the claims. To my knowledge, this isn\u2019t on Optimism, though, so probably not a the best option at this point. ",

Take for instance the idea of quarterly reports. Some of the largest recipients (Aave, Lido, etc) are already doing similar, and can easily provide regular updates of what the project as a whole is doing, but without explaining how the RPG funding is being used or being held to account separately for their RPG funding. It feels like we would then require pretty detailed scrutiny of their abundance of reporting material to give feedback on what our community need from them\u2026 and how could we criticise them when they\u2019re already providing so much? It\u2019s in the project\u2019s interests to just keep slowly giving us nuggets of information we request, and otherwise keep pumping out the same reports they\u2019re providing for every chain, to keep costs down. And then is the idea that every delegate must keep track of this feedback and scrutiny, and bare it all in mind for the next proposal? That\u2019s a lot of extra work on all sides. On the flip side, imagine asking for quarterly reports from the small project providing a valuable service on Optimism only that\u2019s difficult to monetise other than for RPG funding. Setting a prescriptive reporting standard may mean that they\u2019re draining a decent chunk of their funding just on the cost of reporting. Or accepting that reporting could scale with the organisation, the little project may really only be able to say \u201chere are our current financials and stats, all of our funding comes from RPG funding\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, then would we just accept a dashboard page on their site that shows the current state of their operations and finances? And if so, what\u2019s to stop bigger projects taking the same approach? It feels like we may get so bogged down in figuring out the correct approach to accountability that we lose sight of the bigger picture - the little project doesn\u2019t need much and is doing important things, so we don\u2019t really need much accountability from it. The synthesis that I\u2019m reaching is that the larger and more complicated our approach to accountability becomes, the more it\u2019s likely to damage the effectiveness of our RPG funding program. Some accountability may be of benefit, but we should aim for this to be flexible and accommodating to the needs of the recipient. We should also aim to make it manageable and easily digestible for our delegates, to keep the funding process light and accessible. Perhaps I\u2019d suggest to start with that projects need to give feedback on their use of funds already received before they can receive more funds\u2026 that at least provides an incentive to give good feedback.

I am just seeing this post now; after I posted the initial draft for Saddle Finance - but actuallly had similar thoughts as you @OPUser which is why I linked to the Gnosis Safe Wallet Address that Saddle will be using on Optimism so anyone viewing the proposal and simply click and immediately see the address on-chain. I think all submissions should really have this be a requirement as part of the template. In addition - the address was one I created with my public wallet/ENS: westonnelson.eth to further increase confidence in this regard. If you copy/paste the address into the web app of Gnosis Safe at (it works on mobile, but the Desktop web app is what you want to use) you can actually easily see the address, confirm that it is in fact a 4/7 Multisig, and in settings, who the addresses that are the owners on the Safe with signing capability are! This is something I think hopefully should be helpful and perhaps a best practice for teams to be considered. So as an example; even not as an owner, you can still view and verify this information about the Safe, which is excellent. In Saddle\u2019s case it looks like this:  Screenshot_20220701-124522_Brave1080\u00d71194 132 KB  **And this can be accessed by you (or anyone) by heading to the URL:    gnosis-safe.io    Gnosis Safe Gnosis Safe is the most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum      As far as on-going tracking\u2026 I think as someone mentioned, this could quickly become overwhelming to the point where it would just feel like too much for anyone\u2026 so I did have an idea though here: To actually create a small database of sorts (all the addresses that Optimism/Delegates have sent $OP to etc.) And then add them into Forta and subscribe to alerts about activity (which you can customize) so you can be kept up to date essentially real-time with the wallet activity. It\u2019s one of the tools I use myself and so firsthand highly recommend it. Cheers! Weston ",
