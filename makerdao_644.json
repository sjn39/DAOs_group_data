Based on the recent goings on regarding flash loans, and the general concern over the risk of governance attack it seems likely that we are going to put an executive proposal to activate the GSM on-chain on Friday. Once the GSM executive goes live on Friday we need to make sure that it is activated as quickly as possible in order to minimise the risk of governance attack. In the meantime, in order to defend against a possible governance attack, consider moving your MKR to the  \u2018Hat\u2019 proposal. So, to conclude, I am asking MKR Holders to do two things. 1. When this weeks executive vote goes up (Friday, 12pm EST), please review it promptly, and seriously consider voting to activate the GSM as quickly as possible. It is critically important that this is activated as soon as possible. 2. Vote for the current hat proposal prior to Friday. This is the executive proposal that has already passed, and was created the Friday before last. The more MKR on this proposal, the safer the Maker Protocol is from attack. Current hat proposal can be found here: https://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/activate-the-savings-rate-spread-and-the-sai-and-dai-stability-fee-adjustments ",

Activation of the GSM (Governance Security Module) means that there will be a delay between a proposal being \u2018passed\u2019 and a proposal becoming \u2018active\u2019 This immediately shuts down flash loans, because there is no way for an attacker to abuse the change that they voted in within the same block that they voted it in. Outside of the use of flash loans or borrowed MKR generally, having a GSM delay means that for 24 hours (or the length of the delay), other MKR Holders can see what change will be activated, and react if it is malicious. This reaction can take a couple of forms. If more MKR than the attacker owns can be brought to bear before the delay expires, the change can be cancelled. If we can\u2019t muster more MKR than the attacker within the delay period a quorum of MKR (currently 50k) can trigger Emergency Shutdown. In practice, this means that governance attacks of this nature are not viable and shouldn\u2019t happen. An attacker will never be able to financially benefit from an attack before Emergency Shutdown is called, so there is no incentive to attack the protocol, and we should never need to use the Emergency Shutdown mechanism.  Hope that answers your questions.  ",

MKR locked in the Emergency Shutdown module (when this reaches 50k shutdown is triggered) is locked permanently.

This means that if you trigger ES maliciously you lose a bunch of money. Doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t happen, but there is a high cost associated with it.

We did an analysis of the attack vector using flash loans and crowd funding to take over the Maker Governance Contract here: https://medium.com/@dominik.harz/stealing-all-of-makers-collateral-f940970605b1 Right now the attack is not possible using flash loans due to missing liquidity. However, if the liquidity at the flash loan pools become high enough, it is entirely possible. By introducing a delay through the GSM, flash loan attacks would be prevented.  Actually i would have prefer a 0 Delay time with a dedicated team 24/24 working on this.  The problem with flash loans is that it would become a race condition even if you had a 24/7 team working on this. Best they could do is detect the tx with the flash loan in the mempool and try to get in a transaction before the attacker that would prevent the attack. ",

I mean if you had enough liquidity in a flash loan and if there is enough MKR available to buy within a single tx, then the attacker can execute within the single tx. As a defense, you would have to see the transaction first before it is included in the longest chain. Then you would have to send a transaction the e.g. takes the same flash loan but replaces the governance contract with one that has the GSM with a delay > 0 activated to counter the attack. But then it becomes a decision of the miner which transaction will be included first. ",

Sure! We used this https://dexindex.io/?symbol=MKR&amount=50000&action=buy to check the liquidity. On Kyber itself you would only see the liquidity they have in reserve (the swap). I guess you would have to execute the trade with the limit orders as well to get that amount of MKR. Also, the price has changed quite a bit since we did the last check. It has become more than 4x the price it seems. ",
