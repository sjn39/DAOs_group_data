                    "content": "The Synthetix Ambassadors will soon receive a delegation of 2m OP tokens (Optimism governance power) from the SNX Treasury Council. We would like to ensure that there is advanced notice of this delegation because of anticipated community feedback. It is important to note that there is a blog post detailing all of this, but I\u2019ll quickly summarize the reasons for doing this in this thread by taking some pts from the blog post 1) OP Delegation Included in original SNX Ambassadors Proposal If you look at the initial OP distribution that the SNX Ambassadors at the time (Matt, Mojo, Millie) wrote, it makes clear that there was intent (at the time) for this Optimism to be delegated to the Ambassadors. This delegation was something Synthetix Ambassadors had initially pushed for under its internal proposal and was approved by the Spartan Council at Synthetix. Furthermore, these tokens were directed to be held by the Synthetix Treasury council, as they were deemed the best fit to handle distributions for incentives and so on. Members of the Optimism community have stated that phase 0 delegations are only acceptable if it is adequately disclosed, and this disclosure was given. While it wasn\u2019t correctly carried over to the Optimism forums, this was because of the lack of contentiousness surrounding this topic at the time because Synthetix\u2019s phase 0 proposal came long before any drama in OP governance (proposal was posted in May) 2) Ecosystem Support - Overtime Markets scare The Synthetix ecosystem is vast; it is a major part of Optimism and helps to onboard countless users onto Optimism. It is important to support this ecosystem as they request Optimism tokens, and because of the lack of governance power because of the inaccessibility of Ambassador voting power, Synthetix Ambassadors haven\u2019t been able to support its ecosystem properly. The most notable example is when Overtime Markets requested OP tokens to incentivize users and compete with centralized competitors. They received a NO recommendation for their proposal from Optimism DeFi Committee C. For context, when a committee typically issues a recommendation there has been a 100% chance of losing their upcoming Optimism vote. We\u2019ve also rallied support in conversations in the Thales Discord, Optimism Forums, on twitter, and are also using our current voting power to support Overtime. As of right now, this support has helped put Overtime on the path of being the first proposal to overcome a NO recommendation. The Synthetix Ambassadors can\u2019t rely on this sort of outpouring of support each and every-time. Which is why it is essential for this delegation of Optimism to occur, as it will ensure that the Synthetix Ecosystem is properly supported. 3) Inaccessibility of Ambassador Voting Power - Lost committee vote, inability to support ecosystem Most Optimism governance power held by the SNX Ambassadors is inaccessible for voting. Our original wallet faced multisig issues when being used on L2, which made 1.4m OP tokens inaccessible for voting. We believe that this has created situations where Synthetix Ambassadors have been unable to support the Synthetix communities interests properly. One of the major situations is when the Synthetix Ambassadors lost their vote to be selected as an official committee in Optimism governance by far less than the 1.5m votes that were inaccessible for voting due to this issue. Support for the future of Optimism Governance As Synthetix ambassadors we feel that we are well equipped to contribute to the improvement and maintenance of Optimism via governance, and represent the Synthetix ecosystem in the Optimism ecosystem as well. We are not going away, and we want to see Optimism flourish for many years to come ",

Self-delegation: While not being a fan of \u201cself-delegating grant funds\u201d, it was clearly mentioned in the beginning that this portion will be used by SNX ambassadors until funds run out. (Not sure if the Op foundation has changed their official stance since then.)  Edit: It was only mentioned on SNX forum, not in the Op forum - which makes this a diff case.   Overtime: We felt there was quite a bit of unnecessary drama around the Overtime proposal as we all largely supported it to pass this or next cycle - but we understand your intentions.   Inaccessible Voting Power & Delegations: We\u2019re also very much looking forward to a solution to the inaccessible Op, to more active governance engagement (not only grants!), and improvements on stale delegations (power).   Overall, we expect the Op ecosystem will continue to benefit from closely collaborating with the SNX ecosystem. We hope that other, similarly aligned projects also a) accumulate Op tokens on the free market and b) join this governance for a flourishing Op ecosystem future. It will be important to find a good middle ground between self-interests of stakeholder groups & general, long-term, sustainable Op ecosystem growth initiatives. The last point might be especially important for SNX ambassadors & the Op team to consider as the SNX ecosystem in aggregation will have a lot of voting power (-> responsibility) in the Op ecosystem and we don\u2019t see many teams/communities as professional, aligned & outspoken as Synthetix.

                    "content": "Long time lurker, first time poster. I have been following this self-delegation question and it is a super interesting one. I think that there seems to be broad agreement that protocols, especially key ecosystem protocols, should have an active voice in governance. They key questions seem to be 1) Should Optimism be subsidizing this involvement through a grant program designed for ecosystem growth vs. buying their way in and showing that governance has monetary value, 2) How do we protect against overly self-interested behavior, 3) How do we ensure actual governance involvement vs. only focusing on voting for a narrow, specific purpose, and 4) What is an appropriate amount of self-delegation and should the tokens eventually be used? This is a tough issue. My thought is that we are using 1 grant program to solve 2 different problems. If there is agreement that protocols need a voice, then it seems like we should have grants/approvals specifically for self-delegation and encourage protocols to apply for OP specifically for that purpose. For example, if we agree that say 50% of vote (just an example) should be protocol voice then it is pretty easy to assign a grant bucket based on current votes. Some benefits:  Protocols could then justify how much they want based on importance/TVL. We could require that they appoint a delegate who should be actively involved based on certain KPIs. Require that they abstain from votes on their own proposals and attach other requirements that make people feel the process is fair. It also allows protocols to choose to participate in governance AND apply for needed funds rather than trying to incorporate both elements into a single proposal. Finally it incentivizes governance participation and as more OP gets delegated will require folks to get more skin in the game to maintain their vote share. All this to say, I think 2M OP (10ish % of current votes?) seems about okay for an incredibly important protocol on Optimism. Obviously, it seems like they are participating broadly, but perhaps clearly outlining how Synthetix ambassadors are participating/will participate in governance going forward would outline the value of this specific delegation.

Not exactly, it sounds like you\u2019re advocating for a separate voting stream specifically for self delegation.  I\u2019m fine with self delegation being a part of the current grant proposal process, as long as it is specified within the proposal.  The only issue I have with self delegation is if a project uses tokens received via the grants program for self delegation without being transparent about that in the proposal and voting process.  I\u2019m fine with it as long as the expectation is set and everyone can vote accordingly. The issue with Synthetix is a little different because they have tokens that have been delegated to them that they are unable to use.  My understanding is that they are using self delegation as a temporary solution to not being able to vote with their current delegated tokens. ",

Yes? The other two arguments they make are essentially, \u2018We don\u2019t like losing Snapshot elections and/or having to campaign so hard, so essentially were just going to make ourselves the most powerful delegate irrespective of what anyone thinks, and this will include the 2m tokens that were granted in the very first allocation (beyond their earned delegation) to allow us to do this\u2019.  For the record, I don\u2019t doubt the importance of Synthetix to the overall defi landscape, I just think an eventual voting power of 3.4m tokens overstates their importance and is contrary to a vision of decentralisation. If anyone thinks I\u2019m being too cynical, just ask yourselves: When they cast their 3.4m votes which stakeholder will rank higher in their voting decision, the Synthetix organisation or the Optimism Collective?

                    "content": "Looks like there is a fair bit of controversy here, so for clarity I want to try and parse this into 3 separate issues with presumably different levels of agreement.   The 1.4m OP tokens controlled by snxambassadors.eth should be able to vote but have not been able to due to technical issues. It seems perfectly reasonable to either move these, replace them or whatever with tokens in an address that allows them to participate in governance. If the preferred solution to this issue in particular is to take 1.4m tokens from a separate allocation and use them for voting then I would assume that very few people would have any objection to this, it seems completely fair (and with hindsight should probably have been done with all delegates who suffered from the multisig related Snapshot difficulties ages ago).   Use 2.1m OP tokens that were part of the 9m given initially to vote in governance until they are distributed through other means. This was not included in the request for the tokens, but was decided on in your protocol\u2019s internal governance.       MattL:  Members of the Optimism community have stated that phase 0 delegations are only acceptable if it is adequately disclosed   The controversy here is obviously around whether disclosures on the use of tokens can be described as \u2018adequate\u2019 if they are not included in the proposal. I would lean towards no if this could set a precedent for any future projects using the OP they have been issued for, well anything, without feeling the need to include it in the proposal presented to Optimism delegates. Additionally, it is obvious that many DAOs have comically centralized governance (such as the 3 accounts that outweigh everyone else in Lido\u2019s Snapshots), which means that we would be potentially allowing for a much simpler attack vector is we allow this to be a precedent. On the other hand, in lieu of the 1.4m issue described above, and Synthetix\u2019s clearly established position in the ecosystem, I think a fair point could be made that we could accept this as a one-off and use it to establish a rule going forward (similar to how we have been lenient in accepting late entries to Snapshot rounds previously etc). The difference between 1.4m and 2.1m is perhaps not massively important?  Combining both options to give a total vote of 3.5m as seems to be a concern of @Netrim and @Axel_T . Unless I\u2019m misreading the thread that\u2019s not what\u2019s being suggested here, there still isn\u2019t a resolution to the inaccessible 1.4m as far as I know so this would be a replacement rather than an addition (correct me if I\u2019m wrong @MattL).  If that were to be the case then I imagine most would agree that is a very different scenario. For a team to just decide that because they are already a powerful part of the ecosystem and don\u2019t like the way some votes have gone that they should just be able to decide to become by far the most powerful delegate, taking more power than someone who has been trusted by about 14,000 delegators, would surely represent a governance attack, regardless of whether the attacker believes they are doing it for the greater good of the community or whatever, that\u2019s a story presumably almost as old as humans have been experimenting with governance!  I\u2019m guessing that the majority of the community would see nothing wrong with 1, a lot wrong with 3, and so the discussion should mostly focus around 2. Personally I think the issue there is more about what precedent this sets for proposals honest intentions for use of tokens than this specific case. ",

On a personal note, the @MinimalGravitas answer is much more conciliatory than my own, and also doesn\u2019t have the attitude mine did. So (a) thanks for taking the higher ground, and (b) their response is how I would have preferred to answer if I had more time & was less reactionary.  In regards to the summarised issues, my opinion is:  I have no issue with the 1.4m OP, the case is quite clear and very hard to argue against. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m wrong with the 3.5m OP. This isn\u2019t going to happen in 3-18 months time when the technical issue is resolved? Yes/no? I\u2019m less inclined to give another \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 approval or another \u2018this one last time\u2019 approval in regards to the 2.1m OP. I think at some point there needs to be a line in the sand and an end to the exceptions. The ultimate question, if disclosure allows self-delegation, is whether this self-delegation was disclosed to the community voters prior to the original allocation decision. This should be a pretty simple Yes or No answer (for example, pointing to a public, timestamped source), and if the answer requires a great deal of qualification or justification, then that points to the answer simply being \u2018No\u2019, it wasn\u2019t disclosed \u2026and that\u2019s where the line needs to be drawn.  In conclusion:  I\u2019m not that active here, so I\u2019m willing to defer to those who commit more time to Optimism Governance. 1.4m OP is still a great deal of voting power, and should remedy a lot of the frustrations the SNX team is having in getting their voice heard. I just hope that this decision can be made by the community (or even a dedicated Snapshot vote) and not arbitrarily by whoever at the end holds the keys.  Thanks for your time, and apologies for my combative style in my earlier reply. ",

The Synthetix Ambassadors will be using both wallets and will not be removing the self-delegation once the other wallet is accessible. This was laid out in the original SIP and will be depleted as the Synthetix Treasury uses these for rewards.     MattL:  Hey there, That\u2019s not what is being proposed, we\u2019re going to be leaving the self delegation until the Synthetix TC uses that 2m for incentives. That\u2019s what was laid out in the SIP, and was meant to be carried over to the forums. Regarding self delegation - I don\u2019t personally have an issue with self delegations being used by protocols, but I do think it\u2019s one of those case by case items that has to be worked through as a part of the overall review of proposals. It\u2019s a tough issue, but I think protocols have a say in overall OP governance is better for all of OP.   Thanks guys! ",

If I\u2019m not mistaken, from Snapshot you can see that they are starting to vote with this 2.1m OP, and this is yet another reason for community apathy and disempowerment, why OP holders don\u2019t want to get involved in its Governance (or leave quickly), and why a large majority of token holders don\u2019t want to get informed and routinely vote. Why bother when the community is controlled by a few? And the few make up their own rules, to benefit themselves, as they go along? Bearish for the Optimism Collective and OP \u2026or should the Collective be renamed, the Synthetix Ambassadors Affiliate Grants Program?! Sorry, that\u2019s rude, but this action is shady, and from a group/bundled vote Phase 0 allocation as well  ",

I am silent on this as there is nothing new to say, I did my best by bringing this topic up for discussion when Perp did it and later with SNX. But as I am tagged, few thoughts. Those following this conversation from starting are either against it or at least find their approach unethical. Overriding their Phaso 0 proposal commitment by their internal proposal is wrong and against open governance. Can I, as a protocol, take fund from gov for protocol development and later use it for other reason because I have a written document mentioning the same somewhere in my Discord ? They are one of the biggest and trusted ecosystem on Optimism and it makes perfect sense that their voice is heard in our governance but the guidelines should come from OF so that it applies equally to all protocol, big or small. What is better and more sustainable, a decision made by a multisig of 3-5 people or a framework and set of rules applicable to everyone equally and fairly. They are already using and voting with their extra 2M, why should a protocol gets a head start compare to others ? Katie, Minimal, Axlvaz, Netrim and our Latam members raised their voice on this forum as well as on Discord but all we got in Response was \u201cgreater good narative\u201d shielded with word \u2018community\u2019.

In the latest voting round for Citizen House Badgeholder nominations they have used their 2.2M to vote for themselves, and only themselves. This has means they have simply given themselves a position in the top 10 and therefore a citizenship badge. Again, there were no rules against doing this, but it just seems to continue the pattern of self-serving descisions, which presumably we should expect to continue whenever the opportunity arises. Like you said above, Synthetix should have a large role in Optimism, they are one of the key protocols around which so much is built\u2026 but that power should be allocated by the community as it is for everything else, not just taken by them every time there is no explicit rule preventing it. I\u2019m sure they think it is for the \u2018Greater Good\u2019 for them to have as much control as they can, but I fundementally believe it is never a sensible idea to let the powerful decide how much power they should have, even if they really are good actors (which I do think they probably are).

I wonder how long this \u2018we are doing this for greater good of Optimism\u2019 will continue. If we look back, they use their wallet to vote on couple of proposal in season 2, then with Citizenship and now Grant Council. Its even sad when you think its implication on citizen house, they literally gave a citizenship to themselves, now their candidate could, possibly, nominate one additional person willing to rubber stamp in their approval. And the chain evolves, now could this binary tree of aligned entities vote to fund public good without any bias ?? I, with few other delegates I know,  joined our gov because we saw a glimpse of moving away from plutocracy system with Citizens house but I dont think we are making progress in the right direction. I hope we can abolish this method or put a  mechanism of penalty similar of Ethereum POS. In long run we should have a process in place to prune not only the child branch but root too. ",

I think it\u2019s something like:  SNX users represented by an SNX delegate (self-delegation because they can\u2019t vote with the original delegated multisig address) Ambassador delegate address Protocol self-delegation address  am I correct? If so:  There isn\u2019t any rule for all these different addresses to be managed by the same person. If they are elected on their own DAO there isn\u2019t any rule where different addresses should be considered part of the same delegate, all the tokens delegated to these addresses come from different entities. There is a rule that considered self-voting approved if you vote for 5 or 3 candidates depending on the council  I understand the \u201cgovernance attack\u201d argument because one single persona has the power to vote someone in or out by itself. And I agree we should call these problems out in the open. But I think these mistakes should be acknowledged and corrected by future proposals without engaging in a PVP match. We must consider everyone here is thinking about Optimism benefits. Everyone does it as they think it\u2019s best and we self-regulate with each other. This PVP nonsense is just making the coop game more difficult. Because now Matt has 2 options either he says \u201cI am right\u201d or he says \u201csorry\u201d. You don\u2019t give any other chance to say \u201cHey you know what we should think about how to frame this on the OP governance\u201d We are mostly 20 delegates trying to figure these out. How can we bring more people in if they see each other pvping. So back to the questions:  Are these 3 addresses correct Do we have any idea how to rule this and help the Op foundation?  btw I don\u2019t work for SNX, I\u2019m not part of their community and I don\u2019t hold any SNX.

They choose to self-delegate, again number of OP is irrelevant, and using that wallet to vote from past couple of proposals which is, in my opinion, an attack to governance. It was not mentioned in their proposal and they should have followed the same approach like other protocol, now that protocol self-delegation is in place. Others will try to derail the conversation by connecting this to how voting is impacted, either in council or during citizenship, but that the outcome of the problem. I want to bring the attention back to the problem, which is misuse of grant token by not following the proposal. If Perp was prohibited from participation for not following the proposal, shouldnt it apply to Synth as well. To me both are misuse, Perp sold the grant to fiat and they choose to use it for voting. Why to play favorite ? ",

Yes, they are both misuse of grant tokens because they are not on their proposal. But if we look at laws in general everything is considered a gray area and not just black and white. Example: Getting into a private house with a gun to steal something has different consequences if there are people in it or if it\u2019s empty. So perp sold and it\u2019s prohibited from participation, although I don\u2019t agree and did not vote on this. (which brings another great discussion) SNX self-delegated, something they told in a SIP on their own governance. Do you think they should be prohibited from participation? If so are they entitled to sell all their OPs the moment they are out? Will this be beneficial for OP as a whole? I mean you are asking one of the most used protocols with one of the strongest liquidity and fee creators in optimism to be prohibited from governance because someone forgot to add this to the proposal? I\u2019ve read a SIP where these tokens will be used btw and will leave SNX governance, will that suffice? BTW I\u2019m asking all this because it\u2019ll shape future proposals template. I\u2019m not trying to PVP here. sorry if any of this sounds like an accusation. ",

This, combined with the changes to grant applications and the  Protocol Delegate Program should reduce the ambiguity of this in the future from this situation happening again. Personally, while I disagree with this delegation since other protocols did not do something similar, it seems like the issue should resolve itself going forward. However, there is a part that remained unclear to me: if the Protocol Delegate Program was implemented as an explicit discouragement of grant self-delegation, why are these delegated funds still being used after the passing of this vote on December 21st? Now, I have to admit that the reason why I am aware of this discussion is because this decision to use the 2M OP is affecting me and the protocol I wish to represent directly. As of the time of writing, there are less than 24 hours left for the vote to close, and these 2.3 Million OP have moved ParaSwap from being the ~5th to not even being a nominated protocol anymore. This, once again, is happening in a vote for something specifically designed to remove protocol self-delegation , and offer an alternative instead. Had ParaSwap also decided to also use its unspent OP to self-delegate, we would have enough to have closed the gap and made it to 8th place. However, other protocols that are now going to be excluded from this round due to this self-delegation did not even have this choice. Atlantis World ( represented by @revmiller ), for instance, is another protocol where these 2.3M made the difference between being represented and exclusion. In a similar vein, at least 1 Grant Council Reviewee is being affected by this issue as well. Personally, if I do not make it past this round, I am fine applying to represent ParaSwap again on the next voting round, but how many members might potentially be discouraged from applying again in the future? I understand these votes being counted while we didn\u2019t have an alternative for protocol delegation, but I\u2019m unsure as to why the wallet with the largest voting power in an election about an alternative to Grant Self-Delegation would be a wallet voting with Grant Self-Delegation.

The ~2.3m OP granted was meant to be distributed well before today, that\u2019s what the original Proposal allowed for and (if memory serves correct) all the documentation stated this was a temporary issue as distributions of the ~2.3m OP was meant to be finished \u2018over a few months\u2019. It\u2019s well past a few months now, this issue has remained, and votes (and the accompanying positions of authority and shape of the Optimism Collective) are being decided by this problem. To not be PVP (assuming this is a gaming reference to Player vs Player?), and to be be constructive towards Optimism, Sythentix and an ultimately decentralised user base, here are some suggested, possible solutions:   Distribute the ~2.3m OP to users as had been planned to be done by now within the Phase 0 Grant, i.e let the problem play itself out.   Re-delegate the ~2.3m OP to a broad, unaligned set of other delegates, and simply keep the voting power of Synthetix Ambassadors that the OP holders had originally, collectively entrusted to them.   Simply not vote with the contested ~2.3m OP; just take it off the table for the sake of harmony and unifying a group.   ",

I obviously cannot get in the mind of the proposal redactor, but I believe that this is to avoid finger pointing for a particular delegate, as that could\u2019ve come across in very poor taste, as delegates are already expected to do this under the code of conduct. Synthetix and their governance ambassadors are a key part of the Optimism ecosystem, and I really would not want to make them feel unwelcome.     Gonna.eth:  When it comes to the Council election.

How things are going wrong now, and how this will lead to further issues down the track.   Agreed with both of these points, I feel there isn\u2019t much more to be said about this already self resolving matter and one that the SNX team already acknowledged in the community call.  To steer this thread towards a productive direction, I encourage the following points to be taken in the future:  Remove the ability for protocols to self-delegate grants altogether from grant requests, similar to the no-sell rule, as opposed to the current strong discouragement. Grants are destined for builder and user growth, if OP is needed for governance I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s better suited for the Protocol Delegation Programs or even RetroPGF Explore a separate stream for protocol citizens and grant council members. Protocols and builders are the lifeblood of Optimism, and having their voice be represented is important. Perhaps the best way to solve the tensions on the Citizen House/Grants Council side is to have a clear separate stream for Protocol Representatives, which will also guarantee that these sections of the collective are a healthy mix of individuals + protocol delegates.  Finally, something can be discussed to alleviate the impact of the self-delegated grant votes during the affected period after at least Dec 21st, but I am not comfortable suggesting anything as I am part of the affected candidates, so I\u2019ll let someone else explore this if interested.
