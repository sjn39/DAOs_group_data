I have a few questions regarding your role as a delegate, and I hope you\u2019ll take the time to address them.  You mention having an incentive to see UNI succeed in the long term. How do you view the conflict of interest between Compound and Uniswap as competitors courting liquidity providers?  I recognize that Compound is a money market protocol, and Uniswap is an AMM; they\u2019re not directly competing, but certainly, both need liquidity to function well. For DeFi farmers, the competing incentives to move liquid capital from one platform to another are not sectorally driven; if you can make more in a money market platform than on a DEX, you\u2019ll migrate there.  Recently, a 15M UNI bloc mobilized out of nowhere to vote on Proposal 1. Do you think that this bloc was created by borrowing UNI from Compound in an attempt to swing the vote? More broadly, how do you feel about the potential for Compound and similar competing lending platforms being used to execute governance attacks on other DeFi platforms\u2013any ideas for how to build effective defenses against leveraged vote buying?  The flip-side of your status as Compound\u2019s founder is your ability to influence both platforms towards symbiosis. I\u2019m aware (marginally) that listings on Compound, and specifics of borrow limits, collateralization ratios, reserve rates, and interest rate curves are subject to rigorous risk investigation. When working with the Compound community, what sort of \u201cgovernance risk\u201d analysis is performed when offering borrow capability for other governance tokens? To cut to the chase: it seems like it\u2019s a lot harder to acquire enough COMP on Compound to swing a vote than it is to acquire enough UNI, just on the face of it. Can you debunk this idea for us?  What are your thoughts on the recent defeat of Proposal 1? Would you support a.) lowering the quorum threshold? b.) lowering the proposal threshold?  I hope you can take my questions in the good faith in which they are offered. Thanks in advance for your response! ",

Changing the rules seems premature; by waiting until later, the community will have (1) more information, (2) a clearer vision of how things should change if they should change. @Naught I\u2019m not sure yet - generally indifferent. Would want to see what the community thinks, and why incentivizing liquidity in UNI is good for Uniswap (there\u2019s already a lot of liquidity, for most users to enter/exit a position). It would have the effect of rewarding existing UNI holders at the expense of non-holders. @jumnhy (1) I don\u2019t see a conflict of interest - there\u2019s a huge amount of liquidity in both, and I think people often times significantly overstate the importance of liquidity / TLV. (2) It wasn\u2019t - pretty easy to tell with on-chain data (yay transparency). (3) See above. @melveyr I haven\u2019t looked at any retro-active airdrop since there hasn\u2019t been an on-chain proposal for one yet - but I would apply my framework above to analyze it. In general, I don\u2019t have many \u201cpolitical\u201d views for Uniswap - but maintaining the status quo (until the community can clearly articulate alternatives) seems appropriate, so I\u2019d support maintaining the existing liquidity incentives (potentially with some modifications). @chrisblec I have no financial or strategic relationship with Dharma, nor Gauntlet. Tarun (the founder of Gauntlet) and I invest in early-stage DeFi projects together (shoutout if you\u2019re building something cool: check out https://robvc.com/). ",

It would have the effect of rewarding existing UNI holders at the expense of non-holders.   Some points for community to consider in favor of ETH-UNI:   ETH/UNI incentives increases liquidity lock up. UNI is locked into the pool as a sink to the supply. The increased UNI liquidity depth allows price stability for future grants, airdrops, and other incentive measures; without moving UNI price drastically.   The current liquidity programs have the effect of rewarding non-UNI holders at the expense of UNI holders (current pools farm UNI to then sell in market). A UNI-ETH incentive pool balances this equation, while also lowering rewards for the non-UNI holder pools.   ",
