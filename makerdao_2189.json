Currently, there is one DSR option offered to DAI holders: instant access at a predetermined rate (e.g. 1%). The proposed solution would be similar to notice accounts, which can have different unwinding periods at a range of rates. For example, a 30-day notice DSR account could earn 1.50%, instead of 1.00%, to compensate for the extra 30 days of notice/liquidity that they are providing. The client would request/call the funds and be able to withdraw the DAI locked in the DSR in 30 days. This in turn would allow Maker\u2019s ALM team to have a longer duration asset; for example, instead of investing in MMFs it could invest the funds in 1-month treasury, or it could continue to invest in MMFs and have a withdrawal table that allows it to plan for those liquidity events. There have been efforts to create a fixed-term, fixed-rate product, but given changing market conditions, this could be an alternative/complementary product with a possibly lower cost and simpler coding solution that could achieve the same goal. Do you believe that offering additional DSR options, such as notice accounts with different unwinding periods, would be attractive to DAI holders?     Yes No Maybe     0 voters     Do you think that notice accounts, rather than term accounts, would better align with DAI\u2019s investment options?     Yes No Maybe     0 voters     ",

We imagine this would come out of the S&L scope meetings, specifically with regards to its ALM model. We are not sure regarding the characterization of a notice model as less complex or less challenging than a term product. Below is a prototype of a Term Dai product that would support MakerDAO to manage Dai liquidity. However, the consideration of these various approaches needs to be controlled by the S&L scope and Maker Governance. To date, the focus of S&L has been on collateral and not Dai. The prototype below is a test we composed to evaluate assumptions regarding how Maker Core or Maker SubDAOs could offer \u201cTerm Durations\u201d to Dai holders. Term basically allows Maker Core or SubDAOs the ability to offer lock up options to DAI and sDAI holders, at the discretion of Maker, MKR holders, or SubDAO token holders. Prior to voting in the poll above, voters may want to review the documents and the prototype to consider the viability of such an approach. It seems such a product is possible, should Maker holders express a desire to pursue it. Perhaps the poll should be an expression of interest in the various approaches, rather than pitting one approach against the other in a binary fashion.

We\u2019ve seen over the past few years that fixed rate protocols haven\u2019t found much product market fit, and I believe one main reason for this is that people really don\u2019t like being forced to roll over their positions manually - this introduces UX friction, additional gas costs, and complexity. This alternative mechanism would give users the experience of having positions automatically roll over until they wish to withdraw, which I think could be more attractive and result in a lower cost of capital to attract a given amount of DAI participation.

The focus and discipline required to transition to a sustainable steady state for the whole organization and MakerDAO ecosystem surely constrains a lot of what individuals or groups of individuals within and external to the DAO want to do and announce right now. Unnecessary frustration of efforts will arise from pushing forward with new products and features without the foundational blocks the transition pregame period seeks to implement. It\u2019s counter-productive to keep MakerDAO in a perpetual state of moving internally at cross purposes without the proper sequencing of priorities and time for deliberation and consensus forming inputs. Crucial input here is certainly required from whichever Scope conversation will do analysis of regulatory resiliency, because the timing and optics are not great to have headlines on \u201cyield\u201d \u201cAPY\u201d \u201cincome\u201d offered to retail for investment.
