                    "content": "Project Name: Lyra Author Name: Mike Defillama TVL (at snapshot): $31,948,436 Transactions/day (at snapshot): 325 Tier: 2 Optimism native: Yes Revisions to metrics used: N/A Number of OP tokens to claim: 3,000,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0xB6DACAE4eF97b4817d54df8e005269f509f803f9 Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): The Optimism Collective is a new type of community that\u2019s digitally native, sustainable and fair. Lyra began the era of Optimism native projects and today, we are submitting one of the first proposals to the $OP governance fund.  How will the tokens be distributed? Our community has three pillars:  Builders  Liquidity  Traders Lyra\u2019s $OP distribution will reward each of them.   Builders Amount: 600,000 $OP Criteria: Build on Lyra and apply to the Grants Council We\u2019re going to build a vibrant ecosystem on top of Lyra. Composability is DeFi\u2019s superpower and projects like Polynomial and Brahma have demonstrated the potential of building on Lyra. Public goods such as Lyra Live and The Short Put provide value to the whole community and align with Optimism\u2019s ethos. Whether you\u2019re building the next DeFi Option Vault, a community newsletter or anything in between, all builders will be eligible to apply.   Liquidity Amount: 1,700,000 $OP Criteria: Become a Lyra Liquidity Provider  Option Market Pools LYRA/ETH Gelato Pool  Liquidity is essential for any crypto protocol and it plays a crucial role in Lyra. By depositing to the Option Market Pools, LPs provide the collateral that the AMM needs to trade. LPs will be eligible for a share of $OP relative to their stake in the pools. $LYRA was the first token distributed on Optimism, reducing fees for token holders. However, building L2 native token liquidity is challenging and $OP incentives will help Lyra build the most liquid L2 token.   Traders Amount : 500,000 $OP Criteria: Start trading on Lyra Increasing trading activity is Lyra\u2019s fundamental goal and the $OP token presents an opportunity to onboard an array of new users. A rebate on trading fees will reduce friction and help Optimism and Lyra attract more activity. Since launch, traders have paid over $600k in fees to Lyra Liquidity Providers.   Ecosystem Amount: 200,000 $OP Criteria: To be administered by Lyra Governance To inspire the next generation of Optimistic builders, Lyra will host a virtual hackathon and create content to educate builders on what to build with options and how to build on Lyra.   Retroactive Up to 10% of the total allocation will be distributed retroactively to the builders and users that helped build the Lyra community.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?   More Builders Without builders, there\u2019s no stuff. From smart contracts to dApps and everything in between, both usage and liquidity on Optimism start with building more stuff. We think this one is a no brainer!   Liquidity Migration Lyra\u2019s ignition program caused the single largest spike of TVL on Optimism. LP incentives will encourage another mass migration of liquidity from L1.  ignition2940\u00d7930 162 KB    More Traders Every trade on Lyra is a transaction on Optimism and to date, we\u2019ve seen over 8000 unique traders make almost 19000 trades. Trader incentives will enable Lyra to attract even more first time users to Optimism.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?   Builders make things that last While incentives are temporary, smart contracts and public goods built on Optimism are permanent. By directly incentivising builders, we will create an immutable foundation that exists long after the conclusion of the incentives.   Trader retention When people start trading on Lyra, they don\u2019t stop. We have an almost 70% trader retention rate.  Screen Shot 2022-04-29 at 1.48.15 pm941\u00d7382 22.9 KB    Gas savings Users are paying 200x less in fees than they would on L1.  gas-savings3412\u00d71108 135 KB   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We will target distribution over 6 months. The exact rate at which tokens are distributed will be left to the Grants Council and Lyra Council to be ratified by governance in the upcoming LEAP-24.  How much will your project match in co-incentives? Builders  - Grants Council will match $LYRA to $OP up to $50k per month Liquidity - $LYRA distributed as per the framework in LEAP-21 Citizens - Trade fees matched up to a 100% total rebate Note This proposal is subject to approval by the Lyra Council. Specific allocations within each category are yet to be finalised. ",

Retroactively funding projects building the ecosystem is the entire point of the OP Collective\u2019s token distribution.

Same for pairs ETH/USD, BTC/USD, OP/USD\u2026 seems off of the purpose of the funds allocated to Lyra for this round. The focus in the growth of the Liquidity should be one of the main focus (+builders!) and it\u2019s reflected into the proposal. Pools use sUSD so another native protocol like SNX benefit of it too. Also would allow builders on top of LYRA like POLYNOMIAL to have better liquidity an keep growing their own vaults. I see it could increase Lyra\u2019s TVL from 30M to >90M $ of new capital bridged to OP. I see the proposal as it is a win-win for Optimism ecosystem. Better tools build on top + better liquidity > better efficiency and prices > more use by vaults/traders > more added value and synergies within Optimism. ",

Firstly we want to finalise the retroactive component of the distribution. I will attempt to summarise the discussion from our Discord below. Retroactive Summary Optimism intends to incentivise future activity and usage on the network. I think we can agree that the vast majority of tokens should be forward-looking. Should we do a retroactive distribution at all? If so, to who? Well, without traders and LPs we wouldn\u2019t have qualified at all. But they have also been rewarded with LYRA in proportion to their trading/liquidity. Also, some of the early LPs have been farming and dumping LYRA. LYRA token holders haven\u2019t directly contributed to trading or liquidity on the protocol. However, I believe those that have participated in governance have indirectly contributed by electing the council which oversees the protocol. I think the following groups should be eligible for a retroactive distribution:  Traders (that didn\u2019t dump) LPs (that didn\u2019t dump) LYRA holders that voted in an election  We could also make the trading and LP criteria independent of volume/liquidity and create a flatter distribution than we will get with future incentives (H/T Spreek). Edit: Builders would also be eligible for retroactive $OP, but that will be handled on a case by case basis via the Grants Council. ",
