                    "content": "Hello, fellow MakerDAO community members, Following our PSM application on December 14th, 2021, for which we very much appreciate all the feedback and insight given, we are still saddened to see our application rejected. Your feedback has been extremely helpful and we would like to address the questions and concerns. As we have explained in the past on the Forum, we would like to develop a collaboration with MakerDAO similar to the one TUSD had before its move of ownership from Trusttoken to Techteryx. In order to do so, we have answered the questions of the community and provided detailed explanations in regards to what the transition meant on multiple occasions. We understand the community had concerns regarding transparency and security. This was followed by an adjustment of the Debt Ceiling to 0 which we did not contest as it was the community\u2019s choice by vote. Nevertheless, we would like to open a channel of communication and be able to discuss together the future of MakerDAO and TUSD and the next steps we may take in order to benefit both our communities. First, we would like to explain our decision to apply for TUSD to be added as a PSM. We believe that this is an innovative opportunity offered by MakerDAO and that TUSD joining in would greatly benefit both our communities. Adding TUSD to the list of PSM would diversify the stablecoin reserve types of PSM, reducing the risk profile. If the application was to pass, a great number of TUSD users would mint DAI, therefore improving the utilization rate and market value of the token. Additionally, TUSD is a 1:1 token pegged by the US dollar, this means that it would better support the soft peg between the price of DAI and the US dollar, as the PSM intends to do. As we have seen in the past, a large portion of our users trust MakerDAO and look to mint their funds into DAI and participate in the DAI ecosystem. Secondly, we would like to address the questions related to Justin Sun and his relationship with TUSD. As is presented on our website, Justin Sun acts as the Asia Market Advisor. This means that he has no power over decision-making, nor does he have access to the funds or private keys of our users. The MakerDAO community saw that he did borrow 24k MKR from Aave. However, it was shown after by @flipflopflapdelegate that those funds were returned almost instantly. We would like to insist on the fact that although we promoted the application on our social media for our community to consider voting, we did not communicate with Mr. Sun for him to override the general consensus, nor did we act alongside him by creating a new wallet and voting in the poll. This however led to the community reacting promptly and having the votes changed from a few members voting abstain and yes to a solid no from all voters. We understand the importance of voting and prioritize MakerDAO\u2019s community sentiment first and foremost, so we wouldn\u2019t risk working with Justin Sun, or any whales, to manipulate votes. Once again I would like to reiterate that we are open to responding to any feedback and concern from the MakerDAO community, the same way we answer questions from our community. Just like we did upon the transition and when the application received comments, we are happy to explain our process for compliance, tech, contract security, and assets reserves, provided we are included in the discussion. At the same time, we sincerely hope the MakerDAO community is receptive to the information we provide and we can take our collaboration further together! I would like to take this opportunity to show the MakerDAO community our progress since the transition, in hopes it will be sufficient evidence of our transparency, security, and goodwill to work hand-in-hand for a successful collaboration. In the past year, we have started working with over 40+ DeFi projects including lending protocols such as AAVE, Compound, and Venus. All of those have decent high utilization rates as a collateral asset. We have also partnered with Signature Bank\u2019s Signet in 2021, a significant expansion of our banking partnerships in addition to Silvergate, PrimeTrust, and First Digital. I hope this can show that we prove to be as trusted now as we did in the past and that we are constantly striving to provide users with more convenient and efficient use. Finally, we would like to thank the MakerDAO community for allowing us to answer the questions brought up and for the opportunity to see a change in our relationship. We hope you can see this as proof of our commitment to improving things and a positive attitude towards the community\u2019s feedback. We are always open to answering any additional questions brought to us, and we hope this is the beginning of a new vision for TUSD and MakerDAO working together. Sincerely, Annabel from TrueUSD ",

When comes to him borrowing a large amount of MKR, or any other asset for that matter, we at TrueUSD do not know what he intends to do with them. When Justin\u2019s interests are aligned with TrueUSD\u2019s, that is entirely up to himself and we are not involved with his personal decisions. We value and appreciate support and feedback from everyone, regardless of their affiliations. ",
