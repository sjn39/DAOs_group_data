                    "content": " Abstract This proposal aims to introduce a new Workstream (WS) called Gitcoin Discovery within the Gitcoin DAO. The Workstream will be responsible for decentralizing and improving the Gitcoin Quests, which will become dQuests,  through the Gitcoin Knowledge Base, which will become dKnowledge. Built on a decentralized infrastructure, dQuests is a gamified platform where users will be able to progress through various types of quests\u2014like quizzes, code challenges, and on-chain transactions\u2014gaining the ability to verify their diverse skillsets (see initial prototype - HackFS Hackathon Finale live demo).   dKnowledge will contain educational information and FAQs about the Gitcoin ecosystem, Web3 projects, and technologies. The content within the Knowledge Base will be used to populate quest preparation materials.  By successfully completing a quest, users will be able to:  earn XPs and increase their ranking  mint Quest & Badge NFTs with a random rarity  and grow their Dynamic Skill Tree NFT by validating their learnings and actions through on-chain micro-credentials.  Frame 12032\u00d71183 332 KB       Motivation  Getting started in Web3 is difficult because the information needed to overcome the steep learning curve is:  Scattered Unreliable Censorable  Gitcoin Discovery will be a community-driven, learning platform for onboarding and engaging users & developers into Web3. In order to provide high-quality courses built around open source, trustable and verifiable content, members of the Web3 projects will collaborate with community experts in various fields such as:  content creation development & infrastructure research and security  As the Gitcoin DAO expands, we believe there are 3 main problems that need to be solved:  Aggregating ever-growing but scattered information Retaining users and community members/contributors DAO project management, contributor management, and intuitive onboarding  Once the changes are implemented:  Contributors will be motivated to perform certain tasks on the Gitcoin Knowledge Base, such as:  suggest edits suggest translations, update information, etc.   The implementation of Quest, Badge, and Skill Tree NFTs will add an incentive layer for platform users and DAO contributors to engage with the ecosystem. Platform users can be onboarded to the GitcoinDAO and to Web3 projects easily with verified skills and interests. Platform users can trade their quests & badge NFTs.   Overview Gitcoin Discovery Workstream (GDW) believes that the first step to solving these problems is to decentralize the Gitcoin Quests by motivating contributors to actively participate in the expansion of the GitcoinDAO. Gitcoin Discovery Workstream will consist of 2 sub-streams:   dKnowledge will contain information related to the Gitcoin ecosystem (grants, bounties, GTC, hackathons, policies, FAQs, etc.)  dQuests will display the content from dKnowledge in a more engaging way and it will reward users for validating their learnings and actions.  We believe in effective collaboration required from our end to be able to implement the improvements we are proposing. That\u2019s why our budgetary framework is thoughtfully drafted for efficient cross-Workstream collaboration, as shown below:  Brainstorming Sessions (3)1920\u00d7810 74.9 KB   Specification   Roadmaps To see the roadmaps in general refer to the pages below: dQuests Roadmap dKnowledge Roadmap  Measuring Success Our workstream will solve most of the current Gitcoin Quests\u2019 issues:  Quests are not grouped by project or topic Content is mainly for techies Repetitive Q&As Time-inefficient to load quests and go through a quiz Bypass of security measures (e.g. quest timeout and quest completion verification)  dKnowledge  Decentralization of Gitcoin Knowledge Base infrastructure User-friendly library format to Knowledge Base Collecting, forming, and organizing scattered information related to Gitcoin ecosystem Increase community participation into the decentralized Knowledge Base (dKnowledge)  community pool prizes for translations, edits, completion of missing information, etc.   Translation of the content within dKnowledge to 5 languages (Chinese, Japanese, French, English, and Spanish)  dQuests  Decentralization of Gitcoin Quests infrastructure Quest preparation material template Dashboard for project owners/contributors Introduction to dBadges to verify the skills of a contributor/user via Dynamic NFTs  Gitcoin Discovery Features  Dynamic NFT Skill Tree dBadges DAO member onboarding structure dQuest, project dashboard Squad incentivization policies on content creation for quests and knowledge base Mentorship sessions  Our long-term roadmap is the following: We will need 6 months(Q4 2021 - Q2 2022) to get a decent alpha version on the 3 milestones described below, then 3 more months(Q2 2022) to make changes and improvements based on the feedback, and then we\u2019ll be ready for an open beta release. Our short-term roadmap (which is what the current funding\u2019s for) is the following: Milestone 1 - 1 month Intuitively pleasant user interface - We will create a user interface that will allow for users to join the Gitcoin Discovery Web dApp. The user will be able to create new \u201cprojects\u201d which will entail creating and uploading data to GitBook. We will create and test a Github Action that can be plugged in any repo (GitBook or code), which will automatically upload the files of the repo to FileCoin and IPFS through web3.storage. In addition to the files of the repo, we will have the creator of the project upload images which will be ranked according to rarity. These images will be uploaded to web3.storage and using Web3.js, we will store in mapping with the image CIDs linked to the rarity and project name on-chain and emit an event of the storage. Milestone 2 - 2 months We will begin to implement and extend the multiple smart contracts needed for our project flow. A Project Factory smart contract will control the access, approvers, and minting of NFTs. This contract will inherit from ERC-721, and will keep track of pending eligible addresses for future minting. We will use Identity-Link Services built on top of IDX and Ceramic (Ceramic and IDX are built on top of IPFS) to link the GitHub account to an ethereum address(es) and DID through the user profile page. Separately a Topic Factory smart contract for contributors to established projects will be created. Within this contract, the Chainlink VRF will be used to add randomness to the minting of the NFT. We will also build a Chainlink external adapter which will pass the metadata and the chosen image from the mapping to NFT.storage and return the URI from NFT.storage to the smart contract. At the end of Q4, upon the completion of the above-mentioned milestones, we will kick off Q1 2022 with Milestone 3 as described below: Milestone 3 - 2 months We will build a subgraph that will track the metadata of the project and topic NFTs. This will serve as a project registry and will also store the details of the projects. Our front-end will use the NFT.storage URIs to display the details about the projects and topics. We will build a smart contract for the quests that users will complete within the topics. The UI will be built for presenting these quests. The smart contract will call a Chainlink External Adapter which will check the Ceramic streamID for proof that the user completed the quest and will also pass metadata to NFT.storage and return URI to the contract. This will also utilize the Chainlink VRF contract for randomness according to pre-set thresholds within the smart contract. We will build a subgraph that will track the metadata of the project and topic NFTs. This will serve as a project registry and will also store the details of the projects. Our front-end will use the NFT.storage URIs to display the details about the projects and topics. We will build a smart contract for the quests that users will complete within the topics. The UI will be built for presenting these quests. The smart contract will call a Chainlink External Adapter which will check the ceramic streamID for proof that the user completed the quest and will also pass metadata to NFT.storage and return URI to the contract. This will also utilize the Chainlink VRF contract for randomness according to pre-set thresholds within the smart contract. Maintenance and Upgrade Plan: Our team will update any library that we use on a continual basis. We will provide maintenance for the overall availability and security of the dApp. This will include bug fixes, monitoring, upgrades to major versions of tools such as Chainlink v2, new web3.storage releases, et al. We will also be looking for ways to enhance our existing features.  Benefits  The core benefit of this proposal, if approved, is that GDWS will improve the ways and means of collaboration between GitcoinDAO contributors, GitcoinDAO Workstreams, and Gitcoin platform users. It would open the DAO to test, improve and implement ever-growing community incentivization protocols. Further along the line, Gitcoin Discovery, with planned features to be presented as we progress, will help onboard thousands, if not millions of users and developers into Web3 space. We emphasize the vision provided in the research of Modular Politics: Toward a Governance Layer for Online Communities;  (1) Modularity: Platform operators and community members should have the ability to construct systems by creating, importing, and arranging composable parts together as a coherent whole. (2) Expressiveness: The governance layer should be able to implement as wide a range of processes as possible. (3) Portability: Governance tools developed for one platform should be portable to another platform for reuse and adaptation. (4) Interoperability: Governance systems operating on different platforms and protocols should have the ability to interact with each other, sharing data and influencing each other\u2019s processes.   Drawbacks  If we had to build the whole infrastructure to achieve decentralization it could have been a challenge but as we\u2019re going to use composable technologies and great libraries like NFT.storage, Web3.storage, Ceramic, Chainlink VRF, The Graph, and other tools for the right job, it will make it easier to build this dApp.  About our Team Gitcoin Discovery Team Members   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: What do you need from Gitcoin and when?

I think the depth, ambition and impact of this proposal should not be underestimated but maybe it could be more effective to spin it off into becoming its own workstream in one of the next phases and live under an existing one for now? The main advantage is that it simplifies the budget side of things, it can be incorporated in an existing budget, which means less budgets to pass through every month. Just my two gwei ofc.

                    "content": "Hello! I love the vision of a decentralised learning community platform. Its a problem I think about everyday and I hope you won\u2019t mind the long post! However, as @owocki and @krrisis has mentioned, starting an entire workstream + becoming one of the highest budget workstreams is quite an ask. May I suggest being first incubated in the decentralise Gitcoin workstream as a project? Here\u2019s some thoughts from working in education in blockchain:   As you\u2019ve rightly pointed out, knowledge is extremely scattered. There has been several efforts to try to make sense of it but knowledge_curation_speed < knowledge_production_speed and its hard to catch up on what\u2019s even out there yet. That alone is a large project and can be quite opinionated in the sense that what you choose to include and what you don\u2019t shapes the minds of the folks that learn it.   What you\u2019re proposing seems really very very very similar to Rabbithole. I\u2019ve been doing Rabbithole quests and one drawback was that it was a good way for already crypto native folks to get further ahead but most people that were new to crypto couldn\u2019t figure out how to get started (signing, tx, gas, needing ETH to start). Building up that ramp is a massive UX challenge too!   I\u2019ve been in some conversations about inter-DAO onboarding and a big challenge has to do with levelling people from 0 context to \u201cI can figure out what\u2019s happening in Discord\u201d-level context   Some suggestions:   It seems that putting the objectives of onboarding, learning, and engaging in a single platform might lead to a fractionalisation of intent so I\u2019d suggest picking one objective as a priority first!   I\u2019d suggest building this on a chain that doesn\u2019t require as much gas. Also, there are quite a few assumed prerequisites to be able to interact with the platform (based on what I\u2019m seeing so far) the first quest should be simple and get folks to claim their first POAP or something that doesn\u2019t cost anything.   Building an MVP in a shorter timeframe (<6 months) by putting together tools that currently exist and seeing how people interact with them. Such as using Mirror for paying for articles, Setting up knowledge bounties to get people to work on content, integrating with the effort on dQuests and so on   Some offers:   I\u2019ve been talking to folks at where I work and expounding the idea that education should be a public good, contributing to this knowledge base would be something we\u2019d be happy to help!   I\u2019ll drop this over to Bankless\u2019 Academy and see how the response goes   ",

                    "content": "Thanks a lot for this feedback @Fishbiscuit and @krrisis ! I understand that starting as our own workstream seems pre-mature and too ambitious but it was just a way of saying that this project would require collaboration across workstreams and DAOs rather than just being in a silo for tech savies. And I\u2019m completely fine with the approach of starting small within the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream if that\u2019s what the consensus is.   As you\u2019ve rightly pointed out, knowledge is extremely scattered. There has been several efforts to try to make sense of it but knowledge_curation_speed < knowledge_production_speed and its hard to catch up on what\u2019s even out there yet. That alone is a large project and can be quite opinionated in the sense that what you choose to include and what you don\u2019t shapes the minds of the folks that learn it.   Yes and our strongest opinion is that the content will be open source and we will leverage the use of existing open source tools like Gitbook for content co-creation.   What you\u2019re proposing seems really very very very similar to Rabbithole. I\u2019ve been doing Rabbithole quests and one drawback was that it was a good way for already crypto native folks to get further ahead but most people that were new to crypto couldn\u2019t figure out how to get started (signing, tx, gas, needing ETH to start). Building up that ramp is a massive UX challenge too!   It is indeed similar to existing projects at the surface, the one you mentionned is great but not open source and at the service of VCs. And they are also very opinionated on how people should learn. And in their case, you\u2019re completely right, it\u2019s mainly used by crypto-natives. So that\u2019s why on our demo, I explain the difference between our two main pathways, Branch\u2019ed: Theoretical content for users willing to learn how to use the best Web3 projects and tools. Decrypt\u2019ed: Technical content for developers and technology enthusiasts willing to expand their skills.   I\u2019ve been in some conversations about inter-DAO onboarding and a big challenge has to do with levelling people from 0 context to \u201cI can figure out what\u2019s happening in Discord\u201d-level context.   I completely agree, that\u2019s why project creators will be able to create their own pathway, to ease the onboarding process by giving an overview of their project in an engaging way.   It seems that putting the objectives of onboarding, learning, and engaging in a single platform might lead to a fractionalisation of intent so I\u2019d suggest picking one objective as a priority first !   The purpose of this is to have a centralised content delivery platform which is built on a decentralized and cost efficient infrastructure, you can think of this as a digital school where anyone is free to join and leave, where you learn therotical content, you experiment, you \u201cpass exams\u201d and get recognition for it. I\u2019d be more than happy to collaborate with you and the Bankless Academy!

Others have captured many of the thoughts that I have as well so I\u2019ll keep my feedback as short as possible. Budget and scope The budget ask and team seems a bit large to get started. I am all for talking about how we could bring you into the Decentralized Gitcoin workstream as an incubator to get things going and prove out the idea. I also agree that we could trim the initial scope to get laser focus and set the effort up for quick and clear results. Team There are a number of roles that probably aren\u2019t necessary to get started and at least a few of them might not be a full time role for one project. A few of the roles however could potentially be shared resources between dGrants and Discovery. Project management and the Product roles are good examples of that. I\u2019m interested to chat about potentially bringing on full time contributors to these roles that we would share within the workstream. Proposal Content While I love the detail, I think it would be helpful to split this into two documents. One which is a high level summary covering intent, direction, high level timeline, and team roles. This document could link to the next which would contain all of the greater detail that you\u2019ve provided here. That presentation would help get more people interested more quickly by trimming down the time commitment for reviewing. Let\u2019s chat! ",

From my position  investigating the future for a GitcoinDAO Ambassador program as a member of the InterDao Alliance involved with changes to onboarding at IndexCoop for Asia Pacific as KB4 cohort  I can confirm, there is common and agreed awareness of the need for education lead pathways to onboard and retain talented community contributors (and people at large) into the web 3 ecosystems. We have a small requested Q4 budget (6k) for the Ambassador program I would be keen to collaborate on this project as it would underpin the future of all onboarding initiatives, community development and growth.
