                    "content": "There is currently a discussion going on in MIP35 that would see maker lend assets purchased via the PSM to compound in order to gain some interest. I would posit that a better decision for maker to would be to try and get the USDC off of its books outright. so the TLDR of everything below is: auction off USDC to buyback MKR instead There are basically 3 motivations behind this in my mind:  In order for the PSM to do its job there needs to be sufficient room between the current liabilities and the line of the PSM.  As a result of this it seems maker is going to need to raise the line to infinity in order to ensure that there is sufficient headroom in the PSM.   Holding tons of USDC is not capital efficient bc of inflation associated with the USD.  solving this through lending via compound (or any other protocol) introduces even more counter-party risks that maker then needs to contend with.   There are counter party risks associated with USDC. (Not to mention the counter-party in question is your largest competitor)  However in order to be able to get the USDC that was purchased via the PSM off the books maker first needs to pay down it\u2019s liabilities associated with the PSM. See this post explaining dai liabilities. Luckily the protocol has a large store of equity that it can use in order to do this. image1098\u00d7246 9.3 KB The surplus buffer. So what i would suggest, is that instead of storing ALL of this equity as DAI in the surplus buffer we can convert a portion of it into equity stored via USDC in the PSM. So how do we do this? Well first we need to decide the rate at which we want to pay down the liabilities of the PSM. This could be implemented in a number of ways, but i would suggest that we pay it down like interest (maybe call the rate tint). That is, the PSM would have some annualized percentage rate associated with it and that rate would be \u201cpayed\u201d to reduce the protocol\u2019s DAI liabilities.  As far as the technical implementation of how to pay i believe all that needs to be done is to increment the systems sin. This would mean that over time the system would accrue sin via the PSM and once that sin reached 50K dai it would be paid off via the system buffer just as it is today. Over time this would mean that the protocol would gather equity in the PSM, so once you have 10,000 USDC worth of equity stored there you should be able to kick a flap auction the same as you do today with DAI only this time you\u2019re auctioning off USDC instead. The nice thing about this does not change the overall amount of MKR you\u2019re buying back. This is because you don\u2019t destroy any equity with this scheme you just change it\u2019s storage medium. Downside is that it does have implications on how quickly you can store DAI in the stability buffer which is still important as DAI is the systems unit of account. I wanted to throw this idea out there before MIP35 got too far along as a potential alternative, so this post is a bit rushed. That said, What do people think? ",

First lets take a look at Makers balance sheet. Untitled-2900\u00d7600 18.5 KB Note on the picture above positive numbers are in green negative numbers are in red. So you have some assets you have some liabilities nbd. Some of the assets are loans some is the USDC stored in the PSM. Now lets say you\u2019ve decided that you want to pay down the PSM liabilities at the a rate of 2% / year. That roughly works out to 1MM DAI that you would be taking from the protocols income to pay down the PSM liabilities. This is what I am suggesting you do by \u201cwriting off the psm\u2019s dai liability as sin.\u201d Untitled-3.1900\u00d7600 20 KB After doing that your balance sheet looks a bit more like this: Untitled-4900\u00d7600 19 KB Notice now that the PSM assets and liabilities are not balanced as they were before. So really your balance sheet looks a little more like this after doing that. Untitled-5900\u00d7600 20.5 KB And this 1MM in USDC equity is now what you can sell in a flap auction. Untitled-61800\u00d71200 31 KB There is no leverage involved in doing this though. The protocol is using money it already has to pay down its liabilities. Like @alexis says there are some catches with this though:  The protocol would be contracting its balance sheet in doing this. That means there is less DAI supply out in the market and that could lead to upward pressure on the peg, but you can manage this by setting your rate to a sufficiently low number. You\u2019ll notice that in doing this there actually is less DAI in the stability buffer when all is said and done. There isn\u2019t anything \u201cwrong\u201d with this per se, but you don\u2019t want to get too carried away with it bc  there is market risk exposure that you need to hedge against.  ",

The stability buffer is our equity and should be on the liabilities side. Now you are faced with the issue of which of your DAI box you decrease. There are not 2 pools of DAI but only one and they have 0 links to the asset side. Let me present my perception of what happen when we buy&burn MKR \u201cfrom the surplus buffer\u201d image1322\u00d7705 19 KB And what you suggest image1131\u00d7690 15 KB While different, they lead to the same outcome. The Buy&Burn with DAI increases the DAI supply (decreasing the surplus buffer while the balance sheet size remains the same). The Buy&Burn from USDC decreases the balance sheet size. But if the DAI demand stays constant (which we can assume), this will decrease the DAI price (supply vs demand). Therefore, this will be arbitraged using the PSM by providing DAI to get USDC. This will decrease our USDC assets and our DAI liabilities. Both methods are doing more or less the same. With USDC it is more efficient, but with DAI we get the PSM fees and DAI is a bit de-peg until arbitrage. ",

SebVentures:  The Buy&Burn from USDC decreases the balance sheet size. But if the DAI demand stays constant (which we can assume), this will decrease the DAI price (supply vs demand).   I think this bit about the DAI price is backward no? We are decreasing supply and demand is the same. If supply is less than demand then prices go up, so shouldn\u2019t this lead upward pressure on DAI price? I would note the extent to which this happens can be controlled via the rate you would be setting here. If the peg is in a bad state (>> $1 / DAI) you could set the rate here to 0% and then the system would be behaving just as it is today. You also stated that this will be arbed using the PSM. This could be true, but i would posit that it is a presumption. You\u2019re just as likely imo to see new leverage from vaults. Ultimately, both seem like \u201cgood\u201d outcomes to me on their face though. Either you have new loans you are collecting interest on or you have new tin fees that you collect from PSM arbing.

This is a bit of a tangent to my main points above, but i think it is still relevant to this discussion. The PSM in my view is a necessary evil. The DAO needed a tool to create negative price pressure that didn\u2019t conflict with the fundamental promise of DAI which is that 1DAI is worth $1 at ES. The PSM seems to have been able to serve this need. But at the end of the day USDC is DAI\u2019s biggest competitor to be the number 2 USD stablecoin product, so any deal where you ostensibly create demand for their product is counter productive IMO. It really all boils down to this market share picture. MakerDAO - 2021-01 Presentation960\u00d7540 88.2 KB You want DAI to eat into USDT\u2019s position as much as it can, and preferably you are doing it faster than USDC is able to. The picture above shows that at the moment USDC is doing a better job at grabbing USDT\u2019s market-share, and DAI is playing some part in that by buying up all of their coins. So really what is the DAOs motivation to increase the USDC liquidity by lending? Is doing that growing their market share? I don\u2019t want to rabbit-hole on this too much bc it is tangential to what i think the real motivations and issues are with this proposal, but i did want to add limiting the terms of your deal with the devil might be worth doing in it\u2019s own right.

Overall, I also think that having USDC is not ideal but the best solution for the peg right now. Buying MKR doesn\u2019t really provide much. What is needed is to stop using so much USDC as a liquid asset reserve and use something else. One path is cDAI/aDAi/fyDAI (which is exactly how the banking system handles money supply/demand imbalance). Not sure we need to care too much about competition from USDC, we should focus on delivering a better product. For that subsidizing (or not farming) DAI related AAM LP pairs is one solution. But far from enough. We need to find creative ways to use out excess of DAI demand to increase even more the DAI demand. I can\u2019t believe there are no ways in which 300M of capital to allocate can\u2019t help to increase the value of the DAI ecosystem. PS: cDAI/aDAI would decrease the borrowing rates for DAI which I\u2019m not so sure is good for DAI. If it\u2019s not good, we should use USDC to push down rates on money markets. If USDC owners can\u2019t get a yield good enough, they might switch to DAI (which lead to more USDC to compress rates). I\u2019m not sure. ",

For instance even if governance decided to \u201cflap\u201d all the revenues in USDC form, this would represent about 50m/year at new proposed rates and this is around 10% of current stablecoin collateral (assuming we can get stablecoin vaults into PSM). Which means stablecoin backing goes from 26% to 23% in a year. Useful but not a deal breaker. But I think this whole idea is more important because this solution of FLAPing other assets held directly by Maker can be very useful going forward. The bigger issue is with FLAPs efficiency in general and lack of keepers there, so we might want to first implement Liq2.0 to it. So I would say first priority is implementing Liq2.0 to Surplus Auctions if we wanted efficient FLAPs. Not to mention governance might want higher Surplus Buffer first, which could delay FLAPs. ",

                    "content": "Ok i have given all of this \u201cwrite off rate\u201d and \u201closses\u201d business some thought. See these two comments:     latetot:  My main question is don\u2019t you need to know the DAI/USDC rate to decide how much Dai surplus to write off as Sin?       alexis:  The issue by selling the Usdc for MKR or Dai is that you end up selling at a higher price than what you bought it.   So i think this question really boils down to how much did the protocol pay for this asset? Because we want to be sure that if the protocol is selling assets it sells them at greater than or equal to the cost it bought it at. I think the important thing to note before we try and address this is that all of the protocols accounts are settled in DAI it doesn\u2019t care about the USD value of anything, so what we want to know is \u201chow much dai did the protocol buy this asset for?\u201d Knowing that allows us to set a price floor, and since the protocol is ostensibly selling these assets to maker holders by buying and burning MKR it probably doesn\u2019t want to charge a large premium in this trade. That being the case, what we probably want to sell off the asset at cost.  To figure out what the cost, is you need to look at the balance sheet again and how it changes in a PSM trade. What you are looking for here is how much did the protocol\u2019s liabilities change in the asset purchase. That is your cost. I believe this is what it looks like. PSM-Cost900\u00d7600 15.2 KB You have (1 DAI - the tin amount) going to the asset seller and the tin amount going to the stability buffer, so how much did the asset in question \u201ccost\u201d the protocol? It cost 1 DAI, so if your are trying to sell this asset at cost you need to ensure that you sell it for 1 DAI to balance the books. Thus, the \u201cwrite-off rate\u201d for 1 USDC should be 1 DAI bc that is what the protocol spent. One thing i want to point out about this trade is that MKR holders get paid here too. That is the amount going to the stability buffer. Now lets come back to this losses business specifically: \u201cby selling Usdc for MKR or Dai is that you end up selling at a higher price than what you bought it.\u201d This is capital gains/losses and you incur those when you trade one asset for another, so the first thing that i want to note in this is that this happens when the USDC is purchased for DAI and it is happening today with the PSM with or without the addition of this proposal. Now we know that USDC value != to DAI value so by buying 1 USDC for 1 DAI someone has to be losing in that trade there is just a question of who. Well we can probably presume that it is not the seller of the USDC bc that actor wouldn\u2019t interact with the contract if it lost money on the deal. The maker holders get the tin amount on the trade so they don\u2019t lose there either. Now your probably thinking that it is the protocol because it paid the 1 DAI for the 1 USDC in the first place right. Well I don\u2019t think so. This is because the protocol doesn\u2019t really care. Like I said its accounts are settled in DAI so whatever the USD value of DAI is kind of irrelevant to the protocol. It just paid 1 DAI for some asset and that is all that matters to it. So if the asset seller didn\u2019t lose any money and the protocol didn\u2019t lose any money and mkr didn\u2019t lose any money who did? The DAI holders I believe. Their assets (DAI) are being diluted in the trade and that ultimately ends up paying the difference. That is why putting money in the PSM brings down the DAI price. At the end of the day though I think all of this losses business is completely irrelevant to this proposal and if we really want to wrangle with that it is an issue with the PSM itself not with selling the assets that were purchased by it.

Yes I don\u2019t think that play that much as people switch from cusdc to cdai or new user will go for the higher rate. The actual flapping usdc to buy MKR, is actually way more complicated at the end as what it sound as we need to touch the core system to introduce a flap on assert.     Andy_McCall:  USDC value != to DAI   I had another thought about it, what if instead of using the income to burn MKR we use then with the delegator to wipe off the PSM debt by increasing its Dai position and the usdc stays inside as buffer? The delegator is easy to change, it has been modelling for that. The benefit of it is that we don\u2019t need to do any auction so its direct with no lose. While I am not too much in favour as I think it is better to use the income and wait until the usdc unwind by itself this solution is easy to do with little effort and with little risk as we are outside the core system.

The DAI holders I believe. Their assets (DAI) are being diluted in the trade and that ultimately ends up paying the difference. That is why putting money in the PSM brings down the DAI price.   I disagree with it, the dai holders don\u2019t lose on it as it is dai is worse 1dollar. The holder can sell it at 1 or buy it at 1. which is the value of it. The looser here is the trader that switch assert to dai, the trader will pay a 0.1% fees on it which is actually very cheap for him as this decrease the volatility, the other looser is the protocol as it takes the risk of the opposite assert (usdc) for a little price but this position is compensated by a better value of the dai due to the 1:1 peg.

A considerable portion of the SB is \u201cinterest income from loans (SF)\u201d which by definition should be sitting under assets in the Maker balance sheet. I think the confusion may come from calling SB as if it was the bank capital (equity). SB and Equity are closely related, but not the same. ",

The tout is above the PSM one and the tin is below the PSM one. It is less invasive than having an assert flap and the end result is that same. You will decrease the PSM and increase the use of this one. Feature are: Sell : take the gem and return dai minus fees Buy : take the dai and retern the gem minus fees Withdraw: only accessible by gov. It is also gas optimised Vs PSM. If you are happy with it and write the spec I can push the first draft for the code. ",
