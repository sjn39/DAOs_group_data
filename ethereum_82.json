It also allows fetching token balances of locked and unlocked tokens (tokens available for transfer). Time-locking can also be achieved via staking (#900), but that requires transfer of tokens to an escrow contract/stake manager, resulting in the following five concerns:  additional trust on escrow contract/stake manager additional approval process for token transfer increased ops costs due to gas requirements in transfers tough user experience as the user needs to claim the amount back from escrow inability for the user to track his true token balance / token activity   Link to the EIP - https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1132 ",

It also allows fetching balance of locked and transferable tokens.   Time-locking can also be achieved via staking (#900), but that requires transfer of tokens to an escrow contract / stake manager, resulting in the following six concerns:      This file has been truncated. show original      ",
