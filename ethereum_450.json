                    "content": "Read the full text here Abstract Include an explicit definition of the acceptable timestamp drift in the protocol specification. Motivation There is a lack of clarity about how accurate timestamps in the block header must be. The yellow paper describes the timestamp as  A scalar value equal to the reasonable output of Unix\u2019s time() at this block\u2019s inception  This causes confusion about the safe use of the  TIMESTAMP  opcode (solidity\u2019s  block.timestamp  or  now ) in smart contract development. Differing interpretations of \u2018reasonable\u2019 may create a risk of consenus failures. Specification The yellow paper should define a timestamp as:  A scalar value equal to the output of Unix\u2019s time() at this block\u2019s inception. For the purpose of block validation, it must be greater than the previous block\u2019s timestamp, and no more than 15 seconds greater than system time.  Rationale Both Geth and Parity reject blocks with timestamp more than 15 seconds in the future. This establishes a defacto standard, which should be made explicit in the reference specification. ",

The proposal aims to clarify the acceptable timestamp drift to avoid consensus failures and confusion in smart contract development.

The post does not involve any collaboration, advertising, or entirely positive/negative feedback on the proposal.",
