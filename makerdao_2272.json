Proposed Actions  Option 1: Diversify Stablecoin Reserves  PSM-USDC-A  Reduce tin from 1% to 0.05% Decrease gap from 250 million DAI to 200 million DAI Decrease line from 10 billion DAI to 7.5 billion DAI   PSM-GUSD-A  Reduce tin from 0.1% to 0% Increase tout from 0% to 0.25% Increase gap from 10 million DAI to 150 million DAI Increase line from 500 million DAI to 1 billion DAI   PSM-USDP-A  Reduce tout from 1% to 0.2% Reduce gap from 250 million DAI to 150 million DAI     Option 2: Maintain USDC as Primary Reserve  PSM-USDC-A  Reduce tin from 1% to 0% Increase gap from 250 million DAI to 400 million DAI   PSM-GUSD-A  Reduce tin from 0.1% to 0% Increase tout from 0% to 0.01% Increase gap from 10 million DAI to 50 million DAI   PSM-USDP-A  Reduce tout from 1% to 0% Reduce gap from 250 million DAI to 50 million DAI Reduce line from 1 billion DAI to 500 million DAI     Background Recent US government actions have helped stem the imminent risk of cascading bank runs and losses on uninsured bank deposits. In particular the FDIC will be backstopping all deposits for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and the Federal Reserve has introduced a new liquidity program allowing banks to pledge approved assets (primarily treasury bonds and agency mortgage backed securities) to receive a cash advance of up to 100% of the par value of the assets. This should significantly reduce the risk of banks failing due to mark to market losses on their securities portfolios. However, there are still some outstanding risks and possibility of further bank failures and losses to uninsured bank deposits. The government has not explicitly guaranteed they will backstop all deposits for other institutions beyond SVB and Signature. Stablecoin issuers have taken a more risk averse position since the weekend, with the bulk of bank deposits across each issuer now held at \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions, which improves risk positioning. Among integrated stablecoins, USDP and GUSD seem to still have somewhat lower fundamental counterparty risk, with greater assurance of the stablecoins being bankruptcy remote and somewhat lower risk within their backing; GUSD bank deposits are held solely at systemically important banks, while Paxos has private bank deposit insurance to cover much of their deposit exposure that falls above FDIC limits. But despite this potential counterparty risk differential, risk of USDC has declined significantly since last week and further solvency concerns or depegs are not expected at this time.  Reasoning For Specific Changes Below we share some high level goals of the parameter changes and specific breakdowns for each poll option.  Option 1: Diversify Stablecoin Reserves This poll option seeks to more evenly distribute Maker PSM stablecoin reserves across several assets. This has the benefit of increased risk diversification, where a single stablecoin facing impairment would have a lesser impact on DAI\u2019s peg and underlying solvency conditions. Additionally, it improves resilience of stablecoin liquidity in light of the newly implemented debt ceiling breaker mechanism, which allows Maker governance to immediately disable minting from a PSM without standard governance delay. By spreading minting capacity limits (gap) across multiple assets, Maker is more likely to have open capacity available to keep DAI from floating above target price in the event one or more PSM is disabled; this improves safety in case of significant crypto vault liquidations while one or more PSMs is disabled. There are a few drawbacks of this strategy. Maker may make up a growing share of total supply of GUSD and USDP, which can present operational challenges to the underlying issuers if we drive significant minting or redemptions in a short time period. This can also increase exposure to treasury bill duration risk if issuers are forced to quickly purchase or dispose of holdings to meet mint or redemption requests. Maintaining a small fee to swap USDC into DAI may also impact user experience as USDC is currently much more widely adopted vs the alternative stablecoins. If this option is selected, it is anticipated that a further PSM update proposal would be submitted in the future to return USDC tin to 0%, once reserves are more evenly distributed across issuers.  Option 2: Maintain USDC as Primary Reserve This poll option seeks to normalize our PSM parameters more closely to their previous state, with USDC continuing to serve as Maker\u2019s primary liquidity reserve. Elimination of the fee to swap USDC to DAI (tin) will improve market liquidity and UX, particularly for RWA counterparties who may be set up to use USDC rather than alternative stablecoins. USDC remains the most broadly adopted fiat stablecoin in defi, and there may be usability advantages to favoring USDC vs GUSD or USDP. The main drawback of this option is that DAI would continue to have outsize exposure to USDC, which is arguably less resilient on a fundamentals basis versus alternative stablecoins. For example, USDC has potentially more risky exposure to uninsured bank deposits, and a weaker legal structure where USDC reserves may not be bankruptcy remote with respect to the issuer. If USDC faced additional concerns or depeg in the future and Maker were forced to use the debt ceiling breaker, concentrating minting capacity (gap) in the USDC PSM will also reduce available liquidity, as any increases to gap for other stablecoins would need to wait for the standard governance delay period. This has the potential to put liquidations of crypto collateralized vaults at risk if DAI price spikes upwards.  General Risk Considerations Each poll option gives a total of 500 million DAI per day of minting capacity through the PSMs (with specific distribution across stablecoins depending on the poll option). Based on current levels of crypto vault minting, collateralization levels of crypto vaults, and historical experience of daily inflows to the PSM, this is expected to provide more than sufficient liquidity to keep DAI from trading significantly above target price even during a severe market downturn. Maximum debt ceilings (line) for both GUSD and USDP do not exceed 1 billion DAI in either proposal option. If voters favor option 1, there is a realistic possibility of the maximum debt ceiling for GUSD and USDP being reached. However, it was determined not to propose a higher line in this option as holding a larger share of total circulating supply of either asset could increase various operational risks. For example, Maker driven flows (due to increases or decreases in DAI demand) could put issuers\u2019 operations under stress, lead to accumulation of cash reserves at smaller or less secure banks used for transaction settlement, or increase exposure to duration risk on treasury bill holdings if assets must be quickly acquired or disposed to meet minting or redemption requests. Each option slightly favors accumulation of GUSD reserves versus USDP (via relatively higher tout proposed on GUSD). This positioning is based on GUSD\u2019s existing marketing incentives for reserves held in the PSM, along with a broadly similar level of fundamental risk on reserves. GUSD has a higher share of uninsured bank deposits, but they are held at \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions, while USDP has relatively low share of backing in uninsured deposits but may have some exposure to higher risk bank partners.  Timeline and Next Steps This proposal will be submitted in the next on-chain polling cycle beginning Monday 20 March 2023, to be held as an instant runoff vote (IRV poll). If voters give majority support to one of the proposed options, it will be submitted for an executive vote on Friday 24 March 2023. Given the current accelerated GSM delay period, the proposed parameter changes could come into effect as early as 25 March 2023. Depending on the option selected and market conditions, further PSM parameter changes may be considered in the future. ",

Proposal would reduce USDC PSM balance to levels close to other stablecoins, but also alters Maker\u2019s total USDC capacity (200M gap and 7B line), that would mean ideally the balance level to accomplish this goal would be around 500-750M? Would this be safe given the RWA portfolio is already trending at 700M with an additional RWA investment of 750M just approved. These 3 stablecoins might have different banking partners but they all have the same counterparties exposure mainly: US government, SEC and FDIC  and investments (Deposits and Tbills). So the risk of uninsured deposits actually rises, each bank now plays a bigger role, while maintaining regulatory risk. Would adding a 4th and 5th PSM help diversify and hedge these risks? IMO the Tin, Tout parameters for the smaller stablecoins should be 0 while attempting to earn fees on the USDC PSM by adding small Tins and Touts but keeping the directional pressure, USDC has the most transactional activity and liquidity  Hopefully some of the above items can be taken into consideration for adjusting option 1 ",

After finishing dss-kiln PE should prioritize finishing the PSM 2.0 which will include debt targets via negative fees, oracle priced swaps and proper accounting to the surplus buffer. It is not a large amount of work since we get a lot of the accounting / targeting from the new D3M structure. The PSM 2.0 will just be a swap facility on top of a D3M. After this is done the balance sheet should be further automated with an initial ALM Controller which will allocate or deallocate these PSMs automatically based on the amount of USDC available. For example we set a desired target of 500m USDC and the controller will allocate to this mix of treasury deposits or liquidate depending on whether Maker is over or under this 500m number respectively. I understand the endgame stuff is highest priority, but I think for not a lot of work we can begin this process of automation with minimal work which should provide more confidence to DAI holders.

What expectations should MKR token owners have that GUSD will scale and such will finally get traction in DeFi? Please provide details of PMF.   My base case assumption is that the endgame mip set will pass, but as it is still being voted on for another week I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to firmly limit parameter selection based on pending proposal. With respect to broader adoption and traction, I believe that both GUSD and USDP have a significant opportunity for increased usage in light of recent experience with USDC. Maker\u2019s own actions may have a strong impact here both as a signaling mechanism for other defi protocols, as well as direct improvements to liquidity via the PSM. It is strategically much better for us long term if there are several economically sustainable and broadly adopted on-shore fiat stablecoins, versus the current paradigm of just one. That being said, if/when endgame passes we will work on closely aligning stablecoin exposures with the relevant scope frameworks (potentially with combination of PSM parameter changes and proposing revisions to optimize the scopes themselves).     TRUEMAKER:  Would this be safe given the RWA portfolio is already trending at 700M with an additional RWA investment of 750M just approved.   I\u2019m not super concerned about running out of USDC in the near term. If this happened and interfered with RWA deployment, it would be simple enough to realign the parameters to more heavily favor USDC accumulation (eg setting 0% tin and >0% tout).     TRUEMAKER:  So the risk of uninsured deposits actually rises, each bank now plays a bigger role, while maintaining regulatory risk. Would adding a 4th and 5th PSM help diversify and hedge these risks?   I somewhat disagree, as having smaller exposures across more counterparties increases the likelihood that any losses are within Maker\u2019s capacity to recapitalize (through surplus buffer or flop auctions). Additional fiat backed stablecoins could be considered, but at the moment unfortunately there aren\u2019t any other highly reputable options (both USDT and TUSD have significant concerns about transparency and beneficial ownership / internal controls).     TRUEMAKER:  IMO the Tin, Tout parameters for the smaller stablecoins should be 0 while attempting to earn fees on the USDC PSM by adding small Tins and Touts but keeping the directional pressure, USDC has the most transactional activity and liquidity   Definitely an interesting idea. The proposed fee parameters in option 1 were targeted towards slowly rebalancing the PSMs rather than revenue generation, but different tin/tout strategies are worth considering in the future. ",

I agree with you that diversification is good for limiting risk exposure, but what I meant to say is that splitting deposits equally among stablecoins and therefore more US banks is not really helpful with the current market uncertainty around US banks becoming insolvent. The risk of uninsured deposits would be allocated among more US banks, as you know fdic insurance is only up to 250k per tax id, so the benefit is only the 250k of FDIC insurance pickup while the downside is that that new US bank might be part of the contagion. So eg the 3B USDC (previously stuck at SVB) was split among 10 banks, the insurance benefit is only 2.5M, while the uninsured deposit risk is now higher because its spread among 10 banks, that could fail, at an equally problematic 299.75M.
