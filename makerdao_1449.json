One thing I take from the article without a doubt is that the best system, even with flaws, is democracy. ",

I think that one of the vectors of low participation is the lack of simple, easy to assimilate and summarized information that currently exists about Maker and its processes. In addition, Ethereum\u2019s gas always motivates them not to participate, the best thing would be delegates, but superdelegates that over time are only incentivized by increasing the size of the budget they can get, does not seem to be the solution either. It would be better to have delegates with short participation times, without direct opportunity to participate again, possibly alternating. It would be from my point of view the best, shorter to apply and a little less susceptible to failures. ",
