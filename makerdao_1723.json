Read on!  1600\u00d7827 112 KB  Roadmap: collapse version - only milestones. Timelines in these updates only include technical scope from CES CU. Most projects include work from other CUs and those timelines are not displayed in these updates.  TL;DR  Offboarding 5 Ilks (UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A) offboarding successfully executed. HVB Onboarding Spell was executed successfully minting 25M DAI which got swapped to USD and funded the first Participation Loans in HVB. All subsequent drawdowns have been executed successfully. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale onboarding was executed successfully. An rETH Token Assessment update was published and the outcome is that CSI stakeholders recommend waiting until new changes in rETH protocol go live and prove to be safe after the merge takes place. MIP65 Technical Assessment has been published and Counterparty Risk Assessment as well. Legal Assessment and technical implementation are under review. The onboarding spell is work in progress. We are aiming to go to mainnet executive by end of month.   Collateral Onboarding  On Chain and Off Chain Collateral Onboarding   1600\u00d71085 129 KB    EPIC: HVB Technical Assessment and HVB onboarding The remaining 3 executive votes were executed successfully. The total debt ceiling has been minted. CES has continued working on the automation tasks for this collateral:  Creating a keeper network job that will push the yield deposited into the RWAJar automatically once a month. Creating a registry for RWAs which will be a single source of truth for all artifacts used in each RWA so the keeper jobs can easily find any RWAJar that requires work in the future. Scoping the automated reporting for HVB: Ankura is tasked to deliver monthly reports in the forum with all the data about this deal. We will work with other CUs to ingest this data, add on-chain data sources and provide a view to the community on how the deal is performing. A new smart contract to manage Emergency Shutdown RWAs redemption is being worked on. Will be shared for peer review in the upcoming weeks and timeline will be defined. The goal is that MIP65 is the first deal that uses this new enabling feature and other RWAs onboarded can make use of it if decided so.   EPIC: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale OFH Onboarding Onboarding executive spell and subsequent spell to add permissions to the vault successfully executed.  EPIC: rETH Onboarding CES published an update on the Technical Assessment due to changes in the rETH protocol. The current CSI stakeholders decision is to wait after the merge and for new updates on the rETH protocol to be live to reassess whether to continue the onboarding efforts.  Collateral Management  1600\u00d7947 150 KB   EPIC: Deliver MIP65 Technical Assessment The technical and legal streams of work are moving forward as planned. We are aiming to be ready by end of month. Technical implementation is also under peer review and the executive spell for the onboarding is work in progress. A team formed of Monetalis, SF, CES, and Christian are meeting weekly to assess the progress and review timelines.
