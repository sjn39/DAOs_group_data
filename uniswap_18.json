                    "content": "@miligramkiloton You only earn swap fees from token swaps that occur after you added liquidity to the pool, so the earlier you do it, the longer your time exposure to potential fee accrual is, depending on how long you decide to add liquidity, the exchange value of token swaps, and the frequency of swaps. If you\u2019re in a pool early, you\u2019re more likely to have a greater share of the fees, since less people are typically in the pools initially. That\u2019s why the first LPs or stakers of a yield token tend to reap greater rewards, because they earn a disproportionate amount of tokens while the initial distribution rate is still significant, and the number of liquidity providers (and total value provided) is still low. This is not investment advice. I encourage you to DYOR ",
