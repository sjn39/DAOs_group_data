Paragraph Summary After the prior vote passed to manage the veNFT through Executive Spells, I met with @brianmcmichael and the Velodrome Finance team to understand how we could manage the veNFT in a maximally decentralized way. Unfortunately, voting the veNFT is not practical and an inefficient use of the PECU team\u2019s time. A multi-sig was determined to be the best solution for managing the airdrop.  Motivation The veNFT will allow MakerDAO to direct emissions to the liquidity pools of their choosing, increasing liquidity of the chosen pairs and receiving all trading fees and bribes for those pools. Weekly trading fees for the DAI/USDC pair alone have been as high as $150K annualized.  Multi-sig Signers I am seeking four trusted community members to volunteer to be signers for a MIP47 compliant multi-sig to vote MakerDAO\u2019s veNFT on Velodrome Finance. SFCU believe DAI pairs and in particular DAI/stablecoin pairs will be most beneficial for DAI\u2019s utility, but would encourage signers to coordinate with the Velodrome Finance team to maximize DAI liquidity and trading fees.    Create a MIP47 Compliant Multi-sig to manage the $VELO veNFT?  Yes, create a 3/4 MIP47 Multi-sig No, do nothing and receive no revenue from trading fees/bribes Abstain     0 voters     ",

This SR gauges community sentiment towards creating a 3/4 Multisig (MIP47) to manage the airdrop received for the newly launched Velodrome protocol on Optimism.  The DAO\u2019s veNFT are currently being handled by the Velodrome team. Multisig was chosen as best option, due to a lack of practical ways for PE to work with veNFT on L2.   This Signal Request will run until Friday, September 21, as stated above. If the outcome is in favour of proceeding, and an appropriate multi-sig on Optimism with named signers is created, an on-chain poll will follow.

We would recommend (and are happy to help with) leveraging the Velodrome team\u2019s expertise regarding how emissions should be directed. They\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time building models to understand what is optimal for each token. Today, IMO, we should support only DAI pairs, but there\u2019s no reason why we couldn\u2019t support future ecosystem tokens like ETHD, Elixir, and Meta Elixir if the End Game is approved. To be MIP47 compliant, we need 2/3 voters minimum - we could increase the amount of signers to 4/6 but trying to be conscious of the coordination efforts from the signers. Definitely open to changing if that\u2019s what the community desires.

Generally, we have avoided doing this before an item is polled on in an attempt to prevent unnecessary spending/labor. However, in this case, we will essentially be instructing Velo to send the NFT to a multisig run by a group of people (that still need to be identified). In order to prevent the NFT being sent to an address that has not been approved by MKR  holders, we should be explicit and provide the address the NFT should be sent to, if this poll passes. We\u2019re 5 days out from when this can be polled, so hoping this is enough time to set up before then. We can delay the poll if need be, but for security reasons we need the following defined before the poll is created:  A multisig address with 3/4 signature requirements (presumably, on Optimism). Confirmations in this thread with addresses from all signers.  Please let me know if you have any questions! ",

                    "content": "Chris.   I can\u2019t answer the how much value the gnosis safe multisig will hold but I can give some general information about VELO on optimism. https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x3c8b650257cfb5f272f799f5e2b4e65093a11a05#balances I have total outstanding VELO at 567M which at ~$.02 is ~11.34M give or take depending on actual market prices (I have seen VELO as high as .10 and as low as .016ish but this is from memory over past couple months. I would be surprised if Maker ends up with 10% VELO which would be 56.7M (and would be like 15% of the locked voting veVELO if locked in the voting NFT for 4 years).   Will have to wait to hear on specific details. Second point is that to vote on VELO rewards one has to LOCK the VELO into a NFT for some period.   Example is you get one veVELO vote for 1 VELO locked for 4 years.   This ofc changes to something more like 1/208 veVELO for 1 VELO locked for 1 week.    Total voting power is (on last calculation based on voting %'s) about 340-350M veVELO. Point here is that typically people are locking for long periods to get the greatest voting power, and hence the maximum voting rewards (via LP fees, bribes, etc.), once the VELo is locked into the NFT it can\u2019t be removed from the NFT until locking expiration, but one could send the NFT to another wallet. I already started some research on which LPs Maker might want to support and returns on these vary but run from 0% up to something like 200-300% (4-6%/week return) in $$ value.   Depends on how much VELO Maker has, and how long to lock which will determine the veVELO voting power but to put this into some perspective. Every 100K worth of veVELO (assume 1:1 ratio to VELO value for a 4yr lock) worth currently $2K US one can earn up to 4-6%/week (or 80-120 $$ US.weej) in bribes and fees. Since the goal of locking and voting this VELO will probably be to encourage DAI liquidity on Velodrome I don\u2019t expect returns to be as high as above and given the constant VELO rebases for the VELO price to continue to drop over time.

Of course, this is a very small issue, but it highlights the need for an unbureaucratic way to change parameters and affect small-scale changes publicly and transparently. Currently, a signer\u2019s address change on the veNFT wallet would need to go through a MIP, according to @prose11, since the original multi-sig resulted from an ad-hoc signal. A MIP is overblown for a humdrum change like that. We need a low-intensity method to maintain the system\u2019s already approved and working parts. Tagging @rune and @prose11 here for guidance on the ideal process. My proposal: Change request forum polls that cannot propose new items but only change already existing parameters. These change request polls could be delineated so they cannot change or influence any meaningful parameter. In the example above: A multi-sig signer could not be swapped out for a different signer. Just a different address by the same signer or signing organization. Examples: Change multi-sig signer address Change an off-chain parameter ",

Ultimately, it is our opinion that voters decided to authorise @rspa as a signer on the multisig, rather than a specific address. In the interests of reducing on-chain governance overhead, GovAlpha proposes the following solution.   @rspa posts signed verification that he is the owner of the new address he wishes to replace his old address on this multisig. GovAlpha will verify the signature and confirm we are happy for a change to be made. We pause until Monday. If there is no significant objection from the community, we can switch addresses for Raphael. If there are significant objections, GovAlpha will propose an on-chain poll for MKR voters to settle the matter. The transaction updating the signing wallet for Raphael on the multisig is posted in this thread for transparency.  Let me or @prose11 know if you have issues with this. Or feel free to post in the thread. ",
