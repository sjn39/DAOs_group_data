                    "content": "The peg is broken.   The PSM and several simplified variations of it that use a special USDC collateral type have been proposed that would enable us to mint Dai, sell the Dai and profit from the high Dai price, and help to restore the peg. One of the main sources of resistance to these designs is people\u2019s reluctance to take on potentially hundreds of millions of USDC in collateral that could create great negative publicity as well as systemic risk for the protocol. Let\u2019s consider the potential to use MKR as a collateral type to perform the same function as in the USDC schemes.  We would allocate say 50,000 MKR (~$25m) to a special vault that would be used to mint Dai, sell Dai to buy more MKR on the open market, and then repeat up to a specified LR. The main advantages of this approach is that it uses existing smart contracts, we avoid the negative publicity and centralization of USDC collateral.  Furthermore, it could provide much needed support for the current low MKR price. The only risk is the potential for liquidation in the case MKR price falls.  However, we have ways that we could handle such a scenario.  My preferred way is to turn off liquidations while Dai is above the peg and have unbacked dai.  Everyone buying Dai today at $1.03 is buying unbacked dai (as it is only backed by $1 of collateral) and yet demand for it is very strong.  Allowing a controlled amount of unbacked Dai (up to vault debt ceiling) should help restore the peg.  Once the peg is restored and we are able to generate stability fee income again, rather than burning MKR with the SF income, we would buy MKR to make the MKR CDP whole again and then we would unwind the CDP and burn the 50,000 MKR collateral used to create it. I think the risks of this plan are lower than the negative publicity of taking on massive amounts of USDC collateral in PSM like schemes.  Furthermore, it would allow MKR holders to benefit directly from the massive demand for Dai that currently exists but is providing no benefit to them. ",
