                    "content": "tl;dr - Over the last 6 months, UGP has successfully deployed $1.75M to 52 grantees. While UGP was initially funded to deploy $750k per quarter, UNI price has appreciated and the multisig now custodies an additional $8.5m. This proposal seeks approval for the following changes:  Extend the UNI Grants Program for an additional 6 months Utilizing the remaining funds, scaling the grants program up to $8.5M in grants All committee members to be compensated at $150USD/hr as needed for no more than 30 hours/week Due to time constraints, Robert Leshner, Kain Warwick, and Ashleigh Schap are stepping down from the committee, to be replaced by John Palmer, Ariana Fowler, and Callil Capuozzo  Vote here: Snapshot  The six month experiment in creating the minimally viable UNI Grants Program v0.1 is now completed. UGP v0.1 was designed to empower the Uniswap community and highlight it\u2019s most urgent needs. We believe that the program has successfully pursued this mandated, as evidenced by the vast talent pipeline and innovative projects funded already. I. Current State - Setting Precedent with v0.1 It\u2019s easy to make the claim that doing something is better than not having done anything at all, but UGP has hit fairly significant milestones for UNI, as well as for Ethereum, and even helping set the tone for other DeFi protocols\u2019 own grant programs. Examples of such with their respective goals and examples of grants are:   Pushing for innovation on decentralized governance tooling Goal: to increase number of successful governance proposals   Tally\u2019s SafeGaurd to protect treasuries with multisig accountability measures  Fish.Vote made launching autonomous proposals easy and accessible, even launching the 4th governance proposal and reaching quorum successfully  BEN championing UNIversity governance committees and metadelegations    Collaborative community activations Goal: engage and activate members of other communities to UNI   Chainshot - UNI developer course  Flipside & Dune Analytics V3 dashboard bounty competition UNIFest - collab with FWB with snapshot voting for artists and scheduling Sponsoring global eSports leader, Team Secret     Supporting open source infrastructure for Ethereum Goal: Fund projects that would have otherwise not found funding  David Mihal\u2019s Cryptofees inclusion of V3 subgraphs  Omar Bohsali - v3 developer libraries & toolkit, hardhat plugin Polywrap Web3API - UNI.js SDK  Josh Stevens - easy UNI SDK EIP-3074 audit    While most of these grants are still in progress, we have high hopes for the eventual impact of their work for the community. However, even if some grants ultimately do not produce their intended results, the open source nature enables others to pick up prior work and apply for their own grants. We believe that the last 6 months of funding and shared learnings show the potential that a community-led grants program can have in making significant impact. The goal for all grants should be to establish tight feedback loops on successful outcomes so as to determine whether there should be continued/future support (not just funding). II. UGP v0.1 Shortcomings Over the 24 weeks during which the application was open, UGP received 400 submissions and awarded $1.75M to 52 grantees. As to be expected with any pilot program, UGP v0.1 highlighted various areas for improvement. Cadence While the original plan was to fund $750k per quarter, developer interest immediately exceeded our expectations and we quickly realized that a 3-month cadence was too infrequent to effectively support the ecosystem. Taking notes from the Compound Grants Program, we moved from quarterly, to monthly waves. Reputation At the outset of its life cycle, UGP\u2019s marketing was minimal. While grant allocations are roughly on par with those found through established incubators like YCombinator, the program lacked a sense of prestige around it\u2019s reputation, which is a must for recruiting and maintaining talent long-term. We are taking steps to address this, both through a recent branding redesign and by proactively highlighting the work that grant recipients produce. In turn, many grantees reputation in delivering has led to increased UNI delegation and thus trusted stewards for governance. Compensation The amount of time and insights shared across the UGP committee has been invaluable but all members are extremely busy in their own right. It\u2019s important that committee members are not only values aligned, but also incentive aligned. The clearest path is by ensuring committee members are compensated in UNI for their time. Thus far, aside from the immediate application intake evaluations and interviews, the existing infrastructure for managing grantees, the human resources have not been sufficient enough. The ability to scale support for grantees, hackathon mentorship, event support, marketing, does not currently exist. III. Future State - UGP v1.0 But we can do better. The UGP Multisig currently holds $8.5M (at the time of writing), meaning we could increase resource allocation over 5x with just the existing funds. With more resources, the goal is to prove that UGP deserves more sustained funding and for a longer time. With an increased budget, more adventurous opportunities can be explored seriously. This includes but is not limited to: campus outreach programs, local community support, focused diversity & inclusion initiatives, academic research, base layer ethereum infrastructure support, and so much more. In the immediate next iteration of UGP, some clear impactful growth metrics are:   More grants awarded  more grants, sponsorships, and all around allocations    Faster processing times  creating the best applicant experience, from intake to compliance and disbursement, down to grant completion robust application improvements similar to how applying to YC is great pitch preparation    More proactive grants  UGP pipeline is reactive by nature but many high quality projects have been proactive    Greater percentage of completed RFPs/challenges  increased focus on identifying gaps and filling them more frequently    Creation of more resource allocators/subcommittees  recognizing the many community members more in the weeds in different parts of the vast protocol who often identify more precise needs and gaps in resources    IV. Next Steps & Open Call for Committee Members Following the Uniswap community governance guidelines, the proposal will be up for comments and improvement over the next several days. If there are no major changes, this will move to snapshot to finalize the decision to extend the program for another 6 months and the approval to allocate the remaining UNI via UGP v0.2. Like the proposal in May to extend matching funds to the V3 Bug Bounty, the funds are already in the multisig therefore does not require an on-chain vote. With the considerations above to scale the program and improve the process for applicants, our immediate plan that we\u2019re hoping to receive community feedback on is the following: Compensation changes  All members of the committee will be compensated for their time spent working on the program at $150 USD per hour with a 30 hour cap so as to prioritize their time (although based on v0.1, we don\u2019t expect most committee members to get there) Jesse will instead receive 1 UNI as compensation for all his time over the next 6 months Instead of a set amount of UNI, we will reconcile USD prices in UNI at the end of each month as you would with a standard payroll  Committee Changes  We are extremely grateful for Robert Leshner, Kain Warwick, and Ashleigh Schap\u2019s participation in getting UGP v0.1 off the ground but in order to properly scale the program, we would like to add committee members with the bandwidth to commit at least 5-10 hours a week We propose that the seats be filled by:   John Palmer, who is not only a grantee, but has already been volunteering his time to help with evaluating applicants and refining the application Ariana Fowler, The Audacious Project, formerly ConsenSys and UNICEF Innovation  Callil Capuozzo, Design Lead at Uniswap Labs  Jesse Walden, Ken Ng, & monetsupply remain over from the original UGP allocation committee multisig    We\u2019ll keep the snapshot open for 7 days or until we receive 40M UNI delegated in favor of this proposal, as we would for a formal proposal. Excited to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts in the forum! Vote on the proposal here: Snapshot ",

Since I\u2019m one of the proposed new members, I\u2019ll abstain from voting on this proposal. Additionally, I wanted to add a little more about myself and why I think I could help a lot as part of UGP. Here\u2019s a quick bullet point summary of recent relevant experience:   I\u2019m a Uniswap Grant recipient, having built Fish.vote to enable anyone in the Uniswap community to create a crowd proposal to governance   I recently helped create a new brand for UGP with Timothy Luke, another UGP recipient. A summary of our work is here: Uniswap Grants Program Brand   I authored the 2nd successful proposal on Uniswap Governance, to lower the proposal threshold from 10M UNI to 2M UNI. This proposal was actually executed as a crowd proposal on Fish.vote   For the past 2 years, I\u2019ve helped out with admissions part-time at Y Combinator, where I read and review applications. I believe this experience is extremely useful to assessing grant applications. I\u2019m also a YC alumn that previously founded an Ethereum-focused startup.   I\u2019ve helped design and build successful products in crypto, recently PM\u2019ing for PartyDAO as we\u2019ve built a product for collective bidding on NFT auctions.   For the past 2 years, I\u2019ve done extensive product and strategy consulting for startups. I believe this experience will translate well to helping grant recipients with their needs.   I\u2019d love to use this experience to help UGP in a more serious way. In the immediate term, I\u2019d love to focus on improving the written application, reviewing grant submissions, and providing hands on support to grantees building as they build and ship software on top of Uniswap. I hope I have your support! ",

Some quick math: I see 6 committee members, so 6 members * 30 hours * $150/hr = $27K per week if all used full allotment. $27K * 25 weeks (~6 months) = $675K This leaves $7.625M for grants, so $675K is about 8.8% overhead expenses for managing these funds. Have I understood the proposal correctly, or are there any additional expenses for managing the grants program which may not be captured here? ",

I\u2019d personally say not to think about it as 6x30x150 every week, since the point is not to just do 30 hours of work no matter what. My best guess is that this ends up being less than 50% of that limit each week. Additionally, I\u2019d say part of voting in support of this proposal is trusting these particular committee members not to abuse that policy or do unnecessary work. I personally trust everyone on this committee to do good and honest work. Perhaps it would be helpful to require committee members to get some kind of approval from Ken before doing a certain number of hours in a given week/month? ",

Does the UGP plan to follow up on past grants if some grantees prove they are delivering value to the ecosystem? Maybe its already been the case?     With a larger budget we can increase the size of grants, but I don\u2019t believe just giving larger grant amounts is neccessarily important. The better metric is to see where the larger allocations are going and why they require that much especially for those scoped in a 3-6 month time frame Definitely would love to see follow-on grants! This has been and will continue to be a goal!      DCinvestor:  I also think we need to work to keep such costs controlled and in alignment with the magnitude of funds being disbursed.   Absolutely in agreement here. As John said above, I doubt with so more hands on deck now and stated commitment to vetting and scaling the process, the upper bound is less probable. I believe most weeks, it will be 5-10 hours to ensure proper housekeeping is up to speed (pipeline up to date, funds disbursed, etc\u2026). Additionally, Jesse has agreed to 1 UNI as comp for the next 6 months (proposal updated to reflect this).     jcp:  Perhaps it would be helpful to require committee members to get some kind of approval from Ken before doing a certain number of hours in a given week/month?   If the community believes this is a good check to manage administrative costs, I\u2019d be more than happy to do so. ",

We\u2019re in full support of this proposal, the sheer impact that UGP has been able to have in the past six months is incredible, and we\u2019re sure that by both extending UGP and increasing the fund size, even more innovation will be able to occur. From projects improving governance to initiatives that empower the Uniswap & broader Ethereum community, UGP\u2019s impact is substantial and extremely worthwhile. We\u2019re fully in support of adding John, Ariana & Callil to the committee as well as the compensation mechanism to ensure incentive alignment for those on the committee. The one area where we see room for improvement comes in the transparency of the decision making process on both whether to fund a project and how much funding that project should be given - I haven\u2019t been able to easily locate a page that shows the reasoning behind UGP funding decisions for each of the grant applications. If these decisions could be made public (the explanation behind why/why not a proposal was funded), I believe it would go a long way towards demonstrating to every member of the Uniswap community the transparency of UGP v0.2. Although I can see potential areas where it doesn\u2019t make sense to share the reasoning behind funding decisions (ex. stealth products/inappropriate proposals), the reasoning behind the vast majority of funding decisions (especially for those that were rejected) should be made available to the public.

John Palmer, Ariana Fowler, and Callil Capuozzo have been important contributors to the Uniswap and broader Ethereum ecosystem and are excited to have them join the committee. As recommended by @DCinvestor and supported by @kenneth, we think it\u2019s important that the work done by committee members is as transparent as possible. As noted by @ratankaliani, we think that this transparency should be brought to as many parts of Uniswap Grants, especially in how funding decisions are made, dos/don\u2019ts for applications, the decisions behind the size of grant allocations, and progress of grantees over time. Marketing and building up prestige is imperative and is something that we think Uniswap is in a great position for. Perhaps one way to tackle this is to create a lot of good content around crypto startup best practices (tokenomics, how to pitch your protocol, build community, etc.) similarly to what YC has done over the years. This would be a great use of grant funds in the next 6 months. ",
