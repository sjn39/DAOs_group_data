There\u2019s a related issue against Parity that accomplishes a similar (if not identical) task, here: https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9126. They\u2019re questioning whether that should be an EIP as well. I looked over Jakub\u2019s EIP and it seems reasonable, but I think I prefer the solution suggested in the linked issue as it\u2019s more compact, just as flexible, delivers the same data (unless I\u2019m misunderstanding something), and doesn\u2019t introduce another end point to the RPC.
