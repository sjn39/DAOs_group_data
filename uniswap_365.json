I would like discuss adjusting the claim data/logic to make contract deployers eligible for the necessary subset of the unclaimed addresses. This would not add any additional claims above those which are already allocated. I am not yet sure of the feasibility of this proposal however I have the experience and skills to follow this proposal through should it garner enough interest / delegation. Thoughts everyone? I look forward to discussing this further with the community  ",

As a reminder, these are the criteria for inclusion:  Inclusion Criteria We define \u201cprojects\u201d as being any entity whose users were excluded from the retroactive UNI allocation due to the proxy contract issue identified above.
