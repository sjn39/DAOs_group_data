Last year it made possible the Magicians to exist and we will never forget it! EthCC 2017 set the tone for us and was the first time we formed a circle. A new need: small workspaces for team collaboration Currently it has been \u201ctalks\u201d and \u201chackathons\u201d and \u201ceating together\u201d, now we have \u201cworking together\u201d. In Prague I believe there were at least 14 teams doing this and it was difficult! In Paris there may be even more. Accommodating this new need is important and we all may need to get creative! Small groups of Magicians have been organizing into Rings and need time and space to meet. There is a need for numerous 10-20 person teams to collaborate over perhaps 2hr. The will need a white board, chairs, perhaps tables, these are things which our organizers can help with. I wanted to raise awareness of this need and perhaps we can get creative on another thread about solutions. I am interested in needs I am not understanding, and interested in space considerations and limits to what we can creatively do (example: tents?). Here is what a typical Ring meeting looked like in Prague. Some happened in hallways, was there even one by the food trucks?   twitter.com          Meridio (MeridioRE)     Great discussion today regarding the ERC-1400 standard at @EthMagicians, the interest in security tokens is rapidly growing. Collaboration is good for all, and Meridio plans to contribute to and integrate security token standards the community creates. #ERC1400 #ethmagicians  10:52 AM - 29 Oct 2018     8          3            ",
