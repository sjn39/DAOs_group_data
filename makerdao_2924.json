                    "content": " Background On Monday I introduced MIP 29 - Peg Stability Module which is an implementation of the PSM defined here. While I originally wrote the PSM implementation and MIP with the intention of going through the regular monthly governance cycle, it has become apparent to me that accelerating this process may be in the best interest of the protocol. Without mentioning anyone in particular, we are hearing again and again from credible sources in the rocket chat that we are losing market share to USDC with both integrators and users in Latin America. The reason being cited is almost always the issue of the peg not being at $1. I think with these past adjustments of USDC-A moving to a 101% CR has got us most of the way there, but we need to take that final step. Currently we are a worst of both worlds situation where we have massive stablecoin exposure, but are still trading at $1.01 USD. From a risk perspective, there isn\u2019t a big difference between having 500M of stablecoin exposure and 1000M. There has been hesitation in the past to go lower than 101% CR on stablecoins due to uncertainty about liquidations which has led us to have to consider some awkward options. At the time these options were the only thing available, but I now believe we have a better option with the PSM.  Proposal I am proposing we deploy the PSM with a 0.1% fee from USDC \u2192 DAI and a 0.1% fee from DAI \u2192 USDC. We can initially do this for USDC, and if all goes well deploy to the other stablecoins in the following weeks. It is important that we do this soon not only to preserve the peg, but because stablecoin vaults will soon be approaching a CR of 100% where we will lose an opportunity for a natural unwind by vault holders. By taking this course of action we get the following benefits:  Restore the peg. Dai will be forced to trade between 0.999-1.001. Collect almost exactly as much fees as we can get from the Stability Fees anyways. No longer have to worry about liquidations as the PSM will self-unwind when Dai drops below $0.999. Additional profit on the unwinding stage which would previously have gone to vault holders. We enable very large holders to go between Dai and Stablecoins without slippage. Most active vaults in all stablecoins should migrate over immediately if we don\u2019t wait too long as there is a profit taking opportunity. Any leftover (abandoned/forgotten) vaults can be manually swept over to the PSM as long as they are above 100% CR. As we get more tools to maintain peg stability we can back off with the PSM fees to find a more profitable/sustainable balance. This is in contrast to the stablecoin vaults where once you lower the CR you can\u2019t re-raise it. Switching to a fee model gives us all the revenue up front, and exactly.  To keep this objective, I\u2019ll list the cons I can see:  We will increase stablecoin exposure even more. Estimates are another ~400M Dai to push us to $1. Removes profitable opportunities for people speculating on the price of Dai. Price controls are not really a long term solution. We will need to eventually replace the stablecoin exposure with other assets. We are even more so at the mercy of USDC than we already are.  While this is definitely not a long term solution, I think it is good enough to both solve our current issues with the stablecoin vaults and fix the peg at the same time.  Technical Considerations The code for PSM is actually very straight forward. It is mostly using existing systems, so the smart contract risk is not high. That being said, if we are to proceed on this accelerated route, we still want as many eyes as possible looking at it before hand. Some other members of the smart contracts team are already giving it a look over. Security always comes first.  Timeline We are working against a ticking clock with the stability fees, and the sooner the peg is in-line the better. That being said, I still want to give ample time to discuss this, and if MKR holders don\u2019t want to go this route so be it. I will run this poll until Friday, November 20th. If people want to proceed, I will craft a governance vote for Monday, November 23rd. Upon success of that we will turn off the stablecoin Stability Fees in the executive for Friday, November 27th and aim for PSM launch the following Friday, December 4th to give the smart contracts team time to set things up. A passing governance vote will override the Stablecoin Action Plan. Note 1: I will continue with the formal process of MIP29 submission as well regardless of the outcome of this vote. If for some reason this passes and MIP29 gets rejected, we will work to close out the PSM. Note 2: I will also continue to run the Stablecoin Action Plan governance polls in parallel with the assumption that is still the route MKR holders want to go.  Polls There are a couple of options for the details of this proposal. I\u2019ll split them out into separate polls:    Do you Support this Proposal?  Yes, I want to proceed with the accelerated PSM No, I would like to stick with the normal MIPs process Abstain     0 voters        What should the USDC \u2192 DAI fee be (tin)?  0% 0.1% 0.25% 0.5% 1% Greater than 1% Other Abstain     0 voters        What should the DAI \u2192 USDC fee be (tout)?  0% 0.1% 0.25% 0.5% 1% Greater than 1% Other Abstain     0 voters     ",

But just to confirm, the signal process will work more effectively if people vote for everything they would be willing to support in an on-chain poll. The theory behind this is that we will end up with a greater level of consensus for the winning change which both sends a strong signal to MKR Holders when the on-chain vote takes place, and helps prevent the community from fracturing when making decisions. I like to think most of us are here for the long-haul. The fewer people that disagree strongly with the winning outcome, the better. ",

Let\u2019s say we put a fee at 0.1%, price will fall to 1.001\u2026 we accumulate in the PSM let\u2019s say 400M USDC which was needed to take the price down, if demands fall that will rewind itself, that\u2019s fine. If demands continue, we simply put the fee back to 1% again. Well, if the price goes up again we can simply place it in 0.1%, earning a lot of fees in the process. I don\u2019t see nothing wrong here, in the sense that we keep the peg within the 0.99 - 1.01 range, but using PSM in fact we guarantee that we\u2019ll keep the swings within that range. We will profit in this process, and many keepers / traders as well. Yes, we\u2019ll be accumulating more stable coins of course, but util having RWA, that\u2019s our best weapon anyway. For me it is bad if we have 1.01 steady, but if we facilitate those swings back to ~1.00 (up to the market and whoever buys at 1.01 when the price is guaranteed to go down), then I see nothing wrong with this. I really would like to see an accelerate PSM launch, I only see benefits TBH. Price is going down, but there is no guarantee it will continue (tomorrow some new token farming appear and it will go back to 1.01 again, and for sure things will continue popping up in the DEFI space). Note that I\u2019m assuming that for it going between 0.1 - 1 and back it\u2019ll take some time, earning much more fees in the process. ",

I think the problem will be fixed sooner than we expect, after the launch of the PSM. We already have embarked about 15% of all existing USDC. If we double or triple this (400-800m USDC more) the market will start to lack USDC and this should fix the peg (at least the peg DAI:USDC, not necessarily DAI:USD) quite naturally. ",
