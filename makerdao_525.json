Specifications  Motivation As an early enthusiast and user of the Maker system I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be contributing to the DAO as part of an official Core Unit. I joined the @dux-core-unit team as Product Manager in August last year\u2014just before we spun out of SES\u2019 incubator as our own Core Unit. Here\u2019s a recent forum reply in which I share some insight into the motivations that keep me going every day. In these past months I have helped the DUX team build a sprint cadence, roadmap & prioritization framework and other supporting processes to fully empower the rest of my team (skilled, senior and passionate engineers and designers) to do what they do best and remove friction where possible. Besides \u2018facilitative\u2019 work, my ambition is to continue engaging with stakeholders outside of our team (eg. other CUs, delegates, individuals in other DAOs, integration partners, etc.) in an effort to shape and execute on initiatives that seek to improve the governance UX of Maker. I\u2019m honoured to take on the more formal aspects of the Facilitator role since I believe it fits the work I already do and enjoy doing. I\u2019m also glad to realize that @bainpm will be able to once again fully focus on what he enjoys most and does best\u2014software engineering and related research.
