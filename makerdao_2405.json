                    "content": "With SCD we have successfully kept the peg depending only on changing the SF. This success in keeping the peg has a side effect (too high SF which is slowing the growth of DAI supply). That\u2019s why we need the DSR. Its real role is to fix the problem of the slowing growth of DAI supply. DSR fixes this problem by encouraging holding DAI which in return cause needing lower ST to keep the peg. Lower SF encourages minting more DAI and that\u2019s the real goal of using DSR. So what is DSR % should be? (1%, 2%, 5%, or 10%)? The answer depends on the targeted total supply of DAI we are trying to achieve. Of course, we want the DAI supply to be as high as safely possible. the limiting factor in achieving high DAI supply is having enough collaterals to grow the DAI supply. with MCD we will have Eth and few low market caps ERC20 tokens if we assumed 5% of the total market cap of these collaterals as the upper safe limit. we will have 1.2 billion dollars as maximum available collateral with the 300% collateral ratio we will end up with 400 million maximum Dai supply we can safely achieve with the currently available collaterals. of course, the DAI supply should be the lower than the upper safe limit. If we considered the range of 50% to 75% of the upper limit as a healthy target, we will end up with 200 to 300 million DAI as the targeted DAI supply for few months or even a few years until we could secure better and larger collaterals. so DSR should be changed accordingly if the DAI supply is below the targeted range then we should increase the DSR to increase DAI supply to reach the targeted supply. on the other hand, if we have exceeded the targeted range we should lower DSR to decrease DAI supply. what I wanted to say is that it is a mistake to change the DSR as a response to losing the peg (this should be kept as the SF job). DSR should be changed only to control the DAI supply. imagine this scenario! the DAI supply is 350m (which is too high) and the DAI lost its peg lower 1$. what should we do in this scenario? if we increase the DSR to restore the peg we will push the DAI supply to higher and riskier levels. on the other hand, if we decreased the DSR to lower the DAI supply we will worsen the peg issue. this is why we should separate the tools. so that the peg is kept by SF and the DAI supply by DSR.

Every dai in circulation comes from MKR, every dai has an eth collateral in the maker protocol. A dai deposited in compound only makes the revenue better for maker since we will be loaning at x% and not having to pay interest fees for the deposit. Those deposits in compound which already exist enable lower interest rates CDPs through compound but when their dai usage reaches limit their interest rates go above maker\u00b4s and therefore people move to mkr to mint dai at cheaper rates. Compound rates are dynamic if I\u00b4m not mistaken, maker DSR will be more predictable (as is the stability fee, predictable in the crypto term of predictable I mean), maker is the issuer of dai so there should be a trust component too and last but not least the option simply isn\u00b4t there now, we could presume that all compound dai deposits are 100% market share or most of it, a piece of the cake should go to maker simply because the option does not exist now.

Because if I were to say to you what if as a Maker holder you could choose between $1B being borrowed at 1% vs. $100M at 12%.   Which would you choose?  Inherently I think I disagree that Maker holders should only want maximum profit.  I think they also want a \u2018stable and reliable\u2019 system with minimized risk AND maximum profit in that scenario.  Using the DSR to control supply.   The idea that DAI minted by CDP holders deposited into the DSR controlling supply I think one will find is not that strong of a model to manage liquidity (Look at what happend to outstanding DAI as Maker SF went from what 0 to 18.5% and back to 5%.  It took a SF of over 15% to reduce DAI outstanding from ~100M to what 80M and now that we are at 5% the outstanding is over 100M and climbing in short order).   Also pay attention to what happened during this time to the PEG as the ETH price/collateral either moved up or down and how the PEG was lost.  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dai/ against https://mkr.tools/governance/stabilityfee In fact it would be nice to see the DAI PEG on the above SF chart. Notice on the SF chart the following.  As the SF was raised ETH price drops reducing DAI supply, BUT overall there was strong DAI growth generally until the SF hit 18% even with a declining ETH value.  This was when the ETH price was rising.  I really want people to look at the correlation between the DAI supply and ETH price on the short term (looking for dips or rises in ETH price and associated DAI supply changes).  I don\u2019t have the raw data on this to do a statistical analysis but to my eye looks like a pretty strong correlation to DAI supply and ETH price and a \u2018weak\u2019 correlation to SF changes.   Where we see the strongest effect is when the SF hit ~19.5% then dropped to 16.5 and back to 20.5%.  Literally there is strong DAI demand and I predict at current SF RATE of 5% Maker outstanding will hit 110-120M (the new limit) within the month. I really want to see the SF chart with a DAI price PEG from the multiple markets (say CMC data) as I believe that data would help me illustrate points regarding the PEG, liquidity against the SF.   Given the data I think the SF currently should be between 10-14% (this is very good for Maker holders btw).  I also believe while the SF has a moderate bias on the PEG what it really controls (in a slow fashion) is DAI liquidity. If Maker wants to improve the PEG it needs to figure out how to incentivize liquidity particularly during market drops.  Since the worst case is that collateral is losing value, the PEG is above 1 (or breaks solidly above) and then there is a liquidity crunch with everyone trying to scramble either for collateral or DAI. I think I have a few ideas on this but wanted to point out there is enough data already from the SCD the 0.5% to 19.5% rise and then \u2018wobble\u2019 to 16.5-20.5% before dropping to 5% to tell us what the SF should be and how this will also affect liquidity as well as demand. So be careful about how much the SF affects the PEG since a factor of 3 or 4 in interest is the difference between massively growing DAI supply, and only a slightly shrinking one! Given the limitations of the DSR payout against the SF revenue I think the use of the DSR to manage liquidity will be of limited value at best based on the data presented above. I also want to urge the community concern about growing the supply too quickly and running with a SF that puts liquidity at the voted ceiling and the importance of market conditions on collateral and DAI liquidity since this will have a direct effect on the PEG (whether it is maintained or not). A higher DAI ceiling and outstanding too close to the ceiling and I think this puts MKR holders at significantly higher risk.  To maximize return Maker holders want a steady growth path, with a well managed risk profile in conjunction with as high as reasonable SF (mostly to manage liquidity and outstanding against the liquidity ceiling).
