We also recognize that this \u201cvlog\u201d (and perhaps one day podcast) should include All MakerDAO @Recognized-Delegates as either special guest co-hosts, features, or any combination that helps spread the Good Meta of their Recognized Delegate platform. Going forward we will rebrand the vlog to the Drinks w/MakerDAO Delegates and hope to improve the quality of content in the near future.

Meet The Makers: Tadeo of Data Insights Core Unit In this episode recorded during EthWarsaw I sat down with @tadeo of Data Insights as we discussed the vital role his Core Unit plays in the MakerDAO Ecosystem and their thinking behind the proposed Endgame Plan, the incoming data tooling for Real World Assets, and Tadeo\u2019s role as a Facilitator. We hope you really enjoy this conversation as much as I did.      ",
