I think the broker dealer really just cares about the last note you made, which is that they will send DAI to 0x486C85e2bb9801d14f6A8fdb78F5108a0fd932f2 so that anyone can repay the position. The only thing that will change with this flow is the pick() call.  Once governance has the broker-dealer\u2019s address, they can add it to the output conduit such that the pick() will happen on that address prior to the draw(). ",
