                    "content": "Hello, I\u2019m Adrian, and I am very interested in taking on the role of creating your weekly MKR Holder update.  I have created a summary of week 4 ending 1/25/20 in a couple different formats for your review: It is titled MKR Holder DAI-gest: Weekly Governance Recap    (I love the name, I hope you do too).   Medium blog post:  MKR Holder DAI-gest   markdown style page hosted in a Github repository.  I have the repository completed, I just cannot insert any more links since my account here is new.   I have set up a real basic outline to follow weekly which include:  Statistics, Active and Upcoming On-Chain Polls and Executive Votes, Weekly Governance and Risk Meeting (links to recordings), DAI News and Resources I think that either format provided should be easy enough for the social media and forum posting.  I am willing to take this on as a six month to one year commitment.  In so doing, I am willing to take an ownership role in developing the repository, templates, how-to guides for handing it off, and all the other list of questions asked in the Weekly Maker Recap pilot link. I am very open to critique and do want to develop content that aligns with your vision.  I just have ideas, some are great, some aren\u2019t.  I am easy to work with, reliable, and eager to support MakerDAO and DAI, as I think this is a wonderful coin.  My favorite crypto of them all.  You can see my ratings on my Gitcoin profile: gitcoin.co/adrianhacker-pdx for a quick reference check.  Hope to hear back soon. ",
