These users are not helping the project or holders of UNI who\u2019s primary focus is now towards governance and helping Uniswap move forward instead these users are hijacking this forum purely for the money aspect not providing any value to the platform or its users. Would be great to see the forum be brought back to its glory with discussion about genuine proposals and not garbage towards how one has missed an opportunity ",
