                    "content": "TL;DR In Season 16, MMM will continue to focus on providing support for the Grants Protocol launch, the Grants Program Success and Community Engagement. To do so, we are requesting a budget of $471,949. Our top priorities for this season include:  Finalize overall Gitcoin, protocol, Passport and Grants Program branding strategies Launch (or make significant headway in launching) a new gitcoin.co website Developing and socializing communications around GR16, the sunsetting of the centralized grants platform (cGrants) and our transition to the protocol Developing and releasing an Impact Report to highlight the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program Develop and test an engagement strategy that targets three core community audiences (which were identified and researched in S15)  Amount MMM\u2019s S16 budget is $471,949 (+13% vs S15 budget of $417,543). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, MMM is requesting $686,239 for Season 16 from the treasury. There are several reasons for a 13% increase in our budget. Listed below are initiatives that we are newly taking on in an effort to prepare ourselves for a successful launch of our Grants Protocol:  Absorption of the grassroots initiative Building and launching a new Gitcoin.co website [a new initiative] Development of more robust strategies around partnerships, influencer marketing and PR & Comms Integration of Schelling Point event from a brand & creative standpoint Visual refresh of the Gitcoin brand, Grants Program and Grants Protocol Increased efforts to market Passport UNICEF round promotion   Milestone Report All in all, MMM performed well in terms of tracking to S15 OKRs. There were many changing priorities over the course of the season which resulted in a lot of . This likely had to do with a change in leadership at MMM and a lack of context on what the DAO needed at the time of budgeting. There were also several  that mostly had to do with metrics that were mostly out of MMM\u2019s control. This is a great learning for the team to set OKRs directly related to outputs within our control.   Success  Incomplete but will hit goal  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled     Initiative/Dept Objectives Past Season Key Result     Protocols Discover & refine product-market fit for Gitcoin\u2019s protocols (with premier partners). We will both shape and communicate our products & protocols. We will shape it by doing customer & competitor research (to help identify unmet needs) and persona development (to better define the target audience). We will communicate it with content and collateral, market education, and coordinated & effective product launches.  Protocol sales materials created and being used by sales team * The grants protocols weren\u2019t mature enough to push for adoption this season      Protocol product marketing pages integrated into website* The copy and wireframes are complete, but we are still aligning on strategic messaging and creative      Brand/positioning strategy finalized for protocols      Complete key website migration changes of Gitcoin.co including homepage and grants page banners to MMM\u2019s control and revised top and sub navigation (aligned with Protocol launches)      1000 new passports created from content marketing traffic (blogs, Twitter, etc.)* We are still waiting for issues to resolve with Ceramic to verify if this was accomplished or not      5 autonomous partner integrations from SDK traffic* The grants protocols weren\u2019t mature enough to push for adoption this season      Publish 3 new branded walkthrough demos* The grants protocols weren\u2019t mature enough      Finalize names, logos and typography for the grants product suite and each individual product      10,000 cumulative views on Grants Protocol blog posts* There wasn\u2019t enough alignment on the product vision and roadmap to develop a robust content marketing plan. We remedied this by running several strategy syncs with GPC, putting us in a good position to accomplish this goal in S16      Grow awareness of the protocol through co-marketing efforts and case study creation with Optimism and Fantom      5,000 total visitors on Grants Protocol website page* We did not launch the page, and this is ultimately tied to the lack of alignment on the product vision and roadmap to develop a robust content marketing plan   Programs Grow awareness, comprehension, and participation for Grants Rounds.Awareness, comprehension & participation will grow successively round over round for all target groups: matching partners, grantees & individual funders  10% increased in unique (non-sybil) contributions (15,000)* This goal is not congruent to what MMM has control over and we\u2019ll be setting measurable targets in the future of pieces we have more control over (such as engagement metrics). Many people get stopped at the checkout cart due to a variety of different UX issues. A more accurate measure for MMM might be the number of users we drove to the cart. Beyond that point, we don\u2019t have much influence/control.      10% increase of grants receiving $5,000+ in funding* This goal is not congruent to what MMM has control over and we\u2019ll be setting measurable targets in the future of pieces we have more control over (such as engagement metrics)      80% grant saturation for ecosystem and cause rounds      Comprehensive grants program marketing strategy by end of season* Paused on grants program strategy but doubled-down on audience research and content analytics to create a more robust program marketing strategy for a program re-launch in S17      Deliver Grants Round marketing internal runbook      Implement SEO audit recommendations into back-end of Gitcoin.co website      Develop marketing templates & toolkit for ecosystem partners   Community engagement Grow Gitcoin community, deepen engagement & improve brand affinity. We will have a unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO & our community will be empowered to champion our vision, mission & activities organically  Develop community engagement strategy to align and coordinate grassroots efforts of PGF, DAO Ops and MMM (including identifying audiences and outlining/aligning on DAO-wide objectives)      Develop and execute Twitter channel strategy* Rather than developing a Twitter channel strategy, we did an audit of Twitter and allocated resources to audience segmentation and research to inform experiments in S16 that will contribute to a robust channel strategy in S17      With increased Twitter content outputs, maintain engagement rate of 2.5% (includes likes and RTs)      Increase number of Twitter followers by 10% (12,000 followers)   MMM OS Refine our OS for a thriving MMM Workstream & DAO.We will have a world-class marketing team who is working in thriving partnerships across the DAO and in the broader web3 community.  End of season OS health measurement scores of at least 80%* Removed from our list of priorities.      100% of contributors have their roles and responsibilities documented and accessible to other contributors      Publish a roadmap for MMM\u2019s activities over the next 6 months in collaboration with all other Workstreams      All core MMM contributors experience a peer performance review (exact contributors TBC)     Other S15 Wins!  We double-downed on creating clearer lines of communication between GPC & MMM to support a re-alignment of priorities. MMM knocked GR15 out of the park by establishing a solid partnership with PGF We identified our target audience segments of our community and started user persona work alongside GPC & PGF We conducted donor audience research and supported with grantee audience research The vast majority of our roles and responsibilities are fully documented for everyone in the Workstream Transitioned our email CRM to Hubspot Migrated to a new, highly functional Gitcoin.co/blog  Launched the new Passport marketing page   Completed S15 retros and gained lots of insights and learnings for different aspects of MMM including our OS, Programs, Protocols, Brand & Creative, Content & Social media, and Analytics & Development Set up process and procedures for a well-oiled Content Pipeline   Published 23 blog posts with over 20,000 views and counting\u2026 Continued to run the weekly Gitcoin Digest (most recently released issue #39) Created over a dozen pieces of governance including a reimbursement policy, a new Weekly Sync format and a clear process for understanding contributor tiers    S16 Goals The outcomes below lack metrics compared to last season. The reason for this is:  Protocols - over the next 3 months, the Grants Protocol and Passport are still in early stages of development and are not driving toward any particular metrics. As such, MMM will abstain from setting any unnecessary metrics-driven goals. Program - since we will be running a small Grants Round with minimal promotional effort, we will mostly be focused on executing according to requests from the PGF team while monitoring existing benchmarks on Twitter and through email. Research-backed content - this season, our content team is going to be wholly focused on experimenting with different channels and types of content, playing with headlines, formats, etc. in order to better understand our audiences and their needs come S17. Our main focus this season is on running experiments, measuring and running more experiments. With our learnings, we will be prepared come S17 to create high impact, desirable content for our audiences.  Generally, MMM is focused on Protocols delivery even/over Program delivery. That said, we always strive to deliver 100% on all fronts.     Objective Name & EI Objectives Outcome Description Likely Initiatives/Projects     What is it? What will be done?

I am really pumped to see that there may be more collaboration between the SP team, and the MMM team as well. I want to summarize some of my understanding for the work ahead - this is the first season we will be really building and marketing three distinct protocols, at the same time we are transitioning our grants program from cGrants to Protocol (which reduces the marketing burden of \u201crunning a round\u201d but increases the burden in our general website, and brand positioning and understanding).

Does that seem accurate?   I would say this is mostly accurate. We are still finalizing some details but TL;DR related to what you highlighted:  We are doing a lot of building and marketing of our protocols in the background, in anticipation of a heavy marketing play in S17 We are not 100% sure if we plan to marketing three distinct protocols vs. two (Passport and Grants). We are still determining what the best course of action is to ensure that our messaging is clear and accurate for our different audiences. Transitiong our grants program from cGrants to Protocol - 100% correct. Everyone should see a comms plan circulating internally in the next week or two.      annika:  the \u201ctop priorities\u201d listed in the TL;DR don\u2019t quite map to the S16 goals\u2026   This is a great point. I\u2019ve gone ahead and re-organized the priorities to put Protocols even/over the Grants program.

I think they only went OK - there was a major focus on showing each other appreciation vs. creating a culture of high performance. I think this is because our culture at the time wasn\u2019t as open to receiving that kind of feedback. In this past season (S15) we ran a session with less of a focus on appreciation (which we have a ritual of doing each week at our Weekly Sync) and more on creating commitments to high performance. Not only was the feedback given/received by everyone more impactful, our group session gave everyone the opportunity to share learnings and insights from their feedback and to create public commitments about what they are going to strive for next season. The main gap I see from last season that we will look to rectify this season is creating clear accountability around those commitments (by writing them down somewhere and tracking how they performed against those commitments). If you (or anyone else) have ideas on running effective peer/performance reviews, please post them below or send me a DM in Discord (CoachJ#0481) - would love to learn how to improve our process! ",

We are going through one of the most aggressive bear markets with the whole crypto sentiment being as negative as it can be. At the same time the macro outlook of the global economy is also terrible which points us to really hard times ahead. This DAO spends like nothing is happening. I firmly believe there should be aggressive reduction in  expenses and the MMM workstream seems to me like a good to have, but not essential to the operation of Gitcoin. As such I am voting No. ",

I appreciate these perspectives and I really look forward to having the Steward Council active so that folks can help advise on where/how they would like to see cuts. So much of what MMM does has far reaching impact, and we are still working to evolve as the Protocols come online. As I look what the team is doing, there is maybe 20% of it I could see us punting on (for 3-6mos) but it would put us behind (IMO). Startups hit a trough of spending right before they break out of the atmosphere. In our case, our ambition is to launch the protocols and really work to make sure those are impactful for communities who want to build on them. I am not sure that meaningful cuts would allow for us to have that impact. but, I am certainly in the forest and may be having a hard time seeing through the trees. ",

I think it is worth connecting directly with Griffith to learn more about how Giveth is run. How is it that Giveth has launched a half dozen protocols on 10x less budget than Gitcoin has?  See Griffith\u2019s comment below.    Is Gitcoin over its skis? should we hold spending flat while addressing unavoidable risks?   Giveth spends around $120k a month with 40+ paid contributors, ~50% being full time, and GTC is spending 10x that, but it is not an org 10x the size   ",

Apologies if questions and comments are naive while I get my footing MMM has been the work stream I have followed most closely since engaging with Gitcoin\u2014and also where I have the most friends in the organization\u2014so I know they have been doing great work. However, it is a bit shocking to see an increased budget request for marketing during current market conditions. In fact, Gitcoin is the ONLY non-institutional organization I have spoken to in the last 6 months that plans to increase their marketing budget, which is usually the first to be cut in circumstances like these. Granted, with the rollout of the protocols there is a necessity for making people aware and driving user acquisition\u2014I just wonder if there is a better cadence or sequence of events that would allow for product development to proceed while MMM \u2018HODLs\u2019 until conditions improve. I noticed a lot of S15 goals were not hit due to \u201cgrants protocols weren\u2019t mature enough\u201d which signals to me that there is misalignment on roadmap & timeline between work streams. Similarly, MMM\u2019s task of protocol adoption will be significantly more challenging in the current market. It is a bit relieving to hear that you are pulling back on metric-driven goals related to adoption until the protocols have matured, but I would still encourage the team to set any relevant KPIs around the research & strategy objectives under the \u2018Protocol\u2019 and \u2018Community\u2019 pillars. Further, despite very similar budget requests for Protocol & Community (~159k each), it would appear that Community has a much lighter lift of tasks. A further breakdown or KPIs would help explain this. Despite these concerns, I know the work that MMM does is essential and that their contributors are hardworking & well-intentioned. This proposal is well thought out and thorough, but arrived at a time when there seems to be a wider ongoing debate on the DAO\u2019s spending. From reviewing all 5 of the recent budget proposals, my gut tells me that there is a lot of money, time, and energy to be saved with better effort on Cross-DAO-Coordination efforts. Duplicated efforts and misaligned roadmaps/timing often results in a lot of waste! Looking forward to following the discussions on this moving forward. ",

                    "content": "This is the draft budget proposal for FDD requesting funding for Season 16 (1 November 2022 through 31 January 2023).  TL;DR In Season 16, FDD will focus on building open source fraud defense tools to support the DAOs overall transition to the protocol. It will be done by building on our season 15 hackathon success of starting an engaged open data community, dogfooding our tools during gitcoin-led rounds, and finding sustainable models for continued defense for Gitcoin UI, Gitcoin Grants Program, and Community Grants Programs.  We will improve our ability to quickly build modular and composable business intelligence tools which communities can use to reduce fraud, allocate resources better, and promote learning between ecosystems on the new protocol.  In addition,  \u2026 by talking with round owners, we will find sustainable funding options for continuous fraud defense provided by the open data community.   Amount FDD\u2019s total Budget Request for S16 is $349,500. This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.     Gitcoin Season Season 14 Season 15 Season 16     Season Budget $330,000 $349,500 $349,500   Season Reserves $220,000 $233,000 $198,349 2)    Unspent Reserves % 1)  100% 100% 100%   Treasury Request $281,041 $362,500 $384,151    1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower. *2) FDD received $220,000 in reserves at a GTC price of $1.95 in S14. With the GTC price of $1.66, these reserves are worth $198,349. The full amount (100%) will be rolled over to the Season 16 budget request.

These wins include creating a number of new Sybil scoring LEGOS, building an open data community, and formulating service level agreements with others parts of the DAO + round managers. There\u2019s a lot of great progress FDD is making; your efforts to share that progress with the public is putting Gitcoin at the center of the web3 - Sybil defense discussion. I have communicated more detailed feedback via Discord, but to summarize my concerns here for other Stewards:  I\u2019d like to see fewer OKRs, but with clearer links to DAO-wide objectives. It may be confusing to Stewards when objectives have more than one Essential Intent (EI) tagged to them. Some of the KRs feel hard to measure and lack specificity. Similar to @lthrift\u2019s point, research & experimentation should be in the service of building better mechanisms for Passport, Grants Hub, and Round Manager. I\u2019d like to see measurable KRs that other parts of the DAO (not just FDD) will point to and say, \u201cyes, that number is important for us to hit\u201d. I\u2019m worried about workload distribution across the team, particularly the new contributors. Personally, I\u2019d like to see each contributor taking responsibility for a smallish number of high-impact outcomes.  Overall, my worry is that this budget might not gain strong support from Stewards, not because contributors are focused on the wrong things, but because the current presentation requires a fair amount of mental effort / context to understand exactly what FDD is working on and why it\u2019s essential for the DAO.

That said - I feel FDD is extremely aligned w/ the overall purpose of Gitcoin and current focus as far as I understand it.  Specifically - in order to enable communities to fund their shared needs these communities need to both a) have access to the gitcoin protocol and passport and related software and b) possess the expertise necessary to protect and operate those rounds. FDD has proactively undertaken to decentralize itself - to externalize and grow the data science and related skills it has via hackathons and a nascent community and also by packaging and distributing the anti Sybil legos it has created. Why is this so important?  It is not much of an overstatement to state that quadratic funding does not work without the sort of dual approach to Sybil resistance via passport from the GPC plus anti-Sybil analysis and related data science from FDD.  The data on this point clear - and to me so too is the purpose and the strategy of FDD. This short note isn\u2019t intended to substitute for detailed feedback and discussion. Rather I just wanted to add my perspective on the centrality of FDD to Gitcoin\u2019s purpose and strategy - especially during this transition to a protocol & community based future. ",

TL;DR In Season 16, FDD will focus on building open source fraud defense tools to support the DAOs overall transition to the protocol. It will be done by building on our season 15 hackathon success of starting an engaged OpenData community, dogfooding our tools during gitcoin led rounds, and finding sustainable models for continued defense for Gitcoin UI, Gitcoin Grants Program, & Community Grants Programs.  We will improve our ability to quickly discover and build a modular fraud defense system (consisting of open source \u201cLEGOS\u201d) that communities and round owners can use to reduce fraud, allocate resources better, and promote learning between ecosystems on the new grants protocol.  In addition,  \u2026 by talking with round owners, we will find sustainable funding options for continuous fraud defense provided by the OpenData community.   Amount FDD\u2019s total Budget Request for S16 is $349,500. This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the budget can be found at the end.     Gitcoin Season Season 14 Season 15 Season 16     Season Budget $330,000 $349,500 $349,500   Season Reserves $220,000 $233,000 $172,615 2)    Unspent Reserves % 1)  100% 100% 100%   Treasury Request USD $281,041 $362,500 $409,885   Treasury Request GTC   267,899 GTC    1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower. *2) FDD received $220,000 in reserves at a GTC price of $1.95 in S14. With the GTC price of $1.53 (Nov 22nd 2022), these reserves are worth $172,615. The full amount (100%) will be rolled over to the Season 16 budget request.

It\u2019s easy for FDD\u2019s contributions to be overlooked, especially during a bear market, when every cost and budget request deserves scrutiny. That said, I truly believe that decentralized identity and Sybil resistance are critical to the credibility of quadratic funding (\u201cnow us\u201d) and as primitives for regenerative society (\u201cfuture us\u201d). FDD\u2019s proposal for S16 has my support because it will continue to position Gitcoin as a leading voice on decentralized identity, engage a broader community in developing Sybil defense mechanisms, and start offering new utility for Grants and Round Managers on the protocol.

I suspect these exercises are not the most fun part of the job, but I do appreciate the work you put into summarizing S15 and mapping a plan into S16. My observations when comparing S15 results and to S16 plans:  It looks like FDD has made progress in telling the FDD \u201cstory\u201d.  You have a technical area and given few stewards volunteered to review the FDD budget, socializing your story is important work.  Well done. In S14, FDD squelched $80K in fraudulent activity.  In S15 that jumped to $785K.  It was not really a cost avoidance so we cannot attribute an ROI to the work, but the intangibles (trust in the brand) is something to be celebrated systemically.  Perhaps this story feeds into the MMM Impact Report that @alejandro is working on or the content pipeline @mathilddv is building for blog content?  I really like the use of twitterspaces in relation to the hackathon and think that is headed the right direction.  Regarding the Open Data Community (ODC) objective - I find this initiative compelling:     tigress:  Sustainable: as measured both by progress towards decentralized governance and mechanism design and by sources of funding and utility.   The creation of a web3 decentralization measurement is a public good in and of itself.  And if socialized well, it could be a significant forcing function of change.  I am not sure how funding and utility work into that but I am interested to see the outcomes and add any help I can along the way.     tigress:  Discovery of a self-sustaining model for on-chain governance via a fair launch using grants protocol.   Related to the above, I was in two different calls this past week related to lamenting the lack of thought / tools in this area for startups.  As we develop our own plans, might be interesting to link this to the work Gary is doing on \" \u201cBuidl in Public\u201d\"  - because it looks like there is a need.     tigress:  Funding options will be available for FDD service to decentralized grant rounds in addition to a sustainable model for maintaining OSS products.   This is exciting - and will be great to prove out a \u201cprotocol business model\u201d .  The term \u201cbusiness model\u201d does not need to have a negative connotation, it only describes how we link goals > to actions > to the allocation of resources.  In this case, how the market will allocate resources (funding) back to the services you are developing.   Thank you for thinking about this.  As I think around the corner to an extended or worsening bear market, this could come into sharper focus.  For everyone. ",

The open data community provided these outputs as an experimental component this last season. # OpenData Community Hackathon Results - #4 by epowell101 Finding founding partners will allow the entity to be neutral like the Linux Foundation. The open data infrastructure it incubates will include open source and decentralized components a service provider like Dune Analytics or Flipside Crypto would use, but has no business model. This is how the open data community will attempt to stop centralization via a \u201cdeath from 1,000 cuts\u201d. We will do it by preventing one cut at a time. This burden is all for all of web 3. Now that we are launching the protocol, we face this challenge directly. We could spend DAO funds to build this infrastructure for everyone, but the open data community is a better strategic move. ODC will allow us to not only share the cost burden, but allows for a non-competitive partnership with all the data indexing services. This lets us aggregate data sets for analysis on specific use cases. By crowdsourcing analysis, the analysis quality improves and its cost goes down. At the same time, because this is where the analysts \u201chang out\u201d, the vendors are willing to pay to participate. Lastly, this is an interesting opportunity for us to dogfood the protocol. The project has had it\u2019s initial payments go out via Quadratic Voting. We would love to fair launch this community with a bicameral house where participation is the only way to earn governance. This can all happen onchain now that we have the grants protocol and aqueducts to replace the oracle components that would have been needed before. ",

Steward view:his budget is considerably smaller than the other WS budgets. 1.Overtime FDD appears to be have been faster in organizing, evolving, treasury management and now the team consists of data scientists, data analysts and mostly people with huge data/anti-fraud experience. 2.Sometimes it feels that the workstreams that are more efficient are put even under more \u201cpressure\u201d to evolve further. As a former team member I can honestly say that the FDD has  navigated decentralized decision making and the team sessions we had were always designed in a way that lead to innovation. 3.The efforts of the FDD team and the complexity of the subjects FDD is working on: sybil defense(unsolved problem), advanced fraud detection in web3(unsolved problem) are hardcore. 1,2, 3 Congratulations to @DisruptionJoe and the team! And if all of that isn\u2019t enough\u2026just think about the fact that I am no longer part of this team and still believe they should be funded(lol)  ",

Maybe @shawn16400 can you please double click for us on what is meant by your original comment:   hey @tigress and @GClayMiller here was the original comment (for readablity)     shawn16400:  In S14, FDD squelched $80K in fraudulent activity. In S15 that jumped to $785K. It was not really a cost avoidance so we cannot attribute an ROI to the work, but the intangibles (trust in the brand) is something to be celebrated systemically.   I asked @DisruptionJoe or @epowell101 about this earlier this week someplace (I think - this week was kind of a blur).  For anyone following, a quick explainer: A simple case of measuring the return on an effort is, if I spend $1M on a project, how much value do I expect to receive for that effort, or Return on Investment (ROI)?  If the result of spending $1M, I earn $1.5M, my ROI is (1.5M-1M)/1M = a ROI of 50%. Alternatively - we can look at cost avoidance.  How much money am I NOT going to have to spend as a result of that investment.  If I spend $1M on a an energy savings project and as a result I reduce my fuel spending by $1.5M the ROI is also 50%. For all you Project Mgmt/cost accounting-types, yes I know I am skipping over WACC and TVM, but deal with it  . The issue is that for the service FDD delivers, ROI is more opaque.  Gitcoin does not receive any more income, nor does it avoid any costs for squelching $785K in fraud.  So my point it, I really want to use ROI - because a back-of-the-napkin ROI would be (785-362)/362 = ~116% - which is impressive, especially when compared to the prior period results ($80K) but the ROI measure really does not really work here.  (Yes, I know multiple periods may have to be considered, the total cost is not fully baked in, and a bunch of other caveats). To be clear. I am not attempting to diluting the value of FDD - in fact it is the opposite.  I am attempting to pointing out 1) it is not obvious how to measure the intangible benefit FDD delivers 2) the value delivered is pretty darn impressive and 3) when compared to prior periods, the velocity of value-add is huge.
