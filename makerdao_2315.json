In my opinion, there are too many options to efficiently decide using the current polling system. We really need rank-choice voting. Fortunately, @Derek Flossman predicted that rank-choice voting will be available by mid next week. Therefore, I propose two polls:  Pick a cell from Table 8. Let\u2019s pick row from the 1.13 column. Every row will be a poll option (plus an option for zero compensation) Which DAI daily price do we use for ETH/BAT? Options: today\u2019s price, Black Thursday\u2019s price, or an average of today\u2019s and Black Thursday\u2019s price  Does this cover all the options that people want to vote on? Should the polls be conducted in a particular order or simultaneously? ",

I see defisaver is putting together more information on the vaults generally.   Thank you defisaver.com for doing that.

I\u2019m also putting this poll on hold until the following issues can be debated and/or addressed: General Issues: I had no idea that this thread had morphed into another on chain poll. There was no signal tag, no forum poll, no proposed poll content and a shockingly low amount of engagement from the people who are presumably most interested in this issue. And it also appears that the planning silently moved into github again so there is no content of the onchain poll for people to view. Having the content of the poll change in another tool without notifying the thread here does not feel like consensus to me. Some specific issues:   The language of the poll itself makes an alarming declaration: \u201cMaker is only responsible for auction failures\u2026\u201d  Who is Maker in that sentence? Who has the authority to make such a claim on behalf of the ecosystem?    It lists arguments for two of the options but not the third.   What happens if the price of ETH goes down significantly before the contract is created?   The inclusion of arguments unavoidably includes bias. Why is there editorialising in the body of a poll? Why doesn\u2019t it just link back to this forum thread where the debate was supposed to have happened?   Why is CMC used as a price reference? It is legendarily inaccurate and makes no distinction between wash-trading exchanges and legitimate ones.  What utility does price info have here at all? I can\u2019t see how it is relevant to the question at hand other than to provide an easy way for people to calculate how much more would be available if one option is chosen over another. That feels tangential to the question at hand doesn\u2019t it?    I went over the reasons why the signalling guidelines are important in great detail in the last poll and unfortunately my issues still stand. I realise that this will be disappointing for some but (even though I consider the community\u2019s self organization around this issue to be one of the coolest things I\u2019ve seen in governance yet) I\u2019m going to hold off on posting this one for Monday until we can discuss the above concerns.

I firmly disagree with you that there is \u201clow engagement by people most interested in this issue\u201d. Myself and many others have been very vocal as seen here:     Black Thursday Vault owners report Thread Collateral Discussion       This thread is for vault owners that want to come - or anyone really and pretty much make entries like Vault NNNNN - Comments  to present their Black Thursday loss post mortem event.  This thread is simply about accumulating individual vault data so the full picture can emerge of the event and potentially a claims submission place for individual vault holders.  I know that everyone at Maker wants to express sincere apologies for any misunderstandings as well as actual losses during this event, w\u2026         Maker MCD Ethereum System Liquidation report and Black Thursday Compensation Analysis Governance       One last thing folks.  I am just working to clean up my spreadsheet and remove superfluous data before posting the data here for people to download and work with themselves.  I have Twicky working on another dataset but did not put a rush on this.  My goal is to post the current ETH-A dataset in hand by next weekend (I am working 52hrs this week and have a family with 1yr 5yr old to take care of).   Also while I have been compensated for my work on the initial report and I am paying out of those\u2026     One benefit I can see here however, is running the 2 polls necessary at the same time. I would propose merging the 2 polls into the same voting process. Poll 1: Vault Compensation Reference Price Date Poll Poll 2: Percentage Of Vault Collateral To Be Returned To Black Thursday Victims So there would be 2 separate polls live at the same time. This way it can be done all at once and steps can be made to proceed from there. Re: your concern for visibility -  could you offer the solution to this then by making a very visible sticky thread for creating discourse for the above two polls and how options should look? I\u2019m sure myself and many others would appreciate the place for that to happen if the current threads by your standards aren\u2019t the place for that to take place. The longer this drags out the more I lose complete confidence in the MakerDAO system. The auctions are very flawed and has caused much higher than necessary losses to those involved. ",

Great write-up @LongForWisdom I would like to share what is very much on my mind. I think now that the dust has settled there should be more forward efforts in proceeding promptly with compensation for vault holders to help restore some positive integrity and reputation to the MakerDAO system and also to have some compassion for those involved as there are many. Being left with 0% of collateral after liquidation is an enormous difference between the PreBlackThursday average of 17.7%. @MakerMan  has spoken of a working group and it would be good to get some more details on this. I was actually just thinking about setting up a Discord Server for communications and being able to co-ordinate efforts although I\u2019m not sure if that is something others feel would be useful? @psychonaut has come up with some good ideas in terms of structuring how a compensation by way of governance votes could look. Primarily this consists of running 2 polls. These are (does not by any means have to follow this exact wording) but along these lines: Poll 1: Vault Compensation Reference Price Date Poll (Already on Github as a PR)   github.com/makerdao/community         Vault Compensation Reference Price Date Poll, initial draft   makerdao:master \u2190 jpritikin:blackthur            opened 06:38PM - 01 May 20 UTC               jpritikin             +59 -0            This is to establish on behalf of the community which the community can use to signal which date to use for ETH/BAT references prices vs DAI for vault compensation. This is because it has been established it would easier to compensate in DAI.  Poll 2: Percentage Of Vault Collateral To Be Returned To Black Thursday Victims (Yet to be added as PR)  This is to establish on behalf of the community which the community can use to signal which % of collateral effected vaults should have returned to them in DAI equivalent.  \u2013 Richard has pointed out today that Poll 1 does not meet the following Signaling Guidelines I believe it should be a priority to complete both Poll 1 and Poll 2 outlines on Github as pull requests and have both meeting this requirement of the above guidelines. Once this is achieved both polls can be added to the Voting/Polling dashboard and be ran simultaneously to finally be able to decide the terms for community compensation for vault holders. This has taken longer than necessary and we should be as a community doing everything we can to restore the confidence and reputation of MakerDAO, and not let the efforts so far made be in any vein.

In writing that, I was trying to identify the entity that may provide vault compensation.     rich.brown:   It lists arguments for two of the options but not the third.    The third is a compromise. If you think it needs arguments, please suggest some.     rich.brown:   What happens if the price of ETH goes down significantly before the contract is created?    That\u2019s why I put example calculations in the poll. You can figure it out. If MKR holders choose M13 then nothing changes. If MKR holders choose the current price of the assets then that\u2019s what will be used.     rich.brown:   The inclusion of arguments unavoidably includes bias. Why is there editorialising in the body of a poll? Why doesn\u2019t it just link back to this forum thread where the debate was supposed to have happened?    The April 6 poll included arguments. If you prefer to keep arguments outside the poll then I am okay with that, but I need to know how to format the poll so we can get this done promptly.     rich.brown:   Why is CMC used as a price reference? It is legendarily inaccurate and makes no distinction between wash-trading exchanges and legitimate ones.    I don\u2019t have a strong preference. I figured even CMC can provide daily high/low price, but I\u2019m happy to use your preferred price data. Please suggest something.     rich.brown:   What utility does price info have here at all? I can\u2019t see how it is relevant to the question at hand other than to provide an easy way for people to calculate how much more would be available if one option is chosen over another. That feels tangential to the question at hand doesn\u2019t it?    I\u2019m really confused. How is it tangential? We need to determine how to calculate the amount of compensation. How do you propose we do it? ",

Agreed if an on-chain audit trail can be produced I don\u2019t see why this class can\u2019t be included.     make_dao_2020:  I don\u2019t have much knowledge about the self-liquidated vaults.   Self-liquidated vaults actually reduced the amount of bad debt in the system that was already paid for by MKR token holders. I was seeing the 0 bid auctions in real-time and it made no sense to sit and wait losing 100%. In short it ended up saving MKR token holders from having to fork out more to cover the shortfall by not incurring further bad debt in the system. \u2013 If 0 bid vaults are being compensated, self liquidating vaults who actually did more to help the protocol should be compensated so they are no worse off than those who are compensated from 0 bids. They should at least get the difference between what was received as a self-liquidated vault and what is distributed to vaults who came under the liquidation gun. Example: If compensation for 0 bid vaults is 17.7% At a minimum a self-liquidating vault that received 12% - should be eligible to receive the difference as compensation. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s complicated with the onchain data.

This is an option, but there\u2019s a risk of excluding certain users e.g. non-english speakers who aren\u2019t able to claim via the forums. The bigger concern for me is compensating vaults based on a \u201cnominal percentage return\u201d of collateral may not address all vaults who self-liquidated or paid back debt on black thursday. For example, what if a vault owner had repaid all or part of their vault\u2019s outstanding DAI debt on black thursday to avoid liquidation, but had purchased the DAI with outside funds that were not collateral for their vault? It\u2019s not clear how we would judge how much of their collateral they had already gotten back vs how much more they should be compensated. ",

Everyone is annoyed with how slowly this is going.   The one main problem that is sticking us is the idea that if we try to piecemeal this a few things will happen:  governance pleasure will run out - quickly.   We want the first hit on this to potentially cover everyone. If we don\u2019t try to hit everyone out of the gate. people will be left out.  Put simply we want to do this, quickly, but also correctly in a way that is fair and equitable (as much as governance pleasure will allow).    Anything else and we end up with a worse mess of some people getting something, others nothing, and everyone madder than before because there is nothing worse than dangling a carrot and taking it away. I started a new thread where everyone can look for Maker Vault Compensation Status Updates.     Maker Vault Compensation Updates and Status Governance       Greetings everyone.  I am starting this thread to have a single place for Updates on the above.   I will edit here so people can see the current status and items yet to be worked on.  My time is limited and LongForWisdom is a much better forum organizer so bear with me.  WORKING GROUP consists of @Joshua_Pritikin @LongForWisdom @MakerMan @monet-supply @Vault2288  20200521 Status Update  While working on a comprehensive compensation plan we discovered there are more classes of people affected by \u2026     I can\u2019t speak for the current working group here, but it is my impression from the group it would be cleaner from a governance perspective, and very important with our first compensation plan to sweep as wide as possible.  The goal is to attempt to satisfy all concerned parties and do this in a simpler fashion for governance to deal with.   We know everyone we offer compsation to won\u2019t accept and we also know governance will want a firm maximum pricetag on all of this otherwise they will likely not act.   I know everyone on all sides wants a fast, clean closure on this, at least the best we can. Right now working group has a good idea of a plan but we need the above data to use as input into a new compensation report (which \u2018should\u2019 be relatively easy to construct as the data is simpler in some sense) that characterizes compensation across ALL possible classes and allows governance to vote on a single total that can be raised and used to fund compensation. I am personally sorry this isn\u2019t going faster and can only offer my own personal apologies as the working group is trying to act to drive this without a real governance mandate and funds provided by governance to complete the task.  It is like trying to run a division of a company without a formal head, a goal, or funds to achieve it.   So we literally are flying by the seats of our pants using our own funds and resources and personal perserverance to move this forward. I can only speak for myself and not governance.   Sincerest apologies the DAO wasn\u2019t really on top of this in the way a CEX could.   I honestly am at a loss for why I am apologizing to vault owners except that I feel it is correct.  I look at each of the liquidations and think - this is a person and even doing the first report was saddening to me personally.   I know everyone involved with Maker wants to see this resolved quickly and equitably for all parties concerned. ",
