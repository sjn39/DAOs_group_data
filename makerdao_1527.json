Several of us already know BlackRock but for people who are still unaware of the power that this investment house has, they could practically call themselves the masters of the world, obtaining the majority of shares in different financial media. Everything BlackRock touches pretty much turns to gold, but I want to be a bit skeptical of this partnership as Coinbase = Circle = USDC = DAI, BlackRock even went so far as to speculate that he was behind the unpeg of USD=UST (which I personally appreciate since we must clean up the crypto industry) now, if this association were to materialize 100%, what possibilities would there be for USDC to have even greater exposure than USDT in the market, a much more adequate support with government entities and conventional companies, that would put DAI in a better place. I have always been in favor of lowering USDC exposure with DAI but I want to take this news with a grain of salt. I wanted to know what the community thinks about what just happened. My conclusion remains the same regarding the future, the massive exposure of crypto is imminent and there is no stopping it, we see enough positive news already, but I am a little scared to know if extreme regulations can harm us.
