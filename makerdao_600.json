You are not doing enough, we need more automated service developments around Maker Dao and we should use a part of the growing surplus buffer to do it. We could have an app with a maker wallet ( like metamask ) where you can trade and swap in dai as the only stable currency ( like argent ). We cannot just sit idle gathering money to only burn or stack up in the surplus buffer. I see our protocol as the premise of a central bank that can create a whole ecosystem depending on it. I personally think you are making a mistake by just increasing the surplus buffer and stopping everything else. I think it should be divided a certain way with burning maybe having only a fifth or less of the budget. Dai pegged to the dollar ( fiat ) loses value everyday you don\u2019t use it and the only thing right to do with it is create new added value. As a lover and investor of maker, I am afraid that without a proper vision and path forward in improving and providing a comprehensive ecosystem to help our DAO thrive and garner attention, we quickly become dinosaurs in the crypto-sphere.

Market Opportunity The NFT market has seen incredible growth over the past year. Sales activity has dipped somewhat over the past 3 months, but the NFT space retains huge user attention, narrative tailwinds, and overall momentum. Despite this, NFTs are still second class citizens within the defi space with sparse lending and collateral support.

Flappy Friday) has painfully pointed out that the state of UIs built for interacting with auctions (CLIP, FLAP and FLOP auctions) is fragmented, somewhat deprecated and clunky. With this thread I hope to create some clarity on the state of these UIs, where they are going and lastly announce some short-term measures to increase discoverability of the appropriate UIs for end-users.

I have also read a lot of critique on the state of Maker governance.
