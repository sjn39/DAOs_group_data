I think we should dogfood here and build a web3 system replacing hackmd. I guess people writing such bullshit do not even know how to operate such a thing. Perhaps with keys whitelisted at magician events and every key can invite new people. If vandalism is detected from one account the changes of this account and all accounts that where invited by that account get reverted. Just an idea \u2026 ",

For demonstrably bad edits (i.e. straight up graffiti like the above, as opposed to controversial topics) the stake could be confiscated and put towards EM funds. Easiest would be to allow a centralised party(s) to arbitrate this (the stopping of an automatic refund after e.g. 1 week) and would probably solve the problem. It would be a barrier to entry, but for this specific use-case I would guess most people would be comfortable with this type of approach as they are likely to be fairly technically minded. ",
