The program is being redesigned to increase its throughput and effectiveness. This new iteration of the Incubation Program is scheduled to start in Q2 of this year. As part of this redesign, together with stakeholders, we have drafted a list of new CU ideas that will act as inspiration for the facilitator candidates participating in the new program. The purpose of this post is to collect feedback from the community to improve the initial list, while creating transparency and alignment about the upcoming changes to the program.  Why the Incubation Program? The Incubation Program provides support and guidance to teams to scale and grow the Maker Ecosystem according to its core principles \u2013 permissionlessness, openness, and decentralization. The purpose of the Incubation Program is to scale up MakerDAO in a decentralized way. It has to produce Core Units that are independent, with facilitators who have the authority to make their own decisions and are accountable for those decisions. This is why the list of Core Unit ideas can serve only as a source of inspiration and a starting point for the facilitator candidates. Neither SES nor the community has detailed control over which Core Units the Incubation Program will ultimately produce. The goal is rather to empower facilitator candidates to develop their own mission, vision and strategy and take ownership of how their Core Unit will provide value to the DAO.  The New 2022 Edition of the Program The full public announcement about the redesigned Incubation Program is scheduled in a couple of weeks. We already reveal a few things about the new Program here:   The tentative timeline we are targeting has the start of the program in the 2nd half of April, with graduations in November, i.e. in the last governance cycle of 2022.   The program will feature 3 separate tracks: Outreach, Legal Resiliency, and Transparency & Quality Control - three focused curricula for the facilitator candidate to choose from, critical to the development and sustainable scaling of MakerDAO.   Contrary to last year\u2019s approach of coaching full teams, this season of the program will focus on training the facilitator candidates. By focusing attention on the facilitator candidates, we aim to increase the number of Core Units that are added to the DAO over the course of the year, while providing the best onboarding experience that empowers the participants to successfully lead their own teams.   For more details on how this approach fits within the broader strategy of the MakerDAO SES Core Unit, refer to the Status Update Call of February 25th:   Watch the recording   Look at the slide deck that was presented.   Incubation Program Tracks Based on our on-going assessment of scaling risks and opportunities, three tracks were selected to be part of the new Incubation Program:   Outreach \u2013 Tackle the long-standing challenges that MakerDAO is facing with the promotion of its products and attracting new talent to its community.  Legal Resiliency \u2013 Address key legal and regulatory challenges of the protocol and mitigate risk for permanent contributors and governors.  Transparency and Quality Control \u2013 Help with scaling MakerDAO through data collection and the creation of actionable insights about the current state of the DAO and the products we\u2019re building.  For each track, we\u2019re looking to collaborate with MakerDAO subject matter experts to support the facilitator candidates, such as the Growth Core Unit for the outreach track, SES legal strategists for the legal resiliency track, and others.  Initial List of Core Units Below is an overview of the list with Core Unit ideas for each track:     Outreach Track Transparency & Quality Control Track Legal Resiliency Track      MarComms (with Growth CU) Transparency Reporting Support Advocacy & Public Policy   Events  Software Quality Assurance Regulatory Advisory   Design Accounting Support Self-Insurance   Community Development  Red Team (White Hat Hackers) Legal Network Coordination   Makernaut Support MIPs Review Services Core Unit Incorporation Support   Developer Relation Smart Contracts Auditing Legal Grants   End User DAI Adoption Management Support Legal Review   Integration Support  Resiliency Auditing Special Purpose Core Unit(s)     View the full overview here  We Need Your Help As the next step, we\u2019re looking for your input:  Please have a look at the provided materials Provide questions, comments and feedback about the tracks and Core Unit ideas Feel free to bring up additional Core Unit ideas to consider   [Update] Questions and Answers  Q1. Are you going to set up all 24 New Core Units as part of the new Incubation Program? No! We\u2019re aiming to have ~5 facilitator candidate graduates per track which would make it 15 CUs at most. Realistically, we would have between 8 and 12 Core Units formed as part of the program. This will depend on the quality of the facilitator candidates and the prioirities set by the Community.  Q2. Are the Core Unit ideas random or do they follow a broader roadmap? The tracks presented follow the roadmap already highlighted in SES recent status update:   Grow Revenue - MakerDAO should aim for securing revenue through incubating and launching multiple Real-World Finance Core Units (already in progress by SES) while expanding brand strength through the new Outreach CUs.  Scale the Protocol - enable ecosystem scalability addressing critical bottlenecks, such as delegate overload, through the work of transparency & quality control CUs hand in hand with various cross-CU initiative (including the SES Ecosystem Dashboard and API).  Protect the Protocol - The legal track aims to map and mitigate critical legal risks of failure of the Protocol through decentralization.   Q3. Instead of producing specialised Core Units shouldn\u2019t we focus on creating cross-core-unit ones? The limited cross-interaction bottleneck is already being addressed by the Cross Core Unit & Stakeholder Alignment Initiative.  Q4. How do we make sure that the Protocol expenses don\u2019t outgrow the revenue? The first step is to ensure that revenues grow in advance to expenses. The Real-World Finance initiative and the Outreach track are focused especifically on that. We should think of different mechanisms to make sure that the expenses are under control. For example, the DAO could ensure that the provided funds are being used efficiently. The Transparency and Quality Control Core Unit aim to help delegates and MKR holders to allocate funds efficiently. Additionally, SES has argued in the past for a consensus mechanism to determine a DAO-wide budget cap.  Budget Cap1592\u00d7978 224 KB  This would help us to align expectations accross the DAO and with the Incubation Program.  Q5. Is there a way to make offboarding Core Units less traumatic than observed in the past? This topic has been covered in several threads before. Here is one of them. The Ecosystem Performance Dashboard is aimed towards not only reducing the information overload for delegates and other stakeholders, facilitating scaling up the DAO, but also to provide better feedback mechanisms to avoid offboardings in favor of early corrections and potential restructurings.  Q6. Is there a possibility to combine several CU ideas into one, or split up ideas into multiple CUs? Yes, this is not only possible but an expected outcome of the incubation program which is meant to identify the right match between the skill set of the facilitator candidates, the core unit scope, and the most urgent MakerDAO needs.  Q7. Will the community be able to provide intermediate feedback before the core units go live? Yes, this is one of the most important changes to the program: adding more formal feedback moments to the process. We\u2019re still figuring out the details, but we\u2019re currently considering 3 separate checkpoints with a sentiment poll gauging the excitement of the community about the developing core unit concepts:   Checkpoint 1: when the facilitator candidates have worked out their Mission, Vision, and Strategy.  Checkpoint 2: a Core Unit Launch Pod Session when more details are available about the budget, the team, and the roadmap. This would be earlier in the process than the CULPSs that we\u2019re used to.  Checkpoint 3: a more explicit sentiment poll posted together with the initial RFC for MIP39, MIP40 and MIP41.  We hope this will encourage delegates and other stakeholders to think more thoroughly about their position on the core units in the pipeline, allowing facilitator candidates to correct course earlier in the process.  Q8. When will these core units become active? While we encourage the facilitator candidates to already start operating as if they already running an official core unit as early as possible so that they can hit the ground running, we\u2019re targeting the November cycle to make the formal proposals. This is based on our experience with prior core units and the time that was required to finish the incubation program. ",

Rationale: I believe it\u2019s important for there to exist some way for MKR holders to access protocol profits directly. This should be in addition to burning. I believe that the lack of such a mechanism is part of the reason the MKR token price lags the value that the protocol generates. Even if we don\u2019t enable the payout mechanism for years or decades, it seems important for one to exist in order to provide an ultimate justification for the value of the token. The typical arguments for not having a direct payout mechanism, like dividends, are:  They will cause taxable events and other tax inefficiencies. They might get us classified as a security and thus invite regulatory problems. They would be expensive in terms of gas fees.  A mechanism similar to The Sagittarius Engine proposed by @rune might solve these problems. It would be nice to know for sure \u2014 I imagine this would require analysis by world-class law and accounting firms. ",

In general I think that throwing more core units into MakerDAO, without there being a common ground on high level objectives across core units is a recipe for disaster. I assume that your thinking is that by creating specialized core units, this should be less of a problem. However, I think this has a high chance of leading towards more and more siloes. I think before trying to add 10+ specialized core units, a couple cross-core-unit-core-units (CCUCU\u2019s) should be onboarded. Right now the accountancy of several initiatives is already very vague, and adding more core-units will not help. Then on the tracks: I thought there was also an idea for a RWA track/RWA core units? Are they being formed right now, or are they disregarded? With the current state of the DAO it should be a priority to onboard more people/companies to help onboard a shit-ton of RWA. For the Outreach Track: I wonder if it makes sense to create a slightly more general version the 5 bottom core units on the list (Community Dev, Makernaut Support, Dev Rel, End User Dai Adoption, Integration Support) that could have the mandate of these 5 core units, and just be 5 parallel core units, such that they could also combine forces if they want to pick up a bigger initiative together. Legal Resiliency Track: this is not my cup of tea at all, but I wonder here as well if it makes sense to give these core units such specialized mandates, or that creating parallel core units with the same/similar mandates makes more sense. That\u2019s it for now. Great work. ",

This is my personal opinion and recommendation, but NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR the DAOs recommendation\u2013easiest way to onboard into DAI is by using CEXs like Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Kraken, Gemini (assuming they have inventory), etc. However, there\u2019s still a lot left to be desire when using DAI to buy a Pint   at a Sports Complex. Primarily because it can only be done by using a Debit Card like the Coinbase Debit Card that charges Fees out-the-wazoo, IMO. As you know, there are other ways to onboard to Crypto via 3rd party providers like PayPal, Venmo, Credit & Debit Card providers, etc., but I\u2019m a Yankee so I can\u2019t really comment on those as it\u2019s easier for an American to onboard via the CEXs versus the alternatives, IMO\u2013but everyone has choices here.

Personally, (IMO) I\u2019m super excited about StarkNet, but I would not limited the ability of DAI to be used only on StarkNet based Payment Rails(far away). I would also consider other sidechains like Polygon, and Layer 1s that are EVM compatible,  and that are not necessarily EVM compatible. Again, the one that reaches 100M+++ Active Users will be the payment rail that DAI needs to be on, in order to scale DAI adoption. Please let me know your personal thoughts! ",

When one of the sides of a deal decides to end the agreement unilaterally, it hurts a bit (the same thing would likely happen if one of the Core Units providing a lot of value chose to leave the Protocol). </3  Offboarding Core Units  The Tradeoff  hg1240\u00d7580 31.1 KB  Adding costs for the \u201cexit\u201d will add costs for the \u201centry\u201d of Core Units. This will significantly reduce experimentation. In theory, this would help SES\u2019s Incubation Program, as Governance takes only CUs that can hit the road running. But I would prefer if the governance process was open to anyone. I want the MKR holders to be able to take more bets on teams that wish to grow Maker. However, not providing any type of job security (by becoming erratic or unpredictable in making decisions) will harm Maker\u2019s reputation to attract talented people.  (Not an) Employee Programs A corporation can quickly build several programs (including re-training, repurposing, golden parachutes, and a long list of others). If that fails, the government will step in and help repurpose the person without a job. One of the extremes would be to take a cut from every budget and create a fund. We can call it \u201cunemployment insurance\u201d and rediscover the government. On the other extreme, we could add some disclaimer: this funding is provided for the Core Unit to serve its mandate and does not guarantee an infinite cash flow.  Reducing Costs     Doo_StableLab:  Or else the Maker Protocol will become less agile while those fixed cost (paying Core Units) will continue to increase   Increasing the barriers to exit will add to the costs that @Doo_StableLab is mentioning. We might want to review the costs at some point (even today). This would probably be some kind of audit that evaluates the value that each Core Unit is bringing, versus the cost. This activity is done (hopefully) by the delegates each time a Core Unit is voted in. ",

We believe, there is a number of very current and underserved areas in the DAO that need specialized CUs and the list proposed is a reflection of that. They are just ideas though, serving as inspiration to the future incubees. I think lots of these Core Units would ultimately be of cross-CU nature as they would render services to multiple CUs often charting territory in-between them. The X-Core Unit initiative / Stakeholder alignment meetings serve the purpose to bring CUs more closely together based on a common theme they contribute to. On RWA track / RWA Core Units. We are already incubating a number of them and @Retro is breavely leading the Objective this quarter, so he\u2019d be able to elaborate there. ",

                    "content": "DAO Privacy Policy Having participated in the community forums / discord servers of some other DeFi protocols, I have come to realize that a well-defined DAO privacy policy is very important. Community members interact with DAOs through various means: community forums, Discord servers, Zoom meetings, Crowdcast events etc. In each of these cases, what user info is accessible to the admins of such events / venues? While this may not seem very useful for decentralized organizations, an example is worth considering to highlight the relevance: For example, the Discord servers of some DeFi protocols require users to submit mobile phone numbers for \u201cphone verification\u201d to send chat messages or even to listen in to meetings. This is a very strict feature, and requires only mobile numbers; landline or VOIP numbers are not allowed. This is intrusive and vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. However, the bigger issue is that Discord has left their phone verification privacy policy vague. They haven\u2019t specified if / how they share such phone numbers with the server admins. Their only reference on this matter says the following: \u201cDiscord currently uses phone verification as an anti-abuse tool. Private servers can also set up a phone verification requirement for extra security.\u201d Some interpretation seems to be as follows: While Discord doesn\u2019t share phone numbers with server admins under normal circumstances, it reserves such option if servers complain of some abuse. Secondly, the wording \u201ccurrently\u201d is problematic and leaves the room open to generally sharing phone numbers with the servers at a future time. Regardless, there\u2019s considerable lack of clarity. While DAOs may claim that they are decentralized, gatekeeping ability through phone verification or some other means is the strongest indicator of centralized power. Conducting such gatekeeping without spelling out a privacy policy makes it even worse. Being the industry leader, it would be highly appropriate for MakerDao\u2019s DAO to lead by example and publish a privacy policy. It\u2019s not clear to me which CU should undertake this effort. Any thoughts? ",

While the GDPR in the EU is one of the strictest data protection laws in the world, the US, for example, is much more permissive. If Maker wants to provide services in the EU, it will have to comply sooner or later -even if it is not registered in the EU-, because the GDPR has clear implications for non-EU entities, as : \"The GDPR applies not only to controllers or processors established in the European Union, but also to the processing of personal data of data subjects residing in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities relate to the provision of goods or services to data subjects residing in the EU, regardless of whether the data subject has to pay for them. And Article 27 of the GDPR provides for the appointment of a representative by controllers or processors not established in the Union and sets out the basic rules applicable to representatives.\" This is if some non-EU data controllers, fearing the risks of the GDPR, have preferred to cease operations in the EU.

                    "content": "Thanks everyone for the suggestions and voicing potential concerns.     synesthesia:  Following all the great comments above, I\u2019ve added the Q&A section   Please note that the opening post has been updated and read through the Q&A. I do notice that a lot of the concerns that were brought up are general concerns:   Keeping expenses under control and making sure that revenues continue to cover everything, also in the event of a downturn.   The lack of a broader alignment on a global vision.   The lack of cross-core unit coordination.   Concerns around core unit oversight, accountability, and the ability of governance to correct course when needed (related to the potential off-boarding of CUs).   While the Q&A already offers some hints about the answers to these, we will make a follow-up post that will make it easier to connect all the dots. In the meantime I want to restate again that our efforts in on-boarding core units is aligned with exactly these concerns, even if they don\u2019t provide all the answers:   Focus on revenue growth: RWA Core Units are already part of the current wave of incubees and the outreach track is focused on growth too.   Focus on Core Unit Performance accountability, spending controls: the transparency and quality control track is a decentralized tool to help with these aspects. And we\u2019ve already kick-started the initiative to create an Ecosystem Performance Dashboard which can be a critical tool in this.   As I said, this doesn\u2019t provide all the answers. More efforts are needed to address these challenges and we will actively support these efforts further in the near future. The two things I don\u2019t believe in, are (1) simply stopping to onboard new talent and (2) \u201coutsourcing all the things.\u201d Both of these are knee-jerk reactions that will not work. Instead this will weaken the Maker ecosystem and has potential to seriously harm us in the medium and long run. Simply put:   The on-boarding and retention of new talent, if done correctly, means more revenue for the protocol, not less. We need to figure out how to do this correctly, not just give up on scaling up.   Outsourcing is a complicated matter that looks good on paper but very often doesn\u2019t work in practice. It is a typical management-myth that this is a magic bullet to save costs. I have personally seen multinational organizations go off the rails completely due to a disastrous outsourcing policy. The reasons are complex and I will make the time available to write more on this soon. I\u2019m not against working with external service providers in principle, sometimes it is the right tool. What I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s a complicated affair that is very difficult to get right. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we simply outsource this?\u201d is most of the times the wrong reflex.   All this is not to say that we don\u2019t need to be very careful adding fixed costs to our bottom line, and I also agree that we need mechanisms to scale back when needed. For the incubation program, I want to point out that we have a number of tools available that can curb costs where needed:   We can be more selective or less selective when it comes to the graduation of new facilitators and the ratification of new core units.   If needed, we can allocate part of the SES Incubation Program budget that has already been approved to support new core units after they graduate. We haven\u2019t brought this up before, but this is an example of a temporary cost-cutting measure that we can deploy if we need to slow down spending.   I hope this already clarifies a number of things about how we\u2019re thinking about this. We will be posting a lot more about these aspects soon. ",

We have a fair amount of outreach in incubation, but nothing tying the different ways of generating awareness about Maker together. I know the DAO organizational form has some innate inefficiencies, but when it comes to marketing having different CUs communicate different messages can cross from inefficient into counterproductive. The community should agree as a whole on a marketing strategy and which segments of users we\u2019re trying to reach. A traditional company would have a marketing director filling this role, but being decentralized I\u2019m not convinced that is the right way forward. From my position it seems like most of the outreach we\u2019re incubating is directed at a broad base of users. This makes sense if we\u2019re trying to reach the retail segment. Unfortunately this is in contrast to other changes we are making to the protocol which aligns it more towards professional/institutional actors. In my view we need to make a decision on which direction we want to go and then more clearly align our efforts in that direction. ",

When creating the list of potential Outreach CUs, we expanded a lot on the issue of potential inefficiencies in aligning the different, specialized CUs in terms of a common brand/ marketing strategy. You\u2019re definitely right that this needs to be addressed and I understand how proposing a generic Marketing CU would be one way to mitigate this problem. I believe that the versatile nature of Maker with various different components and target audiences may however be too big of a job for one CU to tackle. There also seems to be some consensus in the community about this:  Bildschirmfoto 2022-03-17 um 12.48.431392\u00d7818 105 KB   Bildschirmfoto 2022-03-17 um 12.48.521386\u00d7772 99.1 KB  Also see: [Informal Poll] Marketing Maker To foster further growth and continue to cover the DAO\u2019s growing expenses, we need to excel in promoting all components of Maker and cater various target audiences. Splitting this job and having several CUs would allow for a higher level of specialization/ understanding of the target audience they cater and hence more productivity. This doesn\u2019t mean that those CUs would exclusively work on their own but rather engage in cross-CU collaboration to reinforce their activities if applicable. On top of this, the proposed Design CU could act as a common denominator collaborating with all Outreach CUs and ensuring that we establish a consistent visual brand identity that is tailored to the different target audiences. This consistency will ultimately help building brand awareness and improve Maker\u2019s competitiveness. Generally speaking, the proposed CUs are just a starting point to get conversations with potential facilitator candidates going. It will be up to those candidates to define their strategy, so some of these CU ideas might be merged or split out as the candidates move forward. When the need for a coherent Marketing approach is discussed in the group, I would expect facilitator candidates engage with the community to seek alignment on the issue. ",

There also seems to be some consensus in the community about this:   Thank you @Sarah for your reply. I do agree that sorting all marketing under one umbrella is probably too diverse and too big of a job. As such I think specialized marketing CUs are the way to go once we have a strategy in place. Unfortunately we are right now in a position where revenues are declining and operating costs are expanding, leaving less and less room to onboard specialized marketing CUs. I fully expect core units to collaborate as we have seen with other core units already in existence, but they have also revealed a frustration in lack of direction and clear vision. In my mind a marketing strategy needs to originate from a wider DAO strategy and vision. I also fully agree that a generic marketing CU is only one way to achieve the objective of a coherent strategy, but another thing that is also lacking right now is someone doing market research. We are growing but with limited input of an important group of stakeholders; the users of DAI. Doing this kind of research requires the appropriate skill set and is typically found within the marketing sphere.     Sarah:  Generally speaking, the proposed CUs are just a starting point to get conversations with potential facilitator candidates going.

When the need for a coherent Marketing approach is discussed in the group, I would expect facilitator candidates engage with the community to seek alignment on the issue   I think this approach is putting the cart before the horse. This dives into a debate within management research between deliberate and emerging strategy but given our current constrained budget I think we are wise to go the cautious route and avoid taking on too much fixed expenses. Better to focus on a plan first as that carries less recurring costs. ",

Sometimes a small cost can make a big impact, but most of the proposals are dream too big compared to what is currently possible. Although important and necessary problems are identified here, some of the proposals are intended to focus only on subtasks. This is a problem because, in the meantime, there is no basic direction to follow, without which overall effectiveness will deteriorate. As an example, the (DeFi) Lego fortress will not be assembled by randomly placing building blocks, but by fitting them together in some order to get what is envisioned. ",

I would not shift this task to a Marcomms CU as you would need on the ground contributors to promote the usage of DAI within the sports complex, use DAI as a learning tool for stablecoin adoption, and integrate with Point-of-Sale software providers.   Following on this, I think that promoting DAI via sports or esports, would be a great way to make DAI and Maker known in places such as LATAM where the use of cryptocurrency is rapidly growing. ",

Based on your input, we created a maintained backlog of Core Unit ideas to serve as inspiration in the future editions of the Incubation Program. Given the current circumstances, however, we have decided not to scale up the Incubation Program yet. We will still focus on onboarding talent to the DAO, in a more limited capacity, applying lessons learned from the previous edition. We are also working on budget transfers that would reduce the financial impact on the DAO even further if needed. This includes a budget neutral approach, which would stay within the already approved limits of the SES budget, resulting in a net zero increase for the protocol upon graduation of the new core units. As such we can continue to protect MakerDAO\u2019s moats and increase its competitive advantage. As of today, a number of potential facilitator candidates have already reached out to us. In the nearest future we plan to evaluate these applicants highlighting a selected shortlist of Core Units that reflect MakerDAO\u2019s key risks & opportunities. Our goal is to match these with the most promising and fit facilitator candidates, further prioritising quality over quantity. An additional advantage of this approach allows us to further develop the high quality educational materials in collaboration with Maker Academy and overall improve the efficiency of the program. This will optimally prepare us to kick off a successful scaled-up version of the program when the room for more agressive growth is available again, potentially next year. ",
