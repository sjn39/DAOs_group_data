                    "content": "There\u2019s a lot of different threads and talking about budget reductions in general, and also specifically the current attempts at offboarding events and strategic happiness. I think the right way forward is to generally find low hanging fruit where budgets can be reduced, and while doing so also consolidate the large number of core units into more coherent and similarly sized core units with unified budgets, where we know the budgets are being properly allocated amongst similar initiatives in the way that gives the best overall result, by carefully weighing the tradeoffs. To get clarity and voter support around constructive ways forward on these issues as soon as possible I propose we use the Wednesday 9pm CEST Endgame DVC meeting to focus on this topic, and invite @Nadia and Mariano from growth, @Aes from Strategic finance and the two core units: Strategic happiness and Events. In preparation for this meeting we can discuss different possible outcomes such as whether it is realistic to both do budget reductions and keep the function of swag and events (by looking at to what extent they support nadia and growths existing initiatives). It will also allow SF to develop their holistic budget reduction plan further, and for core units in general to prepare methods for identifying potential low hanging fruit for budget reductions. We can then aim to get preliminary MKR voter support for a particular overall direction or set of principles that future budget reductions and consolidations will be done by. This should help with stability for the core units, and allow them to focus on their day to day more and not worry about sudden top-down budget changes. I would also like to know if there are any other of our 20 core units that should be considered for consolidation with growth and marketing. ",
