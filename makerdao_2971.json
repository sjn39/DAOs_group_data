With the current growth rate, we are going to hit the DC around wednesday.  image1289\u00d7583 48.5 KB  I would like to poll for two things here:  changing the DC to allow more DAI from ETH-A. find out if we want to switch over to IAM for ETH-A   Changing the Debt Ceiling Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:  I personally do not see any, as ETH is still the most liquid and robust asset-type we have in the portfolio, but I am happy to adjust here if people raise good points in the discussion      even more (Rism team should decide) 1000 MM (+ 260 MM) 900 MM (+160 MM) 800 MM (+60 MM) 740 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until January 22th; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal poll lead by the risk team, onchain-poll, urgency executive.  IAM for ETH-A  update @LongForWisdom started a more formal with concrete next steps over here:  [Signal Request] Rolling out the Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module (DC-IAM) Please express your opinion over there! IAM is already active for ETH-B and has been working quite good. I guess we don\u2019t want to have executive votes for changing the ETH-A Debt Ceiling on a weekly basis, so maybe it is time to think about activating. I know that the idea isn\u2019t new, but maybe it helps to find out if we as a community want to have it so the corresponding mandated actors feel empowered to move forward. Pros:  fewer signals, on-chain-polls, execs working with the Debt Ceiling of ETH-A  Cons:  ETH-A is our biggest collateral-type, maybe it would be better to start with something smaller      Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Since IAM for ETH-A is planned anyway, I don\u2019t think we need a corresponding on-chain-poll about it - but happy to move forward with this as well if needed. Nevertheless, this poll will also close on January 22th. ",

                    "content": "Looking at ETH-A liquidation curve, it tells me that about 100m DAI gets liquidated if we see around 30% ETH drop. Of course some will react and unwind before liquidated, but some won\u2019t. Plus don\u2019t forget there are other larger risky vaults (25m liquidated at ETH-B, 30m at WBTC-A at same price drop). And finally, in terms of protection we have 6h box of 15m and 4m of surplus (even if we increase surplus to 10m, it will take some time to fill it). So if somebody asks me whether we should be increasing risk exposure and me knowing that tomorrow 100m+ debt could easily get liquidated, I don\u2019t need to say anything more. However CR ratios are healthier compared to average historically observed distribution and we aren\u2019t seeing aggressive risk taking on ETH-A vaults as is the case at ETH-B. Even though the exposure is rising, the pace of ETH price increase is much higher. Still, if additional DC leads to existing vaults minting more DAI and lowering their existing CRs, this would be a very bad and risky situation - we could see over 200m liquidations on ETH-A at 30%+ drop alone! Even if we are optimistic and think 50% of those vaults will react to price drops and unwind in time, we could have quite a large liquidation event in front of us. Auctions of such magnitude could be clearing for about a day or more - depends how many people unwind in between, but otherwise the time we risk additional drop is total liquidation size/15m*6hr if I am not mistaken. And if price goes lower for another 10-33% during that time (33% to reach 100% CR, but there will be auction slippage), we start having loss events. So it is about what people think, are we going to see short term crashes of ETH below $700 again or not and if vaults are going to become more aggressive on leverage? Also by approaching the 1bn debt ceiling and potentially CR distribution becoming riskier, we might need to become much more aggressive on SF and Surplus, although this won\u2019t save us from anything short term. If somebody is feeling a bit paranoid about the whole situation as I am, would it be too unpopular from me to soon propose a higher LR ETH-C vault instead of increasing DC for ETH-A all the way up to 1bn? At least until we get more protection in Surplus Buffer or until this crazy growth is behind us and things stabilize. The current liquidity metrics for ETH are justifying a higher DC though, but I don\u2019t believe this community is also prepared to increase SF, box parameter and surplus buffer at the same time substantially and therefore I am looking for other risk mitigation tools such as introducing higher LR ETH vaults. I expect people here arguing higher LR ETH vaults won\u2019t be competitive and usable enough, but note that the average debt weighted Collateralization Ratio on ETH-A is 473% right now. Such measures would be similar to what margin trading platforms do when prices are becoming very volatile, which is to suddenly increase margin requirements for users. But in Maker\u2019s case that isn\u2019t doable instantly so we may need to prepare similar measures in advance. ",

At least until we get more protection in Surplus Buffer or until this crazy growth is behind us and things stabilize.   Looking at the SC-team feedback for WBTC-B, this is doable but not as part of a urgency action. I like that you are paranoid/conservative, but not raising the DC if there is obviously need for DAI cannot be an option If ETH-C with similar SF/LR as ETH-A does help from the risk perspective, I am all in for that. But this is maybe a step after the next ETH-A increase. We need to avoid the situation of not being able to mint DAI-from-ETH ",

New vault types can be as simple as higher LR, lower SF, or even use something like Global Collateral Ratio (new vaults can only be open at current GCR or higher in that vault type). So lets assume we have ETH-C with 200 CR, and lower SF than current ETH-A - some large and highly collateralized vaults will probably migrate to ETH-C, effectively lowering DC utilization in ETH-A, allowing for new space. This would also partially solve the free riding problem, as users with higher CR are much less risky for the system, while they are charged the same SF. ",

I agree with increasing the SB and the box parameter but am assuming you would want to see how the market reacts once new SFs are implemented. Regarding the SB, do you feel the $10M currently leading the poll is high enough or should we increase this to $12M+? We\u2019ve grown DAI by over $300M since the poll went live so I think it would be important to consider larger increases (as a side note, I feel like the signal request polls should be closed more quickly given the rapid growth we\u2019re experiencing, or if sufficient consensus is reached). Regarding the box parameter, are we able to get a sense from the Keepers of the level of capital they hold? ",

With the current box it would takes weeks to liquidate vaults which is likely to hurt us a lot (if I understand correctly that we can liquidate 15M DAI every 6 hours). This is a broken system and should be fixed. We should either help Keepers to be up to the task of liquidating 100M DAI per hour or find another solution. Maybe Liq 2.0 is the solution already. SB, SF and LR are not solutions to this problem. Sure a higher SB might let us live. But we will still take the loss because our liquidation system is not good enough. We need to have a liquidation which we are confident that it can liquidate 5% of available ETH in 2 days. Then we should allow having 5% of all ETH as locked collaterals. If ETH is the pristine collateral of DeFi and Maker the biggest lending protocol, 5% is the minimum we can expect. The speed of liquidation is a technical problem that is fixable. The ability of the market to absorb all those sell orders is a more complicated matter (just like portfolio insurance in 87\u2019s Black Monday). ",

The last time I asked about this, it seemed to me that the ultimate goal of Maker is to maintain the DAI peg, I supposed in such a way that users trust this asset, in turn increasing the demand for it and the cashflow generated. I see some people in this thread pointing to the risk of liquidation as a an argument against raising the DC. Why is that? In what way do liquidations impact the peg? In what way do liquidations impact the security of the overall system? It seems to me that this risk is segregated on a per vault basis and only concerns the vault owners, not the Maker system as a whole. In that context, and as I was saying in the thread linked above, I am under the impression that the DC should always be increased when the cap is about to be reached, and that there should in fact always be a comfortable margin, except if the value of DAI below $1, at which point there is a need to make people unwind their vaults by increasing the SF, thus allowing for a reduction of the DC. Indeed, why would we artificially limit the amount of debt generated by not moving the ceiling appropriately and raising the fees, as long as the peg is maintained? ",

It seems to me that this risk is segregated on a per vault basis and only concerns the vault owners, not the Maker system as a whole.   Because if the ETH price drops significantly enough, and quickly enough, the Maker Protocol takes a loss in addition to the vault owners. 150% LR means that if ETH drops by >33% that the Maker Protocol needs to make up the difference. Naturally some vaults will save themselves (and Maker at the same time), but this is not a guarantee. There is also doubt over whether Keepers can actually handle large volumes of liquidations at once. The box parameter mitigates this risk, but it increases the time that the Maker Protocol needs to hold onto liquidated collateral before it can be sold, which increases market risk for the protocol.

Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:  I personally do not see any, as ETH is still the most liquid and robust asset-type we have in the portfolio, but I am happy to adjust here if people raise good points in the discussion   Ceiling adjustment     740 MM (+ 150 MM) 690 MM (+ 100 MM) 640 MM (+ 50 MM) 590 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Last time we raised the ETH-A Debt Ceiling the @Risk-Core-Unit team proposed a increase on their own but were influenced by the corresponding community poll - this is the corresponding community poll  The poll will run until January 14th; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or there will be a corresponding on-chain-poll taking the (intermediate) result and the proposal by the risk team (maybe the SF needs to get adjusted?) into account. I guess raising the ETH-A-DC might be a topic for the first governance call of this year already? ",

Even if I know that this was discussed some other times, I wonder if the time is now mature to start thinking & implement a DC/SF automatic adjustment system. For example we could weight in some factors such as:  price of ETH averaged growth/loss in price of the last 3 months % of ETH collected in ETH-A vaults (currently ~2.3%) Current utilisation of the DC (currently 523/590, i.e., ~88%) \u2026  and spit spit out (read: onchain algorithm Alg) SF and DC parameters. Of course the algorithm Alg can be updated whenever we want via governance. But it would, imo, provide a more \u2018scientific\u2019 approach to SF/DC scaling, and possibly an easier to handle one, compared to all the time voting more-or-less arbitrary numbers. Remark: this is in no way urgent and possibly not even necessary. It\u2019 just something that I think should emerge sooner or later because it makes sense. ",

There is a similar poll for the ETH-B collateral type as well - but that one has a higher stability fee and a lower liquidation ratio. Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:  I personally do not see any, as ETH is still the most liquid and robust asset-type we have in the portfolio, but I am happy to adjust here if people raise good points in the discussion   Ceiling adjustment     650 MM (+ 150 MM) 590 MM (+ 100 MM) 540 MM (+ 50 MM) 490 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will run until December 3rd and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:  we already have 5% of all YFI in existence locked in vaults - people are getting worried about the YFI-risk already (great post here). maybe @Primoz can chime in here? can we do this without changing the SF?

                    "content": "So we are currently running some risk numbers for each vault type since we need to propose maximum debt ceiling parameters for MIP27 implementation (DC IAM) next week anyway. The maximum debt ceiling figure should in our opinion be a function of liquidity, where DEX liquidity carries a higher weight, because auctions can be more efficient. After performing volume analysis for YFI we determined maximum DC for YFI to be 46m DAI, based on a selected ratio of 30% to 60% of CEX+DEX daily volumes. At 175% LR this would mean Maker would hold more than 11% of YFI market supply, which is not insignificant (ETH has only 2.3%). But this high ratio is mostly due to high YFI volumes compared to its market cap. This means we don\u2019t have anything against increasing DC towards 50m if volume metrics for YFI don\u2019t worsen. However risk premium will rise if we were to attempt such an increase. Below are stress test results for YFI-A, which shows risk premiums based on different price drop and auction slippage inputs at a debt exposure of 46m DAI. The conservative base case inputs we are using for YFI is -40% daily price drop and -40% auction slippage which yields 15% risk premium for 46m debt exposure. For current 20m debt exposure risk premium would measure around 7% (lower debt exposure normally leads to lower auction slippage). Screenshot 2020-11-24 at 23.05.181132\u00d7408 48 KB This high risk premium is due to the largest vault (9.8m DAI debt), which has only 223% CR at the time of writing. This means that if we have a higher drop in price, this vault would quickly get liquidated and could lead to significant losses if auction slippage is severe. Now, there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d here and that is why I wanted to show this matrix so it gets easier to decide for appropriate risk tolerance. But we need to be aware that such an increase could lead to double digit SF, which could dissuade current vault users from borrowing. As said in any case we will need to increase SF towards 7% which would equal Maker with Aave, from where a lot of users came initially. We can either hope CR distribution improves or hope that some YFI vault users are sophisticated enough to unwind before a large drop occurs. In such case lower than here calculated risk premium and SF could be justified, even at higher DC. ",

Yeah i guess I\u2019m mostly wondering what our numbers look like at the 200% LR. Don\u2019t think i would be in favor of purposefully liquidating people. FWIW I don\u2019t think that ~200% seems that crazy to me. Nexo.io requires about 2x collateral for bitcoin backed loans. Which is to say there is probably some demand at that number otherwise they would be setting their collateral requirements differently.     Primoz:  But another vault type YFI-B is possible   This is starting to sound like a better idea to me all the time. Might be something to keep an eye on depending on how this vote goes and how quickly / if people take up the leverage opportunity.     Aaron_Bartsch:  Increasing rates is preferable to LR increases from a UX perspective.   FWIW i think this is a matter of opinion. Personally when i borrow the most important question i want to answer is what is the present value of the loan payments over its lifetime. Variable interest rates make figuring that out next to impossible bc I have no idea what the people on this forum are going to decide to do. However i would admit that to be the case if we start to liquidate people. ",

This combined with the volatility of the YFI token should be a factor for Maker Governance to consider when deciding whether to raise the debt ceiling (increase our exposure to YFI). There may be a case where we want to gain exposure to a certain user, but not another. Traditionally we have done this user segmentation by having two Vaults (ilks) with different risk parameters as is the case for ETH-A/ETH-B, and USDC-A/USDC-B. Let\u2019s introduce Yearns delegated YFI vault as a new user primitive. Yearn delegated vaults deposit tokens into the Maker Protocol in order to borrow Dai which has much more favorable yield generating opportunities than the underlying asset. Yearn manages the collateralization of these positions through keepers which monitor the Oracle Security Module price and rebalance if the price of the underlying token drops significantly. As a user, this makes Yearn delegated vaults much less risky than \u201cdegens\u201d even at the exact same collateralization ratio. In light of this I want to put out the idea of having vaults specialized for individual  \u201cusers\u201d. In effect a \u201cwhitelisted\u201d vault. Of course the Risk Team would need to chime in whether this is something that actually helps manage risk. Additionally, currently the Maker Protocol does not support a whitelisted vault, so the Smart Contracts Domain Team would need to chime in on how feasible something like this even is. I suspect we could do it through adding a whitelist to a collateral adapter. ",

I\u2019m an active contributor in the Yearn community, and am currently working on some ideas for upcoming YFI yVault strategies that combine aspects of current governance staking with yield farming (as well as potentially supporting protocol initiatives) all in one go. I think Maker is a perfect place to store YFI safely while still being able to utilize its value. Realistically, I think a YFI yVault that deposits YFI into Maker could end up replacing governance staking, and likely will if we offer the option. With all of that said, I don\u2019t know enough about Maker governance (or how the risk calculations are performed) to know whether having a special YFI vault for Yearn is an outrageous request. Paired with Yearn\u2019s significant YFI holdings in governance staking and the YFI yVault, whitelisted access to the OSM, a health factor maintained by keepers, and the relatively conservative risk parameters that our DAI strategies tend to have (farming CRV or COMP, nothing too crazy), I think it could be very beneficial to both protocols. Maker would be earning fees on a large amount of capital, and Yearn would be able to utilize that capital more effectively and efficiently. ",

The YFI vault could create an internal accounting token representing the YFI it holds, and that token could be on-boarded as Maker collateral. This YFI vault would need to provide a function to redeem that token for YFI, but it would only be useful in the case of Maker vault liquidations. I guess there is a loophole, though, which is that in the case of liquidations those tokens could end up owned by someone other than the YFI vault who could decide to deposit them back in Maker instead of redeeming for YFI.

Of course the Risk Team would need to chime in whether this is something that actually helps manage risk.   That is not a bad idea at all. Some might say we shouldn\u2019t make differences between users, but in distant future I do imagine loans would have parameters set per type of user risk. Currently Maker charges same rate for any user of YFI-A, regardless of your CR or ability to deleverage. Which means higher collateralized vaults are actually indirectly subsidizing fees for lower CR vaults being more risky. Whitelisted vaults could also come handy for institutional user types who don\u2019t mind paying a bit higher fee if they knew there is always debt ceiling available and rates are more stable. In return Maker gets long term and direct relationship, which helps us manage risks better because we can always reach out to him. If such user can prove they have systems in place to unwind before next OSM price and their balance sheet is strong to add collateral/make repayment, we don\u2019t mind setting more favourable risk parameters. For retail users we could do the same thing, for instance we could make more favourable LR or SF for vault users protected by DeFi Saver.     Planet_X:  Thank you for this really interesting analysis   . May I ask what is the reason behind choosing -40% for both daily price drop and auction slippage?   We plan to publish analysis for each vault type next week, but in genera price decrease is based on largest daily drawdowns observed in past trading data. For YFI this might not be totally appropriate since the asset has a short trading history. But since we don\u2019t adjust for the fact that some vaults might avoid liquidation before next OSM price, we thought 40% drop is conservative enough. High auction slippage of 40% is based on us modelling for max DC which can be up to 60% of daily trading volume. For lower debt exposure auction slippage gets toward 0, which then helps us create risk premium to debt exposure curve. Estimating exact auction slippage is really hard, but the easiest shortcut to it is to compare liquidated debt amount with Uniswap LP pool liquidity and estimate slippage. ",

Even if we don\u2019t, a signal from the community certainly helps the risk team on making a proposal for the initial line of ETH-A. Please note there is also a signal request about creating a new ETH-C vault type as an alternative/addition to ETH-A.  Changing the Debt Ceiling Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:   @Risk-Core-Unit already raised some concerns in the last Signal Request - probably all points are still valid with a higher DC the chance of getting the stability fee raised is getting higher on the next interval of rates group proposing changes  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     1500 MM (+ 500 MM) 1250 MM (+ 250 MM) 1125 MM (+ 125 MM) 1000 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until February 4th; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal (lead by the risk team), onchain-poll or urgency executive.

If this was looking one week into the future I\u2019d vote for +125 MM, as I want to protect the system from a potential bug by having the increase be as small as possible. But since it\u2019s 12 days, I have to try to anticipate the Dai supply over this period which introduces a lot of uncertainties. If the supply is back to 750 MM 12 days, I definitely would not want to raise the DC by + 500 MM, and I assume most others would not want to either. While it\u2019s possible to come back and change your vote, the reality is that this post will likely get buried and most participants will end up keeping the vote they placed with limited information. All this is to say that I\u2019d feel much more comfortable in placing a vote if this was on a weekly cadence\u2026would love to hear other\u2019s thoughts though. ",

Regarding uncertainties about the future: DC-IAM will help to solve this issue.

I started investing in 2009 and I\u2019ve never had so many friends reaching out for advice on stocks / looking to get into stocks. The only thing I can compare it to from personal experience is the crypto bubble in 2017. Crypto feels \u2018hot\u2019 right now but NONE of my friends or colleagues have asked me about what\u2019s going on in crypto which leads me to believe we have a lot more room to run in this bull market. Regarding the ETH-A DC, I voted for a 250M increase. I\u2019d love to hear an update from risk, but 500M seems excessive at this stage without any changes to the box parameter and with liquidations still being an issue. 125M seemed too low given the current run rate of new ETH-A demand. We would likely end up with a new signal request a week later and potentially hit the 1.125B DC rather quickly and potentially lose share. A mixture between increasing the ETH-A DC and creating a new ETH vault with a higher LR originally suggested by Primoz feels appropriate. ",

Given it\u2019s difficult to know what a user wants to do with it, or how much they might even want - I\u2019m not sure how such a flag would be any more helpful than showing the amount (as we currently do), which is very flexible anyway, as it could massively increase in the next few minutes again, or even if there is lots left when you open a Vault - it could disappear very quickly anyway. I get that if it\u2019s 0 (or less than dust) it should be disabled, that we can add very easily (and not hidden - otherwise we will just get questions asking where it is). ",

There\u2019re more and more automatic vault management tools and they need fast solution when ETH\u2019s price drops or increases pretty fast. You definitely know how blockchain market is sophisticated today. Marking it yellow or red is a common way to help users to make a better choice, when a vault is almost drain. If there\u2019re no DAI available then it should be listed with some striking signal and should stop a newbie to set up his/her new vault. Once I\u2019d created a vault (with a little bit DAI generated) and then found no more DAI available but my collateral ratio was pretty high. There\u2019s another time when I was trying to generate some DAI, it showed me a negetive number! It\u2019s unbelievable weired. And I guess when there\u2019s no enought DAI, then all automatic management tools (of vault), like DeFiSaver, will fail to increase your users\u2019 leverage. So solid debt ceiling for every single vault is a bad solution. Even if you insist on a global debt ceiling, make every single vault automatically changable with some regulation rules. Rules controlled by algorithm but not human being\u2019s meetings! Remember you can use algorithms to make your project much better! Thanks and good luck! ",
