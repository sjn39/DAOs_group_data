                    "content": " Executive summary This proposal describes a series of simple governance changes to MakerDAO that would address many problems that exist in governance today. These include a general lack of vision and strategy as well as low accountability to MKR holders.  Table of contents  Executive summary Why we need to talk about this now  Problem statements  Maker has an identity crisis Maker has a governance crisis    Proposal  Main idea #1: Create a Constitution for Maker Main idea #2: Establish a Council of Makers   Expected impact on Maker Implementation Appendix A - How is the constitution created? Appendix B - How is the council elected?  Thanks to all contributors: @adcv @Aes @SebVentures @Eumenes @hexonaut @teej @luca_pro @MarianoDP @Nadia @pipko  Why this matters now We are at the foot of an unprecedented opportunity for Maker. Other stablecoins (UST) and centralized lending markets (Celsius, Blockfi, Voyager) are blowing up. Lending demand is evaporating and borrowing costs are going up. Yield-bearing, uncorrelated RWAs are being tokenized on-chain. All against a backdrop of global interest rates rising, forcing investors on a quest for financial stability. If we play our cards right, DAI can become the USD-as-a-service for the next generation of internet users around the world. At the same time, Maker is at a pivotal time internally. rune, the founder, is pushing back into the spotlight with plans for a massive restructuring of our governance model. Some of his ideas are good but I\u2019d like to give the community another governance proposal to choose from. The best ideas are born in the fire of competition and debate and ideally, Maker can find a way to pick the best from all proposals to build a strong, unified consensus. Finally, interest in Maker governance has never been higher. While reaching consensus may be difficult initially, whatever we decide now will have unprecedented buy-in from MKR holders.  Problem statements The supply chain for decision-making in any organization basically looks like this:  image944\u00d7146 7.45 KB  These different layers of decision-making require very different skills and resources \u2014 e.g. a vision should be very high-level and long-term, whereas implementation choices require highly local knowledge & are necessarily short-term in nature. Smaller organizations can initially get away with having very flat hierarchies but as they grow and mature, they naturally run into the scaling limits of that approach, e.g. the local knowledge problem. From there, hierarchies are implemented to allow for division of labor and specialization in each layer of this decision-making supply chain. Turning to Maker, the CUs currently handle most implementation decisions while MAs/cross-CU collaborations are responsible for our tactics. However, there is a lack of vision of what Maker should be and a lack of strategy on how it should get there. (Another way of putting this would be: there\u2019s an excess of visions and strategies and no unity about them.) Based on these observations, we define two problem statements:  Maker has an identity crisis  How much emphasis should we put on MKR holder profit vs. operating as a public good? What is the right balance between decentralization and efficiency? Should Maker stay isolated to crypto or expand to the real world? Should we burn MKR always vs. burning MKR tactically? Is Maker a bank? What is the right shape for MakerDAO (the organization)?  We are discussing these and other questions in Maker for years and are still discussing them today. In my opinion, it matters less what the vision for Maker is (although I certainly have my favorites) \u2014 what matters more is that we have a vision and stand united in executing it. If Maker had a vision, many strategic or tactical governance decisions would derive from them as well w/o the risk of falling back into the same fundamental debates over again. Instead, discussions about vision could be contained to the vision layer, and decisions about strategy could be contained to the strategy layer, etc., and wouldn\u2019t be conflated as much as they are today. With a consistent vision, there would also be less flip-flopping around important decisions because a vision is meant to be set in stone for at least the next 5-10 years.  Maker has a governance crisis In its current governance model, almost all steps of the decision supply chain are kicked to MKR holders. MKR holders are supposed to decide on every tactic, sometimes even down to the implementation level. Most of the time, someone with more local knowledge could make a better decision than them. In other cases, it is the lack of global knowledge: in the best case, MKR holders bring their own vision + strategy for the project and vote in a way that maximizes the probability of success. But usually, decisions are made without any concern for the long-term or information that sits outside the proposal at hand. This is further exacerbated by the continuous nature of Maker governance: if all budget decisions were made at the same time, it would automatically force decision-makers to zoom out & take a holistic view of the budget; instead, budget requests are streaming in every a week, and every decision is made without taking all other budgets in mind. Finally, there is a lack of voting incentives in Maker. Most MKR doesn\u2019t vote at all; this gives more relative power to MKR holders with an external incentive to vote. For example, they can vote to onboard collateral which would maximize their own portfolio rather than that of Maker as a whole. It would, however, be a mistake to blame MKR holders for this \u2014 Maker\u2019s current governance system is setting them up to fail. Maker has long outgrown the time when a single person can vote on everything. Specialization within layers of the governance supply chain, and cooperation between the layers of the governance supply chain, are urgently needed. But Maker\u2019s incentives actively discourage both: delegates have to vote on everything to get paid; specialization is actively discouraged; and the more voters/delegates participate, the less incentive there is for anyone to specialize.  image944\u00d7501 23.3 KB  In summary, the most overloaded role in Maker has been the MKR holder/delegate. Ironically, it is also the least incentivized at all. As a result, Maker has been less efficient, more wasteful, and less accountable to its holders than it could be. The status quo does not even maximize decentralization, because governance participation is minimal and important principles are not set in stone but rather depend on how who shows up to individual votes or discussions on a given day.  These two problems are related but not the same. For example, many of Maker\u2019s governance problems derive from its identity crisis. If there was a single source of truth for what Maker is or should focus on, governance would become easier (although still not easy enough.) But because a single source of truth is never established, fundamental debates frequently break out over seemingly unimportant votes or proposals. To address the two problems of identity crisis and governance crisis, we propose two changes to Maker. Both require no changes to the code infrastructure (not even the voting portal) \u2014 they are just changes in the process that should hopefully address the problems outlined above. Both are meant as an invitation to explore and discuss, not meant as final truth.  Proposal  Main idea #1: Create a Constitution for Maker In broad strokes, the constitution would be a document that breaks out the vision and other foundational principles from the rest of the governance supply chain. the constitution would define  Maker\u2019s vision and north star The rights & responsibilities of key stakeholders within the system Maker\u2019s mandates (e.g. make money for MKR holders, create the most liquid decentralized stablecoin, and become the cheapest source of credit)  The overarching of the constitution is to address the first problem, a lack of identity, but also has many positive effects on Maker\u2019s second problem, its governance crisis. The benefits can be broken down as such:  Create a rock-solid foundation of underlying principles of Maker. The constitution defines those parts that are explicitly NOT subject to frequent change and from which other decisions (e.g. on strategy or tactics) derive.  Encode in writing what we can\u2019t encode in smart contract code. Create a yardstick against which all other parts of the decision supply chain (delegates, council, MAs, CU members) can be held accountable \u2014 both by each other and by MKR holders. Cleanly separate the what (vision, goals) from how (strategy), so they can be discussed and decided individually.  The constitution is supposed to be a living but hard-to-change document that puts Maker\u2019s current identity in writing. most governance decisions can be derived from it. The constitution can be updated but this should require extensive discussion, a quorum of MKR holders, and a supermajority in a given vote. This locks in the slow-moving, decentralized nature of Maker as a decentralized credit protocol.  image944\u00d7501 26.6 KB  For thoughts on how the constitution could be initially written, see Appendix A.  Main idea #2: Establish a Council of Makers The overarching goal of the Council of Makers would be to break out the second part of the governance supply chain, Strategy, and give it a dedicated role. This role should be highly encouraged to specialize in what allows them to make good strategic decisions while being accountable to the Constitution as well as MKR holders/delegates directly. Specifically, the council could be tasked with  Setting a high-level strategy for Maker to reach the goals laid out in the constitution. Setting a budget for Maker.  Allocating the budget to CUs + external contributors. Managing bigger DAO transactions like buy buybacks, dividends, DAO-to-DAO partnerships, and token/debt offerings.  The goal is to give decisions that need global knowledge of Maker and the crypto credit market to an entity that has it. For example, it is impossible to make individual budget decisions for Maker without considering the budget of all CUs, Maker\u2019s current recurring revenue and runway, overall market conditions, etc. Specialization within the council would be further encouraged. For example, the council could have a fixed number of seats (7) with different areas of expertise, e.g. business, ALM, technology, legal, and wildcards. In order to attract the best specialists for these roles, competitive compensation will be required. The council members would be ratified by MKR holders and serve on fixed terms, e.g. 1 year.  image944\u00d7501 32.4 KB  The council would sit between the CUs and delegates, and be accountable to MKR holders at all times.  MKR holders/delegates appoint council members on 1-year terms MKR holders/delegates can fire council members anytime with sufficient quorum MKR holders/delegates need to ratify every executive spell. The council can not get any decisions passed on-chain unilaterally. It is paid to serve and propose.  For a discussion on how the council could be elected, see Appendix B.  Expected impact on Maker The biggest impact of this proposal would be to move from MKR holders/delegates deciding over all parts of the decision supply chain to deciding over three much slower moving areas:  The Constitution, which encodes Maker\u2019s vision, values, and principles The Council of Makers, which sets a strategy for Maker and manages its treasury Ratifying every spell before it goes on chain.  Instead, all decisions in Maker would be made at the right layer:  image2000\u00d71061 175 KB  Different issues (e.g. vision, strategy, or tactics) can be discussed at the right layer without conflating them. Mapping different layers to different decision-makers finally unlocks specialization, reduces the scope of any individual decision-maker, creates a separation of power, and increases accountability. As a result, CUs can have more freedom to build while at the same time being more accountable to MKR holders and the enshrined. Governance becomes more efficient, which is needed for Maker to scale. Governance becomes more robust to attack and capture. Maker is set up to harvest the enormous opportunity in front of us.  Implementation So, what is the minimum viable way to do these things? Fortunately, nothing needs to be changed technically \u2014 only governance MIPs. MKR holders/delegates still vote on any spell. Voting/polling, which has always been informal, is abolished in favor of more local decision-making by the Council and MAs. The Constitution and Council are in theory independent of each other \u2014 either could be implemented without the other, although they do unlock a lot of synergies if they are both implemented. As a result, if MKR holders want, they could be implemented in parallel tracks. Especially the process of creating the constitution might take longer than six months, but we could benefit from a Council much sooner. The next steps would be to  create a creation process plan for the constitution (see Appendix A) create an election process plan for the council (see Appendix B) create a compensation plan for the council   Appendix A - How is the constitution created? Based on some initial ideas, the process would have two steps. Initially, someone has to prepare a constitution. This could be done by the Council if it were to be elected first. The council could then prepare different versions of the constitution and sending to the vote. Alternatively, Maker could incentivize a Constitution WG/committee that is independent of the Council. Finally, there could be many independent individuals or groups working on preparing drafts of the constitution. In the second stage, all the available constitution drafts should be sent to a vote for MKR holders to choose from. I believe the optimal format would be a multi-round vote, with a discussion period between all rounds, until only one draft remains. The constitution should need a supermajority to pass (2/3+).  Appendix B - How is the council elected? Again, many different ideas here, but some thoughts we would need to address here are:  What should the specialist seats on the Council be? By what process do we propose Council members to MKR holders? Should we create a Council hiring committee? What should the compensation plan for Council members be? They should probably have clear and measurable objectives, and a large variable pay share tied to them for maximum accountability and incentive alignment Are members elected individually, or do MKR holders vote on different permutations of the Council?  Note that the Council would also be compatible with a Party system if that is where we end up going. ",

That being said, if these consensus mechanisms work well enough then it may still be possible for a universal set of shared values or principles to arise.

The others will probably wither on the vine as they wont have adequate unit economics.

How much emphasis should we put on MKR holder profit vs. operating as a public good? Earnings for MAKER holders is at the right point, everyone is doing their job, I personally wouldn\u2019t change it, but exposure to the public should be expanded.  pic2af3e487eb8f5a964bdaf10805456380840\u00d7437 263 KB  I always put it in context with the exposure and the bad decisions that FIAT had, of course there is no level of comparison but we realized how many bad decisions have made the dollar lose value but increase its exposure, therefore, if we make good decisions we increase our exposure and thus get them to use the protocol, but without exposure there is no use. Thanks to the Bretton Woods agreements, the value of the dollar continued to be the most important reference, so we can conclude that despite the bad decisions, the exhibition is the one that maintains the value of the dollar as an international reference, and that we must do with DAI so that be the reference value What is the right balance between decentralization and efficiency? That MAKER and DAI be used by the average citizen, small and medium investments, they are the ones that move the economy, if we increase our exposure to them they will continue with decentralization and efficiency Should Maker stay isolated to crypto or expand to the real world? Unity is strength, but I always liked the idea of \u200b\u200balso adding MAKER as a brand and doing business in underdeveloped countries where regulations are not so authoritarian, and getting these supplies to be paid with cryptocurrencies and stable currencies, which in the name of Maker have a % to return to the protocol and thus the commercial volume continues to move and we increase our exposure, or simply that this money is used for the vault, thus we manage to incentivize the vault and increase the exposure of MAKER towards the public that should be an important goal  image828\u00d71555 195 KB   FPC3n4qX0AA1qVF1200\u00d7675 57.8 KB   20220419_190423912\u00d7510 57.4 KB  These images are taken from the topic:     Recopilaci\u00f3n de Noticias sobre MakerDAO, DAI y MKR Latin America       Hola!  No se si enganchar\u00e1n o les resultar\u00e1 interesante la propuesta, pero se me ocurri\u00f3 abrir \u00e9ste topic para recopilar, contar y comentar distintas noticias que salgan y nos enteremos sobre MakerDAO, DAI y MKR, sea las publicadas en grandes medios de comunicaci\u00f3n o sea peque\u00f1as noticias de la vida cotidiana que nos resulten relevantes. En un principio pens\u00e9 en que sea sobre LATAM, pero no veo porque no podr\u00eda ser internacional.  Empiezo yo:  Hace unos d\u00edas se hizo viral en Argentina que un emp\u2026     From my peers: @Marian @0xRami @Nicolas_Bernabe I place this because for decentralization you have to touch reality, and adoption is our ultimate goal Should we burn MKR always vs. burning MKR tactically? No, I still support tactical burning, as continuous burning is a waste of money. Is Maker a bank? And this is the question that makes MAKER something completely different from the rest of the protocols that practically serve as a bank, Maker by having an image becomes a reason for being, since everyone here wants decentralization, users by having all The same vision of decentralization will never be a bank, the DAO\u2019s is a dream since the cypherpunks and without a doubt MAKER will be the first to do it, but we need that union of vision that I know we all have, but some personal interests can accident the arrival What is the right shape for MakerDAO (the organization)? I think that it is like a committee in part to give an opinion, but those who have MAKER and vote are like the \u201cbosses\u201d and in them they will accept or not the proposals, so it would be like a matrix model, then it would be like a matrix committee? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s practically those two models together. That is my opinion of course, I think that the use of DAI is the one that will increase the value of currency, a special value that the citizen will use more DAI than Tether for example, but for us to have that we need to expose ourselves to the real world, although they do not Like several people, the citizen uses more Tether than DAI despite the fact that Tether is much more insecure than DAI, the citizen uses more loans in a fashionable protocol or even does not use any, and all this happens due to ignorance, so therefore, we must be that teaching for the average citizen, that is where the true power is as a value.

As DAOs grow, opinions become fragmented and decision-making becomes more difficult. Whether a constitution or a core member, there will be a myriad of suggestions. But that shouldn\u2019t deter us from finding a common solution. @Hasu I applaud your ability to peruse a simple roadmap (constitution & council of makers) and deliver on promises outlined in your initial delegate platform. This seems to be one of the goal sof governance:     Hasu:  Encode in writing what we can\u2019t encode in smart contract code   I would endorse a document that does such but allows for flexibility to include new emerging product lines or shifting values of the DAO. We need to encourage agility. As for the council - deciding / allocating budgets seems to be the most important role. How do you limit conflict of interests between CU members? Will this be mostly outsiders? ",

When observed through that lens, it\u2019s clearly a governance attack. This is an attempt to codify the values of whichever VC/whale cartel wins an inevitable \u201ctest of strength\u201d with an immutable Constitution that has the sole purpose of silencing dissent and squashing attempts to innovate beyond what is considered permissible by the executives. At least now, we have VC/whale cartels battling one another. Under this new Constitution, we would assuredly have just one VC/whale cartel with codified morality that could not be violated. If I thought that there would be any chance that this Constitution would respect the ideals of decentralization, censorship-resistance and trust minimization that this DAO was found upon, then I\u2019d be interested. However, there is little to no chance that this proposal would have been made if the proposer didn\u2019t believe that the votes were there to codify the very specific centralized vision for Maker that he\u2019s been pushing for weeks/months. This is an attempt to allow VC-anointed executives to run MakerDAO as a business rather than allowing the DAO to operate in a truly decentralized way. It\u2019s an attempt to trade decentralization & censorship-resistance for max efficiency and a clear path to regulation. Decentralization is messy and less efficient than centralization. If we are seeking maximum efficiency, then we are simply giving up on the idea of a DAO. If this proposition is accepted, it will destroy the DAO and it will create a centralized and regulatable organization that no longer deserves the descriptor \u201cdecentralized\u201d. Reject this very obvious attack on Maker governance. ",

The amount of red tape and bureaucracy that we\u2019d be creating for ourselves with this type of system would be epic. DAOs require a natural level of limited chaos. We need to maintain a decentralized system where anyone can be heard on any idea and anyone can quickly rise up as a MKR voter or delegate. This proposition, in the context of today\u2019s VC/whale wars, is going in the opposite direction of that. It is designed to make innovation harder. ",

Not answering for @Hasu but don\u2019t really see how you could consider the delegates as playing the same role as the Council. As Hasu outlined, the Council is tasked with:   Setting a high-level strategy for Maker to reach the goals laid out in the constitution. Setting a budget for Maker.  Allocating the budget to CUs + external contributors. Managing bigger DAO transactions like buy buybacks, dividends, DAO-to-DAO partnerships, and token/debt offerings.   The Delegates have not performed these duties, they have not been directly asked to, and we don\u2019t know if they even want to! Part of the motivation for the delegation system was to pass executives more easily without having to harass MKR whales, but also to enable people to participate in Governance more efficiently (small holders can delegate to those with similar views and not incur the frictions with on-chain voting). I still don\u2019t think there is any consensus on what Delegate responsibilities are or ought to be. To me, Delegates gain voting power based on their values and the delegators alignment with them and express those views in on-chain votes. Today, delegates are forced to look at proposals largely in isolation because that\u2019s how our Governance system is currently designed. It seems logical to me that there be a group that carries out these higher level decisions (and existing delegates could indeed decide they want such a role with more defined expectations) and be rewarded for such efforts. The Council also has a fixed number of seats with different areas of expertise - I believe having a multidisciplinary team and more diversity would be extremely beneficial for solving some of the DAOs toughest problems.

This is a very unconstructive commentary and the anti-thesis of what Maker should aspire to - namely, a Forum for which ideas are debated (regardless of source) and ultimately voted on by the Maker token holders. This type of commentary basically suggests that individual contributors to Maker DAO Core Units cannot express an opinion and make proposals to the Maker community. That type of approach is, in effect, a powerful form of censorship. Censorship is more pernicious than the decentralization/centralization debate. It is this type of comment that, in my opinion, creates a climate of intimidation for some of those most intimately involved in the day-to-day execution of Maker token votes. It may be that individual contributors have thoughtful views and contributions. Should they not be encouraged to share them for the benefit of the community. Or is your proposal that the only way I can share a \u201clegitimate\u201d opinion is if I leave my role as a contributor to the Maker community?

Maker was handed off to us from the foundation as a very successful, high revenue-generating protocol. The inventive structure was rather elegant, although I will admit that smaller holders did not feel heard, and felt comfortable leaving the decision-making in the hands of a few, while they sought yield elsewhere. There was not enough tangible incentive to keep the MKR participating.     Hasu:  If we play our cards right, DAI can become the USD-as-a-service for the next generation of internet users around the world.   Fully agree man, this was, and still is the vision.     Hasu:  there\u2019s an excess of visions   Taking words out of my mouth lol     Hasu:  Should Maker stay isolated to crypto or expand to the real world?   A question I ask myself all the time, but to bring in the real world, you have to integrate it. We were already on the right path with this. Many many years ahead of any other protocol. It was what made MakerDAO unique. Every other project launched in the crypto space has been cloned dozens of times over and gone nowhere. We had something unique, an elegant incentive model:  Untold upside for proper governance:  BURN  Ultimate downside risk for poor governance: MINT   The arranger model alone, years in the making, live, cloneable, and infinitely scalable had us on track to grow exponentially regardless of macro conditions. The revenue from that alone would have sustained growth and burning through any market conditions. Regrettably, we chose to put those efforts on hold, effectively killing our revenue stream. Collectively, we chose to redirect resources toward efforts that not only produced zero tangible results, but our investments in those efforts also drained our treasury. (This was a decision we consciously made while having a perfectly good model that was already live.) Naturally, as the bear market began we continued to remain confused, discussing the same things over and over again. The way our governance was operating? Nothing could ever happen,  -We became a global central bank, run by 4chan.  Without revenue, and with a scary-looking market\u2026 pausing burning somehow became a popular idea.  The most crucial incentive structure built into MKR\u2026 the only thing that gave it any value whatsoever\u2026 removed, and replaced with\u2026 ???  Maker was turned into a pure risk asset. Zero upside. Only downside. To this day, MKR has negative value. DAI is fine tho, of course. With a completely broken incentive structure, what followed next was entirely predictable. ",

This a16z structure is homologous with this structure proposed (the exact same). It would allow smaller whales to collectively elect an executive team to have disproportionate impact to their holdings.     epowell101:  Just a comment that this is consistent - at least as I read it - w/ some suggestions from a post from a16z today on the overall subject: Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance - a16z crypto    This board of director structure and proposal stands to leave the  proposal authors, delegates, and MKR whales to gain personally or financially if enacted. For example, those seeking C suite roles, executive delegate roles, or  executive operations roles. These large MKR holders are concerned with their own influence, which is of course understandable. Yet, to pretend that this structure does not privilege these large maker holders who seek it is disingenuous at best. This structure stands to undermine the community and small MKR holders. It also means that if the largest MKR holder does widely delegate their votes, they will no longer have the ability to protect the system from this outsized external influence. This structure will centralize decision making. MKR Distribution is not uniform Dr. Andrew Hall\u2019s analysis applies to democracies, but the distribution of MKR tokens does not follow the distribution of votes in a democracy. Therefore, claiming this will increase representation is inaccurate in this case. Based on the true distribution of MKR, this plan is likely to centralize power among the conglomerate of whales and leave MakerDAO in a position of perpetual capture. There should be no engagement with such an initiative. Spine It is deeply concerning and shameful that we have delegates, whales, and internal Core Unit members continuing to push this structure after last week. Hiding behind the argument of \u201cmerits\u201d over the medium, does not obfuscate the reality here. As Marshall Mcluhan reminds us, \u201cthe medium is the message.\u201d Merits Aside from that, there are no merits to creating a centralized board. It does not scale and cuts out the ability for small MKR holders and community members to get involved. There is also a curious absence of the necessary legal and risk anslyses to debate the merits. If the authors are serious about this proposal, I would suggest they put in real time and analysis rather than moonlight here and expect the community to carry the stone.

(Another way of putting this would be: there\u2019s an excess of visions and strategies and no unity about them.)   I believe if this is the case what the dao should do is put more effort in governing the vision and the strategy. Delegates and core unit facilitators should do cross team meetings to coordinate on the best approaches, and put everything to vote for the sake of visibility and discussion.     Hasu:  This is further exacerbated by the continuous nature of Maker governance: if all budget decisions were made at the same time, it would automatically force decision-makers to zoom out & take a holistic view of the budget; instead, budget requests are streaming in every a week, and every decision is made without taking all other budgets in mind.   I believe this could be improved by having tools at hand that show the impact of budgets. Also it would be useful if some core units would comment objectively on other core unit budgets proposals. Core unit presentations should also come with more audiovisual material explaining who is the team and motivations behind core units. (There are already online meetings orgnaized where the core unit is presented to delegates i think, so that also is a good moment to ask questions).     Hasu:  Voting/polling, which has always been informal, is abolished in favor of more local decision-making by the Council and MAs.   Is this all decision-making going to be public? It would only make sense that all the decisions were comunicated openly to Maker holders and the community, in order to showcase that there\u2019s no individual interestests in say, blocking a core unit budget, stablishing a partnership with a friend or other corruption cases.     Hasu:  What should the compensation plan for Council members be? They should probably have clear and measurable objectives, and a large variable pay share tied to them for maximum   Would you be comfortable if no one of the people involved in the creation of this proposal would be available to be elected for the council? (If there are no individual interests at play it should be like that)     MadShills:  This board of director structure and proposal stands to leave the proposal authors, delegates, and MKR whales to gain personally or financially if enacted. For example, those seeking C suite roles, executive delegate roles, or executive operations roles.   Sounds more and more like creating a corporate structure. And in that scenario the ones at the top have a lot to gain.  Being said that, there are a couple of things that i liked about this proposal, saying that no executive will be passed without the approval of MKR holders and trying to find some strategy / vision. But i believe there are other ways to do this in the current status quo without having to go back to be a centralized entity.  Put more checks on Core Units to ensure they deliver what their mandate dictates and quaterly updates on their roadmaps More tools to easily visualize the impact of budgets Do more cross core-unit + delegates meetings to align on vision and strategy Less spending in trivial things not aligned to the Maker core If people want to point in some direction in the strategy, create polls and forum threads or try to unite teams around that vision/strategy instead of creating more power structures. (Seems like now is : I don\u2019t like the current strategy, but instead of trying to fix it i\u2019ll create a power structure so no one can dispute my strategy)  Personally i don\u2019t want to work for a boss, or a team of bosses who decide what is my task, my compensation, my place of work or any other thing. Many of us are here working for a DAO with the purpose of seing a decentralized organization move forward, and working professionaly with the vision of doing the best for the protocol and the users of it. If somehow we had the capability to make sure that the teams are working on that direction, ensuring cross-team communication and making sure no budget usage is \u201cstupid\u201d, that would probably work. But i understand some people have the need to have more tight control on the strategy to make things move faster or more aggresively. Efficiency could be used, but a DAO does not exist for the sake of efficienty, but for the sake of decentralization. My own opinions, and also not set in stone, more a vibe kind of thing. ",

(!)   I don\u2019t agree with this characterization, though of course we should discuss the differences. The mental model that I have in mind is: Governance of software wherever possible. For the rest, while it still needs a workforce, align the interests of the humans by having clear and explicit structures that protect the token holder, rather than implicit hierarchies. Over time, it should all converge towards smart contract code. MKR holders are unfortunately not empowered no matter how you cut it. The token holding structure is very concentrated and plutocratic. For what it\u2019s worth, you shouldn\u2019t really need a delegate system with such a concentrated token holder base. Worst-case, it just amplifies the token holder power of large holders by giving them leverage through other delegated stacks. But the system actually works and helps by making the representation of token holder interests more liquid and active, as well as catching small token holder views that are otherwise difficult to represent. It could still continue to be an essential part of governance in the future for this reason.     rspa:  Plus politiking would reign unchecked.   Politiking reigns unchecked today. This proposal buckets it to one window a year when a new Council is elected (or whenever a Council member is replaced).     rspa:  The way for decentralized orgs is to stay small, intact and with clean interfaces to the outside world.

(!)   EDIT see exchange below. I don\u2019t agree that most centralized companies are experimenting with holacracy. For what it\u2019s worth, holacracy is notoriously difficult to implement and only works in highly idiosyncratic scenarios. Most complex organizations eventually tend towards specialization to stay afloat and/or scale. I also don\u2019t agree that this proposal is aiming to centralize control of a DAO.

Concept of working groups equally shot down    I won\u2019t get into who paints what as what, but while I recognize the sentiments you\u2019re describing, it\u2019s my impression that the issue is a perceived lack of transparency more so than groups collaborating. Cross-CU initiatives have been around for a relatively long time now. My own synthesis of the emergent coordination mechanisms is the following:    Core unit on strategic planning   One way of looking at this emergent structure from high-level vision and strategy to practical tasks:  MKR Voter Committees - connect MKR holders and delegates Strategic Initiatives - connect delegates and core units (such as RES) Cross-CU Initiatives - coordination among core units around roadmaps and launch plans (such as L2, CMON, CMOFF, and SEC) Internal CU roadmaps  We (@SES-Core-Unit) have been supporting the formation of these collaboration structures. We are also working on our DAO Performance API and Dashboard which will formally document these elements in one place.       Hasu:   Now let\u2019s say you do specialize in spite of the financial disincentive AND the social disincentivize, you still run into the problem that your voting power on these issues is the exact same as before.    That\u2019s difficult to say, it depends on the voters\u2019 thinking. A delegate X who presents themselves as part of a coalition Y would still collect votes on their own proxy contract. Now the voter arithmetic is the same as political parties:   Some voters may vote for the person X, despite or thanks to their association with Y. If every voter votes like that, the delegates would collect the sum of their individual votes.   Some voters may vote for a random delegate associated with Y because they like the coalition (party vote). These are extra votes.   The same reasoning may go in the opposite direction: not voting for X or Y because the voter is deterred by the associated Y or X. These votes are a net minus.   The bottom line can easily be one where 1 + 1 is bigger than 2. Again, I do agree the governance infrastructure today isn\u2019t optimized for this case and there would definitely be some practical annoyances. Which is why I\u2019m saying: let\u2019s improve our consensus building governance infrastructure. ",

Any responsibilities really just fit within that advisory role: it\u2019s expected that, given that MKR holders and delegates agreed to pay for the Council, that they are likely to listen to this advise and use it to inform their vote.   The council would use the same mechanisms as anyone else to do their job. For example, hiring and firing of MAs would happen through the usual MIPs process that anyone else has access to. There\u2019s no multisig or anything; the council can\u2019t unilaterally create or drop dssvest streams.   No one is blocked from making competing proposals, or even create competing Councils, not on a UI level and not on-chain (even though that wouldn\u2019t be in the spirit of the proposal, which pleads for unity.) It\u2019s just that outsiders may be ignored if MKR holders and delegates indeed chose to listen to the Council all the time.   I guess the council may at some point propose a number of MIPs that allows them to skip the Governance Polling phase and where some of their proposals (hiring/firing for example) go directly into the executive.   So, if a delegate doesn\u2019t agree with the proposed structure, they could basically just ignore it and continue doing what they\u2019re doing. Although that would work against the intended united action of the proposal. @Hasu is that a fair representation? ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the proposal @Hasu From my professional experience, processes and tools enforce habits. If the habit doesn\u2019t exist in an organization and you put a tool/process on top it tends to fail. What we need is: start every proposal, signal request, idea, with 4 elements: what\u2019s the goal, what\u2019s the strategy, what\u2019s the opportunity size, what are the suggested tactics. CUs will implement the tactics/strategies and will get voted on chain and during the executive. Once the DAO starts thinking in terms of the 4 elements above, then we bring a process to standardize, stream line and enforce the basics elements. By that time, the DAO would have created a habit. These habits can be created by just putting a template in the forum for new posts/signal requests or a Google doc with the template in it. We will continue falling if we get proposals such as \u201cD3M protocol X\u201d. That\u2019s at most a tactic/implementation which normally hardly explains which exact goal, opportunity size and potential different/competing strategies can be considered to achieve the same goal.   Hence, governance votes in an incredibly narrow view of the topic, in this, i completely agree with your problem statement. Explicitly defining the 4 elements in a proposal helps succinct communication. if we don\u2019t structure business proposals in such a way, we are adding noise and entropy to the system, as we need to guess the goal and other strategies.  We all need to work to reduce noise and cognitive overhead in the DAO. (Actually, i would say @Hasu did manage to communicate very well the topic in a single clear piece) Ossification: In Blockhain, the only osified element is the one you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d change. The ones you \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d change will be changed, meaning not osified. I would suggest we all star using ossification with that exact meaning. I wouldn\u2019t clearly state anywhere the things we won\u2019t change. (Bitcoin and Unstoppable Code: The Difference Between Can't and Won't - YouTube) Constitution: it is easy to think about it as a concept we all understand, but i would take it\u2019s very basic concept and implement it in our Blockhain-decentralized context. Maybe just reach agreement on a set of important values, business areas of interest and use continuous voting to gauge the token holders sentiment and use that as a North Star that is less specific but alive. something along the lines of what @wouter  suggests. MA: mandated actors.  Mandated Actors are more a bug than a feature. There is no MIP definition (i couldn\u2019t find it). I\u2019ve asked and i cannot get a clear definition of which criteria makes you a Mandated Actor. It\u2019s a vestigial element from the Foundation that either gets ratified or dissolved. In @Hasu proposal, Mandated Actors take decisions at tactics levels, i would prefer CU members coordinate to create especialization groups to take decisions over tactics and implementation together. There are technical implementations that can unlock new tactics or even strategies. You don\u2019t want to minimize the cross pollination at such low level, that\u2019s where innovation happens: self organized cross functional teams is the key to success. CU members should feel free to join/create especialization groups that coordinate business areas. Example: CMON, CMOFF, L2. As long as there is a governance decision making artifact, as it happens now.  Council: i would like to achieve delegates especialization through incentives, the voter committee initiative and undelegation forced once a year or so. ",

I do not take a position for or against the proposal as a whole, but I think the Council part of it is poorly conceived.  The Council has a social mandate and C-suite level compensation to form opinions but no ability to make anything happen. On the other hand, Recognized Delegates are regarded as brain-less voting automations that merely make things happen. What is the point of severing the power to act from the responsibility to guide the strategy of the DAO? I suggest that Recognized Delegates are the Council. These roles should be merged, as they are in the status quo. \u201cMKR holders/delegates appoint council members on 1-year terms\u201d \u2013 I think this is better addressed by adding MKR compensation on top of DAI compensation for Recognized Delegates. The MKR compensation would use DssVest for a 1 year vesting delay. I think this would achieve the same intent as 1-year terms, but without the baggage of archaic annual elections. Nobody seems to appreciate the liquid democracy innovation that we have implemented here where anybody can be elected or unelected at any time. We can do liquid democracy because we have the blockchain and elections are practically cost free compared to archaic paper ballots. If we need to address the uncertainty that Recognized Delegates feel about their duration of service, we can double or triple the level of DAI compensation, problem solved.  Lastly, I want to point out that adopting my suggestions would make your simple proposal simpler and more feasible to adopt. ",

I understand people feel nervous that a constitution could harden a brand of governance that is antithetical to the founding values of Maker. I think it\u2019s the opposite. This is a free market. Anyone can buy Maker tokens and start voting. If you want to protect a set of values, enshrine it in a constitution now. Whatever protections or rights you are afraid of losing, participate in the process and ask for it now. We have a head start against institutions. VCs and hedge funds are relatively small compared to the big baddies out there. The big banks and investment shops are working on policies and procedures for custodying crypto in a compliant way. Maker\u2019s market cap is under a billion and we\u2019re in a recession. 6,12,18 months from now we can have big institutional funds with lots of available cash start buying Maker tokens and voting on proposals. Whether they want to change Maker or sabotage it to take it off the board, it\u2019s a much bigger threat than the current whale fight. So I think this is a great opportunity while there is a good group of people who genuinely care to codify Maker\u2019s values and ethical responsibilities to DAI holders. This internal political tension is a good pregame for when capital markets really start opening to crypto. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but maybe it\u2019s also possible a constitution could help with regulation concerns. Regulatory agencies care mostly about protecting retail investors. If we have a document that instructs the DAO operation and emphasizes protecting DAI holders, perhaps that can give some cover. If we live in a world where there are billions of DAI giving economic lifelines to people, it\u2019s harder to take it away compared to a scenario where a cohort of future Maker Holder\u2019s execute an action that benefit themselves at the expense of DAI holders or screw something up causing funds to be lost. If someone with legal expertise thinks that\u2019s way off then please share. ",

Rather, it risks exacerbating the principal-agent problem by creating smaller, less accountable and yet equally as risky platforms for the Maker Core. The fundamental theoretical problem with meta DAOs is massive adverse selection and corruptibility. Rune yesterday seemed to make corruptibility a key feature of the Endgame Plan. I believe you can incentivize the system to push corruption out - should it want to, but always leave the choice to the token holder. The simpler the incentives are, the fewer attacks surfaces are available. In Spanish you could use the term Taifa to describe the adverse selection meta DAO outcome, after the splintered Moorish kleptocratic mini-monarchies of the 11-15th centuries. They were parochial and inwardly-focused warlord kingdoms with no accountability and a thinly coherent common platform. They wasted themselves by squabbling amongst each other and allowed the Visigoths to slowly push them out of the Iberian peninsula. Instead, minority interests are better protected through an accountable independent layer of oversight that can propose changes if principal-agent interests fall out of alignment. If MKR holders wish to be plundered, they are still free to replace the Council and allow it.     fig:  I would endorse a document that does such but allows for flexibility to include new emerging product lines or shifting values of the DAO. We need to encourage agility.   Fully agreed but here a simple approach, just common-sense extensions of the existing foundation, can achieve the same outcome with much less risk to the Maker Core.  image1972\u00d71104 297 KB  Conceptually, layers of senior or cordoned-off risk-capital can more appropriately allocate layers of risk on the Maker foundation depending on the type of project envisioned. In this framework, tokenized wholesale RWA lending could be a senior layer of stDAI in the capital stack. You can still do the meta DAOs, or Moonshots, or whatever you want to call them, just providing the infrastructure. You pigeon-hole Moonshots into using Dai from the beginning and by default they must stake some capital first rather than free-ride on the Maker platform with adverse selection. MKR holders could always allocate additional stDAI capital on top if they believe the project is a worthwhile risk. But the project proponents always face first-loss and have something to lose well before the Maker Core starts to bear any significant risk. This is just a sketch of an idea, I\u2019m sure it can be improved. But it already seems like a massive improvement in risk exposure and technical feasibility (no token ICOs, etc) vs meta DAOs, with very very little changes on the existing protocol, which can continue operating unchanged. Thank you both for your constructive feedback. ",

Even the most elegant decision making structure fails if good information isn\u2019t incentivised to flow towards decision makers. Traditionally, very concentrated ownership/ control incentivises bad info flowing up because it supports lobbying vs quality - which doesn\u2019t have time to lose and moves somewhere else. This is the Vladimir Putin Decides to Invade Ukraine paradox. You are super smart, super rich, super powerful, but then because of this you incentivises sycophants and ultimately take decision based on adversely selected / poor information, decisions that have adversarial effects for both parties. I have never doubted @rune good faith and ability to vision, but I\u2019ve been sceptical he has been exposed to the best info package. That\u2019s what I tried to do but ultimately those with higher economic incentives had better access, as it always happens. This is what we should avoid on the first place. We should construct IMO a system that incentivises plurality of opinions and fair playing field of ideas, otherwise there won\u2019t be any protection layer to save us. MetaDAOs will be managed by the best connected folks (and not the best collateral), council members will be the most connected folks (and not the most independent).

We should construct IMO a system that incentivises plurality of opinions and fair playing field of ideas, otherwise there won\u2019t be any protection layer to save us. MetaDAOs will be managed by the best connected folks (and not the best collateral), council members will be the most connected folks (and not the most independent).   In other words: don\u2019t expect there to be a single vision/strategy or advisory group (council) with a high likelihood of echo chambers forming. Instead, map out the diversity of ideas and build the best governance processes to select the best ones based on merit. Like so:     wouter:  (1) identifying competing visions and strategies and quantifying the MKR support, (2) iterating on governance improvements to maximize the common ground, and (3) work towards an emergent constitution starting from there (I.e. ossification of a universal set of principles)   I understand the urge to try and somehow skip the slow and frustrating consensus building part. The reality is: we won\u2019t be able to, unless we let MakerDAO devolve into a centralized structure because that is the only way to obtain quick alignment. I believe this lies at the heart of the concerns people may have with this proposal: this proposal in itself doesn\u2019t present a centralized structure. However it presents a solution that will only work if it is combined with further centralization. A more realistic view may be that DAOs are by definition political due to their decentralized nature. We will need to build better consensus forming mechanisms if we want to give MakerDAO the ability to present a coherent future vision supported by a majority of token holders. And it won\u2019t be the only one. So, I personally love the way this proposal focuses on the decision making process and does not push for a particular vision in advance. That is one step in the right direction compared to Growth Task Forces. I do think it still needs a couple of iterations to come to terms with the fact that we\u2019re operating in a decentralized environment, and the core challenges related to that. For now it seems to be ignoring that elephant in the room by assuming we\u2019ll be able to somehow come to an agreement once and for all relatively quickly. ",

As the MIP75 author it was a means to address the bottlenecks I was observing coming up. I am a practical guy, so when I see issues my impulse is to fix them. Task Forces was always a pragmatic half-measure and in retrospect probably should have been pulled instead of sent to vote as it was clearly generating hostilities. I\u2019ll take the blame for that.

When a proposal, whether data driven or not, is outside of your mandate, it is probably not appropriate to coordinate as a single whole unit. That of course depends on what a core unit\u2019s mandate is.  Proposals Require Data With regards to the merits of the proposal. I did not find any substantive analysis or empirical basis in the proposal text. This absence makes evaluation of the merits impossible. It also suggests the proposal authors would do best to return when they have provided enough information for us to have an informed discussion. Once we have real data points and an impact analysis, the community may offer critiques on the pros and cons. This approach will yield a productive dialogue rather than a thread of confusion. I may have missed the analysis or data.  If I am wrong, please simply reply here quoted.  Understanding Core Units Returning back, can SFCU please address whether this proposal is the official position of the mandated strategic finance core unit @strat-fin-core-unit? Other CU above have already weighed in definitively above. (PE @Protocol-Engineering and RWA @Real-World-Finance ) Perhaps it is possible to hear the official position of other core unit facilitators as well? For example, @Risk-Core-Unit and @collateral-core-unit, as this proposal would change their operations and some individual contributors may be involved?  Clarifying Mandates For organizational clarity, it makes sense for us to understand how the proposal contributors and their core units view their roles here. Is this proposal official and part of the SFCU mandate or not? If not, where are we drawing the line? If SFCU does believe this is within their mandate, we likely need to review and update the SFCU mandate to get everything into conformance.  Communication Avoids Conflict Without answering these questions we will be unable to disentangle miscommunication and avoid future conflicts. Communication heads off conflict.  We must clarify expectations between core units, MKR holders, and the community. Repairing communication and transparency is the path to rebuilding trust. To fail here, and move forward without clarity, sets us up for unnecessary and continual drama. ",

FYI all - I have adopted a personal code of conduct \u201cDaverington House Rules\u201d and wanted to distinguish what I think we\u2019re talking about here in terms of a constitution. Also, I am holding ACREinvest office hours next Wed, 6 July to answer questions about the MIP55 Chief Legal Officer proposal. I saw some questions in the event chat yesterday and someone may have posted here wondering if there is a connection (no!) or has there been private coordination between myself and @Hasu (no!) or was any VC involved in directing my proposal or desire to serve (no!). Details in the post: ACREinvest Delegate Platform - #28 by ACREinvest One urgent issue we don\u2019t spend enough time on at MakerDAO is the social/human dynamic of what we do here and how. I believe membership in the Council should have requirements about reputation and character that demonstrate members have sufficient EQ to understand and support the most sophisticated and advanced technology asset we have here - the HUMAN SPIRIT.  What is emotional intelligence or EQ? Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:   Self-management \u2013 You\u2019re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.  Self-awareness \u2013 You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.  Social awareness \u2013 You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization.  Relationship management \u2013 You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.   I\u2019m supportive of a new effort to create a community/MKR holder ratified constitution-like document, but this should NOT be a Code of Conduct or set of rules for community member behavior. ",

                    "content": "I was watching the recording of the call and I disagree to a conceptual element, at least based on my understanding from the call. In the call, it was mentioned that The Maker Council would propose a Spell for the next executive cycle and delegates and token holders to vote on it, or reject it for another different spell. To me, this feels very top-down and micro management approach on contributors when I compare it to a \u201cRelease Train\u201d deployment approach. I understand our executive cadence as a release train: the development teams add to the Executive Spell the code that is ready to be deployed (readiness definition in this case is a mix of technical + governance process completion). If a tech team feels they prefer to wait one or more executive cycles, so be it. They are the ones closer to the code, to the readiness and are in fact the ones taking the final decision on adding their code base to an Executive Spell or not, not a Maker Council. Maker Council should wait and tech teams deliver when ready. The proposal starts bottom-up, not top-down. The Maker council, or other stakeholders in general, must provide prioritization at a high level based on a set of inputs: goals, strategies, opportunity size, effort estimations or risk mitigation urgency, but once a priority is set at high level, it is up to the teams on the ground to agree on readiness and propose an Executive Spell. My preferred approach would be that The Maker Council or other stakeholders must agree on prioritization frameworks, on business proposal frameworks, on strategies to be raised for voting, but not be closely involved on Executive Spell granularity level. Lastly, let\u2019s remember that anyone could potentially craft a Spell, so even if the Maker Council would be \u201cthe decision maker\u201d on Executive Spell scope, the permissionless ness of our protocol would not allow for that in its current state. Happy to hear your thoughts ",

                    "content": "Thanks everyone for the spirited discussion. I\u2019ve gone through the thread and call to collect what I see as the most substantive question, and answer them to keep the discussion flowing. Please let me know if I missed anything.  Disclosures  As I also lay out here and here, I have been doing this work for free and without expectation of future profits. I have no plans, nor have I had any plans, to join the Council I am proposing. The same is true, to my knowledge, for my co-contributors (although our excellent stratfi CU today is doing some of the work that I\u2019d envision the council to do)   List of FAQs  What is the role of the Council? What is the interface between Delegates and the Council? Can\u2019t the Delegates just be the Council? What is the interface between MAs and the Council? Who decides the composition of spells? How does this proposal address the problem of governance apathy? Who sets the vision? How does the Simple Plan protect minority holders? How complicated will the Simple Plan be to implement?   What is the role of the Council?  I think the most pressing jobs for the Council are to set a high-level strategy for Maker, then design Maker\u2019s balance sheet (asset side + capital structure) to maximize the likelihood of realizing our strategic goals. The way it does this is by making high-level budget allocation decisions The Council has no formal decision-making power \u2014 that stays entirely with MKR holders and delegates. Everything the Council suggests is sent to voting as MIPs/SRs The important part isn\u2019t that only the Council can do these things but that there is now a party who is explicitly responsible for thinking about a strategy and budget from a holistic place, and in this role it is accountable to the DAO. So I think of it as division of labor in governance, not as introducing hierarchy   What is the interface between Delegates and the Council?  The role of the Council is to propose strategic + budget + personnel changes in the form of MIPs/SRs. These are then sent to delegates (and other MKR holders) to vote on Delegates will remain a valued and important part of the governance system but it would change from a role of low-level decision maker to a role of active oversight Delegates are entrusted to represent MKR holder views in selecting the right members of the Council and providing ultimate oversight to their activities and performance They are, and anyone still is, free to submit their own MIPs and SRs as today   Can\u2019t the Delegates just be the Council?  The reason a Council should be a separate group from Delegates is that someone needs to watch the Council and approve all changes before they go on chain, and that would be the role of MKR holders and their Delegates The Simple Plan establishes an explicit separation of proposal and decision, which increases (not decreases) accountability If, for instance, the Council were also Delegates and represented a commanding amount of MKR itself, their power would be much greater than if they could only create MIPs, and needed token holders to review and ratify them   What is the interface between MAs/Core Units and the Council?  The Council sets a strategy and a high-level budget for Maker. The MAs should steer Maker in accordance with that strategy but are otherwise left greater freedom to execute than today This is because in tandem with introducing an independent Council, you can replace manual governance processes to approve work, that we largely operate on today, with process-driven governance that relies on ultimate approval/disapproval from MKR holders In return for the greater freedom, the Council can evaluate the performance of MAs and Core Units and can recommend their hiring & firing independently   Who decides the composition of spells?  The spell is created entirely by MAs and their CUs. There is huge potential in the local knowledge sitting inside CUs and even more that can be unlocked by cross-CU collaboration. From there, the spell is sent to MKR token holders and delegates to vote on In the past, the community has been allergic to CU collaboration or CUs making clear recommendations what to prioritize - we explicitly want to turn this on its head and empower CUs to drive the day-to-day of the protocol This is welcomed provided there is independent accountability to MKR holders on CU performance The community and third-parties could and should also be free to submit their own spells in a bid to increase protocol decentralization   How does this proposal address the problem of governance apathy?  The Simple Plan reduces the number of operational decisions MKR holders have to make. Their most important decision becomes electing and overseeing the Council rather than deciding the day-to-day of the protocol It\u2019s much easier to engage token holders to vote for their desired candidate, than to get them to stay informed on dozens of complicated decisions per week. If other representative governance systems are any guide, the result is more participation, more oversight, and less risk of capture by special interests, in spite of making fewer formal decisions   Who sets the vision?  The most important aspect of the Simple Plan is to start from the beginning and make sure a foundational vision is set by token holders & Delegates How this vision-setting process takes place, or what specific vision ends up emerging, is less important than having one in the end There are many ways to execute this vision-setting process, for instance:  You could take many competing visions and have them read from each other and exchange in a vigorous and meritocratic debate. Then host a voting process, perhaps even including Dai holders and borrowers Another way to do it is with groups of individuals having a go to write it, who might not even need to hold MKR. Some cross-CU initiatives are already in place that resemble what this process could look like, e.g. the Resilience Improvement Initiative      How does the Simple Plan protect minority holders?  Simple Plan goes even further than we are today for minority protection Firstly the ESM is not going anywhere - the Simple Plan makes no changes to the core protocol The Constitution codifies explicitly what is and isn\u2019t appropriate to change via governance, and thereby hardens the DAO against governance attacks The council would drastically remove the ability for special interests to get proposed passed due to voter apathy, which tends to be the biggest risk for minority MKR holders Finally, the Council can have independent parties, who might not be MKR holders, and provides a counterbalance to an echo chamber of large token holder views Focus is to keep governance programmatic and leave as much untouched as possible   How complicated is the Simple Plan to implement?  The Simple Plan looks at what minimalist additions are possible to the existing governance structure to maximize accountability and overlays them with minimal changes to governance, no changes to the core protocol, and no changes in tokenomics The Simple Plan is the result of looking at core governance issues that have stemmed from a lack of vision and a lack of accountability, and aims to tackle them by building up from common sense first principles Practically speaking, I would recommend starting with creating a constitution, because it strikes me as an improvement with no downsides no matter what plan (Endgame, Simple plan, etc.) is ultimately enacted.

Perhaps unpacking the election part might help? also, is the deck from your call available somewhere? the map of functions to me is the most important bit. As a DAO we\u2019re missing critical functions like strategy so would like to understand those functions/outputs/controls more. @adcv maybe? ",

The 6-month role would potentially overlap nicely with the selection and implementation of the council, and serve to provide specific stewardship and cross-DAO coordination across the numerous legal and regulatory initiatives underway, provide support to lawyers already engaged by the DAO and additional outside counsel that might need to be engaged, as well as assist MKR holders and delegates in evaluating current real-time issues of a legal, compliance and regulatory nature that would be crucial inputs for making strategic decisions.

I also think we should work together to pursue a decentralized version that actually evaluates the implementation, not just  a proposal idea. The devil is in the details so until we have a concrete implementation to evaluate the threads will probably be less productive. IIUC If both were implemented:  There is one council, and there is a CLO floating off in the distance advising a single delegate? Are they are offering opinions to the council?  Trying to understand for Kianga\u2019s sake, otherwise there will just be a pile of money being burned and low efficiency of the spend. Also unclear what it means if the CLO only represents her other delegate entity? Is that acceptable from the DAO perspective? Is there some analysis or thinking that establishes this is truly the best path, compared to something like what SES is doing? I understand this seems somewhat orthogonal but it is also very much related, by defining the boundaries each counterpart becomes well defined. ",
