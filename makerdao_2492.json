It has now been proven beyond a doubt that launching a synthetic asset without a proper funding mechanism was silly. If we can\u2019t introduce that funding mechanism via a change to DSR, then the least socially damaging version of TRFM should be considered as an interim measure. Minting DAI 1:1 with USDC is not a valid peg-fixing solution. A negative DSR also removes a lot of complexity from the system because MKR holders can choose a DSR SF spread that will be their profit, while the market will set the actual DSR and SF values. This guarantees all risk taken by MKR holders is paid for, unlike the current model where we have 140M of ETH debt not producing any income for us. With a spread and negative DSR, we could fix the spread to 2% and the market might set the following rates:  -3% DSR -1% SF  With these rates all will be resolved and harmony between parties achieved. MKR holders get paid for taking risk, DAI minters get paid for arbing, DAI holders pay for the privilege of owning DAI and whatever value that provides them. ",

I am in favor if we can confirm there is a feasible way to implement a negative DSR. P.S. If we set the DSR to a large negative value doesn\u2019t it directly negate most of the pressure from comp rewards? Say if we set it to like -10% or -20%? I don\u2019t necessarily think this is what we should do, but it is nice that we would have that much control over external tampering with our supply and demand incentives ",

Unpredictable gas pricing for transfers due to the negative DSR needing to be applied.  TRFM:  Breaks 1DAI = $1USD  I don\u2019t have good answers for the negative DSR issue but on the topic of TRFM, we can ensure that 1DAI <= 1USD and that long-term it should likely be 1DAI == 1USD. We simply lower the target rate below 1 USD when DAI is above the peg and once the peg is restored, we can raise the target rate back towards 1 USD. This means that if generally we do not have an excess demand for DAI, we will see DAI trade at 1USD with a positive DSR and SF. However, in extreme events, we are given a powerful tool to restore the peg and then recover our USP (unique selling point, 1DAI == 1USD) once the peg has been restored. I\u2019d also like to point out that DAI trading at $1.02 is also breaking the social contract around DAI and hurting our USP, so inaction is not an option. ",

                    "content": "When it comes to monetary policy I think we should look towards Central Banks at their ever growing and serious list of tools. One of the biggest things that can drive people away from cash is \u2018inflation\u2019.   While the FED has an inflation \u2018goal\u2019 or \u2018target\u2019 they have a lot of tools to manage markets (and they don\u2019t even care what the price of a dollar is except as compared to the basket of items people buy - in the form of - inflation).   How they manage this is with monetary policy.   All driven by injecting or removing USD liquidity from various markets.   The FED DOES NOT manage inflation by trying to control the value of the USD by directly interviening in markets as per something like the PSM.   How they do control inflation is by directly interviening in the short and long term bond markets (by buying or selling bonds) and thereby driving $$ return rates.    (While Maker for a time dictated rates this is becoming less so as secondary markets are growing larger and more mature)   The other way is by directly injecting liquidity into various markets.   For quite some time up until 2008 crisis what markets the FED would directly manipulate were limited, after 2008 and now covid they literally do and will manipulate a whole bunch of markets now.    This is a tool that Maker simply has refused to consider.   Creating a secondary reserve fund to be used in direct market operations to buy or sell assets to injection and remove DAI liquidity directly. As mario rightly points out:     mario:  At the end of the day there is no perfect solution, only compromises. What we as a community need to define is which compromises are we willing to give without killing the dai core value proposition.   The real question is what does the larger community think DAI\u2019s value proposition is?    I honestly don\u2019t have any sense of what that is because we have no mechanics to solicit opinion from the greater community.    I have wanted for a long time a means for vault, DAI holders + system operators, developers etc. to be able to give feedback to Maker governance.   I don\u2019t know if I posted this publicly but the idea that we would pay people who fit certain conditions to answer surveys I think would honestly be useful for the protocol and as a means to guide the answers to the above question of what compromises Maker governance needs to make to satisfy the community as right now we are just guessing what is important based on a few vocal players.   We need to hear the voices of thousands if not 10\u2019s of thousands on these issues.   Not 100. ",

As soon as the peg is restored you can begin raising the target rate of 1DAI back towards 1USD. So in the long-run we should see 1DAI = 1USD due to inflation making DAI unattractive to hold at 0% DSR. Is temporarily breaking the USP, until we can scale the supply side of MakerDAO ",
