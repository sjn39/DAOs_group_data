I think many things which are voted upon are useless, like removing a collateral which is not producing enough surplus. This is not such a critical thing to need everyone\u2019s attention. So I think for each set of actions we should just choose someone responsible to take care of it instead of putting up a vote. Like how you would pick a team for running a website e.g. someone in charge of frontend, backend, security etc\u2026 Like i see it perfectly fine that @SebVentures just chooses how much resources to allocate to something in the RWA area, he can of course talk to other team members but it\u2019s just much cleaner that there is formal person in charge of something and others won\u2019t waste their time arguing and pushing the changes back in time. I want to note that i\u2019m fairly new and this might be a very bad take! I\u2019m just saying what i\u2019m observing. ",

I think the ultimate solution to the problem you addressed revolves around \u201cstreaming power\u201d to employees. You allow the MKR voters to delegate decision making power with the ability to diminish it at any time, or cut it off all together. This gives some level of autonomy to employees while still having MKR voters be indirectly in charge. Currently, this is not being done in MakerDAO. There is no ability to stream funds to core units, or \u201cstream power\u201d to the different employees. I am currently researching these topics to solve the problem you proposed. ",

Governance       With the extension of the Maker SourceCred trial, the team running the Maker SourceCred instance has received feedback that it is difficult to find information on opting in to receive payments and about the trial in general. This post is meant to be a useful resource for information on SourceCred and how it pertains to Maker.   What is SourceCred / Why should I be interested?  SourceCred is a way of paying contributors based on the value they add to a community. In the context of MakerDAO, using\u2026      Paper ain\u2019t lying, you can see payouts for all the participants here: http://makerdao.sourcecred.io/#/accounts  Perhaps time to get back to the topic at hand though which is downsides rather than benefits of the DAO. Feel free to message me here (or on Maker Discord, same handle) if you need assistance enrolling or have further questions. Thanks for bringing up this topic @sasa. There are a lot of tradeoffs made by decentralization, at least in the forms we\u2019re seeing so far they tend to trade off efficiency for lack of central authority. This manifests in many ways (like to your point debating/voting on topics less relevant to general parties), but the neat thing is we aren\u2019t married to the current paradigm. The protocol has the ability to designate decision making to authorized Multi-sigs, if we wanted to go down that path. Fairly easy implement on the governance side too. So if there are items you feel should be under the discretion of a select group of people, it might be worth reaching out to them and seeing if they\u2019d be up to make the proposal/take on the responsibility.
