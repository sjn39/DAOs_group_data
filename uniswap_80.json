In this report, we\u2019d like to give an overview of our research and highlight wins and pain points felt by members around the community. This will be closely followed by a separate post detailing specif\u2026     Just wanted to highlight here our recent research we did this semester regarding Uniswap\u2019s governance! ",

We\u2019ll preface by saying that considering how \u201cunexpected\u201d this discussion arose, we appreciate the UF team for their quick thinking and on the feet decisions.  When looking at the main debate surrounding L0 and Wormhole, we\u2019re still internally conflicted on which is ultimately the best, and think each has benefits of their own. Ultimately, we don\u2019t think this proposed structure of finding a bridge partner is ideal and sets a bad precedence. We propose:   A working\u2026         [RFC - Update] Deploy Uniswap v3 (1 / 0.3 / 0.05 / 0.01) on BNB Chain (Binance) Proposal Discussion       This will be our (FranklinDAO/Penn) last post here seeing the impending 3 hour deadline for votes. Since we last posted here a few hours ago where we expressed our opinions regarding how we believe future bridging solutions should go, we are currently abstaining from a vote.  For some background, this has certainly been the #1 most lobbied vote on Uniswap that we have ever partaken in. Our opinions expressed above should be coupled with this thought: no matter the outcome, this should be a short\u2026     ",
