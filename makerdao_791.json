Paragraph Summary MIP68 onboards a RWA Vault backed by the assets of a trust arranged by Monetalis. It brings about a RWA structure that can onboard a specific Green Economy SME lending strategy in the UK, but designed to be flexible enough to start as platform for adding other underwriting teams and executing other lending collateral strategies efficiently. And share structure oversight and design features with MIP65.  Component Summary MIP68c1: Specification of the Proposed Structure and Contemplated Collateral Assets This component describes the details of the structure that Monetalis proposes to onboard as collateral, and the details of the collateral Monetalis will acquire. MIP68c2: Vault Financial Terms and Parameters This component outlines the key financial terms of the vault and legal structure hereof. MIP68c3: Technical Details This component contains the data and instructions necessary for the unambigous technical execution of the collateral onboarding. MIP68c4: Debt Ceiling Gradual Increase Mechanism This component describes an automatic process that increases the Debt Ceiling of the vault further once the first portion of debt has been used.  Motivation Monetalis submitted a MIP6 proposal late October 2021 and received a positive Greenlight vote in late November 2021. Based upon recently received feedback, work done within Monetalis in this period our vault proposal has been redesigned to what is proposed under this MIP. The intention of Monetalis to support Maker\u2019s aspiration along a broad number of dimensions remains:  Help the continued professionalization of RWA operations and integration between TradFi/Maker. Contribute to scalable growth of diversified, high-quality RWA collateral. Operationalize the Clean Money vision. Operationalize an entrepreneurial underwriting team Model. Create and operationalise a high-quality on-chain/off-chain TradFi/DeFi integration point.  The proposal should be seen as connected with MIP65 in accordance the strategy outlined in Monetalis Evolution  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP68c1: Specification of the Proposed Structure and Contemplated Collateral Assets  Structure The following legal structure will be used. It is a feedback adjusted version of the previous proposal. It continues to be a simple, plain vanilla, UK traditional securitization structure for this Asset class.  1338\u00d7558 99 KB  This structure is functionally separated as follows and parameterized in the following sections.  1359\u00d7572 191 KB  The final documents underpinning the proposed structure will be finally designed and agreed in collaboration with an external legal counsel appointed by Maker. Structure This structure, beyond allowing Monetalis to start our Green Economy SME wholesale Lending business, is flexible enough to allow Monetalis to scale in a number of ways in practice:  We can sponsor/incubate new, more innovative, underwriting teams focused on Maker relevant lending segments. These could be implement simply via signalled changes to Strategic Credit Guidelines and, potentially, Vault increases - a capability easily extendable to include the EU market. We can reuse/clone our TradFi/Maker integration point (BVI trust/trustees/Governance package/Bank/Auditor/Accountant etc) to support execution efforts such MIP65 Clydesdale and other potential arranged collateral. Over time, with multiple collateral types and situations tested against this structure \u2014and continued improvements of the structure\u2014, components/processes that can beneficially be moved on-chain will naturally reveal themselves and be executed upon.

This means that Maker (via MGB) can ask for the Bond to be run-off at any time and for whatever reason. This means the usual complex covenant rules, allowing the buyer of the Bond to redeem the Bond for certain breaches, are not needed. It puts all power in the hands of Maker and transaction costs (particularly exchange rates). The funding provided under the Bond is strictly constrained by the Strategic Credit Guidelines, which can be adjusted from time to time in agreement between Maker and Monetalis via a signal. This Bond constructs, under current UK and BVI, a situation of zero withholding tax on the PIK interest at the outset. Over this year we will complete a listing of the Bond, at which point all payments from the Bond will be on a zero withholding tax basis, in line with UK securitization standards for non-UK institutional investors. This means interest will accrue in the Bond until the above listing is accomplished and monthly interest payments can resume. In calculation of collateral value, defaults are deducted. Defaulted receivables are defined as follows:  \u201c\u2026any Receivable which becomes 90 days or more overdue from its original due date; and in respect of which the related Debtor is in liquidation, administration, receivership or bankruptcy (or analogous proceedings), or legal proceedings have been commenced for its recovery or which have been written off as uncollectible in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policies\u2026.\u201d  The Attestor/Attestor Committee appointed in MGB will have information and Audit rights on the Bond instrument. The Credit Committee, which approves all credit taken on to the Bond, will require a unanimous yes for an approval. Three persons will be on this Committee, one of which will be an independent industry party. MGB (i.e., the Attestor) will have the right to approve/reject this independent credit committee member as he/she is proposed by Monetalis. 2. STRATEGIC CREDIT GUIDELINES & DEPLOYMENT PATTERN FOR COLLATERAL 2a.

The legal representation of Maker will be via BVI trust with the following parameters:     Category Parameters/Terms     Name Maker Green Bond Trustee Limited (\u201cMGB\u201d)   Legal Structure BVI-based English law trust with control over all material decisions given to the Beneficiaries through the MakerDAO resolution mechanism   Beneficiaries MKR holders   Scope of Trust & Operations The scope of the activities are strictly limited to the following main components:Buy and hold Eligible Bond from MonetalisMint DAI from Vault and convert to fiat to fund Bond Convert to DAI all proceeds of the Bond and pay to VaultOtherwise as directed by MakerDAO resolution   Trustee [SHRM Group, BVI]   Scope of Trustee Instructions The Trustee is not given any material discretions and will expect to be directed by the Beneficiaries   Governance outside of Trustee instructions MKR holder resolution mechanism. An Attestor can be appointed by Maker to oversee the activities of the Trustee.   Services to Trust Admin Services: [SHRM Group, BVI]Bank/Custodian: [Bank Sygnum, CH]   Reporting [SHRM Group, BVI]   Auditor TBD    Key Parties:  SHRM Bank Sygnum  The \u201cMaker Off-chain Governance Package\u201d (instructions to Trustee, Attestor/Attestor Committee role and Maker Vote) will be set to conform with the practice in development within the RWF CU team and for community decision. It will be adjusted over time via Maker Resolutions/Signals as it evolves into better practices.  MIP68c3: Technical Details This Vault is implemented using the MIP21 standard with the following parameters at launch  Collateral Adapter address: [xyz] Conduit address: [xyz] Initial Debt Ceiling: 50 million Stability Fee: 0% (Yield is paid manually to the buffer directly by the trust)  All other risk parameters are not applicable.  MIP68c4: Debt Ceiling Gradual Increase Mechanism This MIP includes a mechanism for increasing the Debt Ceiling further to improve scale and throughput of the onboarding process, while reducing risk. Once the MIP68 vault has surpassed 40 million debt and maintained at least 40 million in outstanding debt for 30 consecutive days, a Debt Ceiling raise to 100 million is included in the next executive votes until it is executed. This mechanism can be deactivated to prevent the automatic increase of the debt ceiling. Deactivation occurs if a valid signal request that specifically mentions deactivating MIP68c4 passes the on-chain poll stage. At least 2 weeks in advance of the executive vote to increase the debt-ceiling, Monetalis will file on the forum an Independent Credit Audit of the Monetalis business. Also, at least 2 weeks in advance of the executive vote to increase the debt-ceiling, Monetalis will file a report on the forum clarifying how professional/institutional capital have been/will be included in Monetalis issued non-bank lender facilities on a retro- and prospective basis.

The 0% is not a typo - there is an idea behind it - will explain and we can have the discussion on what is the right approach on that. Irrespective the basic econonmics from the SME Green Wholesale lending (you can also see it in the UK Bond table), in short-form, is: Gross Interest target : 4 - 5% (\u2026will be more if inflation keeps running up - this number is market-driven - i.e. what you can competitively offer to prime senior secure wholesale loans in market at any one time\u2026) Mgmt Fee to Monetalis : 1% Fixed Interest to Maker on bond : 2% Remainder/profit split 80% to Maker/20% to Monetalis Then there are some structural cost (BVI trust etc) and hedging fees that we will get recalculated also ASAP - it\u2019s a bit different at this new proposed scale.

                    "content": "I\u2019m taking a step back to evaluate this MIP since I think we are in uncharted territory. My reply is not specific to Monetalis. I\u2019d like to assist the community in understanding what the CES Core Unit would do if we decided to do a technical implementation such as this. This MIP falls outside of the current collateral onboarding process so I have to assume I may not have the support of any other CUs. Core units are independent and the details are up to each CU on how to best implement their mandate. For me, a mandate is what I proposed during my Core Unit onboarding and that which has been ratified with the community. I went back to review the CES Core Unit MIP to reflect on our mandate in relation to this proposed MIP and the context of this situation. The key points I\u2019d like to identify are:  Dai supply, enablement, and operationalizing the process Ensure the stability and security of the ecosystem  Let\u2019s dive into the Implementation for this proposal. Please understand the MIP21 isn\u2019t plug and play and months of implementation to onboard collateral has shown us this. The goal is to operationalize the process but we\u2019re not there yet. It takes time to work through enough MIP21 deals to see the patterns to iterate on the code, freeze it, secure it, and then reuse until we iterate again. With a MIP21, there are some significant questions and the answers to these questions impact the technical implementation.  How do we legally bind the representation of the collateral to a token? How do we deal with pricing and oracles? How do we deal with liquidations? How do we deal with Emergency Shutdown? Based upon code changes in the implementation, is an audit required?  In our experience, to do a proper technical implementation, we rely on the domain expertise of business, legal, and risk people and teams to help us answer our questions and provide clarity. In this case, I would need to access or hire third parties to represent the interests of MakerDAO. Part of our mandate is the stability and security of the protocol so CES would need to publish a variety of assessments based upon third party analysis and the actual implementation. In addition, operationalizing includes managing our collateral. I am in the process of setting up Collateral Operations where my Core Unit will be facilitating the process of maintaining the health of our collateral. In order for this to be effective, there has to be clear onboarding metrics, before onboarding, so we can manage to them. We are making progress toward publishing those metrics in the April governance cycle with our proposed MIP, MIP6c-3SP2: Modify the collateral application form. The metrics will follow in the next several weeks for review and feedback. Last, the other real practicality has to do with relative prioritization when it comes to getting work completed. When it comes to collateral onboarding, I have to ask, what is the most important work for my team to be doing this sprint? The answer to the question is dependent upon a lot of very competent people understanding the pros/cons of each collateral in the queue. I\u2019m not sure who understands this better than the current CUs. My mandate and job is to onboard and manage collateral. I want to figure out how to do this as best as possible. I hope this response is helpful for the community to understand some of the realities behind the scenes and considerations when onboarding collateral. ",

                    "content": "The incubating Legal and Transactional Services core unit (LTS) requests consideration of the following questions/observations on MIP68: Monetalis Vault v2. It is likely that many of these questions/observations will be ultimately addressed in the transaction documentation process. We are providing them now in the interest of furthering the discussion at the appropriate time. LTS notes that there may be further comments based on the actual transaction documentation. LTS has not reviewed any of the actual transaction documents other than early drafts of the BVI trust (based on the greenlit MIP6 application). The initial review of the BVI trust and our joint discussion with external counsel on Monetalis V1 did not raise any \u201cred flag\u201d concerns. However, that review was not completed at the time - as aligned with @Allan_Pedersen - in order to manage legal expenditure. MIP68c1: Specification of the proposed structure and contemplated collateral asset Structure Monetalis is kindly requested to pay for Maker\u2019s external legal fees. I would be pleased to further develop a budget with Monetalis that reflects reasonable assumptions. Arranging Alpha Structure It may be prudent to clone (not re-use) the TradFi/Maker integration point in respect of other collateral. This can be discussed on a case-by-case basis. LTS supports the concept of moving components and processes on-chain. Monetalis to please consider how the collateral valuation process, including anonymized loan performance may be digitized on-chain. Collateral Assets UK Bond Structure How has Monetalis modeled calculation of the \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d? Please confirm whether or not the \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d will be hedged? Please confirm that Monetalis will bear the cost of any FX conversion in respect of the \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d. The \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d calculation should be spelled-out to ensure consistency in application. Also, Monetalis should pay for any FX conversion in respect of the \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d. Also, the definitive documents should provide the date by which Monetalis pays the \u201cAnnual Profit-share\u201d. Monetalis to please confirm that interest payments will not be made after the listing. The bracketed text \u201cretained until listing\u201d is unclear. A 50 year duration is exceptionally long. What is the rationale for such a long-term facility? What is Monetalis\u2019 proposed management transition plan on the assumption that current management will have retired? Maker token holders owning an interest in Monetalis should recuse themselves from a liquidation and/or termination decision. How does management \u201creinvest\u201d 90% of management\u2019s profit share? Will these funds be in a secured reserve account as a first-loss buffer? From a modeling perspective, when does Monetalis anticipate that it will satisfy the 1% target? The collateral valuation metric is very simple and simply aggregates the outstanding principal, interest and fees in respect of each receivable. The collateral valuation metric does not appear to incorporate yield curves, prepayment rates, expected default rates, and other generally accepted parameters. There may be generally accepted accounting standards that provide guidance/criteria on loan portfolio valuation. It may be appropriate to include other reasonable covenants, including general financial covenants, ensuring the separation of the UK SPV from Monetalis, etc. It may be appropriate for the compliance audit to be completed on a more regular basis (e.g. quarterly) to ensure more regular transparency on the underlying collateral. Monetalis ought to better define its proposed hedging program. For instance, what is the anticipated cost for hedging and are these hedging expenses paid in priority to interest and principal? What hedging tools will Monetalis use to manage the currency risk? How will the currency hedges be structured to address a demand for liquidation (what is the anticipated term)? Who does Monetalis anticipate using as the currency hedge counterparty and what is the credit profile of this counterparty? Presumably any payments made under the hedging arrangements will be paid to a secured account to support the repayment of amounts due. Is there intended to be any additional collateral security - security interest over accounts, profit share, hedge agreements, other? Key Design Choices in Bond The on-demand nature of the bond allows Maker to request repayment of the bond at any time and for whatever reason. However, an on demand bond may actually shift power to Monetalis on the basis that Monetalis calculates that the Maker community is less likely to demand repayment for no reason. While the bond may not require the \u201cusual complex covenant rules, allowing the buyer of the bond to redeem the Bond for certain breaches\u201d, it may be appropriate for there to be certain basic covenants and related events of default. The breach of any one of these covenants (and Monetalis\u2019 failure to cure) should trigger a potential event of default. The remedies could include, in addition to on demand liquidation, more oversight of Monetalis\u2019 operations and the underlying portfolio. Unlike purely digital assets, real world assets tend to require more nuance upon the occurrence of an event of default and discretion in the exercise of rights and remedies. Is there any risk that the bond will not be listed and thus not benefit from zero withholding tax? The Credit Committee requires unanimous consent for all credit approvals. Is the same decision-making threshold applied for non-credit approval decisions (actions taken in respect of the underlying loans management (for example, triggering an event of default, consenting to a waiver, etc.))? MIP68c4: Debt Ceiling gradual increase mechanism It may be more appropriate for the debt ceiling increase to be based on the performance of the underlying loan portfolio and not simply Monetalis\u2019 ability to make loans.

                    "content": "The RWF Core Unit offers the following updated observations on the MIP68: Monetalis Vault v2. RWF has already provided a Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation for the prior version of Monetalis MIP6 which is linked below. Monetalis MIP6 - Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation RWF believes that the Monetalis proposal presents significant risk to Maker in terms of both Facility Risk and DAI Stability Risk.  Facility Risk: Monetalis underperforms and Maker incurs a significant loss on its loan DAI Stability Risk: the market views the collateral backing the DAI as risky due to significant weaknesses in its asset managers, assets and/or investment structures  RWF utilizes two key standards that are noted below.  Investment Grade risk is defined as being highly likely to repay the loan with timely interest and principal. Historically Investment Grade debt has averaged less than 1% default annually. Arm\u2019s Length Transaction is where parties agree to do business, acting independently and in their own interests. When reviewing whether a given proposal would be an Arm\u2019s Length Transaction, RWF asks, would this be funded in the real world? And if it would not be funded at the current terms, what terms could the Proposal be funded at?  Facility Risk Assessment As noted above, RWF assessed Facility Risk in the Proposal, covering Manager Risk, Asset Risk and Structural Risk. Significant deficiencies in any of these three areas would cause a senior loan in the structure to be non-Investment Grade.  Facility Risk Assessment: Manager    Monetalis\u2019 principals lack experience as credit fund managers as compared to their competitors. Neither one appears to have experience as a private credit investor in asset finance nor a track record in the field. Table One shows that the senior investment managers at Monetalis\u2019 competitors average over fifteen years in private credit investing. RWF research has also indicated that first time credit fund managers usually cannot raise investment capital without significant experience in the field with a credible track record.   Monetalis is a startup asset manager that has not originated any loans to date and has an unproven business model. As such they will need to build out and scale their platform quickly and hire personnel across all key functions, including sourcing, underwriting, portfolio management, compliance, reporting, audit and finance/accounting. This creates significant scaling risk for a Facility.   Monetalis is not profitable yet and is thinly capitalized, likely requiring additional equity funding before reaching profitability. Funding uncertainty could impact Monetalis\u2019 ability to underwrite or manage its investments.   Maker can liquidate the Facility at will (based on a MKR vote), reducing Monetalis\u2019 incentive to invest significant equity in their business.   Monetalis is equity funded by investors who own significant MKR positions which Monetalis has disclosed. If these MKR holders vote on the Monetalis funding decision, it would create a conflict of interest/financial entanglement, as Monetalis equity would rise in value once funded by Maker. One typical way to mitigate this key risk would be having any MKR holders (and their delegates) who are financially backing Monetalis, recuse themselves from all Maker-Monetalis governance actions.   Table One  Table Description automatically generated with medium confidence975\u00d7240 37.7 KB   Facility Risk Assessment: Asset   Monetalis is a new entrant in a competitive, relationship-based UK, SME lending market with larger, better established players, including banks. RWF discussions with active UK SME lenders has also indicated Green financing is particularly competitive, relationship driven and accessible primarily to lenders who have consistently originated vanilla non-green deals. Given that Monetalis is an unproven, new entrant, it may have to overpay and/or risk up to win green financing volume in line with its growth targets. Monetalis is also focused on financing relatively small lending platforms (\u00a315MM-30MM deals). These deals can generally not be structured to investment grade standards due to deficiencies in key areas such as management, underwriting, servicing, sourcing, technology, compliance, and liquidity. Thus, Monetalis would likely need to add significant credit enhancement under the Maker Facility to make it an investment grade.   Facility Risk Assessment: Structure   Monetalis is not providing a facility-wide credit enhancement for the Facility, creating the risk that a loss in any investment would cause a loss in the Facility. Given that Monetalis does not have an existing portfolio, the Facility would face higher credit risk during the ramp-up due to large concentrations in a few investments, even if there were facility-wide credit enhancement. It appears that Monetalis would not pay current interest on a Facility. If true, this decreases cashflow certainty to Maker. Monetalis has proposed no asset performance or corporate performance covenants. This significantly increases risk to Maker as Monetalis would not be required to have its assets perform within specific expectations or its corporate entity to maintain certain performance standards, both financial and operational. The Proposal has not included a hedging strategy yet, which is essential given that Monetalis plans to borrow DAI but invest in pounds (\u00a3). It is likely that hedging will require additional capital and lower the yield on the Monetalis investment portfolio. The Proposal has loose credit guidelines, allowing up to 60% real estate concentration and no limits on non-amortizing loans. Note that most commercial real estate loans do not amortize a significant portion of their principal over Monetalis\u2019 investment horizon. As such the Facility can be significantly exposed to refinancing risk in its real estate investments. As already noted in the Asset Manager section, Maker can liquidate the Facility at will (based on a MKR vote).  Summary  Given the above analysis, Monetalis would not be Investment Grade Given the above analysis, Monetalis would not be viewed as an Arm\u2019s Length Transaction Other Arrangers would almost surely expect the same standard for their transactions  The key items in the Summary above create significant risk to Maker including.  Facility Risk DAI Stability Risk  UPDATE: CONCLUSION: The RWF core unit recommends that the Monetalis proposal be restructured to address the significant risks to Maker discussed above and detailed below.  Add significant credit enhancement to absorb any 1st losses in the 15-20% range. Maintain significant liquidity (12 months operating expenses) on the Monetalis balance sheet so Monetalis can focus on originating and managing its investments as opposed to raising equity Add reasonable asset performance covenants Base upsizing trigger not only on volume lent, but also credit performance and suitably building out the asset manager platform Develop a reasonable foreign exchange hedging program with performance covenants so that Maker\u2019s principle is solidly protected Pay current interest consistently from start of the transaction  Once these issues are adequately addressed, RWF core unit would recommend the Monetalis updated proposal.

Or just for this proposal because RWF has taken a clear position that it opposes Monetalis\u2019s MIP passing (which is a whole other issue regarding the scope of RWF\u2019s mandate - facilitation and assessment vs. approvals)? The general suggestion seems to be directly in conflict with how democratic voting systems work. Conflict of interest concerns and policies generally have to do with those primarily in centralized executive or legislative (and even then it\u2019s usually assumed - see the US debate on Congressional equity investing) positions of power, not the overall voting populace. Ultimately, \u201cdemocracies\u201d are made up of a number of individuals and groups with their own, varied conflicts of interest - that\u2019s why they all get to vote. Forcing or expecting recusals due to conflicts of interest is basically anathema to decentralized/democratic governance. Following a slide down the entire slippery scope to the most basic level, that would permit no one to vote. Even if democratic systems did not generally accept that a general voting body is full of voters with diverse conflicts of interest, the way to cure it is typically through disclosure not voluntary recusal or a forced revocation of someone\u2019s vote. FULL DISCLOSURE - I personally own MKR and have an indirect pecuniary interest in Monetalis. That said, I am much more concerned about this particular voting-related suggestion, its implications for the future of MakerDAO governance, and the precedent it sets if it gains any traction. ",

Persons may engage in a reasonable discussion regarding the existence of potential conflicts of interest, the consequences of such potential conflicts, and mitigations. We would be remiss in our role as assessors from a Risk or Legal perspective not to identify the potential conflict of interest and recommend a mitigation. As you will undoubtedly appreciate, we have to look at potential conflicts from two perspectives - up-front approval (this MIP68) and decision-making in circumstances when things go bad. Equity holders in Monetalis will most likely have a different perspective to MKR token holders - especially when things go bad. This is undeniable. Further, to ensure a comprehensive analysis, there is merit for Legal and Risk to identify a potential divergence in views between MKR token holders that have equity in Monetalis and those MKR token holders that do not. Also, as the Monetalis-sourced collateral supports DAI and the beneficiaries of the proposed BVI trust include holders of DAI, there is a similar potential for divergence in views between holders of Monetalis equity and holders of DAI. We have proposed an unambiguous and blunt solution. If there is a more nuanced and acceptable solution, we kindly encourage that Monetalis or yourself propose it below for consideration. RWF has not taken a clear position that it \u201copposes Monetalis\u2019 MIP passing\u201d. To the contrary, @eumenes clearly states that \u201cThe RWF core unit recommends that the Monetalis proposal be restructured to address the significant risks to Maker discussed above.\u201d Monetalis should explain why the perceived risks are not risks or how the risks have been (or will be) mitigated. This seems a reasonable request to be made by the Risk assessors. Again, it is clear from the communication that RWF is providing its professional assessment. This is entirely consistent with the 2nd and 3rd bullet points under \u201cCore Unit Mandate\u201d in MIP39c2-SP1: Adding Core Unit (Real-World Finance). Your viewpoint cannot be that RWF is a rubber stamp for any and all submitted applications without consideration of risk or legal issues. We would be pleased to engage with Monetalis on these risks or Monetalis may ask the Maker community to opine. Either is fine. Finally, and with due respect, your analogy to a democracy is misplaced. A democracy typically assumes one person = one vote. Of course, if a person or interested persons hold more than one MKR token (i.e., more than one vote), the analogy breaks down. A better analogy may be found in controlling/minority shareholder governance and disputes - where conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders are litigated. The simple recusal approach mitigated going down this area of the law for applicability to a DAO, etc. ",

I also think it continues to undermine the concepts of decentralized governance, generally, and specifically those coded into MakerDAO. The precedent set by requiring such a restriction starts us down a very slippery slope. Again, is this only proposed with regards to this specific proposal? If RWF and you did not assume that large MKR token holders, who generally vote (the former is pretty clear, the latter not so much), would you be making the same proposal? If so, does that mean RWF\u2019s and your opinion is that any MKR holder with any additional self-interest in any proposal cannot vote on any such proposal ever? If not, what level or MKR ownership is the cutoff? And if not, that seems to make this proposal a mechanism suggested to ensure or prevent an assumed, forecasted outcome of a specific vote. As I mentioned, I\u2019m not here to debate the Monetalis proposal\u2019s merits - which they, RWF and @luca_pro have addressed in multiple ways, publicly and privately. So I think, contrary to your statement, everyone has addressed each party\u2019s concerns and they\u2019re now at a place where neither will be satisfied and the vote should happen. Thus, I\u2019ll leave those substantive debates where they are. My observation regarding RWF\u2019s position on the issue referred to my understanding of its past conduct, specifically related to this proposal, regardless of the language used above. There\u2019s no need to perform an inquisition, but it is my perception based on Discord, the Forums and discussions with relevant parties, as well as others. And taking such a position seems to be outside the CU\u2019s ambit of facilitating and assessing the onboarding of real-world asset-related MIPs - not taking positions and attempting to further or hinder them and certainly not negotiating deals (if that were happening, which I am not suggesting). I can\u2019t speak for RWF, but in this regulatory environment, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be seen exercising material, executive discretion. I\u2019d leave that to token holders. So no, RWF should not be a rubber stamp - it shouldn\u2019t be any stamp. It should present its assessment, positive and/or negative, and then let MKR holders vote. As to your points about discussing conflicts, sure, they can be and should be discussed. But, from a token holder perspective, CUs and other DAO contributors are beholden to and empowered by MKR holders after all, my concerns regarding conflicts of interest rest almost solely with those CUs and contributors - not other MKR holders. I already understand that all MKR holders will be voting in their self-interest at all times - that self-interest may be financial, philosophical, political, ideological, egotistical, myriad other things, or a combination thereof. So, I don\u2019t care - not when Monetalis-interested MKR token holders vote for Monetalis, not when it\u2019s a similar situation for crypto-native collateral, not when it\u2019s a D3M candidate, not when it\u2019s an ETH maxi voting on wrapped BTC, or what have you. One takes note of the proposal, expecting interested MKR holders to vote in its favor, and acts accordingly. What I don\u2019t expect as a MKR token holder is that the CUs or other contributors will be acting in their self-interest when they perform work for the DAO. This is the crux of agency law. This is where self-interest can become a conflict of interest - everything in the previous paragraph is not a conflict. It becomes a conflict when a person\u2019s self-interest conflicts with an otherwise legally-imposed interest/duty, or DAO-imposed interest/duty in this case. My indirect investment interest in Monetalis does not necessarily conflict with my interest as a MKR holder - nor do I expect they ever will. They influence each other, but they do not necessarily conflict as contemplated by legal and agency conflicts of interest principles. Now, if one were a facilitator with a self-interest in a given MIP\u2019s underlying entity - then there\u2019s a conflict. That self-interest (in the MIP company) would conflict with the interest imposed upon the facilitator (by the DAO), namely to act in the DAO\u2019s best interest. So, to [mis]use a common syllogism - all conflicts of interest involve self-interest, not all self-interest creates a conflict. If self-interest disqualified one from voting, why ever participate in that governance process\u2026ever? So let\u2019s take your corporate governance analogy - I admit maybe my general democracy one was too broad. Though, while this situation may be cursorily akin to traditional corporate governance (which I would argue for a number of reasons is inapt and an unwise analog), even there shareholders get to vote, self-interest notwithstanding. If I once owned Coca-Cola shares (minority stake) and Minute Maid shares (minority stake), for instance, and have no other legal duties to the companies, I don\u2019t have to \u201crecuse\u201d myself or otherwise abstain from voting on either side of that merger. If I held a majority stake in either, I might have to disclose that stake depending on relevant rules, regulations and law. But, I still get to vote. Conflicts of interest controls and independence protections primarily apply to and concern those with legal duties to a company, i.e. the directors, managers and employees (to a lesser extent) of Coca-Cola and Minute Maid. And again, the solution to any potential conflicts of interest in the corporate realm is typically disclosure of those conflicts prior to any relevant actions and not i) recusal, which is a voluntary concept, or ii) quasi-coerced revocation of votes, which seems to be the suggestion here. As for litigation between shareholders - I don\u2019t really see a rash of holder v. holder litigation related to conflicts of interest. There are proxy fights and fights for control all the time, sure. That said, generally speaking, the valid grounds for any lawsuit can\u2019t be \u201cthe other shareholders\u2019 voted in their self-interest\u201d - at least not in any I\u2019ve worked on, been exposed to or am aware of. Grounds for a suit would require conduct, motivated by that self-interest, that violates the law, corporate charter or corporate by-laws. Nothing of the sort is suggested here. Another point here is that there seems to be an assumption - explicitly stated in Discord - that MKR holders who have financial interests in MIP candidates are somehow incentivized to enrich that MIP candidate at the expense of MakerDAO. I personally think that assumption is unfounded and unlikely to be true. First, the assumption rests on any such person placing primacy on the MIP candidate over MKR. Economically and financially, that entirely depends on the size of someone\u2019s comparative and relative interests in both. Ideologically and emotionally, one can\u2019t possibly know unless the person states it, but then it\u2019s known. It also assumes bad faith on the part of any such person, and that the person does not see and believe in a mutual benefit to MakerDAO and the MIP candidate. But on the same token, if the assumption is accepted generally, then we should operate the DAO as if all CUs, facilitators and delegates are out to strip the DAO of its assets in order to enrich themselves and thus shouldn\u2019t be permitted to participate in the DAO outside their very limited mandates. It doesn\u2019t work there either - we couldn\u2019t function and nothing would get done. It\u2019s just a quizzical and seemingly confrontational assumption to make in this ecosystem, where the vast majority of people seem very dedicated to growing DeFi, generally, and MakerDAO, specifically, and have put a lot of time, money and effort into doing so. TLDR - The Monetalis debate and vote, my indirect interest notwithstanding, can and will go how it goes - and I will stand by the result regardless. RWF should remain neutral in its facilitation and analysis of MIPs within its purview - and maybe they completely are and I\u2019ve misread the situation. But, the point remains that continued gatekeeping-like behavior by CUs - and inserting an MKR voting restriction into a live, non-procedural  MIP discussion is gatekeeping at best, and at worst is an attempt at managerial capture (which I\u2019m sure is not the case - puts them square in the regulatory bullseye with regard to issues of control, regardless of concerns regarding mandate scope creep. Lastly, Proposing or even suggesting that MKR holders should recuse themselves or have that forced upon them due to their self-interests, real or perceived, fundamentally misunderstands \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d concepts and, if adopted, would upend the foundations of decentralized governance.

                    "content": " Independent Risk Assessment (from @luca_pro as Facilitator of LOVE-001, SES Incubated Core Unit) This independent risk assessment has been completed in accordance to LOVE\u2019s prospective mandate - you can find more colour on the current incubation of the CU here. The risk assessment needs to be considered in addition to the original assessment published here, and referring to Monetalis\u2019 v1 application. Unless stated differently, all points of such assessment have to be considered valid.  Risk Overview of Monetalis Vault v2 Proposal The original risk assessment published in relation to Monetalis\u2019 v1 proposal outlined a series of risks that were not allowing LOVE-001 to publicly endorse the application. The assessment indicated as well a set of risk mitigating factors that might have made the application palatable for an independent recommendation. Namely:  Wait for Monetalis to reach a more advanced stage of development and some track record in the market - through the advertised vehicle Raise significant junior capital at the facility level from either the company or specialised mezz credit investors, to cover 30-50% of the facility-level capital stack Raise senior capital from established entities in the market (i.e. banks, credit funds, special sits funds) to be pari passu with MakerDAO Significantly reduce debt quantum by a factor of 80-90%  Debt quantum \u2192  LOVE-001 acknowledges that the application addresses some of the concerns stated above, and in particular reduces significantly the debt ask. A revised Debt Ceiling of EUR 40m has been indicated. LOVE-001 believes that a debt ceiling of EUR 40m is an appropriate risk sizing when it comes to unproven managers such as Monetalis and does not constitute existential risk for the protocol. At the same time, LOVE-001 considers inadequate the automatic debt ceiling increase to EUR 100m - such an increase should not be subject to negative covenants (i.e. stopped only if a negative vote passes) but should rather be addressed through a new MIP and refreshed assessment. Investors\u2019 participation \u2192  The Monetalis team has provided a series of references on the team\u2019s experience and on the validity of the strategy. Given the extremely positive feedback and the high quality of the institutions involved, it appears it will not be difficult for Monetalis to achieve junior financing and/ or pari passu co-financing of the facility. LOVE-001 reiterates that a certain amount junior financing sitting below Maker\u2019s, representing 5-10% of the total financing stack, should be a prerequisite for an approval of the facility. A pari passu (at similar terms) co-investment from a prominent financial partner, retaining between 30-50% of the total risk, could be considered as an alternative way forward. Liquidation \u2192  The underlying bond\u2019s duration has been indicated in 50 years, although subject to an on-demand liquidation. It is LOVE\u2019s experience that on-demand liquidations might prove impractical or extremely detrimental for borrower\u2019s interests, and de facto impossible to exercise. For this reason, it is advisable to reduce the bond\u2019s duration to 8-12 years, in line with the useful life of most investment fund structures. In addition, the liquidation strategy should be further described during possible future negotiations - in case the vote outcome will be positive. Namely, the lender would expect a detailed strategy to be contractually decided together with the borrower, including among other things i) buy-back guarantees at pre-declared levels, ii) existing agreements with performing and non-performing purchasers, iii) detailed run-off mechanisms. It is noted that the asset duration profile outlined seems consistent with a shorter duration of the bond wrapper. Sustainable economy \u2192  LOVE-001 endorses the request for a participation to the firm\u2019s Green Economy Program as pre-requisite for financing. However, given the captive nature of such program, where the same institution is stating the pillars of the program and is validating the compliance to such program, such declaration of intent has limited validity. Related interests \u2192  The question of related party interest has been highlighted by @Eumenes in his risk assessment.     Eumenes:  Monetalis is equity funded by investors who own significant MKR positions which Monetalis has disclosed. If these MKR holders vote on the Monetalis funding decision, it would create a conflict of interest/financial entanglement, as Monetalis equity would rise in value once funded by Maker. One typical way to mitigate this key risk would be having any MKR holders (and their delegates) who are financially backing Monetalis, recuse themselves from all Maker-Monetalis governance actions.   The existence of related party interests is not new in finance, and has been extensively researched. Although it is clear that the existence of such contrasting interests shouldn\u2019t represent an a priori deal blocker, it does indeed require more extensive diligence and enhanced transparency reporting. It is not the role of LOVE-001 to suggest governance mechanisms to mitigate the risks arising from related parties transaction. At the same time LOVE-001 expects @GovAlpha-Core-Unit to address the point publicly by suggesting the most appropriate way forward in the interest of transparency and decentralisation. Process \u2192  By providing an update to the risk assessment published for Monetalis v1 application, the RWF-001 CU has acted in accordance to good risk assessment principles. The two risk assessments need to be considered independent. As a reminder, @williamr, current Facilitator of RWF-001 CU, has published a draft proposal that describes both Process and Methodology. We expect such proposal to be brought forward to voting as part of the next cycle. Conclusions-> The updated risk assessment has highlighted a set of issues that should be addressed by the Monetalis team ahead of voting: namely, (a) scrapping automatic upsizing, (b) reducing the duration of the bond wrapper, (c) including junior or pari passu co-investment capital, (d) introducing appropriate governance mechanisms to deal with transactions among related parties. In addition, in case the proposal will be voted favourably by MKR token holders, the onboarding of the collateral will remain subject to effective legal and technical implementation as highlighted by @christiancdpetersen and @monkey.irish. As it is customary, LOVE-001 does not intend to engage on forum on point-to-point arguments regarding the content of this risk assessment. However, @luca_pro remains available for a conference call with members of the community to discuss the content if needed. ",

Hello from GovAlpha  So this is a bit of a tricky subject and I don\u2019t think Luca and RWF are going to love the answer. The good news is (even though you state it is not your job to propose governance mechanisms) if you\u2019d like to see something changed from the status quo you can propose doing so. The fundamental set up of the Maker Protocol is that MKR holders are in charge of its future. Nothing can change in the system without their approval. Because of the nature of crypto, we have to accept that a large portion of token holders can have their identities obscured if they choose to do so. Thus, seeking to ban certain MKR from voting is a non-starter, it would only prevent people following the rules from doing so, while those who wish to skirt the regulation simply mix their funds and vote from a new address. So instead of relying on this traditional system of forced recusal, we lean on the full transparency of the DAO. We debate proposals and highlight risks before they go to vote so that MKR holders can be aware of the implications of their vote. Strictly speaking, the identity of the proposal author shouldn\u2019t matter, as it is just as easy to obscure as crypto holdings. Instead, we should design structures that allow us to debate the merits of proposals rather than the identity of the people proposing them. ",

                    "content": "So to hopefully respond to @Eumenes 's concerns a little more directly: These vulnerabilities are inherent in a DAO structure where anyone (including anonymous actors) may propose changes to the protocol. After watching your presentation on \ud83d\udd0e Focus On #7: RWA Lending Principles, I can say that the good news is the only analysis method that will be hindered is the \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d principle. It is GovAlpha\u2019s steadfast belief that transparency is the best way to combat these (real or perceived) conflicts of interest. Fundamentally, we should assume that all proposals are made in self-interest. So the qualifying factors should be the merit of the proposals, not the identities of those proposing them. While appearing to \u201cself-deal\u201d is certainly a public relations concern, it is a decision that MKR holders have the right to make. We recommend focusing on making the quantitative aspects of evaluation as transparent as possible so all MKR voters may consider the benefits and drawbacks of each deal. If MKR holders wish to push a change against the recommendations of Core Units they have the power to do so (even if a proposal doesn\u2019t go through Governance, it can always be proposed maliciously with enough MKR backing).  With that said, if there are different ways you believe Governance should process RWA applications, GovAlpha will gladly follow any proposed method approved by voters. ",

Because of the nature of crypto, we have to accept that a large portion of token holders can have their identities obscured if they choose to do so. Thus, seeking to ban certain MKR from voting is a non-starter, it would only prevent people following the rules from doing so, while those who wish to skirt the regulation simply mix their funds and vote from a new address.   Great to see this expressly endorsed by you, Prose, and I am looking forward to a vote on this proposal (among other RWA projects, one hopes) in the relatively near future. ",

                    "content": "Dear @luca_pro , Thank you for your updated Independent Risk Assessment. We are very pleased to see your comfort with our proposal is increasing. Our initial debt ceiling proposed is DAI 50M and we will assume that is close enough to your EUR 40M recommended. Let us address your concluding points:     luca_pro:  Conclusions-> The updated risk assessment has highlighted a set of issues that should be addressed by the Monetalis team ahead of voting: namely, (a) scrapping automatic upsizing, (b) reducing the duration of the bond wrapper, (c) including junior or pari passu co-investment capital, (d) introducing appropriate governance mechanisms to deal with transactions among related parties. In addition, in case the proposal will be voted favourably by MKR token holders, the onboarding of the collateral will remain subject to effective legal and technical implementation as highlighted by @christiancdpetersen and @monkey.irish.   A) Automatic Upsizing of Debt Ceiling: We will keep this automatic upsizing in our proposal. We will ensure performance data is reported to the community whilst we deploy the first 50M over a few months and will, of course,  always be available for any questions. The proposed upsizing process, we think, is an efficient process and allows the community to stay appropriately in control. However, we will, to address your concerns of an assessment in advance of the upsize vote, commission an Independent Credit Audit similar to those we would usually commission quarterly to be undertaken on our non-bank lenders. We will file this Independent Credit Audit on Monetalis with the community in advance of the upsizing executive vote.  EDIT in MIP68c4 : \u201cAt least 2 weeks in advance of the executive vote to increase the debt-ceiling, Monetalis will file on the forum an Independent Credit Audit of the Monetalis business\u201d  B) Duration of Bond: No problem. We will edit it to be 10 years. The 50 years was set to signify that we see this as, hopefully, the start of a very long-term partnership between Maker and Monetalis. In crypto-years, 10 years is already somewhat in the aeons.  EDIT in Bond Duration :  \u201c50 years\u201d \u2192 \u201c10 years\u201d  C) Include Junior/Co-investment in structure: We strongly believe, as highlighted in our Commentary and echoed by the industry reviewers, that the 15%+ junior/equity capital provided by the Non-bank lenders in each portfolio, the strength of the instruments, the covenants and our controls, provides adequate protection. It is the common capital structure model in the market, used by banks and funds alike, and the performance of this type of senior, secured wholesale debt with prime non-bank lenders has consistently been meeting a E(L)<1% requirement across many years and several extreme events (CoVid/Financial Crisis). We therefore will not be changing this dimension of the proposal. However, in the Maker spirit of seeking consensus and compromises, we will make a best reasonable effort to include institutional/professional capital in some of our non-bank lender facilities, and not just originator/non-bank lender capital. It is in fact already in our plans. We will report on this before the upsize executive vote such that this can also be taken appropriately into account.  EDIT in MIP68c4: \u201cAlso, at least 2 weeks in advance of the executive vote to increase the debt-ceiling, Monetalis will file a report on the forum clarifying how professional/institutional capital have been/will be included in Monetalis issued non-bank lender facilities on a retro- and prospective basis\u201d  D)Related Parties: I think this point has been as addressed, as it can be, by the discussions in this thread. We can\u2019t add anything. You will see the promised edits above have now been implemented in the MIP. Pending a positive MKR vote, we look forward to working with @christiancdpetersen and @monkey.irish to implement the solution and quickly get some new high-quality RWA collateral put onto the protocol. We hope these edits are seen as proof of our commitment to, always, trying to find workable, practical, compromise long-term solutions with the Maker Community. Thanks, The Monetalis Team ",

Add significant credit enhancement to absorb any 1st losses in the 15-20% range. Maintain significant liquidity (12 months operating expenses) on the Monetalis balance sheet so Monetalis can focus on originating and managing its investments as opposed to raising equity Add reasonable asset performance covenants Base upsizing trigger not only on volume lent, but also credit performance and suitably building out the asset manager platform Develop a reasonable foreign exchange hedging program with performance covenants so that Maker\u2019s principle is solidly protected Pay current interest consistently from start of the transaction  Once these issues are adequately addressed, RWF core unit would recommend the Monetalis updated proposal.

                    "content": " Monetalis - Lusitano update  A. Capital Partnership The Monetalis team has been working hard on a partnership with a larger, London-based credit fund with GBP ~4B AuM (name confidential for now, but will be disclosed upon closing of negotiations). We are delighted to announce that we have entered the final stages of negotiation to access an initial tranche of \u00a320m of Junior funding. This facility will be used to co-fund the many Forward Flow opportunities we have in the pipeline. After the initial \u00a320M deployment, our plan is to ramp-up this junior facility to \u00a360M, \u00a380M and then \u00a3100M. Our discussions are at an advanced stage, and we are aiming to co-fund some of the Stage 1 refinance opportunities using this partner junior fund arrangement no later than by the end of June 2022.  B. Stage 1 Deployment: Portfolios Refinance Plan Stage 1 of our origination strategy is focused on the deployment of \u00a350M through the acquisition or refinance of existing portfolios.This stage is specifically designed to avoid any portfolio ramp-up risk and provide Monetalis with the right level of diversification from the very beginning. We have identified a number of portfolios from high quality lenders as our initial targets for refinance. We will present metrics associated with each portfolio before illustrating the overall position for Monetalis. It is important to note that these refinancings are made between the lender and Monetalis for the purpose of starting a long-term relationship - i.e allow Monetalis to be part of the diversified funder panel that all lenders prefer. This pattern for starting a long-term engagement with a refinancing deal is common in the market. We highlight that the refinancing is NOT happening because the current funders are looking to exit the arrangements. We do, however, allow for a slightly lower interest rate than the current arrangement - this is a fair reduction based upon the fact that the risk of a portfolio decreases as it matures (if you have paid 60% of your loan, odds are good you will pay the remaining 40% rather than lose your security. In the below specific refinancing situations we expect final interest rate reduction to be between 0.5% and 1%0.5% and 1% - but still within our strategic credit guideline targets.  B1 Portfolio 1 - Professional lending The lender provides loans to professional businesses (Opticians, Dentists, Doctors and so on) for the purchase of equipment or for cash flow purposes. This lender has been operating since 2018 and has an impeccable track record when it comes to portfolio performance and bank funding relationships.  Lender\u2019s current overall portfolio engagements  Lending operation start: 2018 Current Senior funders: Shawbrook bank and Aldermore Bank Current outstanding total portfolios: circa \u00a360M Typical LTV: 80% Average default level: less than 0.5% Capital losses: less than 0.1%   Refinance opportunity Below we present the make-up of the proposed set of loans for refinance:  Funder refinanced: Shawbrook bank Asset type: White asset Finance type: Senior funding at 85% advance rate (lender finance 15%) Facility type: RCF. This type of facility is better suited for the type of products sold by these lenders. An RCF has a term of 3 years revolving + 18 months run off. However, a facility can be put into run-off at Monetalis discretion at any time. Number of loans: 918 Av loan term: 46 months Av outstanding loan term: 30 months Monetalis interest charge: 4% to 5.5% Av Loan size: \u00a343,456 Total proposed refinance: \u00a323,487,009 Total security: \u00a333,724,859 Security coverage: 1.44  Once the initial finance has taken place, we expect new originations of circa GBP2M to GBP3M per month. Whilst these loans are classified as white assets as defined in the Monetalis Strategic Credit guidelines, all underlying borrowers will need to subscribe to their respective professional bodies\u2019 Net Zero and Sustainability strategy. This condition will be contained in each loan contract. This is in line with our Green Economy Program.   Portfolio 2 - Property lending Founded by a very experienced banker, this lender has been operating in the property lending market for over 9 years. The lender specialises in property refurbishment and property development loans in the South West of England and it is today well-funded by two banks.  Lender\u2019s current overall portfolio engagements  Lending operation start: 2018 Current senior funders: Shawbrook bank and Aldermore Bank Current outstanding total portfolios: circa \u00a380M Typical LTV: 50% Average default level: less than 0.2% Capital losses: less than 0.1%   Refinance opportunity Below we present the make-up of the proposed set of loans for refinance:  Funder refinanced: Shawbrook bank Asset type: Green asset Finance type: Senior funding at 85% advance rate Facility type: Block Discount. Block discount facilities are more suited to this type of loans. The facility will typically have a term of 12 to 36 months. Number of loans: 53 Av loan term: 24 months Av outstanding loan term: 18 months Monetalis interest charge: 4% to 5.5% Av Loan size: \u00a3368,000 Total proposed refinance: \u00a319,536,000 Total security: \u00a332,819,500 Security coverage: 1.68  After this initial refinance, we expect to substantially grow this partnership by supporting new originations. We expect new monthly originations to be around GBP3M to GBP5M per month. These loans are classified as Green Assets because they are used to refurbish existing buildings, drastically enhancing their environmental standards or to develop new homes according to very stringent environmental standards.   Portfolio 3 - Green vehicles The lender is one of the UK\u2019s leading transport and commercial vehicle finance service providers. With over \u00a3500m of asset based lending facilities and over 4,000 vehicles on the road, this lender represents an important origination partner for Monetalis. Part of this lender\u2019s portfolio is made up of electric vehicles that are purchased and leased out to taxi drivers and car clubs. The vehicles are then sold on the second hand market.  Refinance opportunity Monetalis has the opportunity to refinance approximately \u00a35m of the current financing of the EV portfolio. We expect that this deal will be the first that is co-funded with our Capital Partner, who will provide junior funding  Funder refinanced: Shawbrook bank, Lombard Asset type: Green asset Finance type: Senior funding at 85% advance rate (Monetalis) + 15% Junior from Capital Partner Facility type: Block Discount Number of loans: 127 Av loan term: 36 months Av outstanding loan term: 24 months Monetalis interest charge: 4% to 5.5% Av Loan size: \u00a341,410 Total proposed refinance: \u00a34,470,000 Total security: \u00a35,859,180 Security coverage: 1.33  The scale and potential of this partnership presents a unique opportunity for Monetalis. The lender has in the past financed combustion-engine and electric vehicles. With Monetalis\u2019 help, they are planning to turn their entire fleet to green vehicles (Monetalis will only refinance loans for EVs). The ambition for this lender is to grow to 10,000 EVs per annum. Their growth, and their ability to purchase new EVs, has recently been disrupted by supply chain issued caused by the COVID pandemic, However, their activity is already started to ramp-up and Monetalis wants to be very much part of this growth plan.  Portfolio 4 - Property development Monetalis has the opportunity to refinance a Property development portfolio specialising in green residential and social housing. This will also be funded together with our Capital Partner through a Forward Flow arrangement. The projects are all based in very desirable areas of the South West of England and have been independently valued by professional surveyors hired by the existing funders.  Funder refinanced: HSBC and other High street banks Asset type: Green asset Finance type: Senior funding at 85% advance rate (Monetalis) + 15% Junior from Capital Partner Facility type: Forward flow. This facility is similar to a block discount and it is better suited for this type of loan. Each agreement will have term of 12 months to 3 years. Av. Loan to value: 50% Number of loans: 8 Av loan term: 36 months Av outstanding loan term: 24 months Overall interest charge: 4.5% to 5.5% Av Loan size: \u00a3366,760 Total proposed refinance: \u00a36,187,266 Total security: \u00a315,468,180 Security coverage: 2.5  The company responsible for these projects prides itself on its operational and building environmental standards. Everything is designed to promote reduction of carbon emissions, even down the type of shower heads installed in their bathrooms. This company has the opportunity to apply its business model to much larger projects which align not only Monetalis ambitions, but also with the ambition and experience of our new Capital Partner. We expect this partnership to generate over GBP30M of new originations in the first 12 to 18 months.  Monetalis starting portfolios The refinance opportunities illustrated in the previous section are only some of the ones immediately available in our pipeline, which are currently undergoing commercial and legal due diligence. We are planning to close these refinance opportunities in the first 45 to 60 days from the executive vote. Once our refinances are complemented, our portfolio will have the following characteristics:  Total refinanced: \u00a353,680,276 Total security: \u00a391,131,392 Overall security coverage: 1.7 Total Num of loans: 1,106 Total Concentration by loan: 0.1%   753\u00d7448 15.1 KB   752\u00d7449 8.77 KB  We note, for completeness, that at the point of refinance, the ownership of all the underlying loan contracts and associated receivables will be transferred to Monetalis SPV structure.

                    "content": "Dear all, As a potential facilitator of a Lending Oversight Core Unit I have discussed extensively Monetalis\u2019 proposal in the past - here. The existence of a capital partnership with a co-investor is a dramatic improvement for the proposal.     Wrongcomma:  The Monetalis team has been working hard on a partnership with a larger, London-based credit fund with GBP ~4B AuM (name confidential for now, but will be disclosed upon closing of negotiations). We are delighted to announce that we have entered the final stages of negotiation to access an initial tranche of \u00a320m of Junior funding. This facility will be used to co-fund the many Forward Flow opportunities we have in the pipeline.   This relationship will have to investigated regarding size, co-investment rights, loss absorption capability, and level of commitment. There is a lot to do but there are the prerequisites to do this. I have, however, a significant concern regarding Monetalis MIP65 and MIP68, and is team bandwidth. I believe both MIPs have significant challenges, and I struggle to see how Monetalis can successfully implement both at the same time for the benefit of the DAO. Conservatism, yet again, might come back in fashion as I hope. Conservatism, however, doesn\u2019t mean stasis, and I believe Monetalis has demonstrated its strong intentions to collaborate with Maker in a synergic way. I would therefore suggest token holders to think deeply whether to prioritise MIP65 or MIP68 in their voting, also considering the strong pressure on RWF-001 with the several proposals that have been approved or greelit. The teams will necessarily need to prioritise one effort over another, and a greenlit proposal might remain waiting for a while before being processed. Personally, I see MIP65 as more immediately applicable, easier to underwrite given the quality of Baillie Gifford as an asset manager, and more urgent for Maker\u2019s needs. MIP68 presents a set of challenges that have been already described and that are only partially mitigated by the most recent developments. I remain available to discuss and want to thank Monetalis for their proposal. ",

On MIP68, I agree with you, but I think also that we should try to prioritise efforts based on likelihood of success (or failure). RWF-001 has very limited resources, and if delegates won\u2019t prioritise MIPs then it will be RWF and other Core Units who will ultimately do it, unless we want to trust blindly counterparties - which we shouldn\u2019t. On Monetalis specifically, I think MIP65 could be a good starting ground to test legal rails, implement a solution, focused, and then move on to something else which is more difficult and where Monetalis (my belief) has a lot to prove still. I am not arguing about merit, but about prioritisation. I wouldn\u2019t want to be Monetalis in a greenlit position (this is the outcome of this on-chain vote based on my discussions with @monkey.irish)  with 10 other opportunities and getting extremely frustrated because the team doesn\u2019t have enough bandwidth. That\u2019s all. I am convinced like you that the RWA initiative still needs to prove itself accretive to the DAO, but until now prudence has paid off. I will leave it to RWF to comment on pipeline and timing and commitments, just providing food for thought on those two specific MIPs following the several conversations we have had in the past.

                    "content": " MIP68/LUSITANO: INFLATION & RECESSION The world is brimming over with uncertainty: We have inflation and central banks are working on pushing it down to its 2% target - flexing both its balance sheet as well as its rate setting muscles. The key questions are how far do the central banks have to go to quell inflation? and will it push the world into a recession in doing so? The central banks instruments are blunt and their transmissions into the financial markets and overall economy hard to predict - we have to remember a big part of the transmission comes indirectly - i.e. central banks action sets provide signals and the markets react with expectations of where the central banks will push the economy and markets. I like the common mental central bank analogy of a person walking a dog using a very long leash (and very long indeed now with the amount of money printed today). We won\u2019t try to predict where the world is going - that would be hubris of the highest order - but we do want to present to the community what would happen to Lusitano business in a state of inflation (a continued increase in product and service prices) and/or recession (a decrease of economic output). This is not the first time the asset class has hit points of crisis and so we know, reasonably well, what levers to pull and how we navigate safely through such periods of turmoil. We will go through this in some detail, but to foreshadow: wholesale funding of non-bank lenders focused on senior, secured lending is, at origin, structurally designed to build \u201cAll-weather\u201d portfolios and franchises with good returns. . We are primarily concerned about two risks:  Credit Risk (\u201cCR\u201d): Catastrophic Principal losses from default Return Risk (\u201cRR\u201d): Extended periods of Poor Returns (compared to risk free rate)  To manage these risks we have a large range of \u201cdefences\u201d in our business model.  Lines of Defence Lusitanos principal line of defences against CR and RR are:  A/ A tall and wide stack of capital, real assets and required financial remedial actions ahead of Lusitano exposures  1600\u00d7967 350 KB    The basic capital stack we have explained several times, but just as a refresher:  100 USD end-borrower Loan Secured on Asset to a maximum of usually 50% to 80% of asset value (downward trending LTV in market now) Monetalis funded USD 80 of the loan and Originator fund USD 20. The Originator funds on a first loss basis So an ultimate asset collateralization ratio - between Asset and Monetalis loan is 100/0.5/80 = 250% to 100/0.8/80 = 160%    Monetalis security is not only restricted to the above capital stack, in particular we note the following controls/rights, capital buffers and remedial actions:   OWNERSHIP OF LOAN: When a loan is funded by a lender, the ownership of that loan (along with its receivables and security over asset) is transferred to Monetalis;   SECURITY: In the unlikely event of Monetalis having to take ownership of a portfolio, Monetalis will have the right to collect against the underlying security for a loan. The typical security for our loans are hard assets;   DEBENTURE ON OVERALL PORTFOLIO: This means that whilst Monetalis owns all loans individually, any individual loan losses can be deducted against the performance of all other loans in the portfolio. As Monetalis will only fund lenders that have historically maintained defaults of less than 1%, and each loan funded by Monetalis will not typically be greater than a few percent of an existing portfolio, this debenture adds a substantive capital buffer to the Monetalis portfolio.   CROSS-GUARANTEES ON LENDER: When a new facility is granted by Monetalis to a lender, the lender will be requested to maintain a minimum reserve of retained profits. Monetalis will have a cross-guarantee on these and could call on this reserve to cover any loss of capital. Again adding another substantive capital buffer to the Monetalis portfolio.   REPLACEMENT PAPER: Monetalis has a right to request any defaulting loans be acquired by the lender at full price and replaced by a performing loan. This requirement generally acts as a nice pruning tool that keeps a portfolio in-line in most circumstances.     This all in all, means a crisis would need to strike very deep to ever touch our positions. It ensures our CR is kept exceptionally low.  B/ The \u201cat-will\u201d funding and acceptance - on portfolio and individual loan basis. We have two key sets of data sources and monitoring processes that reduce CR and RR.   INDIVIDUAL LOAN UNDERWRITING & MONITORING When a new facility is agreed, the lender, its products and all the covenants associated with the facility are set up on our IT platform. When a lender requires funding for a loan, they will submit all the relevant details and upload the associated documentation onto the platform. The details for each individual loan that is proposed for underwriting by a lender under a facility agreement are reviewed to ensure it meets our credit guidelines (otherwise it is rejected). This data is reviewed weekly by portfolio manager and monthly by credit committee for trends and concerns. Increase in volumes or more \u201cclose to limits\u201d cases or higher rejection rates would be concerning and require investigation. Such investigation would lead to potential immediate changes in the credit facility - increase of interest rate if market is going that direction and/or sharpening of underwriting criteria if warranted.   MONTHLY COLLECTION, DEFAULT AND PORTFOLIO MONITORING Our platform has an Open Banking API with the collection accounts, enabling our system and our team to have direct line of sight of all collections and disbursals.  From all portfolios we get monthly performance data. This is reconciled by our system against the expected collections and the bank account data, It is then reviewed by the credit committee to recommend changes in the facilities. These may be to constrain or even entirely cancel facilities. Any breaches of facility covenants, any semi or non-performing loan are flagged in our system. Providing our team with the relevant breaches, the latest borrowing basis figures and a list of demands for the lender required to cure any of the breaches (including using the \u201creplacement paper\u201d remedy).   Overall, the fact that we have all data at our fingertips and necessary monitoring capability - and the legal ability to make changes as we see fit in the credit facility - are major reasons for why we can reduce CR and RR in dynamically changing environments as inflation and/or recession would constitute. We can follow interest rates as they go up or down (beyond the variable rate mentioned in D/) - and we can contract and expand portfolio acquisitions as we find prudent.  C/ On-site, Lender Audit - at least quarterly - and ad=hoc From experience we know that when markets get challenging to operate in, this is the time where lenders/originators have the hardest time in terms of changing to new realities and ensuring their operations - in particular underwriting and collections - stay within their guidelines and/or make appropriate changes to such guidelines and stick to following them. It is therefore vital to use direct, on-site audits to help these lenders stay on the straight and narrow, at least quarterly, and likely on a more frequent ad-hoc basis if markets and guidelines are changing faster. These audits review guidelines vs actual implementation on underwriting, cash management and collection. Do substantive sampling of underwritten loans, their documentation and collections. And may do a deep dive into defaulted loans and their collection efforts etc\u2026 These audits are vital for managing lender/funder alignment asymmetry particularly in dynamic markets where things so easily can veer off-track. It is a key tool in ensuring CR is kept inline. For prudence and good governance, we have these audits carried out by experienced, independent external teams of auditors.  D/ Variable Rate Facilities with lenders The principal RR reducer is the fact that all Facilities provided to Lenders are variable rate connected to BoE bank rate. I.e. we agree a starting interest rate that is then automatically fully adjusted by any BoE base rate movements. Important to note that this adjustment happens across the portfolio (i.e. both current and new loans). The graph below shows the BoE Bank rate movements - as you can see ultimate facility interest rates have moved upwards since the beginning of 2022 and are expected to grow further (as BoE predicts more is needed to curb inflation).  1600\u00d7684 51.7 KB   E/ Strategic Resilience Choices: We deliberately - particularly in these market circumstances - select lenders and credit markets that are very likely to perform through a crisis - helping reduce CR. We, in particular, look for:  Lenders that has been through crisis successfully   Most of the lenders in our pipeline will have gone through market turmoil and downturns brought by events such as the Financial Crisis, Brexit and COVID; We want to see the Lender having performed across these crisis without loss to senior - and very limited overall on their portfolio We, in particular, review their ability to collect from semi-performing and non-performing loans that may have accrued during a crisis. We want to see substantive success herein for us to consider providing a facility   Credit markets that are less sensitive to cycle/crisis: We have focused on products, industries and security that have remained resilient through downturns. As examples:   Professional loans, i.e. loans to doctors, dentists, opticians have seen no negative impact in terms of arrears or defaults during the recent COVID pandemic or any previous crisis; Financing of leasing of hydrogen-powered buses to city councils for city bus route operations. The bus still runs during a crisis. Social/Retirement housing. Massive underlying core undersupply in the UK, and buyers/funders (councils, mutuals, insurers/pension funds etc) who will continue to act with a long-term focus during a crisis.  As part of these reviews we also look at the stability of underlying asset value. Its value and liquidity needs to be not materially compromised during a crisis.  F/ Management Team experienced across cycles Our Portfolio Manager, Hywell, has 15 years on the clock with no losses of senior positions and built and managed portfolios of more than GBP 200M for two large wholesale funding banks in the UK. And our Credit Committee Chair, George, has 30 years+ in the market as CEO for Santander and ABN Amro UK finance units and other roles . Allan has 20 years in investment committees and boards from private equity and financial institutions - and Alessio has over 15 years experience in Financial Services, with the last eight years in Executive positions in the non-bank lending market, This means we have a decision making team that has seen and operated during a crisis - and, as such, knows what to look for and is unlikely to under- or over-react in these situations.  G/ Green Economy Program = Resilience In our view, companies who borrow, and invest, into activities/assets aligned with long-term Climate Change/Green Economy goals, in times of a potential recession, are very likely companies with sufficient short (and long-term) financial capacity, resilience of business and strategic foresight to position themselves well for coming out of a potential crisis, where one might expect the pressure to move more aggressively down a Green Economy path would substantially increased. As such we actually see this implicit screening of companies and lenders in respect of their commitment towards a long-term Green Economy alignment and our Green Economy lending Program as a signal of health - and ultimately a more resilient credit risk. So we do see our Green Economy Program screening as part of our CR reducing efforts. That concludes our line of defence description. Let\u2019s now consider inflation and recession effects  Dynamics of Inflation & Lending In an inflationary environment we have arguments pushing both ways in terms of effects on lending: businesses have more pricing power, but supplies are also more expensive and demand may go down. People constrain spending, but, on the other hand, might do well in taking out loans as rising inflation hollows out fixed interest rates. Etc. However, general consensus, is that the net effect on lending/banking is mainly driven by rate of change in, and the level of, inflation - and it goes something like this:  A/ Net effect of Modest Inflation - even long term: Say within the 5% or so, the net effect is overall positive on lending. Basically net interest margin will be rising - lenders pass on the effect of inflation to their customers. There is no material increase in defaults and it is centred around the higher risk portions of debt (where you might say this situation is priced into the lending cost over the cycle): low income, unsecured (credit card) etc\u2026 I do hope you note that Lusitano does NOT at all work in that end of the credit spectrum - in short we\u2019d benefit from a modest inflation. It is unclear whether the credit market will long-term expand, stay the same or contract in this situation. The short-term effect of inflation is usually some level of contraction, because banks pull out of several credit markets to reprice and rethink underwriting (you see the mortgage market in the UK being completely overhauled these weeks). They are concerned about the inflation ticking up to B/ or even into recession. New loans will be more expensive and fewer (and as such press up the net interest margin). When are inflation levels no longer modest? Again this is impossible to judge exactly. Generally I think consensus would be that modest is usually max around 5% - a short period of between 5% and 10% might be ok, but not long term - the economy cannot adjust fast enough. Above 10% is very problematic - we are now heading towards recession inducing territory. Which gets us to the next section.  B/ Net effect of shock changes and long-term high inflation: A short-term rapid ascent of inflation (and then hopefully arrested by central bank actions) is almost self-evidently not good. People, businesses and lenders get caught out and you will see a short-term increase in defaults. If this ascent was just a shock, then it will move back to normal and perhaps these defaults can in fact be recovered in a more stable inflationary situation. Post a shock the credit market will contract and, potentially, almost dry-up for a while out of concern of another shock happening longer term. In the case of high-inflation everybody is having a hard time keeping pace adjusting. It can go either way in terms of effect on lending. Very likely, though, into increasing defaults and a lot of workouts - not necessarily ultimately net negative in terms of results. Certainly a contracting and expensive credit market. As mentioned, at some point, this type of inflationary situation would push the world into recession (for a short or long period). You will from the \u201cline of defence\u201d list see that Lusitano has material shock absorbers - dialled to resist exceptional shocks (all portfolios are stress tested against the worst shocks experienced over the past many years: Covid, Financial Crisis, Housing Crisis, Brexit etc) - and our capital/asset protection package, our strategic choice of portfolios to work with and direct control package should allow us to steer well clear of losses from even the high-inflation case.  Dynamics of Recession & Lending It is well-known that lending has issues with recession: defaults will go up proportionally to the size and length of the recession. Now for Lusitano the question is how much up will these defaults go, and in which industries/credit classes? As you can see from our line of defence, we have put ourselves quite far back in the capital exposure and we have made some serious strategic choices in respect of whom and what industry we support based upon their ability to weather a recession. And remember we have stress tested all portfolios for key crisis situations we can imagine. This means we feel reasonably confident about seeing our portfolios entering into a recession (not happy though). We actually don\u2019t think we\u2019d see ultimate losses in a recession unless it were to be very very long (which we think is unlikely given the central bank\u2019s fierce commitments combating this) How do we navigate through a recession in terms of underwriting further/new credit? Remember we are doing \u201cat-will\u201d underwriting per individual loan and so we can act exceptionally fast in reducing and changing exposures. And this is where the skills and experience of a seasoned management team truly kicks into gear. All the senior members of the team have been through these situations before and know where to stop and withdraw from, where to keep a trickle with new underwriting guidelines and where to continue healthy volumes from etc\u2026 In fact, a nimble, highly skilled wholesale funder, can, as banks usually over-contract, build a strong franchise quite nicely in recessionary circumstances.  Originator/Lender & Asymmetry: Not necessarily your friend in crisis A key question to ask oneself, as a wholesale funder of lenders, is: Can you trust the lender/originator to act in a manner aligned with your interest in these cases of inflation/recession/crisis? Unfortunately the answer is, on balance, no. There are too many asymmetries in the relationship. We here list a few:   Lenders Junior/equity positions are not aligned with senior positions when crisis starts hollowing out a junior/equity position (junior position holder become more risk seeking than risk averse)   Lenders preservation of a long-term, multi-product, life-time revenue, customer relationship is not aligned with a specific loan\u2019s performance and our position herein (as funder).   Lenders need for a constant volume of origination income/revenue is not aligned with our need for careful contraction of lending volume as market circumstances changes   Lenders larger RoE on Origination vs on Lending means decision-making is not aligned with our pure lending-based RoE.   I recently saw this graph from McKinsey below, which somewhat illustrates how this misalignment has, broadly speaking, only been increasing as lenders have moved towards \u201casset-light\u201d business models (for good strategic reasons btw!). This graph speaks of banking, but it is the same for non-bank lenders - just worse (they are even more asset-light).  1372\u00d7968 111 KB  The point being, we cannot rely on the lender/originator acting in our interest in these situations of crisis, and therefore, we have installed the above detailed lines of defence. And put people in place who know how to use them.  Conclusion: Well-prepared & All-weather We hope we have shown you that we are well-prepared and setup for performing during inflation, crisis or recession. And, as such, ready to act as an \u201cAll-Weather\u201d, \u201cClean Money in action\u201d growth platform for Maker. ",

Very informative post and I urge All MKR token owners and @Recognized-Delegates who have not made up their minds on MIP68, \u201cLusitano\u201d to take-time out and read. After many years of running in an average range of 1.5% to 2%, some economists are saying that coming down from 8% inflation (current) to the 2% inflation target will be nearly impossible and we\u2019ll need to get used to running in a 3-5% inflation rate range and naturally the US 10-Year Treasury will be a key indicator. Assuming some of these targets are not achieved, and JP Morgan\u2019s 5% probability of stagflation comes into fruition, have you thought about Monetalis/Lusitano\u2019s strategic approach to such an environment? More than likely it will be hazardous for both bonds and stocks. But I can also imagine that some businesses will keep on pushing forward regardless of the economic environment. ",

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate So, as you mention, Stagflation is an outside case. The central banks resolve to get rid of inflation even at the risk of recession seems very credible. However, should we move into stagflation, we are well-defended with the \u201cline of defense\u201d package above - it is quite comprehensive. I will add, the fact, that we would start building the portfolio now, and it is only USD50M to USD100M that requires deployment, is actually beneficial. Credit always leaves the markets a bit too fast and a little bit too unconsidered, and so extra excellent opportunties, caught in this blunt credit pull back, with resilient lenders working with equally resilient credit markets and hard assets are starting to nicely appear. And with this small scale deployment we can escape any average negative market conditions and trends through careful selection. Economic activity may decreases and prices may continue to rise, but there will still be an ample amount of strong, necessary businesses, to keep the world ticking over, that needs lending to deploy 50M to 100M. Lastly, perhaps one thing to generally consider about deployment in these uncertain times: Stead-fast, intelligent, funding of lending under a Green Economy/Clean Money vision during times of turbulence, shows the world a very different, positive, \u201cface\u201d of the crypto-economy/DeFi from the household one of fickleness and boom/bust. This type of action shows long-term commitment to being a sustained positive force in the world economy. I think cultivating this image and action sets will only bring positive effects for Maker\u2019s standing in respect of TradFi/Regulators etc - its builds valuable goodwill - perhaps even a necessary goodwill as Maker continues grows in size and economic importance in the overall financial system. Just food for thought. ",

                    "content": "Having tracked the progression of the Monetalis Lusitano proposal from inception to its current state, we would raise the following concerns about the investment: Facility Structure:  Lack of first loss capital at the facility level  A 15-20% first loss position insulates Maker from principal losses on the underlying pool. First loss capital helps to shorten the duration of investment in the event that Maker chooses to wind down the portfolio   Limited excess spread  Net of fees and expenses, there is little excess spread generated to cover principal losses   Off market return  The facility has been proposed with a 2.00% stability fee and 10-year duration; the current 10-year US treasury rate is ~2.75%; the 2-year treasury rate is ~2.60%    Team  Understaffed for investing  The proposal requires knowledge on a range of different business models and collateral types; the Monetalis team is not specialized in this niche (looking at past proposals, the investment scope seems unfocused)   Understaffed for operations  The operational burden of tracking loan performance and compliance across different originators is formidable   Sourcing in a large, competitive marketplace is challenging  Incumbents have deep inroads in the space and more capital; originators have an incentive to prefer incumbents    While we are happy to see that this proposal has improved from its initial form (especially the proposal for a junior first-loss piece), we would still advise against the current iteration of this proposal. There seemingly are outsized structural and executional risks that are not appropriate for Maker. Moreover, we agree with @luca_pro on team bandwidth concerns for this strategy. This concern extends to the Maker core team as well, as this proposal is high touch and may require outsized resources to successfully monitor. As a broader consideration, we are of the opinion that the best assets for Maker are short duration and managed through an external DeFi protocol (Centrifuge, TrueFi, Maple, etc.). Shorter duration assets naturally pair better with Maker\u2019s liquidity needs and external protocols can help to streamline the workflow/reporting for Maker.

Given you have followed our MIP\u2019s progression for the past 7 months of its life on the Forum, I really wish you had posted about your concerns earlier than 1/2 hour before poll close. Particularly because the concerns raised are either factually untrue or misunderstandings of how this specific market works. I sincerely hope you didn\u2019t cast any votes on this information-basis. If you are interested in understanding the facts and the market you are very welcome to reach out to me. I\u2019d be very happy to explain. Also congratulations on your recently announced collaboration with Centrifuge - it looks very exciting. Thank you for your post, and again, very glad to see a new voice entering the RWA debate on the forum. ",
