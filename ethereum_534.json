I\u2019ll try contribute more where I feel like I can (sharding research in the future maybe, I need to get some more time into my ETHSingapore hackathon prototype first)  As for the EthSingapore gathering; I know Brendan has taken notes, not sure if he\u2019s on here yet, but I\u2019ll ask on telegram to see if he can share them, and possibly do a write-up.
