Given these new MIPs and at the request of makerman at MIP73: Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets Collateral Onboarding the incubating Legal and Transactional Services Core Unit thought it useful to highlight a few key points on the DST structure and provide a detailed legal analysis of the 6S Capital DST. Prior Commentary on DST, Trusts and RWF Objectives     Real World Asset Legal Structures - A comparison Research       This excellent work by @christiancdpetersen shows us how complex those legal structures are. They are complex as they are quite flexible and the name could be misleading.  For instance, in the chat @PaperImperium rightfully asked if the Foundation directors have a fiduciary duty (they have). But no one did ask if the Trustees of a Delaware Statutory Trust have a fiduciary duty. It seems obvious. Well \u2026  For sake of precision, the Delaware LLC presented here is specific in its purpose. Other kind\u2026         Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions Governance       Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions  Title: Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions Author(s): @eumenes, @christiancdpetersen Reviewers: @williamr, @luca_pro, @sebventures, @teej, @Philinje, @Porter_Smith Type: Proposal Purpose: For discussion Date Proposed: 2022-01-17  The Real World Finance Core CU (\u201cRWF CU\u201d) proposes to use the criteria in this paper to evaluate proposed MIP6 structured finance transactions (each a \u201cProposal\u201d). The methodology\u2026     TL;DR   DSTs work well if implemented to enhance trustlessness and protect Maker\u2019s interests in the underlying transactions   DSTs work well when non-interested, independent and experienced third parties have express contractual or legal duties to protect the interests of the investors and ultimate beneficiaries (i.e., Maker)   \u201cTrustless\u201d implementation means that the borrower should not directly or indirectly direct the trustee on any actions. The structure should be designed to be effective in mitigating the risk of borrowers with bad intentions   There are many more discretionary actions in a real world financing than in a typical Maker vault. These include amendments to defined terms, covenants, events of default, waivers, etc.   DSTs will not provide much protection if Maker \u201ctrusts\u201d the borrower to do the right thing in directing the Trustee (directly or indirectly through the Trust Sponsor)   The Maker community (directly or indirectly through appointed delegates) should have the right to provide some level of oversight/instruction to the Trustee to protect its interests   The DST agreement (as with any arrangement with Maker) should prioritize transparency so that Maker can easily monitor borrower actions and verify collateral quality   A preference for decentralization needs to be balanced against the need to zealously protect Maker\u2019s interests   There is a balance to be struck between trusting the borrower completely and having Maker appointed representatives \u201centangled\u201d in oversight of a loan   6S Trust Agreement Review TL;DR On balance, the 6S Capital Trust Agreement provides too much discretion to the Trust Sponsor and, indirectly 6S Capital. Thus, Maker is trusting 6S Capital (the borrower) to make decisions in respect of many credit related activities. The 6S Capital Trust Agreement should be amended to increase oversight by one or more persons representing the interests of Maker (as the ultimate beneficiary of the real world assets) and increase transparency on key items. The recent amendments to the 6S Capital Credit Agreement, made without Maker\u2019s prior knowledge, are an example for the need for increased oversight at the expense of a degree of decentralization.  The 6S Capital Trust Agreement gives the Trust Sponsor (RWA International Ltd. (i.e., \u201cCayCo\u201d)) broad power and authority to act for the Trust under the Trust Agreement. This includes the exclusive power and authority to:    Review loan requests (and presumably recommend approval or not)   Trigger defaults under the Credit Agreement   Verify Borrower\u2019s compliance with Loan Agreement   Take action in respect of notices under the Trust Agreement and the Credit Agreement   Do all things related to the general day-to-day administration of the Trust     CayCo\u2019s directors have fiduciary duties to CayCo and CayCo\u2019s shareholder (the charitable trust).   But CayCo\u2019s directors will not likely have familiarity with the day-to-day activities of the Trust and the trust\u2019s underlying assets and will, in all likelihood, take instruction from 6S Capital (subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman law to CayCo and to its shareholder)   Neither CayCo\u2019s directors nor CayCo\u2019s shareholder have a contractual or legal duty to look after Maker\u2019s interests   The Trust Agreement expressly defines (and restricts) the Trustee\u2019s powers   The Trust Agreement expressly narrows or eliminates some of the Trustee\u2019s statutory duties   The Trust Agreement expressly defines the Verification Agent and the Paying Agent\u2019s powers   6S Capital recently proposed the creation of an advisory board for the existing vault 6s Structure Updates. This implicitly recognizes the need for increased oversight   Options The Maker community may consider the following for the existing 6S Capital DST structure:   Amend the DST structure to enable more trustlessness, transparency and fix the deficiencies.   Leave \u201cas is\u201d in respect of the existing $15 million vault   Trigger a liquidation of the existing $15 million vault   For the first option, the incubating LTS believes that the deficiencies are remedial. The second option requires no further action. The last option will require more legal and commercial analysis given the existing loans under the Credit Agreement. Analysis of 6S Capital DST The remainder of this posting is a textual review of the key roles and responsibilities of the Trustee (Wilmington Savings Fund Society (\u201cWSFS\u201d)), Paying Agent (WSFS) and Verification Agent (WSFS) and the Trust Sponsor (RWA International) in the management and administration of the RWA Senior Lending Trust established for the 6S transaction.  Purpose and Powers of the Trust (Section 1.8) - Section 1.8 sets forth the general powers of the Trust (as a legal entity established under the law of Delaware).  1430\u00d71032 79.2 KB   1252\u00d7372 33.2 KB  The Trust Agreement then delineates the roles and responsibilities of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Verification Agent and the Trust Sponsor in the management and administration of the Trust. Typically, an independent, third-party actor (WSFS) will ensure that its responsibilities are clearly defined within the respective agreement. Appropriately, the Trust Agreement clearly defines the role of WSFS in its capacity as Paying Agent, Verification Agent and Trustee. Paying Agent (WSFS) - The Paying Agent\u2019s main responsibility relates to the creation and maintenance of the RWA Senior Lending Trust Account and to make specified priority distributions from such account (Section 3.1(d)). The RWA Senior Lending Trust Account is the account into which the Borrower will make payments of principal and interest. (Sec. 3.1) Verification Agent (WSFS) - The Verification Agent\u2019s main responsibility is confirmation as to the occurrence of the liquidation status of the DAI Facility, the Applicable Rate, and the approval or rejection of any Material Amendment. The Verification Agent\u2019s responsibilities are defined in Article IV. Trustee (WSFS)- The Trustee\u2019s responsibilities are identified in Section 6.1(a):   Fulfill the requirements of Section 3807 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act; and   Maintain the existence of the Trust.    1354\u00d7208 96.8 KB  The remainder of Section 6.1 sets forth what the Trustee is not responsible for and defines the scope of the Trustee\u2019s liabilities:  1392\u00d7308 117 KB   1378\u00d7256 112 KB  . . . .  1396\u00d7664 226 KB   1400\u00d7690 266 KB  The Trust Agreement broadly excludes many obligations and includes only those \u201cexcept as expressly provided by the terms of this Trust Agreement\u201d or \u201cin any document or written instruction received by the Trustee\u201d. Trust Sponsor (RWA International) In contrast to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Verification Agent, the Trust Agreement grants the Trust Sponsor with broad powers and authorities, including \u201ccausing the Trust to perform the Trust\u2019s obligations under the Transaction Documents\u201d. (Sec. 7.1(a)).  1384\u00d7296 118 KB  The Trust Sponsor is expressly authorized to act in respect of the Trust Property:  1384\u00d7228 57.4 KB  The Trust Sponsor is expressly authorized in Section 7.3 to:  1422\u00d71108 401 KB  The Trust Agreement grants the Trust Sponsor broad authorities to act in respect of the Transaction Documents and matters relating to the Trust. This includes \u201cto act on behalf of the Trust regarding certain matters, including but not limited to\u201d:   Executing \u201cany other agreements or documents\u201d in relation to the Transaction Documents.   Reviewing of loan requests under the Credit Agreement from time to time.   Verification of Borrower\u2019s compliance under the Credit Agreement.   [Sending and receiving] \u201ccertain notices under the Trust Agreement or the Credit Agreement. \u201cSending and receiving\u201d is in brackets as the sub-clause does not include a verb. It could be anything \u2026 \u201cacting on\u201d, \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201cdeciding on\u201d, \u201csigning\u201d\u2026   All things related to the general day-to-day administration of the Trust.   This clause is poorly drafted as \u201ccertain matters\u201d is not defined, but then followed by the expansive \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d. A reasonable interpretation may be that the Trust Sponsor\u2019s authorities are intended to be expansive. As important as the above, the Trust Sponsor has the ability to direct the Trustee from time to time in the management of the Trust (Section 6.1(b)).  1370\u00d7104 22.8 KB  In conclusion, the Trust Sponsor has broad and discretionary powers under the Trust Agreement. For instance, other than the action undertaken by the Verification Agent, the Trust Sponsor would appear to be responsible for \u201creviewing\u201d (and likely approving) loan requests. Who is the Trust Sponsor The Trust Sponsor is a Cayman Islands company. The Trust Sponsor\u2019s sole shareholder is a Cayman Islands charitable trust. For purposes of the Credit Agreement, the authorized representatives of the Trust Sponsor are two Cayman Islands directors and Maarten (as an authorized representative). A directors resolution of the Trust Sponsor dated February 4, 2021 identifies Maarten\u2019s responsibilities as an authorized signatory:  1308\u00d7998 130 KB  From the above, Maarten appears to have broad powers to take actions in respect of the Trust under the Credit Agreement. However, it is important to recognize the authorizations above only relate to \u201cWilmington Trust Company\u201d and not WSFS. Based on the documents available for purposes of this review, notwithstanding Maarten being an \u201cAuthorized Signatory\u201d for purposes of the Credit Agreement (Exhibit C), the above authorizations may be inadequate. It may be that, as a matter of Cayman law, Maarten does not have any authority vis-a-vis WSFS. Ultimately, the directors of the Trust Sponsor are responsible for management of the Trust Sponsor. Further, the directors of the Trust Sponsor have such Cayman law duties to the shareholder of the Trust Sponsor - the RWA International Ltd. Charitable Trust. The directors do not have any duties to act in the interests of Maker. @MakerMan @Real-World-Finance @luca_pro ",
