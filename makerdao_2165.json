Paragraph Summary Modify the mandate to reflect the expanded scope of the CU. Renaming CU to Sidestream Automation Services (SAS).  Specification  Core Unit ID SAS-01  Motivation With the Pregame many things have changed for SAS. We broadly expanded our CU work scope to maximize our effectiveness for the DAO. In the past months, Auctions and Liquidations became a smaller fraction of our daily work. We\u2019ve described our expanded work scope in our new budget MIP and in our 2 recent monthly updates. SAS strives to become a trusted custom software development service provider for SubDAOs. This is in accordance with the Endgame plan, where individual SubDAOs will focus on providing value where they know best, without the need to specialize in software development.  Core Unit Mandate With the mandate update, SAS will pursue the technical opportunities in the DAO that are most effective (not being limited to auctions and liquidations anymore). We strive to acquire as many project-based funded MakerDAO projects as possible. For that, we expanded our development capabilities and have now a Web3 Full-Stack offering: Smart contract, API, and decentralized frontend development services accompanied by Product Management and Infrastructure work. To reflect this change (but avoid changing the proven CU acronym), we would like to rename the CU into Sidestream Automation Services (SAS).

From a few perspectives, I\u2019d say it is a good idea to update the mandate. Though I\u2019d hesitate to say it\u2019s a requirement. First, someone less familiar with Maker trying to understand what exactly the SAS Core Unit does is at least as likely to land on the mandate MIP than they are on the most recent budget MIP. In terms of clarity and preventing misunderstanding, updating the mandate to be consistent with the most recent budget is a good idea. Second, updating the mandate will give you more freedom for spending your budget. As a general rule, mandates can be more general than budgets. If an expense comes up that isn\u2019t covered by the budget, the mandate is what you\u2019d use to justify that expenditure. If the mandate and the budget are in conflict, or are simply unrelated, it becomes harder to justify adjusting spending within the limit of your budgeted funds.  Given the reality of things with Endgame implementation, this may just be not worth the time, though. My understanding is that most of the MIPs (both in RFC and not) are not compatible with Endgame and will be removed at some point in the near future. I suspect core unit mandates fall into this category. If that is the case, the question becomes whether you believe it\u2019s worth putting in the effort to do the \u2018right\u2019 thing, given that the definition of \u2018right\u2019 is predicted to change in the near future.  This reply probably just makes the decision more complicated, so apologies for that. ",
