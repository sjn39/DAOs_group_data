These changes are currently in the executive awaiting passage, and there is no way to organize opposition to these rate changes short of campaigning against the entire executive. These changes are drastic in nature, and should be opposed on grounds of both process and substance. Given:   The proposed changes to rates are large, with a 42% reduction in rates for our largest ilk and similar across nearly all Maker ilks, representing millions of dollars in lost revenue on even a monthly basis,   The changes were put into an on-chain poll the very day they were proposed,   There was no attempt to informally poll the community about these changes,   The changes were put into an active poll at a time when no other new polls were created,   These changes were immediately put into a poll exactly as proposed by a group that is not vested with any power by MKR holders,   That this group violated the very MIP46 it is organized under, which repeatedly names discussion and feedback as a requirement, and clearly states, \u201cSufficient time must be given for discussion,\u201d   The stated rationale behind these changes is to grow DAI supply, and DAI supply daily sits at new highs already,   That revenues have been rising for Maker, indicating that no rate cut is necessary to maintain competitiveness with other protocols,   That the only alternative to this signal is to fight the current executive proposal, which includes other necessary things,   \u2026then MakerDAO members should loudly and forcefully vote YES in the poll below. Maker is known to stand for decentralization. Decentralization is not a small group of unelected members putting a poll on-chain the very same day as their proposal is announced. That small group was given time to wrangle votes, quietly plan and discuss amongst themselves, and present a plan immediately on-chain. That no opposition could be organized in such short time should not be surprising. Whether you agree or disagree with whether Maker should drastically slash income even in the face of a growing supply of DAI and revenue, any civil person can agree that even a self-appointed group organized under MIP46 is still bound by its own terms of formation to allow \u201cDiscussion - Parameter Proposals must be presented with enough of a feedback period to give the community time to respond and discuss the proposal. Questions, concerns, or queries must be answered if brought up by the Maker community, and feedback must be considered before finalizing the proposal.\u201d While surely unintentional, Maker cannot leave intact this deviation from our solemn aspiration of decentralization and due process. **Vote YES to repeal \u201cParameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - June 28, 2021\u201d    Should Maker Repeal \"\u201cParameter Changes Proposal - MakerDAO Open Market Committee - June 28, 2021?\u201d  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll will run for 7 days (until Wednesday, July 14, 16:00) ",

It may be worth discussing that independently if you wish. I believe the following points are the non-process related arguments - correct me if I should have added any of the others from your list.     PaperImperium:   The stated rationale behind these changes is to grow DAI supply, and DAI supply daily sits at new highs already    The rationale behind these changes was indicated both in the original post and a reply later in the thread. I am quoting both here.  The Open Market Committee has identified the concerns of the community around tail-risk with USDC as being a material discussion point on the topic of the longevity of MakerDAO. As a result we have concluded that the optimal course of action is to increase DAI supply (from non-PSM ilks).   The OMC has identified moving the USDC off the books as a primary goal.  I think both posts were fairly clear. It is not to grow DAI supply, it is to grow DAI supply from non-PSM ilks. The rationale has been clearly described as concerns around the amount of USDC on the books.     PaperImperium:   The proposed changes to rates are large, with a 42% reduction in rates for our largest ilk and similar across nearly all Maker ilks, representing millions of dollars in lost revenue on even a monthly basis    Technically, depending on how many users choose to mint DAI at the new rates, this statement might not be true. However, even if it is, the supply increase of DAI is needed to ensure that DAI remains on peg without (mis)using the PSM. For much too long, the PSM has been used as rug under which we\u2019ve been sweeping our core DAI supply problems. DAI is taking lots of reputational damage because it is seen as a USDC wrapper and this is not an entirely false picture. I am glad that we\u2019re finally waking up to this issue and correcting course.     PaperImperium:   That revenues have been rising for Maker, indicating that no rate cut is necessary to maintain competitiveness with other protocols,    This is really disingenuous now, @PaperImperium. You know better than most of us here that long term prospects can be in conflict with short term goals. Exclusively prioritizing revenue at the expense of a huge existential risk is not the right measure of competitiveness.     PaperImperium:  \u2026then MakerDAO members should loudly and forcefully vote YES in the poll below.   For the reasons above, I disagree completely with this and have voted no. ",

PaperImperium:  These changes are currently in the executive awaiting passage, and there is no way to organize opposition to these rate changes short of campaigning against the entire executive. These changes are drastic in nature, and should be opposed on grounds of both process and substance.   To me this signal comes across as campaigning against this execute, or at least seems likely to have that effect.     PaperImperium:  These changes were immediately put into a poll exactly as proposed by a group that is not vested with any power by MKR holders ,   This statement seems crafted to suggest the group lacks legitimacy.  But as you later note the group is formed in accordance with MIP46, and happens to also have multiple members who are mandated actors vested with power by, and therefore accountable to MKR token holders.     PaperImperium:  That this group violated the very MIP46 it is organized under , which repeatedly names discussion and feedback as a requirement, and clearly states, \u201cSufficient time must be given for discussion,\u201d   This criticism is not entirely unfair in this case but completely overlooks MIP46c3 which states:    MIP46: Parameter Proposal Groups   Urgent or emergency proposals from Parameter Proposal Groups should follow the existing guidelines for urgent or emergency proposals.   My sense is that as USDC backing Dai has recently skyrocketed, the community does want urgent action (consistent with maintaining 1 Dai = $1.00)  to dampen this phenomenon. The Parameter Changes Proposal in question clearly identifies this concern and objective:    Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 28 June 2021   The Open Market Committee has identified the concerns of the community around tail-risk with USDC as being a material discussion point on the topic of the longevity of MakerDAO.

PaperImperium:  The stated rationale behind these changes is to grow DAI supply, and DAI supply daily sits at new highs already,   As noted above, the rationale is not just to increase the Dai supply, but to increase it from non-PSM ilks. I think it would be a mistake to optimize stability fees for MakerDAO profitability, which aside from process seems to be the main issue this signal is targeting.  Vault holders should be comfortable knowing that MakerDAO does not exist for the purpose of extracting rent. Additionally, understanding how vault holders react to rate changes is still in early stages.  Substantial rate changes create the risk of overshooting but also opportunities to gather that data. I am voting NO on this signal request. ",

Before the PSM, the problem was easy, do we maintain the peg or do we cut the income. The first one was the priority. Now, the peg is not an issue as we traded it for the usdc risk ( less visible), so the priority has changed. And rates are a touchy parameter to change therefore what ever we do we will have this conversation over and over.

If the PSM USDC increased over the previous month, that means that DAI would have been, on average, over peg had there been no PSM.

PaperImperium:  The stated rationale behind these changes is to grow DAI supply, and DAI supply daily sits at new highs already,   Maybe you should understand the difference between DAI supply and DAI demand before (for which the imbalance is handled by PSM-USDC). The decision of the MOMC was not an easy one. You can certainly say we were too slow to react last month (and I agree we were, but easier in hindsight). Maybe too quick this month? Maybe. Is it better than 9 months ago? For sure. If you want to change the process, do it, if you want to propose another PPG, do it.

I remember being scared that Maker would turn itself into a sclerotic org, with layers of rules capable of blocking obvious choices. Maybe that PPG vote was too rushed, maybe not, but I\u2019m happy that it could happen at all. At the current margin, informal governance processes should go faster. The point of rules on this forum are, I think, just consensus-building. Actual executive power rests in the hands of MKR voters. They can reject any proposal. They can also create, vote on, and pass proposals without going through this forum or even the governance portal. So as long as there is rough consensus I think it\u2019s basically fine to submit executives, and my perception on this PPG vote was that consensus was there. Finally on substance the rates change can be reversed with another executive. It\u2019s not like a new collateral type was rushed through. And the PR impact of changing rates a little too fast does not worry me. ",

We would need another Exec in order to pass and execute in order to undue the rates change. So as far as @ultraschuppi 's point on next steps, the most direct line would be having this signal lead to an onchain poll to roll back the latest rates changes from the MOMC. Then if that passed it could then be included in the following exec to \u201cundo\u201d the rates changes.

Great question, thank you! So after introspecting a little bit and with the usual caveats about bias etc, I would not feel bad about the process at all, I would hope the executive does not pass, and I would not want to wait a few weeks before discussing lowering rates again. That last part is not in symmetry with my current \u201clet\u2019s wait a bit\u201d stance, maybe for good reasons (temporarily excessive rates can create lasting PR damage whereas temporarily insufficient rates are just some lost revenue) but also maybe for bad ones (more motivation to keep an outcome I agree with than to keep one I don\u2019t like).

                    "content": "So I want to start out by thanking you for raising this as an issue, @PaperImperium, it\u2019s hard to get people invested in the process of governance itself, and it\u2019s always a highlight when someone does, even if it\u2019s to object in some way.     PaperImperium:  That this group violated the very MIP46 it is organized under , which repeatedly names discussion and feedback as a requirement, and clearly states, \u201cSufficient time must be given for discussion,\u201d   You are correct that the process we followed violated the spirit of MIP46. I\u2019ll go into a little detail about why I decided this was fine in this case a bit further down.  With all this said, if you\u2019re going to setup signal requests like this, please make an effort to present the issue in a neutral and unbiased manner. You have argued towards repeal, and spent no words on arguing the advantage to making this exception to process. The inclusion of emotionally charged terms and lack of representation of the other side, makes this feel like an effort to convince people to vote in favour of repeal. Signal Requests are intended to reveal and solidify consensus, not to push one side of an issue.      PaperImperium:  That small group was given time to wrangle votes, quietly plan and discuss amongst themselves,   Just to be clear, while I recognize the opportunity for this, none of this happened.     PaperImperium:  Discussion - Parameter Proposals must be presented with enough of a feedback period to give the community time to respond and discuss the proposal. Questions, concerns, or queries must be answered if brought up by the Maker community, and feedback must be considered before finalizing the proposal.   To this, I would argue that this proposal was at least partially a response to the feedback from the previous proposal.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Understood. But is that even possible? I would like to hear from GovAlpha if such is doable.   We would put up another on-chain poll, if it passed we would include a repeal in a subsequent executive vote.     SebVentures:  A Governance Facilitator is in the group so I would say the process is followed.   Want to push back a bit on this. My presence isn\u2019t a guarantee that we\u2019re doing the \u2018right\u2019 thing.     PaperImperium:  It is difficult to reject a proposal that is simultaneously birthed and polled \u2014 many do not even check here in a three day window.   So I want to be clear that I\u2019d considered this issue, and ensured that I informed the larger holders that I am in contact with that the vote existed, and that it reduced rates. I also encouraged them to vote.  So, I should have included my reasoning for breaking the process in the thread in question. I did respond to it, but should have been more clear as to why I felt it was valid. So I\u2019ll do that now: I felt it was acceptable in this instance to expedite the process because:  Response to the previous PPG proposal did not feel that we had gone far enough with changes - and people were concerned that the delay was resulting in a lack of competitiveness and materially harming the protocol. The mandated actors had also discussed the idea of further rate reductions outside of the PPG and were broadly (though not entirely) in favour. It\u2019s possible that the mandated actors would have pushed something similar if the PPG hadn\u2019t. There was a signal request that commented on speeding up the process, to which I highlighted cutting down the discussion time as one of the optimisations to improve turnaround. Frankly, it felt like a workable idea, and I wanted to see what the response would be. Delays to the PPG turnaround have been highlighted multiple times in the past and we\u2019ve made no process change, again, it felt like it was worth attempting to lean in the other direction. The proposal is just that, a proposal. The PPG group does not have the power to implement anything. We expedited a proposal for a change, not the change itself. The 3 day weekly  poll duration is not new, it\u2019s existed for multiple years. If larger MKR Holders felt that it was unsuitable, they have had years to change it. They haven\u2019t done so. Ultimately a number of MKR Holders were present and voted in the poll, others were not. If larger holders cannot check in once a week when they have literally hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, to see if there is something that concerns them even when directly prompted to do so, my sympathy is limited. The executive vote exists as a final backstop to prevent something passing if it is unpopular. Delaying CU budgets for a week is unfortunate and would cause some problems, but those problems can be worked around if people truly do not want this. Additionally, as you\u2019ve stated, there is nothing here that cannot be reversed. Downside is that governance looks a bit schizophrenic. Again, that\u2019s unfortunate, but maybe that encourages people to take the weekly poll processes more seriously.  ",

I understand the concerns about short term cash flow, but I can\u2019t overemphasize how important it is that we focus on growth at the current nascent state of the market. Maker MUST be the cheapest place to borrow at large scale against ETH, always, and guaranteed at prices our users will know to be highly competitive and worth it. This way, most automated systems will target Maker for their integrations, and will become highly sticky demand. The risk of keeping fees high is that maker might lose out on these integrations and be left in the dust as other protocols take off, when things start to take off for real. Only exception should be if we are hitting dangerous levels of exposure, which we definitely aren\u2019t any time soon compared to the risk in USDC and the incredible liquidity and value prop of ETH (and don\u2019t forget that we earn from the liquidation penalty!)
