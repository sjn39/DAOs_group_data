If you are looking for a list of pros and cons, ideally the linked signaling thread should include these in the OP for review, with discussion below. Would you prefer for it to be summarized in audio or video form? Viewed as a summary? etc. I produce a resource called Governance at a Glance which is updated weekly, it includes a three point summary and links and brief descriptions of the active discussions and signals happening for that week. If you have feedback over how this could be more useful to you I\u2019d love to hear it. Recently @adrianhacker-pdx has been producing Maker Holders Dai-gest, the latest of which can be found here which I believe is a significant improvement in terms of content than the previous versions. I recognise that we don\u2019t have signaling threads for most of the regularly scheduled votes, so I can see where you might be missing some information here. I would really love to make this easier for you and for everyone else that can\u2019t commit a large amount of time to the project, so please share any more detail or ideas that you can. ",

They are mostly \u201clookbacks.\u201d  A couple of other comments.  There are now many places where one can go to get info on MakerDao and current discussions.  You have Twitter, Reddit, MakerDao.com, these forums, Maker Chat, vote.makerdao.com, YouTube plus a bevy of 3rd party content producers.  These forum threads seem to be where the action is now but I would submit that very few people actually subscribe to this forum like I have.  So, all this discussion isn\u2019t even getting to the MKR masses, IMO.  I\u2019ve been involved with Maker since way back before it was launched and it\u2019s not easy to stay where the action is. It used to be Reddit.  Then MakerChat.  Then, you had to post in the correct group in MakerChat.  Somewhere along the way, everything moved to these forums.  I used to try to keep up with it all.  It became too onerous.  Also, discussions around governance, while incredibly important, can become quite tedious. What I would like to see are a few reasons why someone might vote for the different options in a polling or executive vote right at the vote site.  It doesn\u2019t have to be exhaustive.  Last night, I went to vote.makerdao.com to see what\u2019s up for vote.  It looks to me like there is an executive vote for \"Activate the Debt Ceiling Adjustments and Set the Dai Savings Rate Spread.  When I click on that, I see that the vote is to:  Lower the Sai Debt Ceiling - Cool.  I\u2019m in favor of that. Set the Dai Savings Rate Spread to 1% - Cool.  I\u2019m good with that. Lower the Dai ETH Debt Ceiling by 20 million to 130 million Dai - What?  This looks like we want to lower the debt ceiling.  Why in the world would we want to do this?  So, I click on that hyperlink and I\u2019m taken to another poll with links to more resources.  I can take an hour to read the Migration Risk Construct, Governance Risk Framework, watch a video and so on.  I don\u2019t want to do that so I go back to the vote at hand.  Under \u201cReview,\u201d I see \u201cThis change was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, Feb 27.  Please review the Video, Audio, and the online discussion to inform your position before voting.\u201d  My preference at this point is to review the online discussion.  I don\u2019t have time right now to watch a video or listen to an audio. So, I click on the \u201cdiscussion\u201d link and it takes me to the forum topics.  Which one of these talks about the THIS particular vote?  It\u2019s not obvious to me.  If I click on \u201cvideo,\u201d I see all these governance videos.  Sorry, but I would rather watch paint dry than watch another one of these.  Even so, let\u2019s say I want to be a good steward and I\u2019ll watch a couple of minutes of discussion if it will help me with this vote.  All I see is Ep. 75, Ep 74, Ep. 73\u2026  Which of these is from Feb 27?  I can\u2019t tell.  Yeah, I could go to Youtube and try to find it and then try to figure where in that video this vote issue is addressed but by this time, I\u2019m done.  I gotta get back to work.  I think you get my point.  We seem to have a binary option of either letting the MKR voters do all the voting directly or to delegate our voting by proxy.  I would suggest that there is an in-between option.  We MKR voters could do a better job voting if the relevant info was readily available on the vote site.  I want to see recommendations from the Maker team for each vote and maybe some brief pros and cons for each selection.  I realize that the team doesn\u2019t want to \u201cguide\u201d the vote.  However, I want this guidance.  Without such guidance, the only other alternative for me is to just delegate my vote. Btw, I still don\u2019t know why we would want to lower the debt ceiling or if I\u2019m even reading that correctly.  So\u2026 I just won\u2019t vote today.  Sigh. ",

I agree that it is not necessary to transcribe the videos when the \u201cSummaries/Episodes\u201d (https://community-development.makerdao.com/governance/governance-and-risk-meetings/summaries) exist. I didn\u2019t know they existed. I always just checked the transcripts page and saw that nothing new appeared there. It would be helpful to add one line at the top of the transcripts page: \u201cDue to \u2026 the transcripts are no longer produced. Please see the Governance and Risk Meeting summaries here.\u201d I also suggest that the folowing line is changed on the executive vote page: This change was discussed in the Governance call on Thursday, February 20. Please review the Video, Audio, Summary and the online discussion to inform your position before voting. If the summary is not available when the vote starts - the sentence below could follow: The Summary of the Governance call will be available shortly here. If we want even better UX, the link to the Summary could appear when it becomes available  ",

About the Dai Stability Fee:  The MakerDAO system is designed to cover excess outstanding loan amounts that may not be covered by the liquidation of collateral.  Although this is highly unlikely, it would most likely result from a situation that is unforeseeable.  This fee covers the amount of inflation during the time the loan is made, administrative costs of the Foundation, and a credit guarantee fee for Maker Holders who are acting as guarantors of the loan.  This fee covers the risk and the risk of risk being risky. For the voter to decide:  A prudent fee to ensure system stability in the event that collateral no longer holds enough value to cover outstanding loans. ",

Poll Opened:  March 2, 2020 Dai Savings Rate Spread Voters can choose the Dai Savings Rate spread to be set anywhere between 0% and 4%. About the Dai Savings Rate:  When the value of Dai goes too far off track from the $1 set-point, adjusting the savings rate is one mechanism for price correction: \u2022 If the market price of Dai is above 1 USD, MKR holders can choose to gradually decrease the DSR, which will reduce demand and should reduce the market price of Dai toward the 1 USD Target Price.    \u2022 If the market price of Dai is below 1 USD, MKR holders can choose to gradually increase the DSR, which will stimulate demand and should increase the market price of Dai toward the 1 USD Target Price.

Coming to rely on the Foundation for information on how to vote is dangerous because they won\u2019t always be there to provide that information (also centralization risk, etc). Regarding the DSR Spread, @hexonaut is the best person to expand on this. That said, my understanding is that the spread shouldn\u2019t be seen as a monetary policy tool. It\u2019s more of a business-strategy lever to control growth of the system. Lower DSR spread equates to more growth, higher DSR spread equates to more immediate profit (leading to MKR burn.) The current situation is that the DSR is a system parameter that is controlled by two levers, the stability fee lever, and the DSR Spread lever (which is an \u2018indirect-lever\u2019 that doesn\u2019t 1-1 correspond to a system parameter). We voted to implement the following relationship: DSR = SF - DSR Spread There is more information under the DSR Spread tag. I believe it was also mentioned in some G&R meetings (there was a presentation!), but I don\u2019t think they are tagged correctly. ",
