                    "content": "Disclaimer: This is my personal stance and does not represent PECU views. Read the final piece: Aggressive Growth Strategy. In my previous piece I tried explaining why we should grow Surplus Buffer and how it will fuel revenue growth. Now, I want to argue why we should stop the burn entirely for years to come. Keep in mind I am not arguing that MKR burn should stop forever however, I believe that burning MKR before we absolutely dominate the stablecoin market is very shortsighted.  Quick look at the history MakerDAO has been burning MKR for years now. I want to take a closer look at some of these periods and see the effect that burn caused on MKR price. For the lack of better tools, we will use mkrburn.com as the source.  A year in flames - 03.2019 - 03.2020 During this period, MCD constantly burned MKR. It burned almost 14k MKR (1.4% of the whole supply) in a year. One would expect that such burn pressure would do wonders to MKR price. Unfortunately, MKR price couldn\u2019t care less and stayed relatively flat at around $550.  1354\u00d7836 54.4 KB   1322\u00d7858 44.2 KB  This period of time was ended by Black Thursday - when the system suffered a loss of about 6M DAI. At that time, Surplus Buffer size was only 500k DAI and was not enough to cover the losses, so flop actions were started and new MKR was printed. This was a disaster for MKR price as it fell to as low as $220. To cover losses, 20k MKR was minted, not only wiping out the whole year of burn but also increasing MKR total supply 5k above 1M. We can learn a few things from this event:  MKR burn of around 1% yearly didn\u2019t have any effect on the price, Flop actions have a disastrous effect on MKR price,  The short-sightedness of MKR holders was a direct cause for flop actions - if revenues would be funneled to increase surplus buffer instead, it would be big enough to cover the losses (it would be around $7M),   A short period of massive burn - Jan 2022  838\u00d7840 21.9 KB   1266\u00d7856 37.4 KB  In the recent market pullback, liquidations generated $20M surplus that was later spent on flap auctions. This caused a short increase in ETH/MKR ratio. What we can learn:  Burn works! \u2026but has to be massive    Why most of the time, doesn\u2019t burn work as advertised? The buy pressure caused by burning ~1% of total supply yearly is just too small to cause a supply crunch anytime soon. To see immediate burn effects we would need to burn huge amounts of MKR (few % of supply) every year. For now, protocol revenue is too small to generate big buy pressure at the current MKR price. I would argue that market forces caused by \u201cThreat Of Burn\u201d\u2122 are enough to maintain the price floor ie. a huge % burn over long periods of time will never happen because the price will increase even if no MKR is burned. Finally, if our goal is to take MKR off the market, there might be better models like vested escrowed (ve). In the future, when we are ready to burn again I\u2019d probably opt for a hybrid solution (burn + ve) but this is a topic for another discussion\u2026  If not burn, then what? As mentioned in my previous post, I believe that MakerDAO should refocus on aggressive growth. The easiest way to do that is to grow Surplus Buffer. Then, invest in new ways of making money while avoiding the risk of flop auctions. Right now we are facing a DAI supply crisis but once we fix it, we will need to use our cash flows to help DAI dominate the stablecoin market. DSR, cashbacks and increasing the real world DAI adoption \u2013 it all requires a lot of funds. Finally, flap auctions need some work. The current implementation is far from efficient, which causes spreads. Also just enabling small burn (via lerp) will result in a huge MKR burn in case of unexpected inflows (for example revenue from auctions). Redoing tekenomics is also a big endeavour that will keep PECU busy for months. Prioritising Surplus Buffer growth helps DAO to use engineering resources to increase revenues rather than rent-seeking.  MKR price speculation Does it mean that we should prepare for seeing MKR $1500 apiece for years to come until we revamp tokenonimics or re-enable burn? Quite the contrary. Every asset can be valued based on its fundamentals or based on its expected future growth ie. speculative value. I believe that MKR token is currently priced solely on its fundamentals. With a P/E ratio of around 15, MKR is priced like a well-established corporation that has days of explosive growth behind itself. We suffer from close to 0 speculative premium. I believe that refocus on growth is exactly what will make MKR price more speculative. The burn signals that the DAO doesn\u2019t have any better idea on how to reinvest its revenue and basically pays back the dividend to their investors. There is a very good reason why AMZN never paid out any dividends and yet is one of the most valued companies in the world.  1600\u00d7320 126 KB  Furthermore, as mentioned before, in a scenario when DAO\u2019s revenue 10x but price stays still, just a threat of (massive) burn should be enough to increase price and hence such scenario should never occur.  Conclusions I believe that internal consensus around the burn is one of the most critical topics that MakerDAO should achieve. Avoiding MKR burn shows a clear focus on long-term dominance in the DeFi space. I can\u2019t wait for the future when I will be able to pay in DAI for my groceries and enjoy MKR deflation at the same time. However, I am worried that we will never see that future if we burn through our revenue now. ",

The fact that we have positive earnings right now means that there is not an abundance of ideas that would lead to such aggressive growth in the eyes of the entire community.  If you want to compare to Amazon, you also have to recognize that Amazon had consistent revenue growth and cash flow that was completely reinvested into business operations.  It was not invested in a large cash balance that sat there growing.  Many businesses that have clear growth paths actually borrow as much as they can and investors are ok with it because they see the growth path and agree with borrowing even if it often means their shares are diluted. Maker does continue to grow but it\u2019s hard to pinpoint whether this growth is coming as a byproduct of crypto in general growing or from core unit accomplishments. If you use cash flow to burn, I know what I\u2019m getting and I know it\u2019s fair.  If you throw the money into the buffer, I have to trust that you are going to use that money wisely and without any specific proposals or roadmap, I can only go by track record.  If you tell me what you\u2019re going to do with the money, I can decide whether I think I agree with these investments and either invest or not invest.  So I\u2019m not advocating throwing money around wastefully.  I\u2019m just saying maybe the issue is that we don\u2019t have have enough ideas on how to better use the money.

Crypto is far from a mature market with massive speculative premiums. I believe any effort towards a profit taking mechanism should be deferred in favour of growing the fundamentals such as growing DAI supply to deal with this increasing USDC buffer. To those suggesting a small burn, I also don\u2019t think this is a good use of the limited resources of Protocol Engineering. A focus on fundamentals will likely lead to stronger value for MKR rather than short term burn. ",

I\u2019m thinking details like how much would we want to allocate to each idea, what work is required to set things up/recurring expenses that would be established, expected timelines for implementation (startup cost), how much should we expect in terms of return.  Details like these help people know what to expect.  It also creates a standard of accountability for investments to hold to. What are the priorities?  Is there a threshold the surplus buffer would need to reach before it is used to invest in these ideas?  If there are good ideas that have widespread support, could we allocate a specific amounts to these? My main point is that the continual building of a surplus buffer is not transparent.  It simply asks for trust that those in charge use it well.  If there is a plan that is proposed and accepted, I\u2019m sure it would be much easier for all to swallow the loss of burns for the foreseeable future. We have to understand that many were drawn to mkr because of the promise of a consistent burn.  If you do away with it, you need to tell a good story about what you\u2019re doing with the money because you\u2019re not the only project/business investing in itself and some of those out there paint a very promising picture of the future.

And we dont know how effective the burn was, maybe we would be hovering around 1500. I always started to buy more MKR when I saw the mechanism working and MKR burn. Because it validated my long term investment thesis and I saw it as progress the less MKR there were. I am kinda disappointed seeing the burn being so heavily influenced and at the whim of a handful of people. I thought always it was a more automatic function of the protocol not dependent on anyone. Also we should use money to advertise this might actually grow the usage faster than a technical development. Because people simply dont seem to understand what Dai actually is. People think UST is the first stable that is backed by Bitcoin. I feel like straight up advertising DAI and explaining how it works would be a good use of some of the income. Maybe hire even some marketing agency the one that makes  guerilla marketing for cardano. People rather use Tether USDC or UST because they dont understand Dai and how safe it is. It will be a hard time for MKR Eth ratio once Eth goes deflationary especially without the burn. We should burn some to keep up. I honestly dont even know how much of the capital that doesnt go to the burn actually increases Dai adoption. If its more effective or not. Also its possible that from a future viewpoint we would have burned in hindsight more now with less revenue then with more revenue later because MKR price went up with Eth price after PoS and we need 10x the adoption to overcome the gap.

Having the burner only work at either 100% or 0% allows trades to front-run its reactivation. Having it run at partial capacity when the surplus buffer is close to the 3% of non-SC vaults recommended by the risk core unit fixes this problem.     krzkaczor:  As mentioned in my previous post, I believe that MakerDAO should refocus on aggressive growth. The easiest way to do that is to grow Surplus Buffer. Then, invest in new ways of making money while avoiding the risk of flop auctions.   The idea you have that the surplus buffer is preventing the protocol from growing is incorrect. Can you please point out to me the proposal that was voted down in favour of burning more MKR?  cap2114\u00d71232 256 KB  Note that Maker already has 20.6% of all assets in Defi. The majority of Makers revenue is earned from its extremely capital-intensive non-SC vaults. Nothing that maker protocol does will have a significant impact on its revenue from non-SC vaults. It has much more to do with the market cap of the assets that are being used to collateralize Dai and the interest rate people are willing to pay (external factors).    In defense of bigger Surplus Buffer   There is a ton of riskier activities that DAO can do:  onboard interest-bearing versions of existing tokens to allow leveraged farming - Abracadabra money style, deploy slave MCD instances not only on L2 chains but also on sidechains and other L1s - deploy on Polygon and tap into the retail market, enable more DAI Wormholes on riskier domains and improve DAI velocity and usefulness, enable the protocol to deploy liquidity where it\u2019s needed - ex. become L2 uniswap LP to help bootstrap DAI usage on a new domain,    Why would having a 65M buffer instead of a 250M prevent us from doing any of these things? Integration on L2s is already being worked on by multiple core units. Integration on other L1s has security concerns unrelated to the surplus buffer. Maker not having a larger surplus buffer is a terrible excuse for why we are not innovating faster. ",

It not might be worth spending resources to earn 2% on $65M buffer but it might be beneficial to do the same for 2% on $250M   Regarding your first point about interest-bearing versions of existing tokens and your point about L2s, I stand by what I said. Maybe the risk core team needed to look into whether or not there needs to be a higher sustainability fee on those vaults, but why would 65M SB not be enough? The entire point of L2s is that they are economically secure. We shouldn\u2019t need more SB to use them. Regarding what you\u2019re saying about L1s and side chains, I don\u2019t think this is something that Maker DAO should be trying. Saving up a large SB to earn 2% is grossly capital inefficient, not to mention it could end up costing YEARS of protocol revenue. Remember that DAI and USD lose value over time 2% is barely enough to keep up with inflation. It is better to use those funds to burn MKR, returning value to MKR holders so they can use it to make more than 2%.     krzkaczor:  Trust me, I know something about this.

The burning is the best thing for investors, otherwise, only the developers and the people very close to the project have to gain and the token holders are being left with a useless tokens. Stopping the burn was the biggest mistake this project has made, it starts to look more like Federal Reserve instead of letting the free market dictate the price \u2026 so what somebody bought tokens for a cheap price? Good for them, other will and come join the auction, more liquity will come, more bidders \u2026 free market has a tendency to fix itself, no need for human intervention all the time.

That is because the shares are actually a financial backstop. The market cap of MKR is in large part the security of the system. In exchange for the risk of sudden inflation, MKR holders need to be paid. What MKR holders earn is revenue, not profit. What if an excessive portion of MKR value is because there are so few dividend earning blue chips in crypto? What if a large portion of demand for DAI is the legitimacy and security afforded by having a high MKR market cap? Paying MKR holders was an original required part of the MakerDAO system, because in theory no one would want to hold something that could be inflated and had no other value proposition. MKR holders are insurers that need revenue in exchange for risking capital. Sure you can argue its a dividend earning share of a bank\u2026but its much more of a share of an insurance fund than a share of a company. The idea that a governance power once granted will be taken away in the future and turned into dividends is a weak assumption given human nature. Once you normalize a lack of revenue for people that secure the system it could be surprisingly hard to convince those with a budget to vote to give it up. So in addition to the \u2018its a required part of the system\u2019 argument, I also request consideration that it is a systemic risk to normalize removal of revenue for MKR holders because it could be difficult or impossible to undo because of incentive incompatibility. MKR holders offer stability by putting their capital at risk in exchange for a fee (revenue). As long as the supply trends down overall from 1 million and does so faster than opportunity cost, the system is working. Otherwise it trying to survive by imposing rent on speculators which is not sustainable. ",
