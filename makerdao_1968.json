Paragraph Summary MIP92 will onboard $100M of PSM USDC into a bespoke non-custodial Yearn Vault. Yearn Vault strategies are risk-adjusted and transparent at all times. Strategy allocation and composition in this bespoke vault are flexible. Assigned Yearn contributors will work closely with the relevant Maker Core Units as proposed in MIP92c5.  Component Summary MIP92c1: Yearn What is Yearn? MIP92c2: Yearn Vaults and Risk Management What are Yearn Vaults and how is risk managed? MIP92c3: Bespoke Maker Vault Composition What are the proposed strategies? MIP92c4: Vault Deployment, Integrations, and Migrations Describes deploying new vaults. MIP92c5: MIP92 Proposed Vault Controls Defines Proposed Vault Controls and describes how they may be amended by Maker Governance. MIP92c6: Fees Defines Yearn fees. MIP92c7: Alignment and Goals Light at the end of the tunnel for PSM allocation with the best risk-adjusted returns in DeFi.  Motivation MIP92 proposes using Yearn on-chain vaults to earn yield on idle USDC. The recent collapse of centralized entities such as Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX, among others, has made painfully clear the importance of transparency when depositing funds to generate yield\u2014something that DeFi, and specifically Yearn, are well-equipped to provide. Yearn is uniquely positioned to offer Maker yield-generation opportunities across its USDC reserves while empowering the Maker community to continually audit the exact location and amounts of any and all deposited assets. Yearn is an established and reputable organization that shares Maker\u2019s ideals around decentralization and safety. Yearn\u2019s risk-adjusted vaults are battle-tested (some v2 vaults are nearly 2 years old) and have handled an all-time high of $6.4 billion. Since then, Yearn Vaults have successfully unwound $6 billion with no loss of funds. Yearn aligns with Maker\u2019s safety-first strategy. Maker\u2019s use of Yearn Vaults will further validate the case for Decentralized Finance where safety and transparency matter most. Yearn has provided a risk-adjusted 2.16% APY average for the current USDC vault (deployed Oct 2021) at the time of this proposal.  Specification / Proposal Details   MIP92c1: Yearn Yearn is DeFi\u2019s premier yield aggregator giving individuals, DAOs, and other protocols a way to deposit digital assets and receive yield. Yearn was founded in the Summer of 2020 and quickly became known for the best risk-adjusted returns in DeFi with their core product Yearn Vaults. In addition to Yearn Vaults, Yearn contributors have created the DAO management tool Coordinape, the audit firm yAcademy, and assisted with the development of software tools like Ape-Safe, Apeworx, Vyper, Brownie, Gnosis, Robowoofy, ERC-4626, Weiroll-py, Disperse, Allowlist, yPriceMagic, and Serpentor. Yearn has also contributed to funding Gitcoin, LexPunk, and Nomic Labs. Yearn has presented on risk management and strategy creation at ETHCC, ETHDenver, ETHDubai, ETHAmsterdam, The Stanford Security Summit, and has been mentioned in research from Messari and Ark Invest. Yearn is maintained by a team of full-time contributors and is governed by the YFI token.  MIP92c2: Yearn Vaults and Risk Management  Vaults Yearn Vaults are capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. In 2021, Yearn Vaults had over $6 billion in contracts. Yearn Vaults are comprised of up to 20 strategies and are considered \u201cup-only\u201d, as they take no directional risk and have no unhedged exposure to impermanent loss. Additionally, strategies are able to accept large deposits with little slippage and they must pass the Yearn Risk Framework.  Controls Yearn Vaults use a 6-of-9 multi-signature wallet, made up predominantly of public figures in the DeFi community, along with two core Yearn team members. Yearn controls are not a requirement for your vault. However, you may want Yearn to have permissions for Operations Procedures including emergency situations.  The Yearn Risk Framework The Yearn Risk Framework (explained at the Stanford Security Summit) is modeled after risk management process in the aviation industry and uses eight key metrics for evaluation: TVL Impact, Third-party Audit Quality, Internal audit, Complexity, Longevity, Protocol Safety, Team Knowledge, and Testing. Yearn consistently receives top scores from third-party rating organizations like DeFi Safety. Yearn core contracts have been audited by multiple third-party firms. A full list of Yearn Strategy third-party audits is also available. Should users desire to verify/audit contracts for themselves, all code is verified on Etherscan or other explorers, GitHub repositories for all production code are public, and Yearn developers are always happy to answer questions as needed. Even with Yearn\u2019s extensive preparation for hacks and loss of funds through documentation and war room simulations, there is always a chance that funds are not recoverable. Yearn does not offer a guarantee on funds of any kind. Yearn is purely on-chain DeFi and risk must be managed accordingly.  MIP92c3: Bespoke Maker Vault Composition We propose working together in close communication to maintain vault strategies, allocations, and debt ratios based on Maker\u2019s desired risk profile. The Vault will be variable APY and we estimate a yield of ~2% APY or more at $100 million. The Maker vault will be unlisted and only able to be accessed by a Guest List defined by Maker. Here\u2019s an example of a similar unlisted vault we\u2019ve created for Inverse Finance with permissions identical to normal Yearn Vaults. Permissions and Vault Settings are customizable and proposed governance is found in MIP92c5.  Current Strategies Available in yvUSDC    Gen Lender: Supplies USDC to AAVE to generate interest. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more USDC which is deposited back into the strategy.  GUNIV3USDC-DAI: Supplies USDC to Maker DAO Peg Stability Module to feelessly get the correct USDC-DAI ratio then it deposits to Arrakis Finance\u2019s Univ3daiusdc Vault, which autocompounds a Uniswap v3 DAI-USDC position. Afterwards, it uses this Vault token as collateral at Maker DAO. Flashmints are used to mint DAI from MakerDAO to flashlend and fold the position, boosting the APY. Earned tokens are harvested and sold for more USDC, which is deposited back into the strategy.  GenLevComp v3: Supplies and borrows USDC on Compound Finance simultaneously to earn COMP. Flashmints are used to mint DAI from MakerDAO to flashlend and fold the position, boosting the APY. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more USDC which is deposited back into the strategy.  Notional Reinvest: Supplies USDC to Notional Finance for various maturities to earn a fixed-rate yield on USDC. At maturity, earned yield is harvested and deposited back into the strategy.  Angle Reinvest: Supplies USDC to Angle Protocol as a Standard Liquidity Provider for sanTokens which are staked to earn ANGLE. Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more USDC which is deposited back into the strategy.  Stargate USDC: Supplies USDC to Stargate Finance to earn STG. Earned tokens are harvested and sold for more USDC, which is deposited back into the strategy.  IdleV2: Supplies USDC to Idle Finance to earn IDLE and COMP. Earned tokens are harvested and sold for more USDC, which is deposited back into the strategy.  Yearn is always on the hunt for high-quality sources of yield. The above list is what\u2019s available today within our preferred risk profile. Strategies that will soon be added include Compound v3, Sturdy, and Interest Protocol lenders.  MIP92c4: Vault Deployment, Integrations, and Migrations  Integration Yearn will collaborate with the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES-001) or functionally equivalent Core Units on the best technical implementation. Implementation will only occur once a technical assessment has been presented to the community by the relevant Core Units.  Vault Migrations and Potential Upgrades Vault migrations will happen. We will give you plenty of warning for these. When the time comes, we\u2019ll work to unwind the desired amount from strategies to make liquid for the migration to the new vault. Liquidity is a top prerequisite when creating strategies. If market conditions allow, strategies are made liquid instantly.  Locks Notional Reinvest mentioned in MIP92c3 is the only strategy with a lock on it. The vault today has a small allocation.  MIP92c5: MIP92 Proposed Vault Controls The MIP92 Proposed Vault Controls defines the process to change a Vault Setting. For instance, changing the Deposit Limit, adding a Strategy, or updating the debtRatio for strategies. It is proposed that the vault is under the sole control of Maker Governance. There will be no vault control by Yearn Governance. Four methods can be used to change a Vault Setting:  A proposal by a Core Unit Facilitator with a relevant mandate. A valid Parameter Proposal Group recommendation to change a Vault Setting. A MIP92c5 subproposal. Urgent or emergency changes may utilize the process defined in MIP24.  MIP92c5 subproposals have the following requirements and may enter the Weekly Governance Cycle.  Minimum Feedback Period: 2 weeks. Minimum Frozen Period: 1 week.  MIP92c5 subproposals must use the following template: # MIP92c5: Vault Setting Amendment Subproposal  ## Preamble  MIP92c5-SP#: <assigned by MIP Editor> Author(s): Contributors: Tags: template Status: <assigned by MIP Editor> Date Proposed: <yyyy-mm-dd> Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>  ## Specification  ### Proposed Changes  - Specify the proposed changes  ### Motivation  - Explain why you think the Vault Setting should be changed. - Explain why the proposed value has been chosen.  ### Relevant Information  - Links to evidence further backing the motivation, if relevant.  Urgent or emergency changes to a Vault Setting may utilize the process defined in MIP24.      Vault permissions are customizable and Yearn is able and willing to participate in vault governance and [operations procedures](https://docs.yearn.finance/developers/v2/OPERATIONS) if that is desired as a result of MIP92.   MIP92c6: Fees Yearn has only a 20% performance fee on each harvest. Fees are decided on by yRates, governed by YFI. Right now there are no future fee changes planned. To get in touch, please contact [email\u00a0protected]e. Vault fees can be checked at any time on Yearn Watch.  MIP92c7: Alignment and Goals We understand Maker is very conservative and we align with that perspective. We will work with CES, Risk, Strategic Finance, and any other desired Maker Core Units to clearly define risk exposure and take appropriate action. Our goal for this program above all else is to execute it safely. Yearn Vaults are battle-tested and have been in production for over a year. We\u2019ve developed extensive documentation about Protocol Risk, Risk Scores, Strategy Risk, Vault Risk, Operations, and Emergency Procedures. We are excited about the possibility of working with Maker to earn yield on funds in the PSM, and being able to do so transparently and on-chain. We see this proposal as a first step toward a long-term partnership between Maker and Yearn. ",

While intuition would suggest that adding 3x the current vault TVL would greatly compress yields, this is neglecting that Yearn\u2019s vaults feed into a variety of protocols with their own various TVL and yield. For strategies currently attached to the vault, here are the current APRs and TVLs for each protocol, with the bottom two strategies currently under review.     Protocol APR USDC TVL     Stargate 3.75% $60m   Maker gUni 3.26% $235m   Lev Comp v2 2.16% $330m   Notional 2.63% $25m   Angle 2.41% $13m   Aave 1.06% $935m   Comp v3 1.83% $160m   Euler 2.32% $91m    It\u2019s also important to note that while the initial proposal is for $100m, we envision this product capable of handling far more. For instance, the Lev Comp strategy would still yield 1.36% APR even if it alone received an additional $80m (up to $100m total), and it\u2019s clear from the table above that many other protocols could take on considerable funds with yield staying at or above 2% APR. Furthermore, as other protocols and strategies arise, Yearn and Maker can work together to decide if they are acceptable sources of yield for Maker. ",

If that was not the case, Maker itself would have just deployed large capital into Maker gUni or to deploy even larger amounts to Compound and AAVE rather than pursuing higher yields on Traditional Finance.In fact, in this way, it\u2019s less risk from Maker and also more profitable as the protocol doesn\u2019t have to pay 20% performance fee and also does not have exposure to newer and riskier DeFi protocols.     mil0x:  Concerning the YFI collateral, we have recently released the Maker-v3-YFI-A strategy (GitHub - mil0xeth/Maker-v3: Let\u2019s draw some Dai together.) into the production YFI yearn vault (yvYFI) on yearn.finance.

Wanted to chime in from the perspective of a third (much smaller) external protocol that integrates DAI. I oppose this proposal from a risk perspective. DeFi yield farming is primarily driven by token incentives (of steadily diminishing value) and does not represent an attractive and scalable path for Maker. Major primary venues like Aave and Compound can make sense for D3M, especially if demand in the venue has remained stable without incentives like on Aave. The other venues considered for the vault are not appropriate from risk and liquidity perspectives, especially Stargate. In general MakerDAO should avoid allocating to venues and instruments with substantially less organic liquidity than DAI itself, as its primary goal remains to ensure the strong liquidity of DAI at peg while sourcing yield is the secondary objective.

If that was not the case, Maker itself would have just deployed large capital into Maker gUni or to deploy even larger amounts to Compound and AAVE rather than pursuing higher yields on Traditional Finance.In fact, in this way, it\u2019s less risk from Maker and also more profitable as the protocol doesn\u2019t have to pay 20% performance fee and also does not have exposure to newer and riskier DeFi protocols.  Hi @Doo_StableLab ! It seems that you are worried about risk / reward ratio. The idea of this proposal is to scale it up slowly. We don\u2019t recommend deploying 100M USDC overnight. That way, we can work together to choose the right strategies for Maker\u2019s risk profile.  Considering Yearn team itself hasn\u2019t allocated more due to \u201caccording to internal security allocation monitoring, as we take security very seriously\u201d, why is the team asking the Maker protocol to pursue something that own team\u2019s security team is not yet sure about? I believe it\u2019s only fair that once the yearn team itself believes the strategy is profitable and secure, the Maker community should consider it as well. Currently, the fee for YFI vault is 1% and which is less than half of APY the proposal is assuming that the strategy can yield.  Same as above. We take security very seriously and that\u2019s why we are scaling up that strategy very slowly. In the last 5 days, the amount of YFI as collateral increased to more than double. We are going slowly because of the recent volatility and this is a brand-new strategy with all the latest optimizations we are using at Yearn.

                    "content": "I just happened to be looking at this thread.   Dealing with various return seeking strategies with different DAOs and perhaps can lend some perspective. Two major market shifts occurring that are affecting yields.  High inflation pretty much world wide (last time world saw inflation in 8-15% ranges was 40 years ago now).   This is leading to significant asset re-allocations generally and starting to put some crunches on refinancing of debt generally Significantly Reduced crypto Market Cap (was what 3-4T now < 1T) pretty much reducing demand for leverage also hitting trading volumes.  There is also what I call a significant horizontal broadening of crypto space both by network, and by protocol.   Simplest way I can put this is that 1/4 previous crypto value basically has 10x the places to go and is creating fee/cash flow crunches in a lot of places.  There are other negatives weighing on crypto right now, and negative inflation pressures in TradFI that are leading to a general take money from crypto and put it into TradFI approach which is due to the fact that TradFI is now offering higher returns than in the DeFI. I don\u2019t see this trend getting better. There are some good comments above regarding whether the investor trying to manage the investment manager, or whether to simply invest in a well defined portfolio approach and allowing the investment manager to perform.    A general investment approach is to diversify and I feel like Yearn could allow for some diversification but I don\u2019t see where Maker gets that since the above Yearn proposal has large allocations in AAVE (Maker has D3M), and GUNI (where GUNI represents 10% of the vault portfolio). I just don\u2019t see where the additional diversification comes in here, nor how the return for the work makes sense. In the past I have wanted to see deeper Maker partnerships with Gnosis, Matic, Nexo, even Celcius (ugg) where we helped build trading liquidity depth for communties via Uni v2 Token-DAI pairs that could be used to borrow DAI but these ideas never went anywhere. Each time I see these communities approach Maker I want to know not just what Maker can do for you, but what you can do for Maker.   These kinds of deals should be done perhaps with greater visions of networking to cross build platforms vs. this we use you, you might use us dependent relationships. I also want to point out something here about PSMs generally.   People seem to have this idea that Maker has USDC to do what it wants with but unless Maker Mechanics have dramatically (or will) change the process to access PSM stable coins is for someone via some collateral to mint DAI and swap it for stables.   Since stables is the collateral to mint DAI (or any other PSM stablecoin for that matter) to get the stable you need DAI.   In this sense it seems what Yearn is asking for is Maker to open up a yvUSDC vault and mint $1 yvUSDC to $1 DAI.   I will leave details of how to do this to CES and PE but just want to note to people that as far as I know Maker works all accounting mechanics in DAI not in USDC, USDP, GUSD, etc.   The point here is that at any time, for any reason, access to PSMs may no longer be \u2018free\u2019 and/or there may not be liquidity to go from DAI to USDC, USDP, or GUSD.   Fortunately as long as PSMs are open, and fee free going from USDC, USDP, GUSD, etc. to DAI is pretty easy the reverse not so much. My real questions here are as follows:  Cost or need for Oracles on yvUSDC Cost on resources to do this (fixed and ongoing to manage) Amount to dedicate at what return to cover (2) much less generate any profit. Risks of this vs. just spreading out into more RWA Not a fan of EndGame (as people know) but how does this fit into EndGame strategy.  Does it?  ",

I am not sure about these costs to be honest. Maybe this is something we\u2019d need to cover in more detail with the Maker team.   The benefit of DeFi is transparency and that everything we do is on-chain. You will always be able to see what these strategies are doing with your USDC. The downside of course is the lack of legal recourse if something were to happen and this risk also exists for RWA borrowers as we\u2019ve seen recently. Legal recourse is ineffective if the money is gone.   I don\u2019t know enough about EndGame and I\u2019d like to learn more.

Nevertheless, we recommend a cautious approach towards risk taking, where each strategy is carefully analyzed to the point where all risks and exposures are specified and well understood. While the current on-chain yield environment is suboptimal especially when compared to traditional financial benchmarks, we believe that such a module is valuable enough to justify allocating resources towards it, as risk/reward profile will most likely improve in the future. We believe that Yearn is the right partner for Maker in this regard, as they are well known industry leaders with major contributions towards the category of yield generating strategies and DeFi in general. Yearn is the most battle tested yield generating protocol in DeFi space. The MIP certainly takes Maker\u2019s well being into account, as the proposal is clearly synergistic, considers specific needs of our community and can be tailored in terms of available strategies and their utilization, exposure towards specific strategy and the fee schedule & sharing can be adjusted and is subject of the debate. As it was said before by other community members, preferably the module would be designed similarly to the current D3M deployments, where exposure is either limited by the debt ceiling or the effective yield, but to our understanding this is currently not possible or would require significantly more engineering resources. The mechanics of D3M could be manually replicated by MOMC, Risk CU or some other group, proposing parameters when needed within the limitations allowed by the governance. In the case where the community believes capacity for on-chain exposure is a valuable add to the protocol, Risk CU would be happy to collaborate with other CUs and Yearn to specify all the details of the module, including but not limited to strategies, exposure towards specific strategy, exposure towards the module as a whole and the process of management and potential future further development such as implementing new strategies or underlying assets when available.

But the analysis is not as simple as 1% yield/100 year time frame catastrophe.  You need to factor in the lost opportunities from receiving -zero- return.  Imagine if we today had 1% from three Billion of the PSM for one year - 30,000,000 USDC or DAI.  What opportunities were lost without that 30,000,000?  What CU would not have had to be cut but rather expanded, what growth or marketing could have been done, etc.?  How much less is the three Billion worth in relation to inflation particularly with -zero- return? ",

Not only do nearly all comments here seem to completely miss the point, but they all seem to come from absolutely different worldviews and ideas on what MakerDAO itself should be, or what the point of MakerDAO even is. Only MakerMan seems to come in with the right approach - which is that this is not really comparable to any of the off-chain semi-liquid deals happening with Gemini, Coinbase - this is basically going back to MakerDAOs bread-and-butter.  This is new collateral This is a new collateral type, in this case yvUSDC. Thus it should first go through the paths of other similar suggestions for new collateral.  This is DeFi collateral, not CeFi When taking into account risks, remember that this is defi collateral. It is liquidatable 24/7 and can be liquidated via automated means with whatever rules we set. This is leagues better compared to slower semi-liquid CeFi options Maker is currently using.  Yearn\u2019s brand, Speed What a joke to suggest Yearn is bad because they ship slow. This is the whole freaking point. When we talk about this amount of money we are not looking to invest in the newest and brightest - capital preservation is still the no.1 goal here.  Yearn\u2019s Responses @corn\u2019s answer on no oracles shows high naivety. Individual strategies used by the vault can be exploited and thus the value of the vault can go down in chunks. As token-based yields compress, in the future strategies used by the vault might be variable returns, which again means oracles are needed. Addiitonally, not being in the loop about the end game is not excusable. If you are trying to play the DeFi buddy buddy game, at least be knowledgeable of the other gigantic DeFi blue-chip and their latest developments. Currently this all just seems like \u201cHey Makerdao is giving out USDC to invest, we should get some\u201d - while the way this should go is \u201cHey MakerDAO is setting the steps out to define its future cashflow generation, and we believe Defi should play a part in that and Yearn would be the best partner to collaborate with on that front\u201d ",

                    "content": "Hey JWizard thank you for the comments and reading through all this. You have a lot of good points. I read my response about oracles again and I want to add something here: We don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for budgeting for oracles like @makerman suggested because of pricePerShare. pricePerShare gives the price for a single Vault share and acts as the oracle of total assets/outstanding shares. If pricePerShare goes down, it means value of the vault has gone down and there\u2019s an issue or exploit. I was reading through Endgame Asset & Liabilities Management Technical Design and I think there are some useful implications here. When I wrote this originally, you\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t intend for this to be applied to D3M V3. If there are other prerequisites to meet we\u2019ll work with Maker CU\u2019s to come up with a solution that aligns with Endgame. I\u2019m sorry if this proposal reads like we\u2019re throwing something at the wall. We\u2019re not. We prepared this proposal from the perspective that if earning yield on PSM USDC is important to Maker, as well as aligning with DeFi-native ways to earn yield, then Yearn Vaults are viable. I leaned into what Yearn vaults are quite a bit, and the frameworks Yearn has in place to manage risk. You\u2019re right though, I could have mentioned more about why going back to the bread-and-butter should be important to Maker. ",

If passed, this MIP will onboard up to 100M USDC from the USDC PSM into a bespoke unlisted Yearn vault. The Vault will generate yield at a variable APY. It is estimated that the APY will be around 2% or higher with 100M USDC invested in it. A list of investment strategies that the vault might adopt is proposed. Choices of which strategies to pursue, deposit limits, debt ratios, and corresponding risk profiles are controlled by Maker Governance. Yearn Vault collateral is controlled by a 6-of-9 multisig wallet with the signatories being well-known figures in DeFi. Maker may either choose this setup or a different solution. The author recommends that Yearn still have permissions for operations procedures, including emergency situations. Yearn charges a 20% performance fee. The fee rates may be changed through Yearn Governance but no changes are currently planned. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

We are really happy about the willingness to use Yearn vaults and we want to be a great partner to Maker. On MIP92, this will give back up to 25% of the fees Yearn generates each month up to $100 million TVL. Fee sharing scales up to 50% once you hit over $1 billion TVL. Fees are paid out each month. This will mean Yearn\u2019s fees are reduced to as low as 15% in MIP92 and as low as 10% beyond that. You can check out the fee sharing table here: Partnership Program | Yearn.finance Even though the proposal is live I want to make sure you all know we\u2019re committed to fee sharing for MIP92 because we know this will help us grow together. If you have any questions please let me know. ",
