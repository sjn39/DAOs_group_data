My general impression thus far is that most proposals are a mixed bag, with very few high-quality projects I\u2019d be excited to support without reservations. Since Optimism is a new collective & ecosystem, I have been very lenient as I\u2019ve thought it\u2019s OK to give mediocre or unproven protocols the benefit of doubt. Of course, over the 4 cycles I have become gradually more strict about my votes. For Season 2, I\u2019ll only be voting for proposals by a) protocols that have proven themselves over a reasonable period of time (e.g. >1 year); b) have a very clear case for incentivizing usage directly on Optimism, and c) a co-incentives program with an amount you can safely match (I don\u2019t want to see a $5M market cap project asking for 500,000 OP). Of course, there can be exceptional proposals which contribute to the Optimism ecosystem another way. I realize this is going to be unpopular, and I\u2019m going to receive some hate mail, but that\u2019s OK. I believe granting of $OP tokens through Gov Fund must be earned, rather than being a bet. There are other funds like the Seed Fund or RPGF that may be more appropriate for a lot of proposals. I also continue to be very uncomfortable granting OP tokens and building an ecosystem while Optimism is a de-facto centralized sidechain, just with 7 days of social disputes available. I\u2019d like to see Optimism urgently have a) permissionless fraud proofs, b) decentralized contract upgradability, including emergency. I\u2019d only be truly comfortable when we also have decentralized sequencers and economic sustainability for $OP. I\u2019m not going to do anything drastic like protest by voting everything Against, however I\u2019ll be much more careful with my votes until Optimism itself is in an acceptable place. I\u2019d like to see the OP Labs and Optimism Foundation teams provide a detailed roadmap update on where they are with the above-mentioned decentralization goals. I generally agree with the learnings and steps being taken for Season 2 and look forward to participating in the discussions during the Reflection Period \u2122. I also hope to see some accountability and results data for previously approved proposals around this time. ",

On the bright side, this has also calmed my fears of too much growth with centralization concerns - for now. Nevertheless, even without growth, it\u2019s still a useful mechanism for distributing OP to enthusiast users and decentralizing the token house. Now that we are 7 cycles and over a quarter in, I\u2019d request commitees to start considering the results of previous incentives in greater depth.

                    "content": "For projects that have already received a grant before (whether through Gov or Partners Fund) - the repeat proposal has to be exceptional IMO. I don\u2019t think the second proposal basically repeating the first one makes much sense. Here are my thoughts on the exceptions where a second grant may work:  The first grant was wildly successful and the protocol continues to grow with no slowdown: in this case, a substantially smaller grant (let\u2019s say, <50% of the first) to continue incentives might be justified Some amount of time has passed since the first grant, and there\u2019s a strong reason to restart incentives (something like - the protocol managed to retain most of the growth the incentives brought, but there are new opportunities on the horizon worth capitalizing on for more growth) A new approach with new methods & goals. E.g. the first grant was about liquidity incentives. With that bootstrapped, the second grant can be about achieving something different, e.g. improving the user experience, direct marketing to onboard users to Optimism, etc.  Likewise, as I mentioned previously, committees should also consider the effectiveness of similar types of proposals. E.g. if DEX A & DEX B ran some type of liquidity mining, and it was of limited benefit, then it doesn\u2019t make sense granting DEX C with the same type of grant. At Cycle 8, 9, and going forward, we have to start being more selective about the grants, and targeting the types of programs that lead to sustained adoption and activity across a diversity of usecases. Also, being mindful of what the bottlenecks are. E.g. there\u2019s plenty of liquidity on Optimism now given it\u2019s early state, but not enough users & other usecases to leverage this. ",

As such, we should be very wary of second grants, and especially, third grants - no doubt the ones who had second grants successfully pass will come back for thirds quickly after the second runs out. Particularly for TVL-centric incentives, all it really does is subsidize users to keep their money on Optimism, and they\u2019ll go elsewhere once the subsidies inevitably run out. To be clear, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to use large grants to distribute tokens anyway, even if it\u2019s actually economically illogical to do so.

Particularly for TVL-centric incentives, all it really does is subsidize users to keep their money on Optimism, and they\u2019ll go elsewhere once the subsidies inevitably run out.   My understanding of what you\u2019re saying here is as follows:  OP spends a lot on incentives relative to fee generation. That\u2019s fine if we\u2019ve shown growth. But we haven\u2019t shown enough growth in these grants. In several cases where protocols have claimed growth from their grants [which frequently targeted TVL], that growth is illegitimate and unsustainable \u2013 so this is an inefficient use of OP.  The Grants Council is going to be weighing in on what sorts of growth outcomes we\u2019d like to see, which makes this an opportune moment to think through them. I respect you greatly and think it would make your statement above more actionable to add what you believe does constitute legitimate, sustainable, timely, or otherwise useful growth. I haven\u2019t yet seen a convincing argument for why repeated grants are per se a bad thing. My position is that we should be encouraging repeat grants because this sort of structure allows for rapid testing and course correction and directs applicants to regard them more as for discrete projects rather than as handouts to their team. Certainly the same subsidy can continue to unlock new growth opportunities as market or ecosystem conditions warrant. I\u2019d love to have this discussion if you\u2019re willing. We can start a new thread for the sake of keeping this one neat. ",

However, right now sequencer revenue does not directly relate to $OP (correct me if I am wrong,  am basing this on the usecases shared in the help centre article). So, while it\u2019s true that sequencer revenue is the only real way Optimism might accrue value directly, it\u2019s still an indirect proxy for correlation, since currently $OP is not affected by network activity like Ether is, nor does the revenue somehow re-enter the collective treasury like in some DeFi tokens. Currently, grants and other foundation-related activities (like quests and airdrop speculation) have mainly targeted increasing and chain activity  and TVL, where the figures look a lot less dire than revenue vs spending. Personally, I think that as long as future allocations focus on stickier incentives, I don\u2019t mind this strategy being kept, but I would also like to see other methods of revenue sustainaibility     polynya:  Happy to discuss this further. I don\u2019t think repeat grants are a bad thing - but if you see my comment here it\u2019s only a good thing if the grant\u2019s mechanisms have been deemed to be working in incrementing growth. My beef is more with the repeat grants which are a carbon copy of the first grant, but all it really does is maintain status quo. So, I think we mostly agree.   Got nothing to add here, agreed with you and @jackanorak that multiple iterative grants are better than either one monolithic grant, or a grant simply asking for more of the same. ",

                    "content": "I fully agree from my experience over the past few months. We have run a few very small OP token distribution programs to test the waters. Ultimately it was a big waste of time and energy having to manually approve each person for their proof of work entry to prove they were authentic. A lot of multiple accounts were created in an effort to farm the OP rewards which we distributed from our personal accounts with zero grant assistance. On the other hand our free NFT claim system using Galxe or Quest3 has proven to be an incredible tool for attracting users to layer 2 networks. We have had around 100,000 free claims on L2 in the past 4 months since starting the experience. Some these claims requires the participation of being a holder or making a purchase from one of our designated collections just like the OP quests required which helps retain the users within our ecosystem. On the other hand we also offer multiple claims for simple off chain & on chain tasks that are completed as an effective way to educate the user about the project during the claim process. We have also utilized this as a cross promotion for Optimism, Lattice, and Quix with amazing results to help grow the ecosystem. Which requires users to follow their social pages or even join the projects official discord server as a task to claim the free NFT. I feel this methodology can continue to be iterated on by many creators or protocols at once creating a buzz on Optimism network due to heavy migration and activity attracting other creators or developers to the network. Without the activity on chain Optimism\u2019s growth may become stagnant as users continue to rely on the chain solely as a financial resource with a potential airdrop now that the quests have ended. Currently we are faced with inflation in OP token price prior to the event as more speculation occurs and the only thing left for all these users from the quests to do is buy more tokens in preparation to sell off after the airdrop leveraging their position with current tokens being accumulated. It seems the quests provide a way for users to feel they have accomplished on chain activity for a potential airdrop without any sense of desperation occurring. Token distribution to grow the network is also great but it certainly does need to be improved upon and have more retention built into the framework of these grants to ensure that users do not simply claim the OP, dump it, and leave the network. Every protocol that does OP token rewards should also put out some sort of NFT claim system related to the OP token distribution if that is what the main factor is for user activity to continue growing. I myself want to see more focus on the retention of decentralized financial institution users at the protocol level using NFTs. The NFT & Gaming sector has a very long road ahead before gaining any sort of notoriety from the rest of the blockchain world. What better way to help fuel that movement of growth than asking the protocols that receive grants to implement a similar program. ",

Despite not agreeing with all takeaways as it\u2019s too early to call initiatives a good or bad idea (Execution!), we can already tell that focused grants to top projects have a big short-term impact and we should run smaller, much shorter experiments, and more clearly scoped grants to derive more learnings. It\u2019s no surprise that some highly flawed retroactive grants were not successful & user onboarding has generally been slow and expensive when there is very little general user interest in crypto Sustainability and long-term success of each of the grant proposals is yet to be seen. There is lots of entitlement from proposers and high Asks justified by previous grants instead of looking at marginal value added and long-term value Grant rounds have been rushed. There should rather be continuous grants & different tiers with varying requirements for applicants depending on the size of the grants.     [REVIEW] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Overnight.fi V2   For proposals, we\u2019d expect to follow more or less the following template  Current Price  30-day TWAP should be pretty fair, updated when it moves to voting 7-day TWAP at payout day would be better; but would require Ask in USD & Foundation input   Comparable Proposals / Project Size / Return for the Optimism ecosystem  -10K USD: Instant grants for small tools, bounty work, etc. 10K-50K USD: Small grants for teams/startups/dev funding 50-300K USD: Growth program for early-stage, smallcap project with significant value-add 300K-1M USD: Onboarding top teams/projects, co-initiatives w/ significant growth expectations 1M+ USD: Exceptional growth opportunities    Obv would be great to judge proposals purely by outcomes but many are early stage, public goods, nice-to-have tools and outcomes will be multi-dimensional (team, liquidity, user, building block onboarding, etc.).   Current Stage of the market & Optimism  Crypto is not a sprint but a marathon \u2013 despite some investors claiming otherwise in bull markets. We know 5-15 of the top crypto teams today. It\u2019s early days but we expect some of them to continue to outperform while completely new teams will join and overtake tier 2, 3 projects. Optimism is a $200M marketcap project. The grant amounts signal it\u2019s a Multi-$B project already. Crypto has the lowest trade volume in a long time and top projects, for example DEXs, have not yet fully moved to Optimism. Therefore, current market shares and the long-term importance of projects should not be overstated. ( \u2192 Avoid drawing premature, wrong conclusions)  Questions: Phase 1 Evaluation & Strategy going forward  Politics & Governance Theatre  Lots of unnecessary debates are tiresome & turn off genuine contributors Real goals (great product, ecos, Op, impact) are consequently not central in the Op ecosystem   Expensive traction  Optimism bought some initial traction in this market; some liquidity & users will stay for a while There are few dedicated builders & innovative apps onboarded to Optimism so far   Stop the waste  There should be ongoing grants run by a dedicated vehicle with some autonomy & clear KPIs (we like public discourse but in Op it\u2019s ineffective to say the least; OP will be siphoned away) Projects should not benefit from multiple grants at the same time (Don\u2019t give a grant to a project for DEX liquidity and to a DEX for DEX liquidity incl. that token pair\u2026) Long-term, continous incentive distributions are not effective (Why are there still projects ineffectively incentivizing user liquidity on an Uni v2 fork with insig. trade volume each day?) Run small, lean experiments (2-6 weeks marketing, incentives, etc.) Don\u2019t overoptimize meme KPIs such as TVL. Liquidity is key but a moving target if not effective.   Important decisions: Focus ( \u2192 Sustainable growth)  Is this the right time to focus on liquidity/user incentives or dev grants? What is the right vehicle for diff grants and support programs? Which incentive designs are best? ( \u2192 new Op Foundation team, should collab with ecos ) Do you want to give first-movers to Optimism more advantages/funds now? Do you think that will pay off more or might it potentially hurt long-term adoption? What are the top projects that contribute most today, in 3y to OP? What is the biggest value-add from different stakeholders on Optimism? How to optimize that? Do you want ecosystem teams to opt-in to lock-ins at this early stage of Optimism? What\u2019s the best way to incentivize future growth of projects & communities in the OP ecosystem?    We think Optimism (Gov) should double down on the most important ecosystem stakeholders in the long-term but focus on clearly scoped incentives in the near-term!  Early movers require bigger incentives than late adopters (Grant Amounts, APYs, etc.). There is no need to overoptimize this though as opportunists, yield hunters, grant hunters today will likely not add unique, sustainable value but hurt future, potentially bigger contributing projects. This means Optimism should more carefully look at marginal value added from projects & proposals from now on and put an additional focus on onboarding the best teams. This gov fund can & should be utilized for liquidity goals as much as for onboarding important building blocks, top teams, adding users, communities, building public goods Offering top teams 2-5% of the total gov fund in the next 5 years can pay off!  Velodrome Example: Why 4 MILLION OP is a way too large Ask for Velo today *  Incentivizing partially idle sitting TVL & high farming rewards to certain parties (early partners in the Velo ecosystem) will not offer as much return for OP today as it can in a bull market. Velodrome played a significant role in onboarding projects. The economics offer some lock-in for partners to Velo & Optimism. This can help with kickstarting the ecosystem but we are not convinced that the protocol is competitive in the long-term with the most efficient DEXs. Op should be careful of incentivizing liquidity & lock-in at this point as it will hurt projects, Op efficiency, users. There are positive signs with Velo but we don\u2019t see a full-scale liquidity flywheel taking off. Quite a few of those positive signs (for example user activity) can be attributed to the central positioning in the ecosystem, the previous grant and the resulting support for more protocols than other projects. Spending almost 2% on liquidity incentives (TVL growth) of 1 DEX project should lead to activity & sustainable growth with high certainty. Currently, many DEXs are starting liquidity incentives on Optimism, effectively competing for the same USD. Optimism needs to find the best use of funds - not favor one over others & potentially lose in the long-term. If Optimism doesn\u2019t have certainty on the best use, Optimism should run smaller scale experiments until we know. We can compare Velodrome to Sushi\u2019s Onsen pools (at the time: Uni v2) to onboard & bootstrap new projects to Optimism. Consequently, it would make sense to give Velodrome another, smaller grant to enable them to keep onboarding more teams & pools (don\u2019t focus too much on lockup & liquidity incentives) while making sure to also welcome and better onboard Uni, Arrakis, Curve, Sushi & Co to Optimism and building an ecosystem-wide liquidity plan. Without going into more detail, the mentioned co-incentives are directly bought with Op. Lots of projects got an OP grant to run incentives on Velo. Now Velo asks 4M OP (100K+ OP/week) to match their bribes or build liquidity. This is not how you grow an ecosystem. In our opinion, a grant of 500K OP would go a long way in onboarding new projects.  *We don\u2019t understand how a committee can Abstain. That said, won\u2019t engage in further Velo discussions.

Socket - Yes Following recommendation, adjusted Ask is reasonable, top cross-chain aggregator with Lifi and similar, good focus on onboarding builders & users. Ethernaut - Yes Great dev onboarding proposal, adjusted Ask + top-up is a good approach. Tally Ho - Yes Reasonable proposal to drive users to Optimism. Ambire - Yes Reasonable proposal to drive users to Optimism, slight lack in clarity. Messari - No Interesting proposal but expensive, would like to see comparable Defillama proposal. Defillama - No Top team, should be incentivized to prioritize Optimism but proposal lacks detail. Agora - Yes Small proposal that can add value to governance on Optimism. Mochi - Yes Unique app, solid proposal w/ focus on onboarding users & retaining new stakeholders. Other notes   Saw a comment re: similar proposals in different phases: Generally agree that Optimism governance needs to be more careful about marginal value added from here on. In the case of wallets, we see significantly different use bases & are in favor of strong incentives to help them start using Optimism (if incentives are implemented in a solid way incl. sybil-resistance).*   Not all recommendations (for example from tooling committee) are live yet. We have already voted but the snapshot was taken down again. Will check back later & possibly adjust voting if there is additional, good input from committees that we missed or surprises on Snapshot.   We voted & will vote again with our new Delegate Address: Superdelegate.eth. ScaleWeb3.eth will not be usable again due to the l1 multisig setup we have. ",

We specifically look forward towards tooling around new OP primitives (Think: attestation station), \u201claunching\u201d Op chains, tracking, general \u201ctools\u201d for different stakeholder segments (incl. OP devs, cross-chain builders, investors, governance followers/voters etc.) Grants Council - Growth: Stablenode, Gfx, Flipside, Michael Van der Meiden, JackAnorak We picked these 5 as most of them have been central actors in Optimism governance and provided good input to grants evaluations before. We also like the differentiated perspectives on \u201cwhat makes good grants\u201d and \u201cgrant focus for Optimism\u201d. Combined this looks very comprehensive and we see decent overlap with our own understanding of the next phase of grants. We mainly look forward to  no incentive dumps for inflated KPIs & general overpayment (clearly scoped grants & results) ongoing, yet more specific support & collabs with top projects (follow-up on previous grants) small-scale rapid experiments with solid tracking & learnings, a.o.t. general growth approaches for the Op ecosystem such as education, reach, marketing channels, very promising projects or mini-apps (caveat: new retail investors from outside crypto should not be main target now) investments into new areas w/ potentially significant value-add &or network effects (e.g. attestation \u2192 identity \u2192 social score \u2192 lending/game app impact; DeFi L2 such as Uniswap \u2192 concentrated liquidity \u2192 options \u2192 trading apps; packaging of staked Eth yields, zkApps on top of Optimism) onboarding of quality people (define small projects; collaborative research/builder projects)  Protocol Delegation (in this order): Ens, Lifi, Connext, Thales, Kyber, Paraswap, dHedge, Agora  These projects are built by long-term Web 3 builders whom we want to see more closely on/with Optimism (intentionally didn\u2019t include all SNX projects or Velodrome to broaden the ecosystem) Some of the projects have solid, active governance (ENS, SNX overall) while others are just getting started. The former can provide learnings, the latter may offer fresh perspective on governance topics & implement learnings in own governance systems (win for projects, OP & crypto) Overall, don\u2019t expect specific protocol vote to make a big difference but we hope to see long-term effects of this protocol delegation experiment. (Protocols should find more and more reasons why they should be more actively involved in Optimism & want to accrue more influence in Optimism)  (As our Superdelegate address doesn\u2019t have any OP delegated currently and we can\u2019t use the ScaleWeb3 address, you won\u2019t see any official vote from us in this cycle.)

This time there was lot of confusion.   Would be great if delegate(s) took some of their time and provide feedback before the proposal goes to voting, I have see that many project(s) are quite active on their proposal, seeking feedback and willing to update and amend their proposal depending the feedback from users/delegates. What\u2019s the point of giving suggestion when proposal is live, the project team cant amend the suggestion even if they want to, jumping it at the last moment is not helping anyone.   There should be at least 24hr cool down period before bringing proposals to voting, during this time the responsibility will be on project team to make sure that their proposal is adhering to all the requirement and is ready for voting, if they miss to do so, they will be accountable rather than OP Team or delegates.   This one is for me but would like to mention, delegate should be precise in their word when providing their support to a proposal.   We need some active participation from OP team on discord gov channel, during Phase 1, I had few queries related to couple of proposal, I did post them on discord gov general channel but did not got any response from team. Again, as a delegate, its my responsibility to make a judgement call but little help here and there could help me make a better decision.   If project submitting a proposal is not willing to submit a report on their last phase spending sighting extra and unnecessary work, I expect that OP Team should provide us with such a report. This is again just for me, I am not asking other do the same or suggesting on making this a rule but I am willing to invest my time looking at those report so that a. I can make better decision on the basis of those report. b. I would like to make sure that funds are being used properly ie. accountability.   This is to the team submitting the proposal focusing on LP and airdrop, on \u201cwhy the users will stay once incentives are over\u201d; these two are my favorite line a. users will come for incentive and stay for the product b. we believe our project has this and this to offer and users will stay because of this I request you to understand this, those using L2 as their main chain to do their transaction, we dont need someone to tell us about a unique and innovative project, its vice versa, we are looking for them. If I am using a platform just because of an incentive, I will use it as long as incentive exist but on the other hand I will continue to use if the platform is self-sustainable and rewarding me for using it, OP incentive are just a boost, if you need an extra incentive to sustain your project, you need to re-think your stagey. Again, my opinion, highly dependent on individual.   See you all in Phase 2. Cheers! ",

In Phase 1, we are providing our reasoning on why we are voting yes/no which is good to have and we should continue this. I want to discuss the timing, from my experience, if I only give feedback at end of 3 months, I will see the improvement in next quarter but if I share it as I see a scope of improvement, I can see the changes in next days/week. Similarly, can we work on giving the feedback at early stage so that the project team can improve their proposal before it goes for voting. Think from the project team side, they are active on the forum, spending their time, seeking input, feedback, answering users comment and most important willing to improve their proposal depending on the input. Now, if you only provide feedback at the end when they cant amend their proposal even if they want, what the point of that feedback. Feedback is like a medicine, it works best when given at right time. I feel sympathy with project team and I share their frustration. ",

Proposal A: Superfluid : YES Proposal B: Kromatika : YES Proposal C: Hundred Finance : YES Proposal D: Biconomy : YES Proposal E: Dope Wars : NO Proposal F: Infinity Wallet : YES Proposal G: Dexguru : NO Proposal H: Overnight[.]fi : NO Proposal I:  Saddle Finance : NO   With this Cycle 3 comes to an end and going forward, I would like to see more detailed plan towards token distribution and user retain especially towards project focusing on LP incentive.   Other thing I would to share is focus on co-incentive, if your project is giving APY on providing liquidity to a pool is not a co-incentive but rather a feature of your project/product. What you are willing to offer from your side to match the token request is a co-incentive such as your project token, if your project does have a token our cant provide the co-incentive, mention it as such.   And this is one quite important, if you disagree with any decision or comment, please explain your reasoning and ask open ended question.   This one goes to OP Team, we should follow OP manual and rules mention there and should not consider any proposal if they does not have approval from a delegate with voting power mentioned in the OP Manual. If you are mentioning something in the manual, stick to it or just remove the line. I saw that they have mentioned that they will follow the rule going forward which is a good thing to see.   See you in Phase 1; Cycle 3. Cheers! PS: As usual, I am looking forwards towards your feedback and/or criticism on how to improve the gov and what can I do to support you more. ",

Cycle 6 Voting:- I followed the recommendation provided by dedicated committees except for bankless-academy where I voted against. Public funding is one the major steps towards Ether\u2019s Phoenix and we have a dedicated funding for that but that does not necessarily mean we should wait for Citizen house to be active before considering funding public good. But to me, if we are funding public good from Gov fund it must be focused only towards Optimism.

Before actily involved in OP gov as a delegate, I was a discord member of different projects on Optimism including L2DAO when Phase 0 proposal was in incubation. During that time, L2DAO was seeking their community feedback on forming the proposal in a way to maximize its impact on project. There were other community member active on their discord, helping each other, topic of discussion was not limited to Phase 0 proposal but all web3 space including discussion on other chain, nft and metaverse. To encourage community engagement, especially from new users, L2DAO created a new Discord role by name L2DAO \u201cJade\u201d , similar to \u201cnerd\u201d, \u201cdeveloper\u201d, \u201ccontributor\u201d and so on we have on our OP discord. To recognize overall involvement from community side, they gave this role to me including two other community member. That\u2019s all, that was my role in L2DAO. I hold a discord role for some time, soon after that they redefined their discord architecture and I think this role does not exist anymore. Soon after Phase 0, I got more involved in OP governance, I left many other discord group, including some bigger project on optimism, just because I wanted to focus more on OP gov and I didnt had time and bandwidth to follow up with other project. In short, I contributed to a DAO, they recognized active contribution by creating a fun discord role which was assigned to me including others. This role does not exist anymore, I got more involved in OP Gov reducing my activity in other project. Left many discord group, still follow few but not active as I used to be. Hope this help. ",

Number of OP delegated and participation going down:-  Total number of OP Delegated is still going down   Overall engagement is lowest, apart from selected committee member and few community member no one is actively taking part in discussion  Suggestion : -  We might see flock of new users after second airdrop depending on multiplier on the basis of token delegation and active participation, second boost could be because of Citizen house. Citizen house will come sooner than the second airdrop and I expect that to create some good vibe and may boost engagement on token house too.       1. An independent entity should monitor engagement from community on this          forum and reward them retroactively. (could not be gamed easily).       2. Taking feedback from active delegates could be another option, they might         know who has contributed during feedback cycle      3. Point based reward system (likes + times replied to and so on) - as          mentioned by SR + Prometheus on Season 2 feedback Thread. Could be gamed         but I am in favor of trying this for one season.        4. Another similar option could be asking the proposal author to share feedback.          From receiver end, if they see impact of a community member and they should         get some extra point. Repeat and filter it.       5. If a user feel their contribution deserves reward, they can create a post,          submit and show their contributions.      6. We can start retroactively, there are couple of active community member          on this forum and, I believe, we could try to include them in next season.  2. Road ahead  We already know that foundation want us to experiment, suggest and implement changes but we might need hint on road-ahead.  Suggestion : -  May be a good idea to set the goal, a short term goal. What do we want to achieve in next 6 months. Are we still focusing on Liquidity and user on-boarding or can we put priority on long term sustainable vision, beyond just LPing and mercenary liquidity.  3. Proposal Evaluation: - I am no longer looking at Phase 0 but season 1 and 2 was mostly focused towards LPing and user incentives. Going forward I would like to see some changes.      1. Personally, I am looking at direct protocol iteration.       2. May be supporting development of project, incrementally.      3. Liquidity does look good but as long as OP incentives are on-going.          If  you are submitting a second proposal, proper accountability of          prior/existing proposal could help.

I created this badge because you can mint it on a new address and still hold the \u201cverified\u201d tag, its free and fun. Only drawback is that sample size is quite small, just 18 delegates between 4 committees. So if you are part of any committee, you can mint a zk ba\u2026     ",

Luckily, there is a lot of room for optimization. Some goals for Season 3 include:   creating a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers setting a pace for grant distributions defining a clear scope, with clear differentiation from Partner Fund creating accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based distributions reducing the workload on delegates\u2026     Voted in Favor :-  easy to reach consensus when group size is small communication could be fast tracked, this was a challenge in season 2 Streamline the process, making grant funding less complex  I also believe that putting decision power is few entities could lead to centralization of power and might create an Eco-chamber which will hurt us in long run. But supporting this proposal because OF is working on iteration, feedback from past season is reflected in this proposal and we are more aligned toward experiment from beginning.     [Special Voting Cycle #9a]: Protocol Delegation Program \ud83c\udfdb Governance       Please read Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting for full context before reading this proposal.  Protocols building on Optimism are among its most important stakeholders and they value having a voice in the development of this ecosystem. Throughout Season 1 & 2, protocols have repeatedly expressed this interest by requesting that they be able to self-delegate grants as a means to participate in Token House governance. Self-delegation of grants has historically been discouraged. This proposal pre\u2026     Voted : Against Governance is difficult, chaotic co-ordination could be tiresome some time, few entities will try to make it political or even worse, a pvp battle. But even after all this, we should try to be more inclusive, inclusive of other protocol, builders and community. I am reading \u201cskin-in-the-game\u201d narrative as a positive side of this proposal which I agree but what about other protocol bringing more value to our chain even if they are not native ? What do we want to built, a cult or a community ? I shared the similar thought here and also agree with @BP_Gamma here ",

Michael and Katie - Both active and quite familiar with web3 space. GFX Lab - Has vast knowledge of dev and gov, received two grant from gov and contributed heavily to our gov.

With my limited knowledge on public good, there are couple of nomination I would not consider a public good.  A protocol having raised millions in VC/token(sales) funding Very less impact or at least at early stage Could be considered as a public good in the past but not anymore  My Focus would be -  Clear and visible impact (one example would be revoke Ui), NiceNode, Orbiter could be another one (there are couple of open question though). Optimism Espa\u00f1ol , jackxbt and similar under education section. Must be open sourced Might consider means-test where needed.  This is not to bash anyone or any project. To me, Optimism two pillar gov model was the main motivation behind joining this collective. Finally, we are moving away from plutocratic voting system and I understand that my vote has equal weightage, like other elected citizen, and I want to be transparent as possible, provide my rational behind every decision, take feedback, iterate and work towards making this collective better. So, if you have any feedback, please let me know. (comment /dm on this forum or on discord nono#1218) Note - Please note that I am not a smart contract developer and may reach out to collective I trust for additional information or may have to skip certain nominations related to development tools, APIs, or packages when casting my vote.

While Uni v2 was a public good, its successor, Uni v3, is not. Once you lauch a token, you are in \u201cin-profit\u201d market. Tally Ho, a wallet I love and use, might be another example. They are depended on grants, gitcoin and similar, but with their upcoming token lauch I am not sure anymore. One arugemnt I hear - they are still open source, anyone could fork and build upon them and their impact is visible. Totally valid point however, one could argue that they have already reaped the benefits of their impact through VC funding and token sales. Supporting a team or project that is dependent solely on grants, like you have mentioned, may be a more prudent choice. There are few gray area and still seeking feedback from collective. ",

We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols. Our systematic framework for DAOs covers governance methodologies, decentralized workforce, implementation, documentation, communication and community engagement. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but we provide a framework of principles and tools we have developed throughout our experience. We scale DAOs sustainably. Experience We are the leading professional delegate team with a track record across major DeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, Element, InstaDapp, Hop and more. We pioneer delegation work through high governance standards, extensive research, hands-on expertise and the consistent use of a code of conduct. Pushing forward web3 and DeFi since 2018, StableLab\u2019s co-founders previously spent 3.5 years at the Maker Foundation.  1600\u00d7900 162 KB  Governance delegates and roles currently (or previously held by StableLab). View all our proposals, votes and milestones at stablelab.xyz /governance. Values & Conduct A. VALUES - A.R.T.  Active: We participate in every aspect of the governance process, from creating and presenting proposals to providing feedback in the forums and actively voting. Research: Our decisions are backed by a team of experienced researchers and PhDs. Trust: We act unbiased and transparent, according to our code of conduct - driven by a strong set of ethics and values.  B. DELEGATE CONDUCT  Use values to guide actions. Maintain impartiality and transparency in participation. Rely on data, research and prior expertise for proposals and votes. Apply battle-tested internal policies for consistency. Consult with the team for quality outcomes.  Our view on the Optimistic Vision At StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a non-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers. Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere. Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution.  Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years. Decentralized governance is a relatively new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems, such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy, need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.  This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner. Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.  We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO. Disclosure Through our holding company, we have invested in multiple projects to advance growth and governance for them. See the full list here.  We contribute to various protocols\u2019 governance, such as MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, and Element. See the full list here.  When applicable, we will disclose potential conflicts of interest in our rationale. Waiver of Liability By delegating to StableLab, you acknowledge and agree that StableLab participates on a best efforts basis and StableLab will not be liable for any form of damages related to StableLab\u2019s participation in governance.

Most users are unlikely to read all 24 proposals and thus can\u2019t make an informed opinion. It would make sense to approve each individual proposal as each proposal is unique. Proposal B Vote: No Deadlines are deadlines. Even though uniswap is an important partner, there are rules to follow and it is important that there are no exceptions to this rule. We are open to approving their application for their next cycle but it is unfair to give them special treatment. An individual vote also makes it more likely to be passed so this might encourage other protocols in the future to purposely miss a deadline since uniswap got this treatment. Proposal C Vote: Yes We believe grants are a great way to help the community. ",

                    "content": "Voting Cycle 3 Proposal A: Superfluid - Yes Superfluid has a great product and track record. We prefer that superfluid has opted for 150k of $OP to last 6 months and would encourage them to apply again when they have more evidence of their success. Once we can evaluate the success of superfluid adoption on Optimism it will be much easier to request further tokens or even a larger amount (if necessary). Proposal B: Kromatika - No We aren\u2019t in support of using such a large percentage of the tokens for influence marketing. 50% is too large of an amount and could be spent better elsewhere such as grants for educational content or refunds for bridging. If the % spent on influencer was reduced or spent on educational content for users then that is more ideal. Proposal C: Hundred Finance - Yes We are in support of this proposal for numerous reasons. The hundred finance team aligns themselves greatly with optimism and they have shown this behavior with their promise to return the OP tokens if they identify that the extra OP tokens aren\u2019t contributing to an increased TVL. Not only that but it is a reasonable request of 300k tokens and they have been active on Optimism for a few months. Albeit there is only $400k on Optimism they have shown signs of success and this grant can help boost TVL. Proposal D: Biconomy - Yes Biconomy has a great track record and after diving deeper into your statistics and work with other protocols, it would be great to support this project. Even though the OP request is quite large, we feel that it is a suitable amount since a majority will be spent on the ecosystem and gas grants. It would be great to see more of their blogs similar to this in the future that showcase gas savings in projects that use their products as it would help highlight how the OP grant is helping users onboard. Proposal E: Dope Wars - No The amount requested (one million) is far too large and would be better if it was split up into batches rather than an all-in-one grant. Proposal F: Infinity Wallet - No In the previous cycle we voted yes, but we had a change of mind as we share a similar concern about open-source and a lack of metrics to support the proposal. Proposal G: Dexguru - No DexGuru is a helpful project but the token distribution is not clearly tied to supporting the optimism ecosystem. The grant explanation is very vague and doesn\u2019t help us understand where 500,000 OP is going. Proposal H: Overnight - No It is an interesting idea but there is no live product + no co-incentives. Using USD+ isn\u2019t a co-incentive as its daily yield is part of the aspect but it is an interesting experiment. As the OP request isn\u2019t too high we are going to vote yes. Proposal I: Saddle Finance - No It is a very short term focus as as it focuses solely on LM and only across 3 months. ",

                    "content": "Season 1 Reflection Season 1 has come to an end, and we at StableNode, would like to take the time to reflect on the past four voting cycles. There we 38 proposals over four voting cycles, with the initial cycle being a batch vote. Voting cycle #1 - 3 Voting cycle #2 - 17 Voting cycle #3 - 9 Voting cycle #4 - 9 We voted 16 Yes\u2019s and 22 No\u2019s. To see our voting history and the reasons, check out our delegate thread.  optimism votes1024\u00d7768 53.8 KB  Governance Update #2 provides a good overview of the problems faced by the community, and we echo these concerns as there were too many proposals to work your way through, both in terms of voting and providing feedback. Specifically, voting cycle #2 was a large number of proposals, and we believe that such a large amount can act as a deterrent for individuals to get involved in the governance process. Voter apathy is a prominent issue within decentralized governance, and when possible, we should minimize the obstacles that come with participating in decentralized governance. We don\u2019t necessarily mean to reduce the workload/number of proposals but to find a more effective way to allow voters, especially individuals, to continue to participate in OP governance. We also recommend using a tool like Messari governor keep track of the proposals in preliminary discussions and the active vote. The discourse and discord can get a bit overwhelming sometimes, so a quick check there to find the preliminary discussion is short. Regarding the proposals, we recommend that future applications use previous successful proposals to help write their application. Proposals should be clear and detailed, updated post-community feedback, and contain all relevant links. Using Boardroom\u2019s voter track record and cross-referencing it with the history of some of the Optimism votes, it seems that even a few large delegates have stopped voting. Voting cycle 4 hasn\u2019t concluded yet, so not everyone would have the 38 votes (the first vote was a test). We aren\u2019t sure of the reason for the reduced participation, but it could be due to many proposals, lack of incentives, or other reasons. We encourage delegators to re-delegate to those delegates who actively participate in Optimism governance. One reason is that Snapshot does not support voting via Gnosis Safe, so delegates using a Gnosis Safe would be unable to vote. There is no solution yet. ",

Ideally, this would go under RGPF but, Bankless Academy have a strong track record and this request helps support the greater ecosystem. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Across Protocol Vote: Yes Rationale: Across has been a great support in the Balancer ecosystem and believes they can have a similar experience in Optimism. The distribution period of 12-18 months merits itself in this case. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Tarot Vote: No Rationale: Following the recommendation we made in DeFi committee A. Implement a reduced token distribution period with further clarity around using 10% for the ops cost. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Revert Compoundor Vote: Yes Rationale: Following the recommendation we made in DeFi committee A. Ultimately, the proposal was strong and will add value to the OP ecosystem. Regardless of the drama within the proposal comments, we base our vote on the merits of the proposal itself. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Kromatika Vote: Yes Rationale: Following the recommendation we made in DeFi committee A. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: dHEDGE DAO Vote: Yes Rationale: After the revisions, we are happy to support this proposal. They have a clear plan on token distribution with co-incentives too. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Otterspace Vote: No Rationale: It is an interesting product, but I don\u2019t believe it necessarily warrants a grant from the governance fund. It\u2019s also quite early in its stages, with much competition. I don\u2019t see a grant accelerating adoption. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: OptiChads Vote: Yes Rationale: I am a fan of public funding and encouraging users to live healthier life. I would be intrigued to get a follow-up to see how the challenges work out. An accountability committee would be beneficial here, especially as this has different vision to DeFi protocols. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Interest Protocol 2 Vote: Yes Rationale: Small request to help accelerate the onboarding of a strong protocol to Optimism. Season 2 Governance Fund Proposal: Socket Vote: NO Rationale: Following the recommendation of the tooling committee. Token request should be reduced. ",

Season 2: Cycle 7: Alchemix Vote: No Rationale: Following our recommendation in DeFi Committee A and would like to see the outlined changes made before resubmission. Season 2: Cycle 7: Tarot Vote: Yes Rationale: Following our recommendation in DeFi Committee A, we are in favor of supporting Tarot\u2019s request after the amendments. Season 2: Cycle 7: Sushiswap Vote: Yes Rationale: Following our recommendation in DeFi Committee A, we are happy to support the updated proposal. Season 2: Cycle 7: Abracadabra Money Vote: No Rationale: Large request amount with no live deployment on Optimism. Season 2: Cycle 7: Overtime Markets Vote: Yes Rationale:  Amount requested is suitable and due to the novelty of being a sports betting platform, they need this extra support to onboard users from web2 to web3. Fee rebates will hopefully make it easier to attract more users to the ecosystem. Season 2: Cycle 7: Overnight.fi Vote: Yes Rationale:  Stablecoins are a bit of tricky one, but since its supported by high-quality stable coins with a strong token distribution, we are happy to support it. Season 2: Cycle 7: LI.FI Vote:  Yes Rationale:  Amount requested and distribution plan seem reasonable. They already have a strong amount of traction and this will help projects on OP. Season 2: Cycle 7: Safe Vote:  Abstain Rationale:  We just became delegates in SafeDAO so I don\u2019t think its fair to vote. Season 2: Cycle 7: Karma (Discourse Form Plugin) Vote:  Abstain Rationale:  We helped Karma with the proposal so will be abstaining from this vote. Season 2: Cycle 7: Karma (Delegate Dashboard) Vote:  Abstain Rationale:  We helped Karma with the proposal so will be abstaining from this vote. Season 2: Cycle 7: Rainbow Wallet Vote:  No Rationale:  Token request is too large for one use-case. A lot of bridges have already been funded too so they will overlap a lot at this rate. Season 2: Cycle 7: Otterspace  Vote:  Yes Rationale:  After the amendments, 50k OP is a suitable amount and can have a large impact on the ecosystem. Season 2: Cycle 7: Dope Wars Vote:  No Rationale:  Token request is way too high. Would prefer to see some form of adoption then introduce rewards. ",

                    "content": "Season 2: Cycle 8: Alchemix Vote: Yes Rationale: Following our recommendation we are happy to support the proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Arrakis Vote: No Rationale: Following our recommendation we are will go against the proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Symphony Vote: No Rationale: Following our recommendation we are will go against the proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Homora Vote: Yes Rationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C\u2019s recommendation, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Angle Vote: Yes Rationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C\u2019s recommendation, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: InsureDAO Vote: Yes Rationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C\u2019s recommendation, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Curve Vote: Yes Rationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C\u2019s recommendation, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: PoolTogether Vote: No Rationale: We are voting against the committee recommendation. PT is a great product, but the 110k for alternative interfaces is far too much. It\u2019s a great concept and they will be testing it with a project that\u2019s already being funded. I rather see the success of that before deploying further capital for it. Season 2: Cycle 8: Overnight Vote: Yes Rationale: Following DeFi Commmitee C\u2019s recommendation, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Socket Vote: Yes Rationale: Follow the Tooling Committee, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: EthernautDAO Vote: Yes Rationale: Follow the Tooling Committee, we are happy to support this proposal. Season 2: Cycle 8: Tally Ho Vote: No Rationale: Not a fan of the current token distribution method. Size of ask is fine, but the distribution should be amended. Season 2: Cycle 8: Messari Vote: Yes Rationale: Messari have provided a high-quality of service in other protocols with their quarterly and governance reports. We believe they will add a much needed transparency to the OP ecosystem. Season 2: Cycle 8: DefiLlama Vote: No Rationale: Its not exactly clear. \u201cPay us for our previous work so we can continue building cool things\u201d. DeFi Llama is a great product but they can go for RPGF for their previous work and be more explicit in which work they will complete for a grant from the governance fund. Season 2: Cycle 8: Agora Vote: Yes Rationale: This will help governance in many ways. Governance is an unexplored space with limited tooling, but agora can help push the space forward. Season 2: Cycle 8: Ambire Wallet Vote: No Rationale: Similar to Tally Ho. We already funded a few bridges too. Season 2: Cycle 8: Mochi Vote: Yes Rationale: This is an interesting tool that has the potential to tackle current problems. It\u2019s worth funding experimental products such as Mochi. Season 2: Cycle 8: Velodrome Vote: No Rationale: Our recommendation was abstain, but we will be voting no. For such a large request, we\u2019d feel more comfortable if this was broken up or once we have an accountability committee to follow up with grants of this size. ",
