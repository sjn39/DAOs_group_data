                    "content": "One of the great things about Gitcoin\u2019s Passport vision is that passports can draw legitimacy from multiple credentials (pluralism), rather than de-duping via a single-point-of-failure such as the USA\u2019s Social Security Number (SSN). That said, \u201cdual citizenship\u201d presents a challenge if the end-user considers every \u201ccitizenship\u201d as independently legitimate. (arguably, dual citizenship IRL is already overpowered even without this, but to a much smaller degree) The fundamental choice is: if I have stamps from all of {PoH, Worldcoin, Idena, Bright ID, KYC, Web2}, what is the incentive for me to put all of these on the same passport, versus creating multiple passports? The toy model I\u2019ll assume here is:  There are a number of \u201cpersonhood score\u201d algorithms personhood(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN) each developer can use. Each end-user application delivers a payoff of payoff(personhood) for a given personhood score. Composing these functions implies a payoff function payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN) for the application. If every application has their own passport registry, one may choose a different distribution of stamps across passports per app. If every applications checks the Gitcoin registry to dedup stamps, then users must use a consistent set of passports across all apps. In the latter case, each passport has a total_payoff(credential1, credential2, ..., credentialN). WLOG, we\u2019ll just work with one payoff function.   When to split and when to merge? If there is some partition of my set of credentials such that sum(payoff(credentials_i)) > payoff(credentials), then it is in my self-interest to maintain multiple passports along this partition. If payoff is convex, then this will never hold, due to multivariate Jensen\u2019s inequality (in fact, the opposite would hold - if there is someone with an orthogonal set of credentials, I should merge with them). However, personhood is explicitly meant to support concave payoffs - the problem of splitting credentials mirrors the problem of splitting tokens across wallets, in that 2x the personhood shouldn\u2019t give 2x the payoff. In most cases (for example, cutoff-based systems where you get the max payoff for having a sufficient number of credentials), we\u2019ll be incentivized to split.  Cross-credential linkability? A natural way to approach this (other than accepting only one type of credential), would be to have e.g. a Worldcoin ID linkable to a Bright ID. That way, split passports can be detected and penalized. Not only do we need to be able to detect this link, but we should be able to detect it post-anonymization. i.e. in the following diagram, the application must be able to deduce B without knowing C or D:  There are possibly some clever cryptographic ways this could be done, but at some point someone must know A. In practice this means that information linking a face, iris, social graph, Web2 handles, etc together would be out there somewhere. One could argue that forming this profile is both inevitable (and presents no real harm) and a necessary precondition for Sybil resistance (otherwise, how do we prevent someone from using their iris for one account and their face for another?), and it is sufficient privacy to just not link this profile to any actual activity. Another viewpoint could be that it is unviable for communities to accept outside credentials (especially anonymized credentials) without having their own additional screens. I\u2019m curious to hear thoughts on these viewpoints. ",

I think I\u2019m ok with people having multiple passports or identities \u2014 provided they don\u2019t engage in Sybil behavior. Borrowing your dual citizenship analogy: dual citizens IRL can choose which passport to use, however they can\u2019t use their passports to be registered in two countries at once or to count as two people in one country. Once they\u2019ve entered a country with a given passport, they can only leave by showing the same passport. The primary issue Gitcoin cares about is stopping n sock puppets from getting match funds for funding the same project n times. We need to learn to better detect Sybil behavior. We need to increase the price / diminish the benefit of Sybil behavior. We need to create positive network effects for reputation building behavior. Cross linking credentials could definitely be one of those ways! ",

One of the reasons I liked the idea of using a PersonhoodScore in this post was that it allows the system to scale against different sophistication levels of attackers, including handling dual passports elegantly. assuming cost of forgery = personhood score, if the cost of forgery of identity 1 is $10, and the cost of forgery for identity 2 is $100, then the combined identity for these two is $110. if you can get $10 in matching from identity 1 and $100 in matching from identity 2, or if you combined the passports + get $110 in matching, then there is no incentive to sybil attack the system.     llllvvuu:  If there is some partition of my set of credentials such that sum(payoff(credentials_i)) > payoff(credentials), then it is in my self-interest to maintain multiple passports along this partition.

This might not be realistic though. For example for a voting app, would you get 2x the voting power for having 2 credentials? Even in QF I\u2019d argue that the match amount shouldn\u2019t equal the personhood score. For example, let\u2019s say we updated the \u201clegacy\u201d trust score to be linear in personhood score. That would require removing the 150% cap, allowing me to get 250% or more in trust bonus if I used all of the verification methods. This number would only go up the more verification methods get added. So in this system, indeed there would be no incentive to \u201cSybil\u201d, but that\u2019s because we would just be handing excess power to the user directly.     owocki:  I think this is what you already said in different words tho    The math here is actually important. Any system with a cap or tapering will be concave. For example the spreadsheets in the post you linked (where you link to this) are concave (e.g. if the aggregate match was $100k and I was capable of getting $1m cost-of-forgery then I would want to split into 10 passports). And indeed they should be concave: in a world where there are hundreds of verification mechanisms, someone shouldn\u2019t get double the match because they had the tenacity to sign up with 20 verification methods instead of 10 (otherwise you get farming captchas all over again). Another point to note is that forgeries themselves are not independent events. So it\u2019s unclear if the assumption cost_of_forgery(methods) == sum(cost_of_forgery(methods[i])) is ideal. ",
