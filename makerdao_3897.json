The mandated actors discussed bringing items forward, but in general both Protocol Engineering and myself would prefer to complete the outstanding work mentioned below before deploying. In doing so, we are operate according to the rule: \u201cIs there anything that we feel is ready to include in an executive vote this week?\u201d Rather than this one: \u201cWe need to push an executive this week, what do we have that can go in?\u201d We\u2019re in a situation where there are lots of \u2018irons in the fire\u2019 so to speak, and we\u2019ve made progress across a wide range of projects, but nothing is at the point where it is quite ready for implementation.  Here are some of the projects that are on the go (not exhaustive), and a brief summary of what we\u2019re waiting for. SushiSwap Pairs - Blocked on Sushi deployments Centrifuge Assets - Awaiting Kovan Deployment and testing from Centrifuge. 6s Debt Ceiling Raise - Awaiting green light from 6s. Additional PSMs - Awaiting negotiations from the @Growth-Core-Unit Dss-vest - Awaiting audit results Optimism - Deployed on Optimism L2, awaiting Optimism Launch Matic - Awaiting Oracle Evaluation. Institutional / Conditional Vaults - Awaiting discussions with Nexo + Protocol Engineering work. Vox - Awaiting review from Protocol Engineering. stETH - Awaiting Oracle and Protocol Engineering Evaluations. D3M - Awaiting Protocol Engineering review, risk evaluation, governance actions. Gelato UniV3 DAI-USDC token - Awaiting Oracle and Risk evaluations. We recognize that we\u2019re suffering from \u2018target saturation\u2019 in some respect, and making incremental progress on lots of projects, rather than significant progress on any individual effort. This week in the mandated actors coordination meeting, we discussed providing some more organization and transparency around on-going projects. @Derek will be taking point on this effort and produce a summary sheet of current projects, though it will take on-going buy-in from all the Core Units to keep this up to date.
