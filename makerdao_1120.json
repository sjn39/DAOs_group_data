                    "content": "Summary This post introduces a decision-making methodology for real world assets after collateral on-boarding. Based on that methodology, this post includes a proposal to delegate some decision-making to a committee of volunteers approved by MKR token holders. Go to the section \u201cPROPOSAL\u201d for details.  In anticipation of risk assessments for SG Forge and HVB being published soonest, @eumenes and @christiancdpetersen are providing to the Forum a modified version of their presentation of May 4, 2022 during the RWF CU office hours. Office hours #8 | RWAs: Taxonomy of decision-making - YouTube As discussed at the time, there are a multitude of commercial and administrative issues that occur after the approval of a financing that require a decision. Maker needs a methodology that is  Transparent Practical Commercially reasonable Responsive to MKR token holders  The proposed methodology is a starting point and the methodology may change depending on the asset, etc. We remain guided by MKR token holder inputs. Types of Decisions in Real World Assets Financing of real world assets and real world businesses requires more decision-making than financing crypto assets. Below is a mere sample of decisions made in the real world:  960\u00d7540 156 KB  In TradFi, these decisions can be classified between high impact, medium impact and low impact. The types of decisions may vary between financings - simple loan vs. investment grade bond securitization. The slides below show the difference between a simple loan and an investment-grade public bond securitization. Investment-grade bond securitization transactions are \u201ctrustless\u201d because  The collateral pool requires little lender oversight  High quality collateral with consistent historical performance Well established borrower and servicer   The structure is robust, requiring little lender oversight or governance  Administrative functions are performed by established, independent third parties Key decisions are rarely required, requiring \u2154 bondholder approval     960\u00d7540 29.4 KB  960\u00d7540 45 KB  960\u00d7540 40.1 KB  960\u00d7540 61.1 KB  What constitutes \u201chigh impact\u201d decisions? In the TradFi world, \u201chigh impact\u201d decisions are called \u201cLender\u2019s Sacred Rights\u201d. For Maker, we can envision the \u201cLender\u2019s Sacred Rights\u201d as follows:  960\u00d7540 50.4 KB  After allocation of the \u201csacred rights\u201d, all other decisions might be delegated to an independent third party, a delegated committee of Maker representatives or a combination of both. Due to the inherent conflict, Maker should not delegate decision-making, directly or indirectly, to the borrower (or the borrower\u2019s agents).  960\u00d7540 70.5 KB  The precise allocation to an independent third party (e.g. trustee or independent director), a delegated committee of Maker representatives or a combination of the two can be determined on a case-by-case and may vary by transaction-type (securitization vs loan) or asset-class. PROPOSAL We propose a separate Committee of Delegated Maker Representatives be established for each on-boarded real world asset. The following outlines key principles for a Committee of Delegated Maker Representatives.  960\u00d7540 91.1 KB  Our objective is a methodology that is transparent, practical and responsive to MKR token holders. Request for MKR Contributors Other than decisions relating to \u201csacred rights\u201d which will require MKR token holder votes, RWF CU and the incubating LTS CU respectfully seek Maker token holders and/or delegates to volunteer to serve on a delegated committee of decision-makers. We would envision separate committees for each asset - probably no more than 3-5 persons per committee. The relevant existing core units, who will be most familiar with the underlying asset and transaction, will provide recommendations and advice to the delegated committees. Each committee will be responsible to the Maker community. It is intended to be more formal than the existing RWA Committee (MIP57) - RWA Committee. Subject to the Maker \u201csacred rights\u201d, each committee will have real decision-making power. Criteria for a volunteer will include:   Traditional finance experience (whether commercial, legal, executive, risk, etc.) and/or experience with the particular asset class   Willingness to be a decision-maker on matters delegated to the committee   Willingness to review and make decisions on complex issues quickly, given commercial timelines   Willingness to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the borrower as the delegate may have access to confidential, non-public information   Willingness to represent the Maker community   The volunteer does not have an economic interest the proposed borrower or the proposed asset (subject to standard carve-outs for non-material ownership interests in public companies)   The volunteer does not have an economic interest in an existing borrower or on-boarded asset with Maker   Subject to the level of interest, we can then discuss more process related issues, including the formal delegation process, committee voting, decisions allocated to the delegated committee. The first two transactions will be SG Forge and HVB transactions. The delegated committee, its scope, and initial members will be included in the executive vote for the SG Forge and HVB transactions. Please let @eumenes and/or @christiancdpetersen know if you are interested. We also welcome alternative ideas to address post on-boarding decisions. @Real-World-Finance @collateral-core-unit ",

                    "content": "Thank you for putting this together, Christian. I think this is the correct direction to go and will vote in favor of this. This proposal is aligned with a general trend I\u2019m seeing in the governance discussions that our decisionmaking mechanisms need to evolve to suit the more complex waters we\u2019re entering. The Office hours presentation was excellent. I urge other folks to watch it to understand the trade-offs in this structure (I found it still digestible at 2x speed). A few questions: Based on what I see on the forums, we obviously have a number of finance folks involved in this project, but do we have enough qualified people for MKR holders to have meaningful choices of who becomes a committee delegate?     christiancdpetersen:  The relevant existing core units, who will be most familiar with the underlying asset and transaction, will provide recommendations and advice to the delegated committees.   Will MKR holders who are also members of CUs be eligible to be on the committees? I don\u2019t have an opinion on this, but there has been some community angst around the influence of CU members who also act as MKR holders, so I wanted to ask. Is there a minimum MKR ownership required to participate in a committee? Can we make a point to in the future revisit delegating additional decisions to third parties to increase decentralization? I think it makes sense to start w/ a heavier hand while we ramp up RWAs, but ultimately further decentralization will be valuable. Additionally, a comment: I have a hypothesis that this proposal might be the right kind of minutia to involve MKR holders in. I get frustrated that we MKR holders are having debates about event budgets and other execution details that don\u2019t seem core to the business. Ideally those matters are treated as execution decisions, that can be governed at a high level (budget, hire/fire key personnel). In my opinion, we are unlikely to attract more bright minds excited and involved in this project if we are asking them to contribute to issues that aren\u2019t related to the core business. On the other hand, these committees\u2019 work actually sounds material and provides a means of engagement and contribution. I mean, maybe it\u2019s kind of grunt work, but at least it utilizes the skillsets of finance professionals we want to attract, and it is directly contributing to our core business operations that generate a profit. If this proposal is passed, I will be reaching out to several of my friends in finance to see if they are interested in  buying some MKR to participate (or I\u2019ll give them some of mine). Maybe someone can enlighten me on whether this hypothesis is accurate, or this is just annoying grunt work for the average finance professional. ",

I do not know, but an initial judgment can be made if we get volunteers. We have all of 1 volunteer so far (but still early days)!     HospitableOryx:  Will MKR holders who are also members of CUs be eligible to be on the committees?   Ultimately up to the MKR token holders. But I would not propose that members of the relevant core units (RWF, CES, LTS, LOVE) serve on the Delegated Committee. I think the advisory role of the CUs is important and should not be diluted.     HospitableOryx:  Is there a minimum MKR ownership required to participate in a committee?   I suppose not. There are pros/cons for each approach. But if MKR token holders vote in favor of MKR ownership, then how much? It becomes a slippery slope. Hopefully participation/contribution will encourage MKR ownership (if none at the start).     HospitableOryx:  Can we make a point to in the future revisit delegating additional decisions to third parties to increase decentralization?   Absolutely. I think SocGen and HVB will be materially different than other MIP6 or MIPxx applications. We will learn as we go . . . improvise, iterate, etc.     HospitableOryx:  committees\u2019 work actually sounds material and provides a means of engagement and contribution.

I was just reading that\u2019s is pretty size-able: \u201c* the global micro lending market size was valued at $134.35 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $343.84 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 12.6% from 2020 to 2027.*\u201d \u2014Allied Market Research If MakerDAO can grab 10% market share of that $300B, with a stability fee of 300 to 400 basis pts, that\u2019s $900M to $1.2B to the surplus buffer!!!  Okay maybe wishful thinking, but I believe it\u2019s a sector that Maker needs to pay attention to. And although I think we can say that HVB is part of the \u201cmicro-lending\u201d sector\u2014micro finance institutions and non-banking financial institutions will grow just as much as banks in the next 5 years, per the report. Here\u2019s a small excerpt: \u201c Micro lending or micro finance is changing the lifestyle of various people in the developing nations of Asia-Pacific and LAMEA by helping them financially. In addition, surge in government initiatives for micro lending in various countries drives the growth of the micro lending market. Furthermore, increase in in micro lenders help various emerging countries for reducing poverty and also improves the standard of living of the poor people. For instance, according to a research study conducted in Bangladesh, micro finance accounted for 40% reduction of poverty in various part of the country. Moreover, various farmers across the African countries are adopting micro lending for buying crops, which drives the growth of the micro lending industry. In addition, people in rural areas are taking loans from micro lenders for setting their own business and to raise their standard of living, which propels the growth of the market.\u201d \u201cRegion wise, the micro lending market was dominated by Asia-Pacific in 2019, and is expected to witness significant growth rate during the forecast period. This is attributed to surge in surge in government initiative to reduce poverty and to upsurge the living standard of the people. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the micro lending market owing to affected cash flow among the financial sector and rising liquidity issues among the micro lenders. In addition, surge in unemployment in various emerging countries and closing of different small and medium enterprises negatively impacts the growth of the market during the first half of 2020. Moreover, banks and financial institutions across the globe are majorly focusing on digitizing their financial assets as well as lending schemes, which is expected to capture large customer base in the upcoming years.*\u201d ",

As you probably know from my earlier posts and my professional background, I am always interested in opportunities in the Asia-Pacific, LatAm and African markets. A few points for consideration: (1) Most jurisdictions (when dealing with micro-lending) will have a FX exposure that may be a challenge to quantify - especially if the revenues from the underlying borrowers are in local currency. (2) To ensure that our efforts are scalable, it will be important to underwrite an experienced underwriter. We will be challenged to do \u201cone off\u201d micro loans. A loan to an experienced, local micro-lender who manages the underlying loans is more efficient and safer for Maker. (3) To ensure that Maker\u2019s interests are fully protected vis-a-vis the underwriter, it will be important for the underwriter to have \u201cskin in the game\u201d through a 1st loss position. And, I guess depending on the particular market, \u201cmicro\u201d lending can be really, really, really small . . . hundreds of dollars vs. millions. We would need our loans to be in the millions to be efficient. I think this is the type of product that Maker will need to partner with a reputable, established and local institution. I have a pipe dream of partnering with the African Development Bank (or similar). But as these entities are typically funded by not-so crypto friendly nation states, it remains a pipe dream! But if we could find the partner, the optics would be really good! ",

The MKR token holders will approve the formation of the Delegated Committee for each transaction as part of the Governance Process for that transaction.  Our intention is to describe the Delegated Committee in each Risk Assessment. We could do a MIP for the Delegated Committee. As I noted in today\u2019s call, the Delegated Committee is, at this stage, for Maker RWA, an experiment. It may be useful to see how the proposal develops and then move towards a MIP once we have some useful datapoints.     flipflopflapdelegate:  I was wondering if you can provide more details as to their role for calculating values of the Collateral Types, Pricing (is it mark-to-market/fair value?), monitoring cash flows, etc.\u2013and last but not least\u2013does the calculation agent also perform \u201cboots on the ground\u201d services?   The Calculation Agent (perhaps better named the Confirmation Agent) will confirm whether a proposed loan participation submitted by HVB to the Trust meets the eligibility requirements of the Master Participation Agreement. If the Calculation Agent confirms that the proposed loan participation meets the eligibility requirements, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Trust will then sign the Certificate of Participation (the instrument to evidence the Trust\u2019s purchase of its share in a loan). If the Calculation Agent does not make such confirmation, then the Trust will not sign the Certificate of Participation.

Even after a transaction is implemented, the Maker token holders can, on an on-going basis, adjust how the Delegated Committee functions.   The Delegated Committee is an experimental process. We will continue to experiment, improvise and improve from deal to deal.   We will continue to push decentralization as much as possible. This will be part of the experimentation process.   We will also experiment with the cadence and quality of reporting from the Delegated Committees. Some transactions may require more or less.   We know what TradFi does in this area, but let\u2019s design and implement a better process and one that is built for Maker DAO. @Eumenes ",

Worked with a bank on pricing and monitoring risk of various private credit and public securitization positions held on balance sheet. Worked with a financial data platform on pricing public securitization bonds and monitoring primary and secondary markets for those bonds. Worked with a public accounting firm on pricing and assessing credit risks of private credit and public securitization positions held on balance sheet of audit client companies, as well as reverse engineering public securitization deals to validate data/claims made on prospectuses. Here is my Linkedin for more details: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiahkim/       Eumenes:  Demonstrated interest in building better governance for DAOs   I am a firm believer in the benefits of DAOs - less bloat, less rent-seeking/low value-add parties, etc. However, there are also definite benefits of centralized systems - quicker execution, easier accumulation of deeper specialized knowledge, etc. I think the implementation/execution of good governance is integral for a DAO in staying firmly on the \u201cdecentralized\u201d side of the very fine line between decentralization and centralization, while minimizing the losses of the benefits of centralized systems (inversely, poor governance would result in extremely slow processes, or a system that is decentralized in name only). My interest in DeFi and DAOs started quite recently (beginning of 2021), but since then, beyond my day job (bridging TradFi structured credit into DeFi), I have been both actively and passively participating in a few RWA DeFi protocols.     Eumenes:  Willingness to sign and abide by non-disclosure agreements with various counterparties   Absolutely willing, and understand that this is common practice in the TradFi world.     Eumenes:  Ability to attend regular (monthly) asset review meeting facilitated by RWF and LTS   Yes.     Eumenes:  Ability to timely address commercial decisions needed on investment facilitated by RWF and LTS   Yes.     Eumenes:  Willing to disclose any potential conflict of interest in respect of the particular investment to which an individual may serve on a Delegated Committee   Yes, I am willing to disclose any potential conflicts. This is also very important, and a common practice in TradFi, and should be replicated/enforced in the RWA DeFi world as well. ",

                    "content": "UPDATE @Real-World-Finance received 7 submissions to volunteer and serve as members of a delegated committee for HVB and SG Forge. Jeremy Kim    @Jeremy_Kim Kevin Miao    @humancapitol Naren Ramachandran  @Naren_Ramachandran Joshua Pritikin  @psychonaut Frank Cruz  @flipflopflapdelegate Aayush Katiyar @cryptickatz Justin Shee  @justin1066 For HVB, we will propose a committee of 5 persons. The proposal will be in the HVB Risk Assessment. In proposing a committee of 5 persons, our logic is as follows:   Have a reasonably sized Delegated Committee (3 vs 5 vs 7) with a measure of checks and balances   Have the Delegated Committee include some members with credit experience (especially given the size of the vault)   Have a member active in the Maker community (a recognised delegate or otherwise)   Ensure that we can propose a Delegated Committee with different members in subsequent transactions   No participants from the Real World Finance, incubating LOVE, or incubating LTS core units   As I have noted in the chain above and during Real World Finance office hours, the Delegated Committee is a proposal to address real world decision-making and to create a transparent mechanism for the Maker community to have visibility into the underlying assets. TO BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR   Maker token holders have complete and total discretion to reduce the Delegated Committee to any figure (including zero) at any time so that ALL matters are determined by a Maker token holder vote   Maker token holders can replace any member at any time   Maker token holders can request more or less transparency   The Delegated Committee is an experiment   Objectively, my long-term goal is to delegate as much decision-making as possible to independent, third party actors - better yet, automate. This will come. In the TradFi space, investment-grade, public bond securitizations reflect this goal \u2013 bond holders are asked to make very few decisions because the assets are investment grade quality, the legal structures and covenant terms limit borrower flexibility, information gathering and sharing is high, and independent, third parties (not the borrower and not the bondholders) verify real world activities. As always, I welcome suggestions from each member of the Maker community on how to innovate and improve on this particular work stream. ",

My view is that the Delegated Committee is an experiment and the Maker token holders should have flexibility to make adjustments. To that end, I would propose that a Signal Request be the appropriate Maker governance tool to effect changes, etc. ",
