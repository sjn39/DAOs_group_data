Context We need to facilitate DVCs in a more structured way. I\u2019m noticing no one is taking action on this, so, in the spirit of feedback & RFC, I\u2019m happy to spearhead a few weeks of workshops. By surfacing topics and coordinating themes, the community members who can attend Rune\u2019s DVC\u2019s should have more of an open conversation. Ideally, feedback is published back here on forums so it can be modified/rejected/clarified async. It just so happens that @0xdeniz coordinated a series of workshops with facilitation experts mischief makers that were all about workshop facilitation ( so meta ). I\u2019m channeling that experience into Facilitating some DVC\u2019s; here is the suggested formatting: Intention: Open up a new DVC meting without the proposal author, to shape feedback, ask questions, and articulate concerns about theEndgamee. Desired outcome: Focusing feedback on useable artifacts (lists, fig jams, forms, etc.) and looping back around to the Weds/Thurs DVC\u2019s (at minimum). Ideally, through the month of RFC we use the Weds/Thurs  DVC time in a more actionable way, with structured conversation. Agenda: For this Friday, since it\u2019s shorter notice, it will primarily be about prioritizing the endgame MIPs for discussion and figuring out a workshop format that works. starting agenda:  Welcome, walkthrough and intro ~5 mins Icebreaker 5 mins Define challenges (ask One high level question) <10mins break (5 mins) MIP breakout group(s) align and assign (5 mins) Breakout sessions  (15 mins)  if we have enough time:  Vote & cut (3 rounds; 2 mins a pop) (or async vote) Closing, flex time, and follow-ups (5 mins)  Rules:  I\u2019ll use my Zoom & Figma account(s) and record (but not post to youtube). I think an open forum that isn\u2019t published is needed. Open to suggestions outside of zoom; discord works fine too. For once, camera-on if possible. Try to enjoy ourselves; workshops should shake up the status quo and feel more high energy. Show up and be present.  Roles:  Attendees: I would love it if some MKR holders could attend, but anyone in the community with concerns and a collaborative mindset are welcome. Facilitation (time-wizard): That me   Organizer: Open to a second meeting organizer  don\u2019t all stand up at once.  Time: 7:30 am PST | 10:30am EST | 14:30 PM UTC  Edits Figjam link (view only until start time) Greatly reduced agenda because online calls are hard to coordinate. ",

We chose not to record the call so opinions could float more freely. As a result, we got high level and specific with the endgame MIPs. There is definitely more feedback to surface and ultimately iterations to execute. Detailed feedback The most cogent and aligned feedback has been delivered to appropriate threads, Endgame v3,  the clustering MIP, POVE, and the offboarding MIPs (Events) and ( SH ) (apologies for the offboarding repetition). If you want to see anything else from the session that Figma link is open to view.  What to expect this week   New time: Friday 8 am PST. Making space for the SES update. Another workshop format, the same Figjam link. It will open up Friday morning and then view only again after concluding. (DM me if you have revisions or want to sharpen figjam fingers; sometimes practice helps) Slightly changing agenda with another activity to open and get contributor brains working. I will continue to serve as a nexus for the next EG-RFC-DVC to see if we can incorporate changes or have a discussion about how to proceed. I will leave my suggestions where appropriate and hopefully bring some operational guidance as the month progresses.   Learnings  Icebreakers are fun; look to this Friday for an even more enjoyable beginning to the meeting. Not everyone has used Figjam (solution: I will help anyone with 10 mins to get comfortable providing feedback and using the tool if they plan on attending.) Vote rounds and condensing is difficult on the fly and even more challenging async. Spent the weekend researching that conundrum and would love to bring polls back here as a solution for soft consensus. All contributions anonymize after the call concludes. I\u2019m simply migrating most contributions to the forums directly, as they are far more concise and topical than I could ever manage alone.  ",
