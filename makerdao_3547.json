I think it\u2019s a good thing, the whole space always tends to give power in the hand of the users - i.e. Ethereum allowing anyone to create a token easily, Uniswap allowing any tokens to be listed. Now users will be able to choose the chains they want to use.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Kind of like NBA Top Shots\u2026   NBA Top Shot isn\u2019t on Solana nor BSC.

                    "content": "The Polygon chain of course has its potential issues, on being the lags it creates for the overall systemic needs of Maker to both liquidate and re-collateralize.   An example of this problem would be that if the Oasis on Polygon had significant liquidation needs, the DAO participants who place bids would need the the funds available on both networks simultaneously to not drain liquidity and attention from the monitoring of the primary Eth based ecosystem.  The duplication of systems here with additional \u201cbridge time lags\u201d is one of several risks of utilizing an Oasis, HOWEVER, I strongly support the creation of an Oasis with an overall Oasis Debt Ceiling that is monitored and limited so as to not be allowed to compromise the entire system by growing too large before proving viable and reliable as an ecosystem for Maker to grow in.  I think the onboarding of new users would be valuable and even as other scaling solutions emerge, the interoperability of Polygon and other Ecosystems such as Polkadot(I really want maker to consider that as well), will eventually allow Maker to form an integrated extended web of banking systems, all tied back to the original super central bank that issues Maker tokens on Eth as always. As with systems in the history of all banking, if one subsystem implodes, the mitigation of the losses can be absorbed and the system allowed to grow stronger with each successive test, so long as the system remains relevant and functioning.  At this moment in time , Maker is losing some relevancy and that is dangerous, while functionailty is being impaired by the limits of ethereum for smaller users whcih are critical to Makers true long term value as something more than a lender to the Defi yield farming system.  We need average people to have access to borrowing Dai again. ",

Recent crypto price volatility have resulted in astronomical gas fees at peak periods. This has resulted in a migration towards L2 chains. Aave, Curve Fi, SushiSwap, 1inch & others have also replicated their applications on Polygon. There are also bridges built between ETH, BSC and Polygon - so there is very little friction towards migration. Once you are on Polygon, you pay close to nothing in gas fees because of the blockchain design. The Maker community looks to be sleeping on this development. Yet, as crypto creativity doesn\u2019t sleep - Qi Dao seems to be trying to make a copy of Maker on Polygon: https://app.mai.finance/ !!! Is anyone concerned about this?

What seems concerning is that Maker is reacting to the market instead of planning to be ahead of competitors. I think that Maker should be one of the first protocols to launch in the new L2s, even just offering the main L2 token (or ETH) as collateral, and nothing else. Another option could be offering DAI bridges to all the L2 and gathering people to use DAI and promote the maker ecosystem. I think is important to be fast and agile to generate adoption, and if Maker does not do it, others will. Also, I don\u2019t understand all the internals of Maker and there might be many arguments about why/how this is difficult to achieve. ",
