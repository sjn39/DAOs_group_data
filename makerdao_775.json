                    "content": " Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) Offboarding Post Mortem  Executive Summary  The Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) was the first Core Unit offboarded by MakerDAO. After the offboarding, several issues were uncovered with how we handle offboarding, particularly in regards to internal CU finances and post-offboarding obligations to the DAO. Four main issues were discovered resulting in five key recommendations from GovAlpha at the bottom of this post.   Statement of Facts  Timeline  May 2021 - Content Production is one of the first Core Units approved by the Maker Protocol. They set up a multisig wallet in accordance with MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management. A forum Post is made detailing the multisig permissions, noting that the multisig would be a 2 of 2 with Facilitator Seth Goldfarb and Jerry Goldfarb, a Content Production contributor. This post declares that all unused funds should be returned to governance when the last facilitator is offboarded. October 2021 - Content Production proposes a budget and has it rejected. One of the items mentioned in the discussion is how far under budget the Core Unit was running. November 2021 - After discussions, a new 6-month budget for Content Production is approved, streaming the team 70,824 DAI per month. December 7, 2021 - Offboarding the Core Unit is proposed by @Deimos. Content Production objects to the validity of the proposal, but it is confirmed valid by @prose11. January 24, 2022 - Vote to offboard Content Production is finalized by a margin of less than 2,000 MKR with over 87,000 MKR voting.  Immediately following the vote, Seth cut off funding to the Ambassadors program. After informing his team of the defunding, Seth and his team reached out to GovAlpha and GovComms to see if there is interest in continuing the program. Content Production makes their third (and largest) pull for January on their DssVest budget stream for 104,858 DAI. In January there are 4 budget calls from Content Production, with the last occurring on Jan 29th. Pulls for the month total 199,974 DAI, with approximately 3,800 DAI remaining unclaimed in the DssVest Stream.   January 28 - 31st, 2022 - Canceling of the Content Production Budget Stream is included in the January 28 Executive. It is passed on the 29th and Executed on the 31st. Note with DssStreams, cancelations can only stop future funds from being streamed. January 25th - February 1st, 2022 (approximately) - Communications with Seth stop, with several community members reporting that he was not responding to inquiries. February 2, 2022 - Communications partially resumed with a group of Prose, LFW, David, and Tim Black that was created by Seth. After some clarification, it was confirmed that rather than making a formal proposal for paid transition, Content Production wished to sell off their brand assets to anyone interested in paying. February 3, 2022 -  @Davidutro offers to pay 500 DAI for the makerdao.world domain that hosts the Community Portal and email services for COM-001 and former MKT-001 members February 4, 2022 - @prose11 is made aware that @kat (a Maker alum who had recently joined Content Production before their offboarding was proposed) intended to pay for the next month of the Ambassador Program out of pocket. Prose reached out to assist with a possible Governance remedy, resulting in this Signal. February 8, 2022 - Seth accepts David\u2019s offer of 500 DAI for the makerdao.world domain. Week of February 14th, 2022 - During ETH Denver (around Feb 18th, an exact date would be appreciated if relevant parties recall), @kat revealed to a group of Core Unit Facilitators and at least one delegate that she had not been compensated for her work with Content Production since December. February 17th, 2022 - Ex-Content Production host \u201cTaste of Denver\u201d party at ETHDenver, now branded as sponsored by Gold Media instead of MakerDAO. February 18th through the present - Discussion of these events took place at ETHDenver, carrying over to the Mandated Actors meeting on February 22nd, where it was decided that GovAlpha should be responsible for this Post Mortem. March 7, 2022 - Seth sends this tweet thread expressing frustration with the process and decisions made by GovAlpha during the offboarding.   Issues Discovered  Offboarding Expectations While much time and effort went into drafting the Core Unit process for MakerDAO, Offboarding Expectations and Procedures were not formally proposed with the Core Unit MIP Set. In absence of these, most Facilitators assumed that funds would be returned and some sort of transition would take place in the event of a Core Unit Offboarding. With no formal offboarding procedure in place, the DAO\u2019s first offboarding resulted in expectations of labor during a transition period, without the promise of compensation. Following the vote to offboard (and defund Content Production), there was a total cessation of all work by the former Core Unit.  Returning Core Unit Funds The DssVest payment structure was designed to alleviate frequent labor from the Executive Spell process. Since the streams were based on already approved budgets, it was seen as a way to cut out excess labor, while still limiting Core Units to their monthly spending requests. However, this assumption only holds true when Core Units are utilizing their full budget, or returning unused portions periodically. In theory, Content Production should have been able to use their approximately 70k DAI monthly allowance for the month of January without issue. But because they had been underspending, they were able to claim approximately 200k DAI in January. Given that very few Core Units have returned any of their budgets thus far, this is likely a vulnerability across the entire DAO. While some Core Unit budget structures, like the auditors\u2019 wallet used by many SES-incubated teams, partially address this vulnerability, the structure creates a new set of people that must process budget returns without an agreed-upon DAO-wide policy.  Commitments Made by Former Core Unit Traditional structures have very clear lines of responsibility (and legal regulations) to follow when people are let go. However, when we remove a Core Unit we are essentially firing a self-sovereign team. One that other teams may have dependencies on. There are also relevant questions about the loss of talent that are beyond the scope of this post mortem. We face two major groups that could have unresolved business following an involuntary offboarding, 3rd party contractors and Core Unit contributors. While all agreements are made between a Core Unit and others (rather than an agreement with MakerDAO), the possibility for reputational damage is quite high and could result in unforeseen consequences following an offboarding. Ultimately, the community must answer the question of what should be done in the case of unfulfilled commitments by an offboarded Core Unit.  Entanglement of Key Infrastructure While in this case, the stakes were fairly minor, the access to key infrastructure remains a critical issue for the protocol. In this case, email services for Content Production and Governance Communications were linked, leaving @Davidutro in a particularly tricky spot following the offboarding. Additionally, GovAlpha leaned heavily on the makerdao.world domain for documentation and for linking further information in on-chain proposals. Fortunately, GovAlpha was already putting the finishing touches on our Maker Operational Manual during this offboarding. While damage has been minimal, this offboarding might have resulted in much more unplanned labor for GovAlpha. Makerdao.world hosts a wide array of introductory materials that are presently only found there and in the MakerDAO Community Repo.  Recommendations  Create an incentive structure (\u201cgolden parachute\u201d) for teams that complete an end of Core Unit transition. The reward should unlock at key milestones for a smooth transition. This recommendation needs active ownership as it is outside GovAlpha\u2019s wheelhouse. Separating Continuity funds of Core Units from the main operational wallet. Ideally, these should have 3+ signers required from other areas of the DAO to keep excess funds safe and legitimate in the event of an offboarding. GovAlpha will be putting this into practice shortly, and we intend to encourage others to do so as well. Establish standardization/procedure for periodic budget returns. I believe @wouter has already thought deeply about this subject within the context of Auditors Wallets, and we both encourage and offer assistance in crafting a DAO-wide mandate. Amend MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management to provide more clarity on setting up and suggestions for best practices.  In addition to applying practical lessons from our first year with this MIP, I intend to highlight that Proxy revoking powers will only be relevant in issues of lost keys. Expect a replacement MIP to be submitted before May for RFC.   Review access to key infrastructure, attempting to avoid siloed access maintained by a Core Unit that could be offboarded. This is probably best suited for groups like @immunefi-core-unit @daif-core-unit, though GovAlpha is happy to lend our institutional knowledge to this endeavor.  ",

One thing I\u2019d like to add to these points\u2026 although @seth and I never had any issues between us, it is beyond me why all of this unfolded the way it did. That said, there is one person who did not deserve to be caught in the crossfire here, @kat. She joined the CPCU in good conscience, wanting to contribute to Maker in whatever way she could, especially given her ties to its very inception. While working under @seth, to my knowledge, she was not paid for all of her work. Salary, compensation, etc. Parts of it are still owed to her. I do not believe the sum in question is large, but it was something she had been relying on. I won\u2019t begin to speculate on the motives as to why this happened, but it did. Given that I think it\u2019s unlikely we will ever expect to see the funds from the CPCU returned to the DAO, I think it would be fair to offer a one-time distribution to @kat here. I will leave it open for others to comment, and for her to disclose any details about how much they owed her. ",

We have not received work that was requested from her upon that separation. Ambassadors were made aware ahead of time that if this were to be the outcome, the payments would stop as the Core Unit would no longer have incoming budget. They received their final pay as discussed ahead of time and we attempted to communicate with Gov-Comms, Gov-Alpha, and others about the transition ahead of the vote\u2019s outcome but these teams\u2019 \u201cleadership\u201d chose to postpone dealing with the situation until the vote ended. As it stands, being off-boarded involves no \u201cresponsibility to the DAO.\u201d This issue was brought up to SES, Gov-Alpha, mandated actors, and other groups, on multiple occasions when the Core Unit framework was being written/passed through, as well as when the offboarding proposal came to light. The accusations we have unreturned surplus are also ridiculous and unfounded. In no part of the CU framework is the idea of a \u201csurplus\u201d defined; this is one of the many inadequacies of the CU framework that Juan and others were made aware of when it was being proposed. Any funds we\u2019ve retained were granted to us by MKR holders. \u201cnow branded as sponsored by Gold Media instead of MakerDAO.\u201d This event was entirely planned and executed in spite of Growth\u2019s childish attempt to co-opt and take credit for our efforts and paid for with money budgeted to our team.

The post clearly states \u201cWhen the last facilitator is offboarded, Governance should take back the remaining funds.\u201d Governance\u2019s responsibility to the DAO and continual failure to address the systemic issues inherent to its operations is not the responsibility of the ex-CPCU or anyone else. \u201cDecember 7, 2021 - Offboarding the Core Unit is proposed by Deimos 1. Content Production objects to the validity of the proposal, but it is confirmed valid by prose11.\u201d This is a dishonest over-simplification of a situation that involved multiple conversations with Gov-Alpha, Prose, LFW, Tim Black, other Delegates (at the time) and it was concluded that despite being valid, it didn\u2019t seem to hold much weight with anyone. This list does not include the fact that in Nov 2021, our 2nd budget proposal didn\u2019t just pass, it received 100% support from anyone who participated in voting for it.  The admission by MakerDAO that this was mishandled is not our problem or responsibility but if you\u2019re going to continue to attempt to drag us back into this, at least try to be factual and utilize more than hearsay to discuss the subject.

Did Maker holders pay for an event you removed their branding from? Were you always branding all Maker spend as Gold Media?

You did pay me for my work through December 17th, but I also remained at the CPCU and continued working for you until its official offboarding in January.

It seemed to me that you assumed that I had \u201cmade it clear\u201d that I \u201cdid not wish to continue with Gold Media.\u201d I tried contacting you repeatedly to clear up any misunderstandings, but getting a response from you began to seem like a fruitless effort. When I finally did receive a response from you, I expressed my confusion to you. I explained my interests, intentions, concerns, and my side of the story. Yet, to this day, I have still not heard back from you. I\u2019m sure everyone understands how difficult it is to deal with someone who does not want to communicate. Now, imagine my position, trying to issue an invoice to someone who actively avoids me. What is even more offensive and upsetting is that while shrugging me off, you somehow had communication capacity and funds available for the Gold Media Event. You cut me off from communication and used money the DAO gave you for an event unrelated to the MakerDAO brand. There was money for that, but no money to pay me for my work? I didn\u2019t want any of us to be in this position. Publicizing these sorts of petty things is a bad image for everyone\u2026 for me, for you, and the DAO. If you had just communicated properly with me and the DAO in general, all of these issues could have been avoided. @seth, remember, it\u2019s never too late to do the right thing. Own your mistakes, pay me for my work, and return any remaining funds to the DAO. Keep some dignity going forward. We all make mistakes, but you can still save face if you wish to. ",

Will be watching the Ambassador Pilot Program signal this week, regardless of the results I\u2019ll reach out to you @Alefcripto and let you know of potential governance options if a resolution cannot be sorted out otherwise. \u2014- As a brief aside, the goal of this thread was not to establish the validity of attested arrangements, but rather to highlight the vulnerability of the DAO in non-voluntary offboarding situations. The DAO will often not have the ability or direction to sort out these types of agreements, which is why the suite of recommendations to improve offboarding were made in this post. It is my hope that we will learn from the DAO\u2019s first CU offboarding and have procedures in place that mitigate the issues uncovered. There\u2019s a lot more that can be said on this situation, and I encourage that to be done in the forums, though I would ideally like to see this thread explore the issues uncovered and the proposed recommendations. My recommendations are admittedly half-baked and need some community support and ownership to come to fruition. ",
