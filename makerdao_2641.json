With that in mind I also wanted to create another proposal that ensured that certain vaults didn\u2019t get too big relative to other collateral types to ensure the safety of the protocol. For now I think we only need to worry specifically about USDC, WBTC, PAX, and USDT as they are all centralized. It\u2019s important to note before voting that if another collateral type like ETH or KNC was getting too big we have the power to pause DC increases through emergency action. Should we limit WBTC-A Debt Ceiling to a specific max % of global DAI supply?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If Yes, what should that % be?     15% 20% 25% 30% Abstain     0 voters     Should we limit USDC-A Debt Ceiling to a specific max % of global DAI supply?

Once ratified, governance facilitators will be responsible for ensuring automatic debt ceiling adjustments do not exceed the agreed upon percentage. Edit: Had to reset polls to add abstain. ",

                    "content": "Great to see another initiative and the pervious one for ETH. I though think that debt ceiling shouldn\u2019t defined as % of global DAI supply. In our models when we perform risk assessment of collateral, debt ceiling is in majority defined by exchange volume of the collateral and stress testing downside price returns. So DAI supply clearly can not be a input from risk perspective and for some assets it would be just unwise to increase debt ceiling. But I do agree we need a better or new framework for ongoing changes to debt ceiling. Ideally we would simply provide a curve for each collateral type with a DC cap and corresponding risk premiums on its utilization. This isn\u2019t an easy task though and requires a lot of ongoing modelling for each collateral type, but we hopefully get there soon or find some kind of shortcut. ",

                    "content": "I think the answer lies in our ability to have more regular assessment of applicable DC plus SF, but unfortunately exchange liquidity is only one of the many inputs to measure this. Also, now when most of DAI minted is being farmed by same users, I see much less risks in terms of liquidation outcome as many vaults could be unwinded quicker before liquidations happen. Which means exchange liquidity actually plays just a bit smaller role, but is still very important. Since we are understaffed to run these models for each vault type constantly and make assessments for new collaterals we should strive to calculate DC and RP numbers in a more practical way. Give us some time to come up with more practical solutions. ",

Although the other results aren\u2019t actionable at this time, it\u2019s great to have data on what the community thinks of the other collateral types and will be helpful feedback for future debt ceiling discussions and even MIP17 work.
