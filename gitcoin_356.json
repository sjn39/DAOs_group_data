                    "content": " Background @ceresstation suggested that we split our discussion on how to use Vitalik\u2019s Akita donation into proposals.  Proposal Return all AKITA tokens to their source (Vitalik\u2019s sending address) making either an explicit or implicit message that these tokens were sent to the GitCoin multisig address in error.  Open questions Reasoning:  My first concern is that by \u201caccepting\u201d the receipt of these tokens, the GitCoin Mutlisig holders take on unwanted social and (potentially) financial liabilities. I leave it to the community to better define what \u201cliabilities\u201d means. The point is that the liabilities of accepting the tokens outweighs the benefits. Since the tokens first appeared, the conversation about them has taken on an expected, but completely unwanted, negative tone. The AKITA token holder community seems to think GitCoin owes them something (social liability). By returning the tokens both the negativity and any sense of a responsibility relative to the AKITA community is removed. The longer it takes to make a decision vis-a-vi these tokens, the worse the situation becomes. In the hope that the GitCoin community quickly return the focus its limited resources to its primary mission, resolving this as quickly as possible is best. The long term outcome of succumbing to the un-invited demands of the AKITA community will cause other new tokens to follow their lead. If we legitimize AKITA, other tokens will seek similar legitimization. The action we take is precedent setting. The GitCoin community does not want similar situations to happen in the future. Doing anything other than simply washing its hands, will lead to many future examples of tokens seeking legitimacy through GitCoin. As a result, GitCoin\u2019s legitimacy will be diminished.   Not Proposed The following two things are specifically NOT being proposed. If anyone wishes to do any of the below, they should create their own proposal.  I am not proposing that the tokens be burned. I am not proposing that the GitCoin multisig singers should send the tokens anywhere other than Vitalik\u2019s original sending address.  ",

It\u2019s because I agree with everything you say about the expected turn, the liability to the community and multisig signers, and the distraction these tokens are causing. Let me state my slight counter proposal more clearly. Burn all the tokens by sending them to 0x0. My reasoning is twofold:  Julian is right - these were not sent in error. There is a contradiction in what has been said in the other threads. Despite my respect for Adam and others, we cannot say \u201cthis token has no real value, therefore we should sell it (in whatever way)\u201d. This does not compute for me.  If the history of a project suggests there is no real value to their token, then we should act in line with that assessment, and simply burn that which can only be a burden on Gitcoin. Ironically, this kind of principled action - an assertion of communal belief about what \u2018value\u2019 actually entails in web3 projects - simultaneously  creates and secures the economic gain for which the AKITA \u201ccommunity\u201d is calling. I literally cannot think of a better, lived example of what it means to walk the Middle Way. Blockchains enable the deterministic execution of performative speech. Saying \u201cwe don\u2019t think these tokens are actually worth anything\u201d, while simultaneously acting it out is precisely the kind of principled speech-action which might, one day, make these quadratic lands truly sustainable, viable and vibrant. Oh, it also saves us from having to decide who controls whatever \u201cvalue\u201d we extract from any sale, who is liable if anything goes wrong, etc etc - which is the most incredible amount of admin and the least interesting work we could possibly be doing.

[Proposal - Akita] Allow a Vote on the GitCoin proposals for donated AKITA tokens Including both GTC and AKITA holders via Snapshot \ud83d\udcdc Proposal Discussion       I do not believe that the Akita tokens have 0 value since the market says otherwise and certainly don\u2019t believe that there is anything wrong with speculating on any asset, people have traded far worse things than harmless meme tokens.  While one solution is to sell all the tokens at market but that would 1. cause immense slippage. 2.  cause prices to dump and undue distress to the Akita community.  I think the fairest way to distribute those tokens is to airdrop the akita tokens to GTC holder ad\u2026     ",
