                    "content": " Protector MetaDAO Operationalisation Strawman  Content This post contains an attempt at operationalising the Protector MetaDAO (\u201cPMD\u201d) concept in detail in strawman formats for community consideration. It contains:  Strawman I: PMD Operating System & Key Concepts Strawman II: PMD Implementation Projects Strawman III: Maker RWA Exposure Strategy over 12 months  It does not comment or consider the unique Endgame tokenomics - the focus is on the underlying business mechanics only.  Motivation & Next Step I believe we need to get projects underway ASAP to accomplish the Endgame vision within 2023. I also believe that for the Maker Community to kick-off specific PMD projects and allocate budgets, the Maker Community need to see a detailed picture of what the PMD concept could look like in practice and what specific projects would be required to accomplish this. This is an attempt to provide the Maker community with this picture and, based upon community feedback, set the stage for making a set of PMD related specific implementation project proposals in January 2023 - and get quickly to execution. \u2013  STRAWMAN I  Protector MetaDAO Operating System & Key Concepts  Maker & PMD This document does not cover general MetaDAO mechanics or any tokenomics/metanomics. It squarely focus on the governance, frameworks and requirements needed for appropriate collateral management at the PMD level. PMDs, essentially, are allocated capital from Maker that is to support the DAI currency peg and generate yield income. This means certain requirements and processes must be put in place to safeguard Maker against undesirable levels of risk and relationships are taken on by PMDs, yet allow a large level of PMD independence, room for innovation and choice. The following sections, in sum, set out how this can be achieved.  PMD Portfolio Risk Requirements Framework Maker demands each PMD develop a portfolio that exhibits a set of key traits that, together, ensures the portfolio is appropriate for backing DAI. The key degree of freedom for each PMD - and key basis for intra-PMD competition - would be the design and performance of such a portfolio. This is managed via a PMD Portfolio Risk Requirement framework, that must be developed in detail and on a scientific basis together with a professional third-party with experience from building these models with insurers, pension funds and banks. Not only should this framework provide appropriate safeguards, but should also propel DAI into a state of portfolio design and control that should be recognisable as \u201csafe\u201d by international regulators. The below PMD Portfolio Requirement list should only be seen as an example and give the community a flavour of how it could look like. The ultimately list, developed with a relevant professional third-party, would be substantially larger and detailed.  PMD Portfolio Requirement List Example     Component Requirements     Liquidity  30% of portfolio liquidated within 48 hours without haircut  50% liquidated within 72 hours with a max haircut of 1%  80% liquidated within 72 hours with a max haircut of 5%  100% liquidation within 1 month with max haircut of 5% of illiquid 30% portion    Market Value Variation For publicly traded instrument component of the portfolio, max historical st.dev: 5% and max historical draw-down: 10%, max 2y prospective st dev: 5%   Interest-rate sensitivity  Max duration of X  Max convexity of Y    Credit Exposure Requirements  Public Instruments: A to AAA rating requirement  Private Credit Instruments: must be setup to achieve a AA to AAA rating, and\u2026Senior positionDirect access to underlying assetOvercollateralized by more than 125%Credit source must have history of zero losses to Senior componentStructural control via Senior positionHard-asset base only    Discretionary Investment Manager (\u201cDIM\u201d) Counterparty requirements  DIM must have 5+ year, large scale, positive track-record specific to asset class  PMD mandate may only amount to max 20% of the DIM\u2019s AuM in asset class    Concentration Limits  Max 40% of portfolio with one DIM  Max 20% exposure to individual asset class or credit class (excluding US Treasuries)  Max 40% exposure per country (excluding US Treasuries)    Diversification TBD   Legal & Compliance  Full legal compliance required on all asset and investments  Best practice level of documentation and agreements  Best practice level usage of third-party checks & controls    Legal & Regulatory Resilience Multi-jurisdiction Maker holding requirement   \u2026 \u2026     Stress Test Framework The above PMD Portfolio Requirement list would relate to performance under usual market conditions, and so it would be necessary to develop a set of financial stress tests that the PMD portfolio would need to pass on regular intervals. Pass meaning that the portfolio performs as desired under the various stressed conditions. These stress scenarios and pass/no-pass requirements must be built together with revelant professionals. Again purely as an example, one could imagine the stress tests would comprise of a set of simple parameter scenarios and more realistic, complex scenarios. These test would require regular updates.  Simple parameter scenarios examples  Market-values fall by 15% Interest-rate moves up 1% Credit default in markets move up by 2% etc\u2026   Realistic, complex scenarios examples  Persistent inflation over 3 years @ 8% and depression with zero market growth Inflation drops to 2% within 1 year and markets grow at 2% p.a. etc\u2026   Reporting Framework Next step is to connect these framework up with a reporting framework. A reasonable starting set might comprise of: Daily/Real-time Best-estimate, programmatic, real-time valuation of PMD portfolio and components Monthly  Performance reporting of portfolio and components (assets, geography, products, concentrations, terms etc) - i.e. some form of KPI reporting as relevant per asset class and DIM etc For instance on private credit this would include the metrics such as arrears, prepayments and recovery analysis \u2026as much of this on-chain as possible\u2026  Half-yearly  Update showing the PMD Portfolio meeting the Portfolio Requirement list - on a current level and on a 12 month prospective basis Update of stress-test results - showing a pass grade for the PMD portfolio (current & prospective) Reporting on Asset Class on actual, prospective and relative performane Reporting per DIM on actual, prospective and relative performance  Annual Full annual, audited, report and next year expectations and plans for PMD and portfolio. Ad-Hoc Adding/Exiting a new asset class or DIM requires a prospective update of stress test results and showing the Portfolio Requirements list continue to be met. All reporting should be designed transparently and the underlying raw data certified/approved by appropriate third-parties.  Accounting & Definitions Standard Framework A related subject to the reporting framework is a detalied set of definitions and accounting standards. It is somewhat a subsidiary project to the Reporting Framework, but equally important when portfolios across nations and asset classes are to be compared on an apples-to-apples basis.  Documentation Framework PMDs should be required - beyond the above - to document and store all relevant documents, agreements and transactions in a secure manner and with appropriate access controls. It should essentially mirror the quality of the documentation system employed by financial institutions.  Monitoring & Enforcement Framework Within Maker, we would expect there to be constituted a Governance Entity (the RWA Council) (\u201cGE\u201d) responsible for PMDs. The GE should reasonably have something akin to the following duties and underlying basic protocols of action:   GE set, communicate and revise the requirements to PMDs  Requirements appropriateness must be evaluated at least annually and finding presented to Maker Community It is also the duty of the GE to revise these requirements based upon changes to economic circumstances, strategy etc Such evaluation and proposed new requirements must be performed by qualified third-parties and presented to the community    GE monitor the PMDs performance and compliance with requirements  Must monthly issues aggregate PMD performance opinion Must half-yearly issue opinion on PMD requirements compliance based upon the PMD reportings Must annually (and adhoc if desired) perform audit of PMDs operations and compliance in detail. This must be performed by an independent third-party and include sampling, visits etc.    GE enforce compliance with the PMDs  Based upon above monitoring activities, the GE must propose enforcement actions against the PMD as it sees fit to protect Maker for MKR vote. The actions include:  Terminate MetaDAO and run-off portfolio Terminate new deployment in specific asset classes or specific engagement Mandate cash payments or replacement papers from the arrangers and asset managers Restructure portfolio within a time limit   The includes also issuing a Fine to the MetaDAO for non-compliance PMDs may dispute an enforcement decision by requesting a MKR vote on the decision. The voting decision is final.    GE must maintain an RWA Committee consisting of PMD members and outside experts as a sounding board for the judgement calls that GE may need to make in exercising their duties.   GE may propose, at any time, increase/decrease to PMD\u2019s overall Vault Allocation based upon PMD performance.   Important to note that all reviews, audits etc. should probably be conducted by independent third-parties and such work must be kept publicly available. Further to this there must be a governance structure for the GE. It could reasonably look as follows:  Governance of GE  GE members are elected by MKR voting and a GE member can only assume this role for 2 years after which a cool-off period for 3 years exists before the person can be re-appointed GE consists of at least 3 individuals On an annual basis an independent third-party must evaluate the performance of the GE and deliver an evaluation report to MKR holders. MKR holders may discharge a GE member at any time via MKR vote.   Competition between PMDs, Compensation & Dimensions of PMD Choice PMD\u2019s are only, financially, relevant to Maker, if they produce more yield (within appropriate risk constraints) to Maker than a simple investment choice of Maker to deploy assets in US Treasuries/Money market fund/Bank time deposit. Thus a relevant benchmark/floor rate for PMD\u2019s must be set for what yield the PMDs must deliver. One could suggest something like SOFR as a relevant benchmark. Compensation of the PMD must then, equally, motivate for beating this floor/benchmark, and so one could suggest the following simple payment/yield cash flow waterfall from PMDs portfolio:   Floor Benchmark Payment: Pay Maker SOFR  Mgmt Fee Payment: Pay PMD 10% of SOFR  Profit-share Payment: All yield cash flow above are split:  70% to Maker 30% to PMD    How much yield being achieved above the floor/benchmark then, also, becomes a simple basis of competition between PMD\u2019s - and ultimately a way to determine how to weigh capital allocation towards individual PMD\u2019s over time. The proposed numbers above have traditional finance comparables from the investing industry and makes this an easy way for outside parties to understand and evaluate the scope and motivation of PMDs business - aiding in establishing the franchise value of the PMDs.     Component TradFi Comparable Choice of level     Benchmark Yield All TradFi investment activities that are outsourced to a third-party have a target. For public instruments it would be a relevant tracking index - and for private instruments it is often a minimum/floor for what return accrue to the investors ahead of the manager SOFR represents a simple, liquid, money market yield level. Fundamentally the level of return Maker should be able to easily generated without any PMDs   Management Fee A usual TradFi construct to pay for general operational expenses in undertaking the management of assets 10% of yield is unusual. More common would be pct of AuM. For competitive US treasury investment management, the rate could be as far down as 0.07% of AuM, but for private credit it could be ~1%+ of AuM. If we say yield on an overall PMD portfolio is about 4%, then 10% of yield would equate to 0.4% of AuM, which probably might be a good middle ground between the mentioned extremes.   Profit-share This would be a usual TradFi construct when you expect the asset manager to deliver alpha/beat an index or threshold to motivate performance. A such, it fits with the circumstance of the PMD: it needs to deliver excess return above SOFR. 70% Maker, 30% PMD. This is a high share to PMD compared to usual. Private equity would be 20% and for basic equity or bond investing it would be lower again. However, as illustrated below, given the floor benchmark payment requirements actually extends to the Surplus Buffer and MetaDAO tokens of the PMD, this higher over-performance fee may be reasonable risk/return.     Floor Performance Demand against Surplus Buffer & PMD tokens The Floor Payment requirement for the PMDs would go deeper than you\u2019d see in TradFi: The Floor Payment requirement is not just backed by the collateral that the PMD manages for Maker, but also by the PMD\u2019s Surplus Buffer and PMD tokens. I.e. the PMD takes on its account any performance below the floor. You may call this a first loss obligation, but it goes a bit further by the fact that the PMD actually has an obligation equal to floor yield. This is an important mechanism that, over time, as the PMDs Surplus Buffer expands and the MetaDAO tokens contain real franchise value, provides an added level of security to Maker.  Virtuous Financial Cycle between PMD and Maker All the above mechanisms should, in sum, produces a simple, productive virtuous cycle:  Maker allocates asset to PMD PMD motivated via fee structure to maximise yield under constraints Yield returned to Maker and can be used for DSR or other DAI Demand Growth activities that should result in more demand and thus assets under Maker control Maker has more funds to allocate to PMDs   Flexible Framework: many PMD Options and room for Innovation Above presents a flexible framework for a PMD to innovate and make independent choices within. Just a few examples of innovation and choices PMDs could make:  Improve liquidity position by developing standing collateral-based loan facility Improve interest rate sensitivity/Market value variation via hedging Focus on proprietary credit sources and build key credit class expertise with outperformance potential Add/build Surplus Capital and/or source extra Junior Capital structures to improve liquidity and allow further credit exposure Acquire out-of-the-money options to accommodate certain stress tests  All in all, this framework should allow an infinite amount of different PMD portfolio implementations and deliver substantive innovation in finding the right way for RWA to aid backing a DeFi stablecoin. All to the advantage of Maker.  Roles: Maker vs PMD vs Arranger vs DIM It is important to carefully sort through the key roles here to ensure motivations are appropriately aligned and there are no conflicts of interest. The following split should accomplish this:     Party Role Compensation     MakerDAO  Asset Allocation on MetaDAO level  Determine Risk Framework etc  Monitor and enforce on PMD  Net Yield   PMD  MetaDAO process owner and must facilitate MetaDAO decisions on Allocation of Assets and DIMs within Risk Framework by providing independent review of proposals on this as it arrives from Arranger.  Also provide review and quality assurance of reporting and monitoring by Arranger  10% of Yield below floor and 30% above floor   Arranger  Propose optimised Asset Allocation within Risk Framework to MetaDAO  Conduct DIM search and negotiations to best match agreed Asset Allocation and propose to PMD  Design, setup and orchestrated Legal structures and regulatory responses   Reporting/Monitoring-Agent on DIM and legal structures   Trigger enforcement/cure actions against DIM in the event of performance, credit or portfolio covenants  >1% of AuM + 10-15% of Yield above target   DIM Discretionary Investing within mandate AuM + Profit-share (whatever is usual for the relevant asset class)     This should produce a simple and clear situation with clear separation of duties and strong alignment of interests and appropriate checks of alignment along the way:   PMD aligned with target of producing yield under constraints and growing AuM   Arranger aligned with PMD via compensation model, but - importantly - not aligned with any particular DIM - meaning the Arranger can work truly to develop best possible DIM selection and negotiate for the benefit of PMD/Maker. And as the overall arrangement with Maker for an Arranger is larger than it will be with an individual DIM (as there will be multiple DIM\u2019s per Arranger), Maker alignement will always be largest to the Arranger compared to any individual DIM.   Arranger, proposes allocation and selection of DIM to support the allocation - which should be aligned with PMD and Maker, but - to ensure no undesirable alignments between Arranger and DIM have appeared (i.e. fees etc) - and that the analysis of the Arranger stacks up - PMD reviews and proposes/do not propose the allocation and DIM to PMD for final MetaDAO Token decision.   Each DIM engagement will be on market standard terms and so principally be designed to ensure max yield from whatever mandate they may be given.   Legal structure and compliance designed and executed by the Arranger under approval and monitoring of the PMD Cluster. This makes good sense as it keeps Arrangers focused on execution in the \u201creal world\u201d (outward looking), whereas the PMD cluster remains focused on review and representation in the DAO world (inward looking).   Also importantly, this separation, matches the desire for keeping PMD lean and small - and have all day-to-day work put onto Arrangers and relevant third-parties.    Chinese Walls: DIM vs Arranger It would be conceivable that an Arranger could have its own DIM (or vice versa), but - as, for instance, when prop trading and investment banking are both within a bank - it requires strong Chinese walls between them - and that the PMD have reviewed and approved these Chinese walls - and continue to monitor that the walls remain tall and stable. Otherwise the Arranger/DIM business can potentially run foul of self-dealing issues.  PMD/Maker Divorce-papers filed and continously updated Maker may choose to leave the RWA collateral market. For this reason each PMD must have updated action plans for how to handle such a situation. This includes:  Liquidation/sale of portfolio Close down of activities or how to continue MetaDAO close down or how to continue etc\u2026   PMD Collateral Evaluation Minimum Standard/Best Practice Whilst all the above should set alignments between Maker, PMD, Arranger and DIM right - and the overall risk framework with continued independent third-party evaluation - should lead to development of strong and secure portfolios for the PMDs, it would make sense to continually - across PMDs and Arranger - to maintain and update a best practice collateral evaluation standard. A starting point for this could be:     Component Content Parties     PMD Token Holder Decision Summary Should summarize all key findings and evalutions in lay-man readable format PMD Team   Investment/Credit Review & Projections Complete assesment on the merits of the investment/credit. This would be the bulk of the assesment one would expect and should meet the relevant market standard for assessment of a specific asset class Arranger report + Relevant Independent third-party report   Legal Review & Plan Review of both the legal status of the collateral and the Maker holding mechanism. This would also include a plan for how to implement the necessary legal structure Arranger Report + relevant Independent legal counsel report   Counterparty Review Review of all relevant counterparties in the transaction - DIM, servicers, custody, bank etc in respect of traditional counterparty risks (bankruptcy, fraud, regulatory constraints, etc) Arranger Report + Relevant independent third-party   Reporting & Monitoring Review & Plan Set out how reporting will be done on the collateral and how monitoring will happen. Also a plan for how to implement this PMD team   Technical Review & Plan How technically the collateral will be onboarded and interact with the Maker protocol - i.e. smart contract etc etc PMD team + Maker Eco-system Provider   Collateral operational processes Provide clarity on how the collateral is to operate - i.e. onboard, offboard, generate yield, change counterparties etc PMD team   Implementation Budget & Plan Overarching plan and Budget for onboarding of collateral PMD team   Portfolio Projection Update Portfolio Model projections must be updated with the new collateral so a new 12 months projection can be delivered PMD team + independent third-party   Portfolio Requirements & Stress test Update Portfolio, with new collateral needs tested for matching the portfolio requirements and passing the stress tests PMD Team + independent third-party    Some of these pieces probably, particularly on a portfolio level, needs delievered to Maker GE/RWA Council.  Tokenization naturally incentivized in quest for liquidity It is expected that PMDs will naturally be promoting on-chain tokenization of assets, as a key aim of this process is to turn illiquid assets into liquid assets - and thus help the PMDs increase yield without sacrificing liquidity. This again should well-align with the overall desire of Maker to move assets on-chain.  Designed for Regulatory Resilience The total framework above is designed to be in-line with reasonable TradFi regulatory expectation for how to manage large scale assets underpinning a liability akin to a stablecoin - i.e. something in-between a bank, pension-fund or insurer. By implementing a high-quality framework of this kind, any potential regulatory intervention or challenge may possibly be pushed further out, as the relevant regulator will have the least possible concerns about stablecoin holders not being made whole under all-weather conditions. It also squarely puts Maker and the MetaDAO structure in a position of \u201cmatured and safely ready to interact with TradFi\u201d, which should be a valuable position to take as DeFi/CeFi/TradFi should continue to integrate in one shape or another.  Technical: Programmatic Yield & Rev Share Mint Liquidity Module Yields from RWA allocations will ultimately be calculated amounts - not necessarily liquid or \u201ccash available\u201d amounts (take for instance an accumulated ETF, which automatically reinvests all cash flows derived from the underlying investments). And even if the calculated yield amounts are available in cash, they may best be reinvested into current portfolios. Essentially we could have a situation where assets underlying a certain sized vault would just continue to grow in value and make the vault further and further over collateralized. This is, per se, not a problem - no money is lost and DAI remains further and further protected - but this situation doesn\u2019t necessarily deliver any actual capital/cash to Maker Surplus Buffer (or the MetaDAO\u2019s Surplus Buffer) available for expenses, DSR. etc. etc\u2026 The solution seems to be to develop a standard module that looks at an RWA vault vs valuation of underlying assets (according to the accounting valuation framework) and use a rule-set to mint DAI yield and allocate revenue share and yield to MetaDAO and Maker Surplus Buffer. This could ultimately (as the valuation engine of underlying assets matures) be done on a second-by-second basis. To illustrate:  Vault: 100 DAI owed and underlying asset value: 102 Automatically 2 DAI are minted and allocated according to revenue share rules - i.e. say 1.6 DAI to Maker Surplus Buffer and 0.4 DAI to PMD Surplus Buffer Vault: 102 DAI owed and underlying asset value: 102  This could be done manually also, but it seems prudent to turn this into a programmatic event. Worth noting that substantial considerations need to be put into the development of the underlying asset valuation data stream such that this programmatic yield mechanism is not corrupted by temporary whims of market value gyrations. Distributed yield needs to be high confidence value distributions. We expect this to be solved under the Definitions & Accounting Framework. \u2013  STRAWMAN II  Protector MetaDAO Implementation Project This Strawman set out how, in practical projects, how to implement and firm up the details of the above overall PMD operating system  Implementation considerations   Build & Deploy Simultaneously To a large degree we have a situation where we probably need to assemble the plane whilst flying it: Maker probably must, over a 9 to 12 month period, build out both a solid RWA exposure, and an associated appropriate organisation (PMD/GE) around it.  Assemble & Activate Resources First step is assembling and activating ressources - and then pointing them in the right direction via an execution plan - and managing it to get it all on target. In this case this would revolve around activating the relevant clusters with budgets and resources to achieve the tasks at hand. It has the added benefit of allowing the Maker community to see the clusters in action before they may/may not be adopted by a PMD.  Results \u2192 Confidence Nothing is more convincing than results so the implementation plan should preferably contain a chain of results during the implementation.  Communications & Engagement Also a key consideration in the execution plan is the need for sufficient Maker community communication and engagement - and the build up of MetaDAO communities. This must also be included.  RWA Council Challenges: quality build allows hiring of quality There is a need for a RWA council of high international calibre to match with, say, a USD +10B business (aspirational number chosen), however, it may largely be impossible to hire these before substantive progress have been made in establishing a strong base of operations and deployment have been established: few with the right level of financial governance experience may be attracted to work on this until clarity and base performance has been achieved. This is also why quick results probably are necessary and high-quality base performance established - and then this hiring of council dovetailed into it.  Investments & Budgets For management and transparency it is important to clearly identify and allocate a budget on an overall basis to this implementation and equally on an overall basis manage accordingly within this budget. A piecemeal basis will very likely not allow for a smooth and well-managed process - instead it usually results in overspending on nice-to-haves and underinvesting in the need-to-have items.   Implementation Plan     Work Stream Components     Design & setup initial PMD Capital & Risk Management Framework  Estalish PMD Risk requirements Framework and Stress Tests Setup Reporting & Monitoring standards and processes Establish definition & accounting standards Set rules of divorce Set collateral minimum evaluation standards    Establish PMD Governance  RWA Council establishment Rules & Processes design & Implementation (Council, PMD, Arranger, DIM)    Build RWA Exposure & Test Cluster Performance  Empower Clusters & Monitor Execute Interim RWA exposure strategy Setup basic virtual cluster accounting on monitored Collateral    Community Engagement  MetaDAO Commnity Build Up Maker Communication & Engagement    Technical Builds  Technical Implementation of Reporting Plan Technical implementation of programmatic Yield and Revenue share Minting     Underlying these workstream should be a traditional Project Management structure with overall budget control and a project management office tracking and managing for progress. We can now set scope, timeline, resourcing and budget for each component listed under the work streams as example. Won\u2019t do it here in this post, but will try to develop a model in an appropriate project management tool and share. \u2013  STRAWMAN III  Maker RWA Exposure Strategy over 12 months I estimate the Maker Community\u2019s 12 months desires, related to RWA and CeFi to be as follows: Maker wishes the following to be achieved in respect of PSM in this timehorizon:  PSM liquidity diversification away from USDC Yield generation on as large a part of the PSM as possible PSM to be, largely, split between pure RWA and CeFi exposures Appropriate legal claims, control and governance gained on both pure RWA and CeFi exposures  Maker wishes the following to be achieved in respect of pure RWA:  Large amount deployed in secure and liquid instruments with highly rated partners Smaller amount deployed in strategic secure instruments with highly rated partners aligned with Cluster and Makers goals and strengths  Given the activation of the two clusters for undertaking RWA work, the tasks around the above list of desires could - as an example - be split as follows into specific work targetst for the year.     Component 12 months goal Cluster     RWA Liquid/ MIP65  Create liquidity solution on top of assets Create automated reporting tool Change to tokenized asset format  Viridian   RWA Liquid TBD over Q1 depending upon risk framework, market outlook and assets in PSM etc Spring   RWA Strategic TBD over Q1 depending upon risk framework, market outlook, assets in PSM, cluster foci, etc Viridian & Spring    As both Clusters, as part of the Risk Framework work, need to produce test results of their portfolio and make projections for next year, it would be expected that both Clusters also potentially adjusted the portfolios over the coming 12 months to match an emerging Risk framework requirements. Also, over these 12 months, one would expect all current RWA collateral needs to be resolved as either:   Run-off - and this run-off put in place  Adopted by Cluster X - and such adoption put in place  Maker Core Interim Asset - with expiry date and management for such interim asset determined  \u2013 ",
