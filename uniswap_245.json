Additionally, two new bridges \u2013 Wormhole and Layer Zero \u2013 have raised their hands to be the provider for the BNB deployment (in addition to deBridge, the initial bridge selected prior to Celer).\n\nFor cross-chain deployment proposals, we believe it is most important to optimize for protocol security \u2014 specifically, for community members to be able to make informed decisions based on all available information on risks to bridge security. Secondary to that is clarity of process for all governance stakeholders. In order to satisfy both of those conditions, we propose the following next steps for this BNB proposal:\n\n1. **For this BNB proposal only**, we have an additional Temperature Check for the community to vote on the four bridges which have been discussed in the forum or this proposal: deBridge, Celer, Wormhole, and LayerZero.\n\n2. At that point, the winning bridge with the most UNI votes will be used in the final governance vote for the BNB deployment.\n\nLink to the [forum discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734/44).",

                    "content": "0xPlasma Labs and I have been big supporters and contributors to Uniswap ecosystem developments since v1 and all L1 and L2 blockchain ecosystems. Today I would like to raise a very important question that does not leave my thoughts and hear every person\u2019s opinion from the community. The Uniswap ecosystem is crucial in developing the global decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, it has not yet deployed its protocol to the second-largest blockchain infrastructure by volume and user base, BNB Chain. This represents a missed opportunity for Uniswap to expand its reach and potentially drive further growth and adoption of DeFi.  Proposal This proposal will authorize 0xPlasma Labs to deploy the Uniswap v3 protocol to the BNB PoS Chain on behalf of the community. We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).  Uniswap v3 current stats Total Value Locked - $2.6B Chain Breakdown Ethereum - $2.37B Polygon - $99.84M Arbitrum - $84.9M Optimism - $44.53M Celo - $865.4K  Potential TVL + LP Fees from BNB Chain -  50% * $2.73B (PancakeSwap)  Uniswap v3 volume on Ethereum chain  image3354\u00d71400 503 KB  Source: Dune  BNB Chain current stats BNB Chain is a decentralized, public blockchain that operates using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It is designed to support the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and is powered by the Binance Coin (BNB) token. BNB Chain is operated by Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain technology company, but is open to participation and contributions from a global community of developers, users, and stakeholders.  image1634\u00d7450 68.4 KB  PancakeSwap Stats  image2374\u00d71490 315 KB  Source: PancakeSwap  ETH vs. BNB  image2750\u00d7280 56.1 KB  Source: DeFiLlame  The Important reasons why Uniswap v3 should be deployed to BNB Chain as soon as possible   BNB Chain has a large and growing user base, providing a potential new market for Uniswap v3.   BNB Chain offers high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a suitable platform for Uniswap\u2019s decentralized exchange services.   Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi in the Binance ecosystem.   BNB Chain offers unique features such as staking and cross-chain support that could enhance Uniswap v3\u2019s functionality.   BNB Chain\u2019s strong governance model and active community could provide valuable support and feedback for the development of Uniswap v3.   Binance, the company behind BNB Chain, has a strong track record of supporting and promoting high-quality projects, potentially providing valuable exposure for Uniswap v3.   Binance has a global presence and a strong brand, which could help increase awareness and adoption of Uniswap v3 among retail and institutional investors.   Binance offers a range of products and services that could be integrated with Uniswap v3, such as the Binance Smart Chain and Binance DEX.   Deploying to BNB Chain could provide opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other projects on the Binance ecosystem.   BNB Chain strongly focuses on security and compliance, providing a safe and trusted environment for Uniswap v3 to operate.   BNB Chain has a robust ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, providing potential opportunities for collaboration and co-development.   BNB Chain\u2019s support for on-chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven development model.   BNB Chain\u2019s support for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven business model.   BNB Chain\u2019s strong emphasis on community engagement and participation could provide valuable support and feedback for Uniswap v3.   BNB Chain\u2019s commitment to regulatory compliance could provide valuable support for Uniswap v3 as it seeks to expand into new markets and jurisdictions.   BNB Chain\u2019s support for tokenization and digital asset management could enable Uniswap v3 to offer new services and features for users.   BNB Chain\u2019s a fast-developing ecosystem of decentralized finance dapps and assets.    Why BNB DeFi ecosystem needs Uniswap v3  BNB Chain has a big DeFi development community that needs a more advanced DEX ecosystem to boost the general DeFi ecosystem development Bridge supports BNB Chain needs a better liquidity source with less slippage Assets need more reliable DEX infrastructure to provide their users with a better trading experience We need to educate all BNB community about what is real DeFi and yield using Uniswap v3 as a reference.   What can Uniswap Ecosystem get from BNB chain deployment?  Additional $1B of TVL + huge trading volume + earned fees for LPs 1-2M new users + UNI holders Huge respect and appreciation from DeFi devs More adoption for Uniswap NFT Platform (as BNB chain has a weak infra for NFTs)   Financial Incentives for Liquidity We can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and Quadrat Protocol for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users.  Security and Governance Bridge 0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using for the Governance cross-chain infrastructure one of the current ETH<>BNB Bridges: HyperLoop (0xPlasma), Layer Zero, Celer, Stargate.  HyperLoop Overview HyperLoop is a generalized cross-chain message-passing protocol inspired by roll-ups. At a high level, the HyperLoop protocol works by utilizing a network of Executors to observe and attest to messages on a source chain and relay those attestations to a destination chain. \u201cWatchTower\u201d node can disconnect Executors from the HyperLoop protocol if fraudulent attestations have been detected, and utilize Executor stake to payout for transactions on the destination chain. A general L1<>L2 and L1<>L1 communication HyperLoop bridge supports arbitrary message passing. More info on the HyperLoop protocol security: The HyperLoop bridge supports generalized message passing, asset bridge, and swap (using Uniswap v3 and HyperDEX routers) for all supported EVM and non-EVM chains. Applications using HyperLoop are secured by a set of WatchTowers, responsible for detecting fraud in the network. Only one WatchTower needs to be honest for the application to be safe. Instead of a consensus type of bridge, HyperLoop utilizes the over-collateral lending nodes and on-chain whitelists for the Executors. Bridge Executors can\u2019t pass an incorrect message or change the content. Importantly, we\u2019ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity. Security is top of mind for 0xPlasma. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for HyperLoop and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program. You can read more about HyperLoop Bridge&Swap protocol here.  We would also like to discuss with the Uniswap Community the pros and cons of different ETH<>BNB bridges.   0xPlasma Labs Contribution to Uniswap v3  HyperDEX aggregator supports routing via Uniswap v3 HyperLoop cross-chain swap&bridge based on Uniswap v3 liquidity  Quadrat Protocol - active liquidity management for Uniswap v3 positions Multi-chain Portfolio Management on Plasma.Finance supports Uniswap v3 position NFTs   License Exemption We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script.\u201d 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.  Timeline (5-7 weeks) We anticipate deployment of the smart contracts on the BNB Chain to take a few weeks. Additionally, Uniswap Labs has noted that they will need to complete some front-end updates and add the BNB chain to the auto-router \u2014 this will take ~4 weeks and they are prepared to ramp up following Uniswap community approval of this governance proposal. Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge HyperLoop (or using any other native bridge that we discussed with the Uniswap Community).

DeFi Llama has the overall TVL of DeFi at $41B, of which $24B is on Ethereum. The second largest is BSC at $4.5B. Pancake Swap has $2.35B in TVL. Dune reports BSC as having 753k weekly users. Even if that is off by 90%, that is still a significant number of users Uniswap should be pursuing.

For example, Quickswap\u2019s market share on Polygon has almost been totally eroded since Uniswap v3 was deployed.  Overall, we think a deployment would make sense, but we will conduct more research and talk with other voters before formally supporting the proposal. Perhaps the protocol can target an on-chain vote in early January.

I do have a few questions I\u2019d like to ask to benefit Uniswap delegates.  If your team would be managing the deployment, could you give a bit more background information on yourself and your team?  I have a few questions on the Hyperloop bridge as well, below.   When will Hyperloop be deployed - how much has it been tested?   Can you provide more detail on this comment \"Bridge Executors can\u2019t pass an incorrect message or change the content. Importantly, we\u2019ll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity. \". It sounds like due to the existence of WatchTowers, that it is possible for Executors to pass incorrect (or potentially malicious) messages. What are the conditions under which a malicious/incorrect message could be passed to the BSC deployment?   How many Executors and WatchTowers are there today, and who are they?   Thank you again for pushing this proposal forward. Again, we are in favor of a BSC deployment, but first think the community would benefit from more detail on the points above. ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m Alex \u2014 co-founder of deBridge Since BNB Chain doesn\u2019t have any canonical/trust-minimized bridge, I\u2019d like to suggest using deBridge as a secure solution to execute and relay any Uniswap governance decisions from Ethereum to BNB Chain.  deBridge Overview deBridge is a secure cross-chain infrastructure enabling seamless interoperability between blockchains, powering transfers of any messages and liquidity with zero slippage and zero locked liquidity at risk. A transaction through deBridge\u2019s architecture passes through two key layers:   Protocol Layer (on-chain) \u2013 a set of on-chain smart contracts deployed on all deBridge-supported chains. The parameters of the smart contracts, such as fees, chains, and list of validators, are managed by deBridge governance.   Infrastructure Layer (off-chain) \u2013 nodes run by validators elected via deBridge\u2019s governance. These validators also run full nodes on all the blockchains supported by deBridge.  image1400\u00d7438 78.2 KB    According to the cross-chain Deployment Proposals Framework, here are answers to the Bridge Security questions in the context of deBridge: Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, deBridge infrastructure supports any message transfers and has delivered 126,000+ messages since its launch in February 2022. Details of any cross-chain transfer through deBridge\u2019s infrastructure can be accessed by anyone on deExplorer Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or by a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Validation of any cross-chain transactions goes down to social consensus around forks. That\u2019s why canonical or trust-minimized bridges based on light or full clients are possible only between two blockchain ecosystems (normally L1 and L2) as if there is a fork in L1, then there is a fork in L2 and users can always pick which of the forks to use. Non-canonical interoperability layers and bridges can\u2019t be fully trustless by their nature, due to the need to have a validation layer that should at least determine which of the forks is valid and supported by the community, so it\u2019s all a matter of how this validation layer is implemented. Different protocols have different implementations, such as:  Oracle and relayer model Optimistic approach Zk or Succinct proofs Set of validation nodes  deBridge validation layer uses a \u201cdelegated staking and slashing\u201d with a set of validation nodes, optimizing for security and speed. All validators are elected by and work for deBridge governance. To be confirmed, a transaction must be signed by at least \u2154 of the validators, i.e., 8 out of 12. The validators are disincentivized to act maliciously as they bear financial risks through a delegated staking and slashing module. deBridge plans to scale its validator set, increasing the threshold of signatures required for message validation, and thus enhancing the protocol\u2019s overall security. Thanks to off-chain validation, the validators don\u2019t need to communicate with each other, thus their IP addresses are never exposed, increasing the overall security of the infrastructure. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? As described in the previous paragraph, any bridges and interoperability layers (except canonical ones) have to rely on the validation layer. deBridge leverages professional infrastructure providers to validate cross-chain messages passing through deBridge protocol. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? In order to forge a message, \u2154 of deBridge validators would need to collude and each one would need to provide a signature of the malicious message identifier. deBridge validators are professional infrastructure providers that validate many other protocols and blockchains. All validators bear reputational and financial risks What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? The validators are disincentivized to act maliciously as they bear financial risks for their service as per the delegated staking and slashing module. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Security has always been the top priority for our team. deBridge and its\u2019 periphery modules have been audited 17 times by Halborn, Zokyo, Ackee Blockchain, and Neodyme. Additionally, deBridge offers a $200,000 bounty program on Immunefi. All the findings and remediations can be seen in the published security audit reports available in the public Github repository Additional resources: Documentation portal Developers portal deBridge explorer deBridge team will be glad to facilitate the development and security audit of all smart contracts needed to relay and execute Uniswap governance decisions from Ethereum to BNB Chain. If deBridge is chosen as messaging provider, our team will cover costs for the security audit, performed by our long-term security partner Halborn We welcome any questions about deBridge in the comments below ",

This is a governance bridge, and the Uniswap treasury is held on L1, so the main risk is a malicious governance proposal pointing the fee switch to a malicious address. This would siphon off funds while L1 governance deploys a new proposal to turn off the fee switch and de activate compromised bridge. zk, optimistic, and light client \u201cconanical\u201d bridges are what we should be shooting for. Even then, I\u2019m personally not fully convinced on Optimistic Fraud proofs but many in this community are. While I think while they aren\u2019t ideal, this is an acceptable risk tolerance for the governance use case. Network of Validator bridges are glorified multisigs and should have a high level of scrutiny applied to them. cryptographic security >>> crypto-economic incentives I don\u2019t think Network of Validator bridges are inherently unacceptable for Uniswap, but it\u2019s important to realize they come in all shapes and sizes. It is important to ask a lot of questions such as:  Validator set size, and more importantly, who is running these validators Signing threshold; does any small combination of entities running validators meet this threshold Does required stake/slash make it significantly unprofitable to exploit bridge  I mostly worry that many networks may have a single entity managing a large set of the validators, and a single phishing email could compromise a large set of the signing keys. Uniswap is not ready to adopt a single bridge provider (and therefore, in my opinion not ready to expand its cross-chain ventures beyond governance), and therefore this risk is only relevant to the governance problem. The above scrutiny on network of validator bridges are not specific to any of the providers mentioned in this thread- just want to make sure community analyzes risk appropriately. ",

I believe the Uniswap community understands and evaluates the risks of cross-chain governance messaging using the current bridge infrastructure. As many chains, where Uniswap v3 will be deployed in 2023, don\u2019t have a zk or optimistic bridges, we have to rely on other trusted providers of bridge infrastructure. That\u2019s why I proposed a list of the potential bridges (deBridge, Celer, Stargate, Layer Zero) to proceed with the feather governance voting on a new chain. Also, the bridge risk can only arise on subsequent votes regarding fees in the protocol, and potential financial risk can only be expressed in a maximum of a couple of hundred thousand dollars not earned by liquidity providers in a short period of time. Ultimately, this risk cannot affect the liquidity allocated in the protocol. And also this bridge risk is not affecting the initial protocol deployment for this proposal. The initial Uniswap v3 protocol deployment to BNB chain (or to any other chain) will include all fee tiers (1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.01) so probably the governance won\u2019t touch the protocol for the entire year or two. This period will be more than enough to explore the most trusted bridge infrastructure until the next on-chain proposal for Uniswap on BNB chain. Looking forward to further discussion. ",

                    "content": "Exciting proposal for sure. Mo from Celer Network here. I would love to introduce Celer and also respond to the questions listed here.  A quick introduction to Celer: Celer is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users.  How to build Uniswap\u2019s cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models) Celer IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with FutureSwap since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the application design pattern. When a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call sendMessage of a \u201csend box\u201d contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision. This message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain. A message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call executeMessage of a \u201creceive box\u201d contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract. The validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain. However, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the second security model: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a \u201cquarantine zone\u201d for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from \u201ctrust majority stake\u201d to \u201ctrust any\u201d with app developers capable of running one of the \u201cany\u201d App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module. Once the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process. Next, we answer the questions raised in the post.  Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Of course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains.  Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? This is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description. As discussed above, Celer\u2019s generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celer\u2019s security models: Celer comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis.  Cosmos-consensus Security Model  By default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELR\u2019s value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions.  Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model ( what should be used in this case )   1600\u00d7706 130 KB  So, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario. Instead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be \u201ccommitted\u201d to the blockchain by SGN into a \u201cquarantine zone\u201d for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be \u201cconfirmed\u201d and pushed to the final destination application. During this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celer\u2019s construct will still maintain safety property without any concern.  Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the \u201ctrust-any\u201d model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure.  Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? When operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain. This is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain.  What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Their CELR stake will be slashed.  Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? Celer was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified. ",

Below is a list of the immediately relevant contracts:  BSC Testnet Uniswap V3 Factory contract: link  BSC Testnet Message Receiver Adapter: link  BSC Testnet Message Bus: link  Goerli Message Bus: link   Test use of the Celer Messaging system:  Message sent from Goerli: link  Message queued for execution on BSC: link  Message executed: link   At a high level, we can see the Uniswap v3 protocol has been deployed on testnet and that Celer successfully passed a message from an EOA on Goerli, which implemented an additional fee tier on the BSC testnet deployment. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the work that Ilia and his team have performed. However, in reading through Celer\u2019s deployed contracts and documentation, we have a few concerns and questions we would like addressed. The Message Bus contracts on Ethereum and BSC mainnet have an owner role. The owner controls access to the following functions: setFeePerByte, setFeeBase, setLiquidityBridge, setPegBridge, setPegVault, setPegBridgeV2, setPegVaultV2, and transfer ownership. In addition to this access, since the contract is upgradable, the owner is able to upgrade the implementation of the contract, which means anything is possible. The owner on the Message Bus contracts is the \u201cSimpleGovernance\u201d contract. However, the governance contract functions akin to a multisig since it has five voters with equal voting power. We were unable to find information regarding the five EOAs on the contract, however they appear to be active.  0x1b9dFC56e38b0F92448659C114e2347Bd803911c 0x34dFa1226F8b3E36FE597B34eEa809a2B5c0bBf9 0xDfE4F07D1F36B8d559b25082460a4f6A72531de2 0x9F6B03Cb6d8AB8239cF1045Ab28B9Df43dfCC823 0x2FB8783C14A71C08bFC1dE8Fc3D715Dd93039BF2  After reading through the contracts, we tried to find more information on how their \u201cOptimistic-rollup-style\u201d security model works. We were able to find this blog post & doc page, but it only had the same information from the forum post. We did find this reference to a \u201cDelayedTransfer\u201d, but it is unclear how this is \u201coptimistic-like\u201d rather than a simple delay. We were also unable to find documentation or implementation instructions for running an app guardian. If the Celer team could please share the technical documentation and implementation of their proposed security model, we would appreciate it. While the messaging contract appears to have been audited, their audits are from PeckShield & Slow Mist which do not inspire a high degree of confidence. Both audits were conducted in February 2022, before the addition of the delay mechanism. We continue to be supportive of a Uniswap v3 deployment on BSC; however, the Celer team controlling ownership of the Message Bus and limited information on the security model makes it hard for us to support the proposal.

The passed decision is executed on the destination chain only in case the content of the messages sent by all bridges participating in the framework is matching. deBridge team can help to prepare this framework so that Uniswap governance can have an established process for adding any new chains in the future ",

                    "content": "GFX Labs team, thank you again for your questions. We would love to provide some responses to your questions.  On audits and security track records First, we would like to elaborate a bit on our security audits and track records. We respect that different people may have different opinions about security firms, but we believe that both Peckshield and Slowmist are well-regarded security audit firms. Peckshield, in particular, has been consistently the first to report many security incidents and coordinate major security investigations with top security researchers and firms such as banteg, samczsun, and others. If you have any specific concerns about the quality of these firms, we would be happy to relay them and invite these firms to answer or clarify. Regarding the audit dates, we built Celer\u2019s system in such a way that our optimistic rollup-like security model can be securely and easily added to dApps as a design pattern. The capability to do so has been available before Feb 2022, and we only began talking about it proactively later when we realized that some teams were marketing it as a unique feature. In addition to security audits, Celer also has a standing $2M bug bounty on ImmuneFi since November 2021, which has not been claimed yet. In terms of our security track record, Celer\u2019s cross-chain system is the ONLY ONE that has processed a meaningfully large volume (bigger than $1 billion in asset bridging volume) without any critical security issues being reported or exploited. Additionally, throughout Celer\u2019s development history since 2018, none of the systems or products built by Celer, including the world\u2019s first Generalized State Channel Network, have been exploited in any way. Celer has a security operation team that is active 24/7 to monitor the public blockchain transactions for any anomalies related to Celer\u2019s systems and respond to any reports from security firms and independent security researchers with a 3-minute SLA. Of course, we know blockchain is a dark forest and  our flawless record does not automatically guarantee future security, but we hope that the information provided gives you more confidence from a comparative perspective.  On optimistic rollup-like security model The security model of the optimistic rollup-like system has two components: 1) a two-phase commit pattern in the smart contract, and 2) an off-chain App Guardian that can halt the execution of a message during the delay between commit and confirmation. We would be happy to explain this in more detail using the DelayedTransfer example you mentioned. DelayedTransfer is related to the optimistic-rollup-like security model used in cBridge, an asset bridge built on the Celer Network. When an asset bridge transaction is initiated and the message is relayed to the destination chain, the message is placed in a DelayedTransfer queue on the destination chain, where it must wait a set delay before funds are released with a confirm transaction. During this delay, an App Guardian cross-checks the source chain to verify the presence of a corresponding bridge transaction. If a match is found, the App Guardian takes no action and the confirm transaction is executed as normal. However, if a matching transaction is not found (indicating a problem with the bridge), the App Guardian can halt the asset bridge smart contract, preventing any malicious transactions from executing and safeguarding funds. The App Guardian is operated by every validator of SGN and can also be run by additional parties, such as the Uniswap foundation, for their own dApps. The above security model will be applied to Uniswap\u2019s governance use case. We hope this explanation has provided clarity, but we are available for further discussion via a call or in a Twitter space. We have recently taken down some of the documentation and reference implementation for the dApp side of the optimistic-rollup-like security model, in order to make it more adaptable for various application use cases.  We will follow up with links to the updated documentation and App Guardian repositories within the next two days.  On governance multisig You are correct in noting that the MessageBus contract is upgradeable through a governance multisig. Our governance process involves a community voting process, and the execution of governance decisions for on-chain contract upgrades is carried out by a subset of validators including InfStone, Binance Staking, OKEX and Celer Foundation. We made the MessageBus upgradeable with the goal of making it easier to address any potential security issues just in case and add must-have features. However, we approach this process with care and continually evaluate and improve our governance process. We welcome additional active contributors such as GFXLabs to be more involved. We hope the above clarifies the concerns to some degree and we are always happy to answer any further questions! ",

                    "content": "Hi Mo, I love the tech that you\u2019re building at Celer, but I think that the Uniswap community may misinterpret a number of your points, so these need to be clarified.  Consensus Model When you say a \u201cCosmos-consensus Security Model\u201d or \u201cL1-PoS-blockchain security mode,\u201d someone may interpret that Celer inherits the security model from the Cosmos chain or from the layer-1 where the message was initiated \u2014 both of these statements are not the case. Instead, it is accurate to say that with this model, the Celer network is using Tendermint and Cosmos SDK as a set of ready-to-use tools and technologies for implementing consensus and networking layers for the project. The PoS consensus implementation allows anyone with \u2154 of the voting power (i.e. \u2154 of the amount of staked tokens) to have full control over the consensus and validation of cross-chain messages. The current total stake is 2,587,158,380 CELR and thus, if nodes with more than 2/3 of the total stake act maliciously, they can forge any message. 7 nodes currently have enough stake to control consensus. \u2154 of the total current stake is 1,724,772,247.33 CELR \u2248 $25M at current market price. This is the approximate cost that would allow an attacker to withdraw liquidity from all Celer liquidity pools and forge any message to extract value from any Apps built using Celer Network, and, importantly, I assume the potential value extracted by an attack on Uniswap may be higher than the cost of attack. The only staked asset is the CELR governance token, which means that validators\u2019 collateral directly correlates with the protocol\u2019s performance. This is why an attacker could open a large short perpetual futures position before attacking the protocol, and recover/hedge the cost of their acquired stake. Having more than 2/3 of the protocol voting power would allow a malicious entity to control the consensus process and make arbitrary decisions about which blocks to add to the blockchain, forge cross-chain messages, reverse and censor transactions, create fake transactions, and create their own set of validation nodes. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but this attack can be performed by any single whitelisted Celer validator now.  Optimistic security model You may say that the described problem can be solved through an Optimistic rollup-like security model which is the second alternative provided by Celer. My guess is that this wouldn\u2019t add any additional security to the validation layer for a few reasons:  The optimistic component can always be implemented on the application level, where the receiving smart contract in BNB Chain can have a \u201cquarantine zone\u201d for a configurable period of time, during which whitelisted App Guardians can cancel execution of the message content. If any app can easily add an optimistic component, then why should it be provided by the interoperability solution itself as a second security model? If an optimistic approach is implemented into the interoperability protocol itself, it delegates responsibility from the validation layer of cross-chain infrastructure to the application, which should elect \u201cApp Guardians\u201d who become participants of the new validation mechanism. This approach performs implicit change from the \u201cshared\u201d to \u201cisolated\u201d security model of the validation layer. The reasoning behind why the isolated security model is not suitable for a validation layer can be found in this L2Beat article and my Twitter thread.  I\u2019m not trying to attack a competitor here, I want to make sure that all trust assumptions and risks are made clear for the Uniswap community, as Celer has been endorsed in the temperature check.

This post suggests serious security risks.  I know BSC is attractive considering its TVL, but this could have serious implications, no? ",

                    "content": "Hi Everyone, In light of our concerns with Celer, we thought we should propose a solution to the Uniswap Community. To effectively but quickly evaluate cross-chain messaging protocols, we came up with a few key criteria to asses protocols.  How long has the system been running, and how much value has it been responsible for? What degree of security and decentralization do they offer? Have their contracts been audited & do they have a bug bounty program? Do the contracts have an owner? If so, what can the owner do? Does their documentation clearly explain how their system works, not just in concept but, most importantly, in execution? What do we know about the team?  It\u2019s a mix of subjective and objective items that have helped us navigate the space. Through this process, Wormhole stood out to us, so we decided to see how the rubber met the road. To best understand the technology, we deployed a copy of Uniswap v3 onto BSC\u2019s testnet and developed a message sender and receiver contract. Deployed Contract Addresses  Uniswap Factory Contract: link  Uniswap Wormhole Message Sender: link  Uniswap Wormhole Message Receiver: link   Transactions   Message Sent to add two additional fee tiers.  Message Received and added two fee tiers.  The current flow:  At the Uniswap Message Sender (Goerli) - sendMessage(targets[  ],values[  ],data[  ],messageReceiver). The message is encoded and published. The function is only callable by the contract owner. For testing purposes, it is currently an EOA, but in production, it should be the Uniswap Timelock contract. Wait for the guardians to complete their verification process. Since we have hardcoded the consistencyLevel to 1, it will wait for finality. Once the Verified Action Approval (VAA) is published, then we may proceed. At the Message Receiever (BSC testnet) - receiveMessage(bytes[  ]). The contract calls Wormhole\u2019s core bridge contract to verify the VAA. After it verifies the sender is the Uniswap Message Sender contract, it verifies the message has not already been processed and will finally execute the message.  There are three key points. First, the Uniswap Message Receiver must verify the sender is the Uniswap Message Sender. Second, the content received must be the content sent. Third, the message must not have been previously executed. We would love it if the community reviewed our work. We believe utilizing this configuration for the BSC deployment makes the most sense. If we proceed with this implementation, we\u2019ll conduct an additional test to verify this works with the Uniswap Governance system and coordinate with Ilia. On a related note, from having spoken with the Wormhole team, it\u2019s our understanding that Wormhole is also preparing a forum post with additional information. ",

                    "content": "We had the chance to connect with @ilia_0x yesterday over Telegram \u2014 we\u2019ve answered the questions you\u2019ve posed to us! The Wormhole community is excited to throw our hat in the ring, and we look forward to engaging with the Uniswap community more broadly  Hi everyone \u2014We\u2019re Wormhole, a leading arbitrary message passing protocol that connects 22 heterogeneous chains. Today, the Wormhole community includes several independent core contributing teams as well as a network of 19 industry leading Validators securing the network. The Wormhole community is investing deeply in a fully trustless future and is working on a Zero-Knowledge (ZK), light client based, backend designed to deprecate the Guardian software. Once enabled, chains can trustlessly validate other connected chains.   Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? a) Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with 2 million messages currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.   Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? a) Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found here: https://wormhole.com/network/ b) As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.   Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? a) Wormhole message security waits for both consensus to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.   Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? a) All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). b) While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. c) Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would simply build \u201cedge contracts\u201d to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.   What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? a) Wormhole\u2019s Guardians are leading PoS validators and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. b) There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn\u2019t enough to establish the super-majority required to gain quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.   Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? a) The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings here. Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole\u2019s already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform review the protocol\u2019s security.   As these 3rd party audits are completed and issues are sufficiently addressed, we make those audits public.

                    "content": "Hey Alex, thank you for your comments. Always great to have discussions with fellow builders in the space. Here are some quick replies:  Consensus model  What do we mean by \u201cCosmos-consensus Security Model\u201d or \u201cL1-PoS-blockchain security mode\u201d When we say L1-PoS-blockchain security model, we mean that the consensus algorithm is essentially acting like any other PoS blockchain. The closest in terms of consensus algorithm/mechanism is Cosmos-SDK/Tendermint chains such as Polygon PoS, BNB Chain or Sei Network. This is to stress that Celer uses a time-tested consensus engine and economic security engine, unlike some other multi-sig solutions or solutions with untested economic security models. We are not saying in any way that Celer\u2019s shares the exact same PoS setup with any other blockchain.  Consensus failure != all money stolen Unfortunately, you are not correct in stating that if the PoS consensus fails (2/3 stake colluding to behave maliciously), all liquidity in Celer\u2019s Bridge can be withdrawn. This is precisely where the model of optimistic rollup-like security model shines. cBridge is built with this model from day 1 and even if the majority stake is acting maliciously, large fund withdrawing (in a cumulative sense) transactions can be canceled by any Celer validator plus a group of app guardians from security firms such as Peckshield and others. So what you described won\u2019t happen. From a more practical point of view, Celer validators are highly reputable validators from the Cosmos community and incidentally share many with deBridge we believe.  Optimistic rollup security: application design pattern or protocol built-ins? Implementing an optimistic rollup security model can be done in the application domain and in the protocol at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive. For Celer, every single validator can cancel messages that are maliciously passed by the consensus protocol if the message is sent through an OR model. This enhances the security from trust majority to trust-any validators. In addition, application builders, governance bodies or security firms independent from application builders can run app guardians for specific applications even if they don\u2019t trust any validators in Celer. For example, Certik, Trial of Bits and other security firms that are independent of both Celer and application builders can run app guardians for applications to offer \u201cexternal security firms certified\u201d services. The architecture is highly flexible with a high level of redundancy. ",

If we exclude Pythnet, there are 719 message per day in the last 7 days on Wormhole. To put it into perspective, Celer processes 1958 messages per day during the same period of time. In addition, we could not find any contract address deployed on Pythnet based on your documentation section describing contracts deployed on supported networks. With the lack of information and significantly skewed volume, could you please elaborate on the Pythnet use case so everyone in the Uniswap community has a clear understanding on the usage level of Wormhole?  Who are sending all the 2M messages? Where are those messages going? If there are 2M messages initiated from Pythnet per day, does it mean that there are 2M transactions somewhere on a destination chain? We searched from all your public contracts but did not find the matching 2M transactions. Could you please elaborate?

Since you have done an evaluation of multiple solutions using the criteria you mentioned and are now championing one single solution, could you please post the evaluation matrix with facts for all the criteria? With this, different solution providers can clarify if needed, and the Uniswap community and delegates can do a peer review and make informed decisions. Many community members and delegates may reach different conclusions by looking at all the facts. In addition, we would add the following criteria to the evaluation matrix:  Are there any closely resembled use cases already live and running in production? What is the security track record of the protocol? What are emergency response plans or security operation measures in place to prevent and/or limit the scope of unforeseen smart contract bugs and consensus/multisig failures?  However, we feel that we may be having the wrong discussion here. Cross-chain governance is a unique use case and it can be built as a vendor-lock-in-free architecture where multiple cross-chain solutions can co-exist to serve Uniswap with super-charged security properties.

Is the $320 million that was exploited still an issue that could impact protocols using Wormhole\u2019s bridge solution in the future? @modong what are the risks related to validator\u2019s using Celer native token as stake to be slashed? If Celer token prices get low enough, could there be malicious actor\u2019s/validator\u2019s that see more opportunity in the value of the bridge assets vs being slashed in Celer? Would be good to have a combination of bridges, but due to my unfamilarity in this area I am unsure what is possible. ",

                    "content": " A Vendor-lock-in-free Universal Governance Mechanism for Uniswap In this sub-proposal, we present a vendor-lock-in-free Universal Governance Mechanism (UGM) for Uniswap that utilizes multiple cross-chain protocols simultaneously. This architecture significantly enhances the security of Uniswap UGM and, at the same time, eliminates any potential alignment risks down the road. While we believe that Celer alone can effectively solve the Uniswap UGM use case, as a long-time advocate for open protocols, we propose this solution with the best interest of the Uniswap community in mind.  Which one to choose? Wrong question! It may seem that Uniswap\u2019s delegates and community must make a choice to select a single cross-chain messaging protocol for Uniswap\u2019s multi-blockchain expansion. However, if we go down this path, it will be a TRAGIC day for Uniswap community because Uniswap, the most open dex in the world, will be vendor-lock-in to a single cross-chain protocol. Vendor lock-in carries a multitude of risks, most notably:   Security risk: Uniswap will be relying on a single cross-chain protocol and if that cross-chain protocol is hacked, Uniswap will also be at risk.  Interest alignment risk: This lock-in makes it harder for Uniswap to switch out of the solution even if the interests between the cross-chain messaging protocol and Uniswap become misaligned down the road.  But are we asking the right question? Does Uniswap have to choose one single solution between different ones or can it utilize multiple solutions to achieve a better outcome for the community?  An Open UGM for An Open DEX Cross-chain governance use cases have the following properties:  No room for security breaches as governance decisions are mission-critical parameters for the protocol with astronomical financial impacts Latency is flexible with the governance process being multi-day if not longer Costs are secondary due to the low frequency of governance decisions  With these properties, it is a perfect use case to utilize multiple cross-chain messaging solutions simultaneously. We propose utilizing multiple cross-chain solutions simultaneously through the use of a \u201cMessageProcessor\u201d contract that acts as the executor for UGM calls to Uniswap contracts on the Binance Chain. This contract would have the following functionalities:  The ability to receive messages from multiple cross-chain messaging solutions through one interface. An internal state machine to track messages received from different protocols and to release the message and trigger governance decisions only when a threshold is reached. The capability to remove and add different cross-chain solutions using the same UGM mechanism with potentially different thresholds.  This architecture ensures that even if a single bridge is compromised, Uniswap\u2019s governance process remains intact. Additionally, the Uniswap community can continuously evaluate participating cross-chain protocols with all bargaining power on their side. We believe this architecture should be implemented to avoid vendor lock-ins, even if the Uniswap community decides to use a single cross-chain solution for now. Celer is committed to a vendor-lock-in-free future and is more than happy to implement this vendor-lock-in-free UGM for Uniswap. ",

                    "content": "Thrilled to see the community support for expanding Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain. BNB has long been a thriving part of the LayerZero ecosystem as BNB Chain was one of our initial launch chains and Binance was our first investor leading our seed round. The BNB Chain team and the Uniswap Foundation recently reached out to LayerZero Labs about this opportunity and connected us to Ilia at Plasma to submit a proposal. Backed by a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, and Binance to name a few, LayerZero is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL. Builders include SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, BTC.b, Pudgy Penguins, Radiant, Stargate, Kanpai Pandas and many more unannounced integrations. Notable bridges built with LayerZero include the rebooted Harmony Bridge, CoreDAO bridge, and the Aptos Bridge.  Since our last proposal, we have built a fully functional governance implementation for Uniswap based on specs provided by the community and feedback from delegates and university groups, which is currently under audit with Zellic and Ottersec. These audits will be complete with fully tested code ready to be deployed within the next 2 weeks. Uniswap v3 was approved by the community for deployment on both Moonbeam and Gnosis Chain last year. With this implementation, Uniswap can swiftly deploy Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain, Moonbeam and Gnosis maintaining a unified multi-audited governance model for interacting with all cross-chain deployments of Uniswap v3. With the community\u2019s support, Uniswap v3 can expand to all three ecosystems in as soon as 2 weeks! The complete omnichain governance module for Uniswap can be found here.  1600\u00d7900 87.5 KB  How It Works LayerZero is a lightweight universal messaging interface that allows developers to seamlessly interact with contracts across dozens of blockchains. LayerZero Endpoints rely on an innovative architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and independent Oracles and Relayers to securely relay messages between chains.  1600\u00d7643 70.3 KB  Communication flow in a single LayerZero crosschain transaction. In a single call, paying only source gas, users and protocols can send a message (or a bundle of messages) to contracts on any supported chain. Thus, users are able to create a single contract that is capable of interacting simultaneously across multiple chains via our arbitrary messaging primitive. LayerZero is currently live on 25+ chains including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Gnosis, Metis, Aptos, Celo, Moonbeam and Fantom, and on testnet and undergoing audit on 6+ chains including Solana among other non-EVM chains.  With a fully functional governance implementation, Uniswap can quickly deploy Uniswap v3 to all chains that LayerZero supports without compromising on security or introducing the complexity of multiple cross chain messaging protocols and services. Security FAQ Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? LayerZero enables smart contracts in disparate blockchains to communicate via arbitrary message passing of bytes payloads. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? The current recommended configuration is secured by Chainlink as an oracle entity (currently securing tens of billions of dollars) and the LayerZero Labs (currently securing billions in TVL) operated relayer entity. All applications building on LayerZero have the choice to opt-in to default security or select a set of oracles and relayers. The architecture is entirely modular to allow Uniswap to run any portion of this validation layer if they so choose i.e. additional relayers and/or oracles. LayerZero is a true protocol comprised entirely of immutable smart contracts and is not dependent on LayerZero Labs to be leveraged by applications in perpetuity. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity? LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol\u2019s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN). Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? LayerZero provides the most secure solution for communication and puts control directly into the applications hands. It is worth noting that it is technically impossible to enable communication between blockchains in a fully trustless manner. Via the LayerZero protocol, the only way a fraudulent message may be passed to the destination chain is if both the Oracle entities and Relayer entities \u2013 selected by Uniswap - actively collude together and against the application to approve a fraudulent message. Additionally, LayerZero is secured by a Pre-Crime, the proprietary security layer which has successfully secured the protocol and applications like Stargate since May 2022. Pre-Crime takes an outbound transaction and makes sure that it\u2019s legitimate by running it against a set of application-defined invariants before the delivery of each message. Pre-Crime first forks every chain locally then it runs the state transaction locally to make sure the resulting state meets the list of defined invariants the application sets. Once this is confirmed Pre-Crime then provides an attestation that this is a legitimate transfer and the message is delivered.  1600\u00d7830 76.2 KB  What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Applications own all their smart contracts and maintain the ability to swap out Oracles and Relayers and/or expand their sets at their community\u2019s discretion. Participating entities, including Chainlink, in the LayerZero network are thoroughly tested and vetted against rigorous standards in order to be supported in LayerZero documentation and are subject to re-evaluation at any time. Refer to an overview of Pre-Crime above for the additional security layer designed to prevent malicious actors from successful message delivery. We designed LayerZero to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? LayerZero Labs has commissioned 35+ audits with the most recent audits on Github here. Nearly all code written by LayerZero Labs since inception have been immutable smart contracts audited externally and rigorously reviewed internally at least 3+ times each. LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15m. Our sole focus at LayerZero Labs is building best-in-class cross-chain infrastructure. We have infinite runway and are building for the developer community. Learn more at Developers | LayerZero. ",

                    "content": "Kydo from Stanford Blockchain here. We would love to chime in on the bridging part of this discussion. Message passing is hard. So please do not take the rest of this as criticism.  First, to echo a few things @devenmatthews and @GFXlabs said earlier.     devenmatthews:  cryptographic security >>> crypto-economic incentives   No amount of dollars can help you forge a digital signature. So, we believe in the future, when cryptographically-secured message passing exists, Uniswap should heavily prioritize it (not choosing it straightaway since the complexity could also increase attack surfaces).     devenmatthews:  Does required stake/slash make it significantly unprofitable to exploit bridge   This is an important question to answer explicitly with data (this behavior \u2192 this slash amount, etc). Moreover, we would add that the provider should lay out how to become a validator in the network.  This demonstrates how easy it is to collude across your validator set.     devenmatthews:  Uniswap is not ready to adopt a single bridge provider   We should not lock in one vendor when the possibility of choosing multiple exists.     GFXlabs:  While the messaging contract appears to have been audited, their audits are from PeckShield & Slow Mist which do not inspire a high degree of confidence. Both audits were conducted in February 2022, before the addition of the delay mechanism.   The recency of the audits is very important. These unaudited features, especially the delay mechanism, should not be implemented by Uniswap before a formal audit is complete.     GFXlabs:  Does their documentation clearly explain how their system works, not just in concept but, most importantly, in execution?   Moreover, if your system requires honest interactions with external third parties, you should clearly explain how the external third parties work or link to their technical documentation (in another thread).  Second, we want to explore further the A Vendor-lock-in-free idea from @modong  We believe the best way forward, especially after the Nomad hack, is to use multiple bridge providers for message passing. We do not believe this is theoretically hard but would require significant engineering hours. We would love to see more discussion surrounding this topic.  Lastly, here\u2019s what we think about the current providers. We do not have the expertise to analyze the actual implementations and understand the complexity levels of each codebase; so we made our decision based on the assumption that all these implementations (up to the most recent audit) are equally secure/insecure. Our ranking is subject to change, based on answers provided by the service providers. Our tentative ranking is as follows:  Wormhole Celer & LayerZero  To us, all these providers pose significant risks (relative to native L2 bridges or light client bridges). So, the ranking should not be taken at face value that any provider is \u201cbetter\u201d than another. Note: we are talking about using this for governance instead of a simple bridge transfer. So the evaluation criteria are a lot stricter. We ranked wormhole as number 1 because of its diverse validator set. However, we would love to understand how does Wormhole penalize malicious validators? Does Wormhole have legally binding agreements with each validator? If so, what actions can Wormhole pursue? We ranked Celer and LayerZero second. Celer has a decently sized validator set but the economic guarantee behind them is much weaker. I do not see that being a fixable problem, therefore I placed them (Celer) second. LayerZero depends heavily on Chainlink\u2019s oracle relay service. However, I was not able to find any information with regard to Chainlink\u2019s implementation on their documentation or your website. Can you share more with regard to how does this specific chainlink oracle work? And if it is similar to Chainlink\u2019s price feed, who are the multisig signers (providers) for it? With regard to the relayer, other than LayerZero, is there any other entity running a relayer? If Uniswap wants to run our own relayer, can LayerZero commit human capital to assist us in running it?  Summary We believe the best course forward is the Multi-Provider-Aggregation method. I would love to hear thoughts from other technical delegates on the difficulties of the design and a potential timeline. If the above method is infeasible, I would recommend using Wormhole at this point. However, BNB Uniswap should have the ability to switch the message-passing provider at a later date through governance. We hope @devinwalsh could open a new thread specifically for x-chain messaging outside this one since this discussion is going to be important for future and past x-chain developments. Edit 2: Add clarification around ranking. ",

                    "content": "Hi all! Thank you for your comments and discussion over the past few days. As you have seen in the forum, new information on the bridge selected in the Temp Check proposal (Celer) has been made available since the Temp Check took place. Additionally, two new bridges \u2013 Wormhole and Layerzero \u2013 have raised their hands to be the provider for the BNB deployment (in addition to deBridge, the initial bridge selected prior to Celer). For cross-chain deployment proposals, we believe it is most important to optimize for protocol security \u2014 specifically, for community members to be able to make informed decisions based on all available information on risks to bridge security. Secondary to that is clarity of process for all governance stakeholders. In order to satisfy both of those conditions, we propose the following next steps for this BNB proposal:   For this BNB proposal only, we will have an additional Temperature Check for the community to vote on the four bridges which have been discussed in the forum or this proposal: deBridge, Celer, Wormhole, and LayerZero. This proposal will be kicked off by 0xplasma team at ~6 AM EST on Friday Jan 27 and last for 5 days until ~6 AM EST Tuesday Jan 31. (To be clear, we do not intend for this to set a precedent of bridge-focused Temp Checks in the future. We speak to creating an improved process in the future below) Snapshot poll is live now: Snapshot  At that point, the winning bridge with the most UNI votes will be used in the final governance vote for the BNB deployment. The final governance vote will kick off on Tuesday Jan 31 after the completion of the Bridge Temp Check.  Looking forward, it is clear that cross-chain proposals can be improved for all governance stakeholders. Assessments of bridge security are time intensive and require significant technical expertise and context. Tomorrow morning in a new forum post, we plan to propose an initiative which aims to provide the community with an independent technical assessment of bridge risk for the community\u2019s benefit. We plan to move this initiative forward ASAP so the results may be leveraged in upcoming cross-chain proposals. ",

                    "content": "@GFXlabs team, thank you very much for your replies. We want to summarize and supplement some of our answers to your questions.     GFXlabs:   The Message Bus contract has an owner which can upgrade the contract implementation, thereby changing the logic.    It does have a multisig owner that can upgrade the contract logic. However, for Uniswap\u2019s use case, the upgradability won\u2019t pose a risk because even if a fraudulent message is passed to the destination chain somehow (be that due to a malicious contract upgrade or validator consensus failure), the App Guardian will be able to stop that message from being executed.     GFXlabs:   We don\u2019t know who the EOAs are on the SimpleGovernance contract.    Celer has a total of 21 validators, which are highly reputable PoS validators securing chains such as Binance Chain, Avalanche, Cosmos and more,  such as Binance, Everstake, Infstone, Ankr, Forbole, 01Node, OKEX, HashQuark, RockX and more. Many of them are shared validators with Wormhole. For the simple governance contract used to upgrade smart contract,  the signers are InfStone, Binance Staking, OKEX and Celer Foundation. We will add that to our documentation section.     GFXlabs:   You did not share any further documentation on your \u201coptimistic-rollup-style\u201d security model.        GFXlabs:   You did not share any further documentation regarding running an app guardian.    Apologies that we forgot to follow up on this. For the most direct reference, please see the reference implementation of the  \u201coptimistic-rollup-style\u201d security model that is running for Uniswap testnet and updated doc on how to run an App Guardian.     GFXlabs:  If we are understanding this correctly, the App Guardian has the ability to pause the bridge contract  autonomously if no matching transaction is found. Can you please confirm this point or point us toward documentation?   This is correct. However, this is only for the cBridge use case. For Uniswap\u2019s use case, the app guardian set can be different.     GFXlabs:  Separately, to address your latest post, \u201cA Vender-lock-in-free Universal Governance Mechanism,\u201d this forum thread is only regarding the BSC deployment.   There might be a misunderstanding. The vendor-lock-in-free architecture is relevant in this case because it applies whenever a new chain is added to Uniswap\u2019s supported chains. For this BSC deployment, multiple bridges can be used simultaneously to achieve much better decentralization and security. To @Kydo team, Thank you for your review and comments.     Kydo:  We should not lock in one vendor when the possibility of choosing multiple exists.   We 100% agree. deBridge, Celer and you all raised the same point. That is half of the active participants in this discussion. This is not hard to do. In addition, we offered to make an implementation available within 72 hours. Unfortunately, despite all the above, an option to build a vendor lock-in-free architecture was still not made available in the recent temperature check for the Binance Chain deployment. There might be a strong and valid reason to push the deployment of a less open architecture under an extremely tight deadline. If you still would like to support this open architecture for an open dex like Uniswap, please vote for Celer. Regardless of the outcome of the temperature check, we will implement the architecture in a vendor-lock-in-free way in 72 hours and conduct audits with community-approved firms to make it readily available as a contribution to the Uniswap community. Even if it is too late for Binance Chain, we sincerely hope that future Uniswap expansion can be done using this open and flexible model and the value of Uniswap community can remain open and decentralized. We hope our push for open and decentralized architecture can be heard in this community.     Kydo:  but the economic guarantee behind them is much weaker.   Could you please elaborate on this concern? Celer is run by 21 validators who are all renowned PoS providers,  such as Binance, Everstake, Infstone, Ankr, Forbole, 01Node, OKEX, HashQuark and RockX, many of which overlap with Wormhole\u2019s validators. In addition, Celer contains built-in slashing mechanisms. Wormhole does not have any economic security or slashing built in the protocol. If there is any other centralized/off-chain agreement, we hope wormhole can make them known to the community. Just by looking at this comparison, a reasonable level of economic security in protocol >> 0 economic security in the protocol. Of course, Celer is also working towards building additional zero-knowledge-succinct-proof-based cross-chain message-passing mechanisms that remove the responsibility of message correctness/security from the validators altogether and only rely on them for liveness.

                    "content": " Proposed implementation of a Vendor-Lock-in-Free Universal Governance Mechanism for Uniswap We appreciate deBridge being included as one of the solutions proposed in the temperature check, but we\u2019d also like to support points raised by @Kydo and @modong and express concern that the current temperature check process seems rushed in the sense there are options proposed by participants of the discussion that have not been explored. Moreover, we agree with Kydo and Mo that Uniswap should not lock in one vendor when the possibility of choosing multiple exists with a similar level of complexity to the proposed single-bridge solution. Uniswap must consider several key objectives \u2014 to achieve a decentralized and resilient solution with no one point of failure, and to enact a solution that is consistent with the stated goals and objectives of the Uniswap community. In order to achieve this, Uniswap must avoid reliance on any one bridge/interoperability protocol.  A bridge-agnostic solution Thus, we present a bridge-agnostic approach for Uniswap Cross-chain Governance which suggests leveraging multiple bridges for passing Governance Actions to secondary chains, and executing such Actions only whenever each was delivered by at least a given number of trusted bridges. At its core, we propose using a set of permissionless smart contracts on both chains (the master chain \u2014 Ethereum in this case \u2014 where Governance resides, and any secondary chain \u2014 BNB Chain in this case, though there can be more) which together form a permissionless multibridge transport protocol on top of existing battle-tested governance model for secured delivering and executing cross-chain governance actions.  deBridge_uniswap1920\u00d71002 153 KB   Technical breakdown The first layer of this approach is a permissionless Uniswap Multibridge Sender contract, which is directly controlled by the Governor contract. This contract is responsible for keeping the whitelist of trusted bridges Governance decided to use for message passing, and their corresponding permissionless Bridge Adapter contracts. Whenever there is a necessity to execute a Governance Action in a secondary chain, a Proposal to call a Uniswap Multibridge Sender contract is published using the existing workflow. When a Uniswap Multibridge Sender Contract receives a Governance Action from a Governor contract, it triggers permissionless Bridge Adapter contracts for every corresponding trusted bridge. These Bridge Adapter contracts are needed to unify interfaces and behavior that are typically different across cross-chain bridges\u2019 contracts. When the Bridge Adapter is triggered, it calls its bridge\u2019s Gate/Relayer contract, passing the Governance Action as a message and specifying the address of the corresponding trusted permissionless adapter on the other chain as a receiver. Every time the message is successfully broadcasted to the destination chain by any of the trusted bridges, it actually lands on the corresponding destination Bridge Adapter (as specified upon sending). This message is here transformed into a unified structure with technical metadata taken from the bridge\u2019s gate/relayer. This metadata may include the address that actually initiated a cross-chain call. The unified structure is then passed to the Uniswap Multibridge Receiver Contract, which authenticates the message by checking that it was sent by and received by trusted Bridge Adapters. Then, the actual Governance Action is extracted from the message and is passed to the Delegated Governor contract along with a bridge ID it was sent through for a staging phase. A Uniswap Delegated Governor Contract accepts Governance Actions from the Uniswap Multibridge Receiver Contract it trusts, grouping them by their hashes and by the bridge IDs they were broadcasted through. Whenever the number of messages coming from different trusted bridges and shipping the same proposal reach the consensus (for example, \u2154 of delivered messages), this proposal is allowed to be executed normally, as it happens within the existing governance framework used by Uniswap.  A more resilient and decentralized solution The beauty of this approach lies not only in the fact that it is completely bridge-agnostic and thus won\u2019t get stuck due to a third-party failure, but also in fact this approach and any of its underlying components may be governed the same way Uniswap is governed: whenever there is a necessity to disable a specific bridge, or add another one, or change the expected threshold of delivered messages \u2014 a Governance votes for Proposals on Ethereum which emit cross-chain Governance Actions, which are then broadcasted and executed as prescribed. In conclusion, this bridge-agnostic approach will better prevent message forgery while increasing the durability and deliverability of messages, creating a more secure solution that is consistent and compatible with the governance logic of Uniswap. Crucially, this design allows for flexibility and fault-tolerance in the event any participating bridge fails without recovery. A lot of good business shapes for this approach are described in @modong\u2019s comment Finally, this generic framework is more scalable than the single-bridge framework \u2014 it can be replicated for additional chains, enabling Uniswap to integrate new chains efficiently and safely while having full control over bridge-selection (useful in the scenario the chosen bridge does not support a new chain). If deBridge is chosen for the temperature check and further governance voting, the Uniswap-deBridge integration will be built in the context of this bridge-agnostic framework and thus, will enable other bridges to participate.

                    "content": "Hey everyone, Porter and Guy writing from a16z. Given the expiration of Uniswap V3\u2019s BUSL license in early April, we\u2019re generally in favor of deploying Uni V3 to other chains before that date to avoid the copy-paste rush that will likely ensue otherwise. This has the added benefit of ensuring there\u2019s an official deployment cycle so users on those chains can trust they\u2019re using the original code base \u2013 preempting possible bad actors or just carelessness. Deploying Uni V3 obviously won\u2019t forestall forks from occurring, but at least it offers an official version to users seeking that forum. Additionally, as @devinwalsh\u2019s comments suggest, we would also be in favor of a more formal process for choosing third party service providers or integrations for Uniswap going forward. In our eyes, it\u2019s important that Uniswap is able to create a level, objective playing field for all parties wanting to build or aid in its development. The community remains the ultimate decider once those conditions are set, but it\u2019s key to foster a structured process that enables outside parties to fairly compete on the merits of their proposal. Like anything else, this competition benefits Uniswap long-term as a credibly neutral, market-based platform. It should receive the best services, at the best prices (if pricing is included) by choosing from the widest selection of parties given the same set of operating instructions. A structured process allows time for appropriate due diligence, weighing of pros and cons for each provider, and a comparative analysis that is difficult to conduct otherwise.  For transparency and timing, and because an end-to-end process has not fully occurred for this particular vote, the second part of this post outlines our preferred choice for Uniswap\u2019s bridge provider. To that end, we believe that LayerZero offers the best bridging solution \u2013 for transparency, we invested in them. We believe they are the most secure, decentralized, and philosophically aligned partner for Uniswap. Full investment disclosures can be found here. You can read our original investment thesis here for historical context. LayerZero uniquely offers the capability for Uniswap to own its own immutable smart contract, while also enabling Uniswap to change or upgrade the security model of the bridge at the community\u2019s discretion in the future. They\u2019ve also delivered: LayerZero built out an omnichain governance module for Uniswap, found here. Our support in LayerZero\u2019s offering stems from its: (1) Immutability - Uniswap can deploy LayerZero\u2019s contracts and own them without having a dependency on LayerZero. Other bridge deployments can be changed by the bridging provider, but Uniswap could choose to be the only one with the capability of upgrading its bridge. (2) Open and permissionless nature - LayerZero is open source, modular, and ownable by the applications that integrate it. Please see LayerZero\u2019s implementation for a Uniswap governance executor open source here. Uniswap can future proof its deployment by choosing the oracle, relayer, validation library, and blockchain confirmation parameters in its deployment. (3) Creation of extendible immutable validation libraries - LayerZero is building multiple validation libraries and provides the most modular bridging architecture we\u2019ve seen. Uniswap could choose to implement a new validation library (a ZK light client for example) when it becomes battle tested. Importantly, this upgrade could only be done by Uniswap itself. LayerZero enables Uniswap to own and run its own bridge. To highlight a critical point, LayerZero alone offers the ability for Uniswap to run its own Oracle or Relayer network using the LayerZero architecture, providing the most secure and modular message delivery system because Uniswap itself is participating in its execution. If the Uniswap community sets its oracle, relayer, validation library, and block confirmations in the endpoint settings, there is nothing anyone else can do to change it \u2013 it is immutable and only in the hands of the Uniswap community. This embeds flexibility to also take advantage of future cryptographically secure validation layers. Others have brought up the core concern of security considerations. To date, LayerZero has processed over $5B in transactions with over 700 applications deploying 2,000 contracts without a single hack. Other bridge providers cannot point to this track record. Past performance is not an absolute guarantee of future success, but it is a strong indicator. To @GFXlabs\u2019 first evaluation criteria, \u201cHow long has the system been running, and how much value has it been responsible for?\u201d In our opinion, LayerZero has a demonstrated track record of success at scale that is unique amongst bridge providers. In this vein, cross-chain Uniswap deployments should not compromise the decentralization of the protocol unduly, or introduce unnecessary risk without careful consideration. We do not believe that arbitrarily upgradable contracts owned by the underlying bridging provider or controlled by an external third party are in line with the ethos of community-centric, decentralized governance. LayerZero offers a credible alternative to that reality for the Uniswap community. While we currently believe LayerZero is the best option, we will evaluate any other proposals in good faith and ultimately vote for what we think is best for Uniswap. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time and consideration. ",

Chiming in on behalf of Blockchain at Berkeley: We want to echo earlier statements by @devenmatthews and express support for the points raised by @modong @AlexSmirnov @Kydo and others that a multi-bridge, no lock-in solution is essential for the future health of cross-chain UNI governance. Given the ongoing scrutiny and cooperation with the bridge providers, we believe that a temperature check for specific bridges at this stage may not be the most effective approach. Currently, it is difficult to make a point-to-point comparison between the proposals from the four main contenders, since there is not enough detailed information on the proposals. Providing detailed, finalized proposal summaries from the bridges is essential for the community to decide on the best providers to move forward with. It is important to note that there are some concerns regarding all the existing bridge providers and their ability to fully meet the needs of Uniswap\u2019s governance message passing. While we recognize that each provider has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, it is essential that a thorough evaluation of all proposals is conducted to ensure that the best solution is chosen for the community. In particular, issues such as decentralization, economic incentives, and transparency of operations should be carefully considered before making a final decision. Furthermore, we suggest that it may be beneficial to consider an alternative approach, such as outlining specific requirements for the ideal Uniswap bridge and choosing a vendor based on their ability to meet those specifications. This could help to avoid the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d problem and ensure that the best solution is selected for the community. ",

The following are key topics and outcomes from the discussion shared publicly for the community\u2019s awareness: \u2014LayerZero\u2019s omnichain governance executor (complete open source code here) is designed to enable Uniswap governance to add, remove, or swap validation layer components directly from on-chain votes via GovernorBravo. What this means: Security of the protocol\u2019s cross-chain governance can scale with the protocol over time. Governance always maintains the ability to propose and vote to change parameters which, if passed, are executed on-chain via GovernorBravo and amended in the smart contracts owned by Uniswap. \u2014LayerZero created and deployed a gasless oracle for applications to participate easily in their own security \u2014Major Uniswap delegates and top stakeholders (such as the most strongly incentivized investors of the protocol, L1/L2 Foundations, and major security and infrastructure platforms) can run a gasless oracle as part of the network. To provide additional context, several of these organizations are already actively involved in the ongoing decentralization of LayerZero\u2019s validation layer. What this means: We\u2019ve implemented a gasless signing mechanism to allow a group of ad hoc parties to easily manage an ad hoc oracle network between them. The gasless oracle is a brand new feature we had planned to announce in late February; documentation will be completed shortly. The LayerZero Labs team will commit dedicated human capital and technical resources to assist teams to fully run the node; estimated set-up time is less than 2 hours from end-to-end per team. We propose that Uniswap utilize a gasless oracle of at least 5+ signers. We recommend a consensus grouping of the most respected industry entities and aligned parties with Uniswap (which Uniswap has already done an amazing job attracting via its Delegates) which will provide the most secure and aligned security structure to the protocol itself. \u2014We propose that at launch, Uniswap chooses to pair a gasless oracle run by a minimum of 5+ significant Uniswap delegates and the LayerZero Labs relayer as their validation layer within the broader LayerZero security model. In the future, governance may choose to update these hyperparameters via an on-chain governance process enabling robust, flexible, and governance driven security. We thank the delegate groups who reached out to us for their time and commitment to Uniswap governance and look forward to conversations with more stakeholders over the coming days. ",

And their ability to change Chainlink with a set of Uniswap-aligned oracle validators is very promising. For total transparency, LayerZero reached out to us and addressed most of our technical concerns. One thing we believe we undervalued, in our initial assessment, is the immutability of the bridge. Many hacks happen because of simple upgrades. Under LayerZero\u2019s design, the underlying infrastructure (LayerZero protocol) is immutable. The changeable parts, the Oracle (header sync) and Relayer (MIP), can only be changed by Uniswap governance. Given the immutability and LayerZero\u2019s new proposed Oracle, we would like to signal to the community that we have tentatively moved LayerZero as our preferred bridge provider for BNB. We would also love to see more documentation provided from LayerZero\u2019s side, especially around the oracle and relayer services. ",

So I want to first say we\u2019ve never spoken to GFX Labs (despite reaching out) and although we now have time scheduled tomorrow (Monday), this analysis was written without a single question sent to us. I\u2019ve gone through and done a line-by-line response to everything above but wanted to tl;dr some of the obvious mistakes in the analysis in case they get lost below in the broader post. Firstly, GFX Labs missed the _getAppConfig() function which is the very first line of validateTransactionProof() with comments \u201cRetrieve UA\u2019s configuration using the _dstAddress from arguments.\u201d  11600\u00d7149 106 KB  Taking a look at this function, you can clearly see that the first thing that it does is retrieve the User Application\u2019s config and the default config.  21600\u00d7113 87 KB  Then it goes through each config item and if and only if the configurations are not set, the contract sets it to the default config item.  31154\u00d7150 17.7 KB  The crux of the GFX Labs argument seems to be centered around the perceived ability for the LayerZero ULN owner to be able to modify application parameters, however this is clearly not possible and enforceable in the immutable base layer of the code.     GFXlabs:  Hi Everyone, Several folks have asked for our opinion on the current vote and the abnormal governance process.

Oracles are responsible for moving block headers from the source to the destination. Upon delivery, Relayers can deliver the transaction\u2019s proof to the destination Endpoint. This model, in its current implementation, is a 2-of-2 msig.   This seems clearly misleading as the two parties (oracle and relayer) are abstracted accounts with arbitrary implementation e.g. a fully decentralized network, not to mention the current proposal which I had assumed GFX Labs had reviewed extensively prior to this is for a new architecture with a number of major Uniswap delegates participating within the validation set.     GFXlabs:  Messages are sent to a verifying library. The verifying library (VL) manages oracles and Relayers on behalf of the application. The Ultra Light Node (ULN) is a VL. The Endpoint manages the relationship between the user application (UA) and the VL (the ULN, in practice). The UA selects a VL via the Endpoint. The UA may also configure that VL directly (e.g. by selecting a Relayer in the VL). Relayers submit proofs to the VL (the ULN, in practice), and the VL chooses how to validate these. In the ULN, the owner chooses proof validation libraries and may choose any contract.   The owner of the ULN contract cannot choose proof libraries on behalf of the user application. The owner can only add new proof libraries (i.e. append-only registry) of which the user application can select from.     GFXlabs:  Applications are intended to choose their own VL & Relayer since they can configure which library to use in the Endpoint contract. The Endpoint owner sets a default VL. However, the ULN is the only verifying library that exists, so all apps must use it.   The ULN can hold multiple validation libraries within itself for applications to choose from (ex. A zk-Validation Library could be added to the ULN V2 as a different method for verifying messages). This is an explicit design decision; LayerZero\u2019s architecture supports the evolution of best cryptographic security practices. These libraries and the ULN itself are immutable and only by selection of the user application. Most other bridges and messaging protocols offer blanket validation techniques and only upgradeable smart contracts. Many notable hacks have occurred due to a buggy upgrade forced upon applications built on top of a bridge\u2019s infrastructure, including two identical instances from Wormhole resulting in a $10m bug bounty paid and then later reducing their bug bounty from $10m to only $2.5m.  41600\u00d7381 161 KB  To be clear, both of these issues are completely separate from the $325m hack Wormhole suffered. We believe critical infrastructure should be immutable, open source, and always owned by user applications.     GFXlabs:  We tried to review how the Relayer worked, but according to the docs the Relayer is not open-source at this time, which seems to line up with L2Beat\u2019s concern of the Relayer contract being unverified.   It is common practice to not open source or verify Oracle and Relayer smart contracts. These smart contracts are only responsible for on-chain quoting in gas. All validation logic resides immutably in the messaging library. In a competitive marketplace of Oracles and Relayers, unique pricing mechanisms are often the proprietary edge for providers. These smart contracts can only quote pricing and do not affect security in any way, therefore being verified is irrelevant to its purpose.     GFXlabs:  Additionally, the only info we found in the governance section was \u201cinfo coming soon!\u201d This was not the answer we were expecting since there is an owner on the Ethereum Endpoint and UltraLightNodev2 contracts.

The governance section of our documentation is in reference to the upcoming open source governance module we proposed in this forum thread (see above). The Endpoint Contracts are for setting default configurations for developers to be able deploy and test easily. It is recommended that applications desiring more control over their security opt to set their own configuration settings. Default configuration cannot override user application configured settings; this is an explicit design decision and a feature of a true protocol. The UltraLightNodeV2 settings are a combination of default configurations and one-time setters for adding new chains and proof libraries. The multisig owner cannot change any existing configurations set by the user or modify any existing validation libraries.     GFXlabs:  onlyOwner functions on the EndPoint contract:  setSendVersion setDefaultSendVersion setDefaultReceiveVersion renounceOwnership transferOwnership  onlyOwner functions on the UltraLightNodeV2 contract:  setLayerZeroToken setTreasury addInboundProofLibraryForChain setDefaultConfigForChainId setDefaultAdapterParamsForChainId setRemoteUln setChainAddressSize renounceOwnership transferOwnership  The ULN\u2019s owner can set the oracle, relay, proof systems, and other security parameters. It appears that the owner can entirely bypass the oracle/relay system in their current implementation.   This statement is both entirely verifiably false and addressed in the opening part of the post.     GFXlabs:  Through this process, we arrived at the conclusion that Layerzero is not ready to be integrated with Uniswap. However, as developers ourselves, do we realize that the development process is fluid and that research is ongoing. Our vote reflects the current state of development and available information.   I hope the line by line was helpful. I know we haven\u2019t gotten to speak yet but looking forward to speaking to GFX Labs tomorrow and addressing any outstanding concerns and walking through the proposed security configuration in detail. -raz ",

                    "content": "Hey all, it\u2019s Abdullah from Blockchain at Michigan Firstly, we are glad to see the community\u2019s ability to coordinate an unorthodox approach for deciding the Uni<>BNB bridge via an extra temp check. In an instance like this, it is imperative that we derive a quantitative measure for what the community is feeling as opposed to a soft metric like forum-based sentiment. To that end, we believe that instead of prolonging the bridge discussion beyond necessary means, it is important for us to efficiently decide on a single messaging system. After one solution is implemented, we can focus on a multi-bridge system. The primary reason for this haste, as @Porter mentioned, is the limited amount of time we have to deploy Uni v3 prior to the license expiring on April 1st of this year. Perhaps this urgency is not warranted for other L1s\u2013but for BNB Chain, quick deployment is necessary due to the BNB community\u2019s hankering to quickly deploy forked code (the BNB ecosystem is very much quantity over quality at the moment) and capture much of the present user activity. As of now, we are inclined to side with LayerZero for handling cross-chain governance. We put Wormhole and Celer in a similar bucket due to their reliance on a validator set, emblematic of a proof of authority mechanism. Naturally, such designs are less decentralized and subject to collusion. Potentially, Celer\u2019s current total stake is not large enough from a dollar-value standpoint to be secure. Over time, this should resolve since the ability of an entity to buy up 2/3 of staking dominance will become harder\u2013granted the SGN system proves viable over time and the CELR token remains strong. As for Wormhole, they have stood the test of a major exploit and have since made their system more robust, with a continual promise to prevent future exploits via a large bug bounty program and a multitude of audits. However, our main contention with Wormhole is, again, the limited 19-entity validator set. We realize the credibility of the guardians and how much stake they have to lose from a reputation perspective. But when the going gets tough, entities often focus on doing whatever they can to merely survive, forgoing their pristine reputation. We are not limiting the merits of Wormhole or Celer; however, we feel that when the option to select a system that allows for a higher degree of control over the messaging stack is present, we should select that method. LayerZero would allow the Uni community to control its parameters (oracle and relayer) however it deems fit without the risk of collusion between a handful of validators. Yes, the risk assumption for LZ is that the relayer and oracle are themselves uncorrupted\u2013Uniswap is not likely to face this issue. Unlike other applications using LZ, Uniswap has a robust, distributed governance base. The alteration of the relayer and oracle would require the community to collectively decide parameters, making malicious activity very difficult. That is, unless a hacker alters the parameters by subverting the governance process somehow. We will cast our vote later tonight after our final discussions with Jump and LayerZero. ",

                    "content": "Hi Raz, We devoted a chunk of time to reviewing and researching a bit over the last few days. The questions and concerns raised in our message come from our good-faith efforts to review the resources available. To recap, as part of our review of Celer\u2019s system, we identified significant differences between what was advertised and what is actually happening. Since then, we\u2019ve been attempting to verify anything we read on the forum as part of our own due diligence process. We have made efforts to review each bridge with the limited knowledge and resources we have available. While we have a pre-relationship with Wormhole, GFX only works with projects that we believe in and have first-hand knowledge about. Our primary duty, however, is to advocate for Uniswap\u2019s success. While our post might, in hindsight, contain some inaccuracies, it was made with good intentions after reviewing publicly available documentation and included an open offer to utilize your technology \u2014 importantly, many of the core criticisms remain. Regarding the only owner functions. We\u2019ll edit our prior post to reflect that change. Thank you for the clarification.     raz:  This seems clearly misleading as the two parties (oracle and relayer) are abstracted accounts with arbitrary implementation e.g. a fully decentralized network, not to mention the current proposal which I had assumed GFX Labs had reviewed extensively prior to this is for a new architecture with a number of major Uniswap delegates participating within the validation set.   LayerZero is running the Relayer, and Chainlink is running the Oracle. While these are independent entities of which multiple could theoretically exist to process messages, only two exist at this time. This is functionally a 2/2 multisig, both parties must agree; otherwise, the message will not be processed. We were able to find information on how to run an oracle, but as you said, the existing relayer is currently closed source, and we cannot find an MVP example for a full relayer setup (both on and off-chain components).  Could you help us understand what would happen to message passing if either of these two systems went offline? What would happen if the two systems colluded? We assume the goal is to have multiple relayers. Can you estimate when you think the code or simpler version of the relayer might be released so additional members can participate? What is the incentive for new participants to join the system as an oracle or relayer?  As for the unique signing model proposed, we\u2019ve discussed with a few delegates about utilizing a multisig for UniV3 deployments over a bridge and came to the rough conclusion that delegates would not be comfortable being on that multisig due to the perceived legal risks. Our intent is not to need additional signers. Thus our efforts have been put toward finding a bridge partner. The recommendation of additional signers seems to speak to the lack of parties participating in Layerzero 0. Suppose Uniswap was to consider the signer method. Would it not make the most sense to utilize Chainlink\u2019s Oracle system directly, with the Uniswap signers filling the role as the relayer? It seems that would be the strongest combination because the alternative would be to remove the most secure component (Chainlink) from the stack and replace it with the least secure solution (Uniswap Signers).     LayerZeroLabs:  The current recommended configuration is secured by Chainlink as an oracle entity (currently securing tens of billions of dollars) and the LayerZero Labs (currently securing billions in TVL) operated relayer entity.   To make sure we are on the same page - is this also the only current possible configuration, assuming that Uniswap does not take charge of the Oracle or Bridge duties?     raz:  In a competitive marketplace of Oracles and Relayers, unique pricing mechanisms are often the proprietary edge for providers. These smart contracts can only quote pricing and do not affect security in any way, therefore being verified is irrelevant to its purpose.   If this is the case, then what is the true cost of using L0 as a relayer? Assuming that Uniswap will not move to run its own relayer, is there any other mechanism to prevent a monopolistic relayer from price-gouging messages through an upgrade? If not, how quickly would Uniswap be able to modify its cross-chain infrastructure such that it could continue performing cross-chain messaging at a reasonable price?     raz:  The owner of the ULN contract cannot choose proof libraries on behalf of the user application. The owner can only add new proof libraries (i.e. append-only registry) of which the user application can select from.   Thank you for the clarification.     raz:  The governance section of our documentation is in reference to the upcoming open source  governance module we proposed in this forum thread (see above).   While that makes sense, we think it would have saved a lot of time for everyone if the owner functionality was better documented.     raz:  I hope the line by line was helpful. I know we haven\u2019t gotten to speak yet but looking forward to speaking to GFX Labs tomorrow and addressing any outstanding concerns and walking through the proposed security configuration in detail.   Thank you for the prompt answers. We appreciate the clarification, and I\u2019m sure the other delegates reading the thread do as well. As a final request for now, can you please deploy your proposed system on testnet and link the relevant transactions as we have done with Wormhole? We don\u2019t want to delay the BSC deployment any further than necessary. ",

We\u2019ll preface by saying that considering how \u201cunexpected\u201d this discussion arose, we appreciate the UF team for their quick thinking and on the feet decisions. When looking at the main debate surrounding L0 and Wormhole, we\u2019re still internally conflicted on which is ultimately the best, and think each has benefits of their own. Ultimately, we don\u2019t think this proposed structure of finding a bridge partner is ideal and sets a bad precedence. We propose:  A working group that gets set up will \u201cwhitelists\u201d all bridges looking to be a bridging solution. This can be confirmed with a governance vote if deemed necessary. Once a bridge passes this step, they will enter an \u201capproved\u201d pool When \u201cx-chain\u201d wants to deploy, they can work out individual relations with any \u201capproved\u201d  bridge as their partner As @Kydo mentioned with us, the partner bridge for \u201cx-chain\u201d can be multiple bridges that cross check each other and can decrease further the chance of malicious actors.  Overall, this reasoning stems from: 1) we believe there are multiple valid bridges/solutions to this question. 2) Combining L0 & Wormhole & maybe other bridges with a majority rules outcome will present the best security 3) Puts incentives with bridges and \u201cx-chain\u201d better in our opinion to market compete in each situation.

                    "content": " On Running Infrastructure and Bridges There\u2019s been a lot of back and forth in the thread around immutability, decentralization, trusted entities, and degrees of control by cross-chain messaging protocols. We wanted to clarify these discussion points by calling out the two ways Uniswap would integrate a messaging layer and comparing the guarantees of both Wormhole and LayerZero under each scenario. Simply put, the two scenarios are:  Uniswap runs infrastructure Uniswap doesn\u2019t run infrastructure   Uniswap runs infrastructure  LayerZero LayerZero suggests that integrators can either use their \u201cdefault\u201d configuration, a low-security option or run infrastructure via a \u201ccustom\u201d configuration. The latter model is proposed as the method by which the application developer (in this case Uniswap) can avoid collusion risk between the default Oracle and Relayer infrastructure operators within LayerZero. Additionally, in this model, Uniswap or its delegates would need to run infrastructure such as a \u201cgasless Oracle\u201d (which has not been released yet), which the LayerZero Relayer would pick up and deliver to the destination. Relayers in LayerZero are always permissioned and are required for liveness and security, thus Uniswap would also have to run Relayer infrastructure. The Relayer source code is currently not open-source, so Uniswap would need to implement a bespoke untested solution or run LayerZero\u2019s proprietary implementation. However, this may still be problematic. Due to the Proof Library requiring ongoing mitigation with each chain, a non-default config is **insufficient until the issue above is addressed. The LayerZero team can add a new default chain config, register a default proof handler, and exploit an application in a single atomic transaction. The application cannot mitigate this using configuration. Applications can only mitigate via a custom relayer and potentially an \u201capproved chains\u201d list in the application itself. The flagship application on LayerZero, Stargate, itself is semi-immutable and will have a difficult time mitigating this issue, and would need to make a custom Proof Library to implement the approved chains list. TL;DR \u2014 if Uniswap does not want to trust LayerZero\u2019s current default configuration, it needs to run its own infrastructure. Even when doing so, there are underlying issues that necessitate further action from LayerZero\u2019s team to truly make any custom infrastructure setup truly trustless.  Wormhole We want to clarify that if Uniswap wants to run its own infrastructure with Wormhole, it can achieve the same level of customization that LayerZero touts, as no protocol has a monopoly on deploying bespoke infra. If desired, Uniswap can configure a deployment of Wormhole, which improves upon the security guarantees of LayerZero\u2019s default while also ensuring sovereign security relative to the canonical Wormhole deployment. Wormhole\u2019s contracts are designed so that the Guardian set is customizable on initial deployment (see here: Setup.sol) and can further be rotated via an in-protocol governance mechanism whereby the current guardian set can vote on the next guardian set. Should Uniswap delegates decide to run their own infrastructure, they may run their own oracle nodes by following instructions at Operations.md. In this model, Uniswap oracles produce signed observations (VAAs) which can be submitted permissionlessly on the target chain (BNB), so no relayer infra is needed, and therefore no need to manage gas funds. However, relayers can very easily be made permissioned if desired, which would allow Uniswap to run a permissioned relayer like the one discussed in the LayerZero model. From a security and operational load perspective, however, we could offer Uniswap to layer their signers on top of Wormhole i.e. extend the already robust Guardian set with their additional validators. This option surpasses the level of flexibility and security of LayerZero\u2019s oracle (in this case Wormhole) and Relayer (chosen by Uniswap) mode in which Uniswap benefits from Wormhole\u2019s significantly more robust signer set but is safe as long as the signer set does not collude with the Uniswap chosen signers. We start from the far stronger base of 19 signers and can arbitrarily increase security beyond that with additional Uniswap-affiliated validators. The easiest way to produce these additional signatures is for the Uniswap DAO signers to download and run the existing, open-source, and in-production Wormhole oracle software. After verifying the Wormhole signatures, the Uniswap governance contract can verify these additional signatures from the selected Uniswap DAO signers. Additionally, relayers can very quickly be permissioned, allowing Uniswap to run a permissioned relayer like the one discussed in the LayerZero model. While the proxy contract can point to different implementations, the Wormhole implementation contract is immutable. Thus it is trivial to verify governance messages against a specified implementation. While there are multiple ways to accomplish this, the most straightforward is just including the pinned implementation as an external library in your deployment. This deployment can be done in a fully permissionless manner without having to trust (or ever interact) with the 19 Guardians that operate the default Wormhole deployment.  Uniswap doesn\u2019t run infrastructure  LayerZero The security assumption of LayerZero\u2019s default configuration is that the default Oracle and Relayer are independent. Uniswap would have to trust a 2/2 multisig of these two components. The relayer is unverified, but LayerZero claims that this is not an issue:  \u201cIt is common practice to not open source or verify Oracle and Relayer smart contracts. *These smart contracts are only responsible for on-chain quoting in gas. All validation logic resides immutably in the messaging library. [\u2026] *****These smart contracts can only quote pricing and do not affect security in any way, therefore being verified is irrelevant to its purpose.\u201d  This statement contradicts with the LayerZero whitepaper, which claims the following:  \u201cGiven two entities that do not collude, if (1) one entity can produce a block header for the block containing tA on chain A, (2) the other entity can independently produce the proof for tA on that block (transaction proof), and (3) the header and transaction proof in fact agree, then the communication protocol can deliver m to the client on chain B with the guarantee that tA is stably committed on chain A.\u201d  The Oracle is responsible for producing the block headers, and the Relayer is responsible for the inclusion proofs \u2014 these responsibilities are far beyond on-chain gas quoting.  \u201cLayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol\u2019s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).\u201d  At this point, it\u2019s unclear if there are other Oracle/Relayer options available to choose from outside of the default. In any case, if the Oracle and Relayer collude, they can forge messages. Contract upgradeability is a critical discussion point. It\u2019s true that bugs can be introduced in upgrades, but upgrades can (and do) fix existing bugs. Presenting only one side of this coin is misleading at best. If any bugs are discovered in LayerZero\u2019s contracts, patching them would be a significant task. Such a scenario would involve the proof validation code being implemented with a patch, and then all affected user applications would have to change their configurations to the patched implementation.  Wormhole The 19 Guardians that operate Wormhole\u2019s default deployment are the largest PoS validator companies. The safety assumption is that of an honest superminority (at least 7 of them are honest) or, conversely, that there are no 13 colluding entities. The equivalent assumption under LayerZero\u2019s setup is that the 2 entities do not collude. The contracts are upgradeable via a governance mechanism that requires the approval of 2/3+ of the Guardians. Importantly, the Wormhole cross-chain governance solution has already been tested (see above) and implemented on testnet and is ready for production. Happy to answer any additional questions. ",

As we know, Axelar and Hyperlane weren\u2019t considered for this temperature check, and it raises questions on the hast at which the community is coming to a decision. @pennblockchain, as well as other university organizations, have provided sound commentary on this debate, and we agree with @devinwalsh from the UF team that \u201cassessments of bridge security are time intensive and require significant technical expertise and context.\u201d As of the time of writing this post, it\u2019s clear that LayerZero and Wormhole are the two competing players to win this temperature check, and we\u2019re fortunate to have discussions with both LayerZero and Wormhole In light of the commentary published by James Prestwich, reading forum responses, and our belief that there are many strong contenders in the bringing space not mentioned in this vote. We find it difficult to choose between, LayerZero and Wormhole, and if an abstain/wait option existed, we\u2019d prefer to vote that way. However, as this is a temperature check, with a deadline of tomorrow, we will be voting for Wormhole. With more time to assess the technicalities of each bridging option, perhaps we will revise our decision and vote differently for LayerZero or other providers. ",

                    "content": "This will be our (Stanford Blockchain) final post here in this thread. More posts revolving around this issue can be found at Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Process.  To save time and be succinct, we will focus this thread mainly on the top two contenders, LayerZero (LZ) and Wormhole (WH). We would love to discuss further around other protocols in the thread above. First at foremost, we enjoyed chatting with different bridge providers and their advocates. We believe as contentious as this vote is, this will not be the end for the cross-chain (x-chain for shorthand) governance discussion but the beginning.  TLDR We believe regardless of who will win the vote, this result should be temporary and should be immediately changed/updated when the Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Process concludes. Our vote only convenes that we support the following protocol for a period of fewer than three months. In long term we believe Multi-Message-Aggregation (MMA) is the solution. We have voted for LZ as the current preferred bridge provider. However, our vote is contingent on a few criteria. If LZ cannot fulfill these criteria, we wish to withdraw our support.  Uniswap governance message passing will use Uniswap-community-run oracle and NOT the default oracle by ChainLink. The Uniswap-community-run oracle is mainnet functional no less than 3 days after the passing of the snapshot vote. The Uniswap-community-run oracle have no less than 5 independent signers. LZ will provide sufficient technical support for all oracle signers.  If LZ fails to deliver on ANY of the criteria above, Stanford Blockchain Club will NOT support LZ being the bridge provider for Uniswap governance.  Quick word: We want to say that although the current snapshot will only have one \u201cwinner,\u201d it does not mean the work other bridge providers did is wasted. In the next three weeks (laid out in the Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Process), we would love to continue these conversations and find a long-term and more sustainable solution for x-chain governance. As we have briefly mentioned in our previous posts (1,2), none of these solutions fits all our requirement and all of them poses serious governance risk to Uniswap; therefore we should not just decide once and move on from this issue. Instead, we should take UF\u2019s proposal seriously and contribute more if not less time and energy to it. Some key risks: Both WH and LZ\u2019s oracle/relayer networks lack a slashing mechanism for malicious oracles. WH\u2019s contract can be upgraded (can be patched with workarounds). LZ\u2019s relayer is currently just LZ\u2019s core team.  On bridging: At Stanford Blockchain Club, we understand the difficulties of building bridges and more importantly, the current security gap between any bridge and the Ethereum network. We also recognize how early bridging technologies are and the security assumptions for these bridges might be drastically different from traditional blockchains. We are not making statements about future designs of these bridges or what they could be; we are stating what we are seeing right now. LZ and WH on a high level are both multisig bridges. WH is a 1/1 multisig, with the 1 being 19 validators forming a 13/19 multisig. LZ is a 2/2 multisig, with 1 being 5 Uniswap members, and the other 1 being LayerZero Lab. If Ethereum\u2019s current security level is 100, what would you assign to LZ and WH? Therefore, we would not choose either of them to be the sole message-relaying solution for Uniswap long term. However given we have to make a decision now, we believe the LZ solution is the marginally better one.  Use all of them:  We believe the correct near-term solution is message aggregation from multiple bridges. From our conversation with bridge providers and other delegates, we believe this is the most logical next step for x-chain governance in Uniswap. We have proposed an in-depth design on the other thread, but this graph captures it well.  _P-mc3zi5QBNMEZB7iH52QSRfzDOEG0wyvJZsDbmWv7OOWkbSZVygDyjjuun8GCoiairEdcDxJpTXbDdsES4cgvueA7BeuQYMmJyxQespHvOl49ypzNLyEU60IBsr5lyVNhYXW-bV6-IBFmilzgh4DKJf0xTZJYMpGe5j_i4UvKa0AuOM4GNKnJ-qJFrjQ1102\u00d7742 46.3 KB  The governance flow is as follows:  Uni Gov passed on Ethereum. Payload to different bridge contracts sent from Timelock. Different bridges relay to dst, BSC in this case. Bridges send governance payload to Message Selection Contract. A 11/15 multisig decides which message payload to execute.  Security analysis and design trade-offs are discussed more in the post. ",

Since we last posted here a few hours ago where we expressed our opinions regarding how we believe future bridging solutions should go, we are currently abstaining from a vote. For some background, this has certainly been the #1 most lobbied vote on Uniswap that we have ever partaken in. Our opinions expressed above should be coupled with this thought: no matter the outcome, this should be a short term victory for either party. In the very near future, we would like to once again enforce that we think a multiple bridge multisig should be used to give us the best of both worlds. At the end of the day, taking away our opinions regarding the jurisdiction of this vote, if we were forced to choose on this proposal, our team is genuinely split right down the center with our decision. In short, we believe Wormhole\u2019s council of 19 at face value is more appealing to us, however, custom solutions that L0 have promised @Kydo bring them back up to pretty much par in our eyes if not slightly the edge, given proper execution, which is a whole another story. Ultimately, this has definitely been a pretty \u201cstressful\u201d day as we\u2019ve been trying to digest information in real time (while trying to grind for the Starknet Hackathon lol). Truly, to everyone who reached out to us, thanks for your time and please understand that this \u201cfence-sitting\u201d by us is not one of inactivity and irresponsibility, but one of careful thought, debate, ultimate stalemate. We\u2019d also like to note that as an organization, we\u2019ll look to continuously improve our internal governance decisions and poise ourselves to better tackle similar situations like this in the future. Finally, we\u2019d once again like to thank the UF team for their constant communication these past few weeks, the BD teams of both LayerZero and Wormhole who we\u2019re sure have both lost many hours of sleep, and other participants who have either reached out to us or been very responsive with help (@GFXlabs, @Kydo & other schools, VCs, and other interested projects and protocols). We truly are impressed with the activity around this and hope to see it stay around. PS: Seeing that there\u2019s a good chance this vote might come down to a16z\u2019s verbal communication on the forums, but no vote on Snapshot (custody hurdles?), we\u2019re interested in how this situation will be handled, is there a precedent set here yet?

                    "content": " A Multi-bridge Implementation for Uniswap Governance is Now Available It is now quite clear that the initial concern raised by the community about Celer\u2019s upgradability contract, which we addressed here and plan to deprecation soon, is absolutely not bigger concerns comparing to many of the issues revealed and discussed in the forum. While we have a lot to say about the ongoing debates in the forum and CT, we refrain from doing so and instead now deliver a multi-bridge Uniswap governance solution that is vendor-lock-in-free for Uniswap community to consider. For Uniswap community who has not casted votes yet, please vote for Celer to express your support for this kind of multi-bridge solution. This solution is strictly better than choosing a single bridge in terms of security and availability. In addition, it also retains the strongest bargaining power in the hands of Uniswap community to always receive the best services. See this for more context. The implementation combines both Celer and Wormhole and is open-sourced here   github.com   sgn-v2-contracts/contracts/message/apps/multibridge at multibridge \u00b7... multibridge/contracts/message/apps/multibridge Smart Contracts for Celer State Guardian Network (SGN) V2 and cBridge V2 - sgn-v2-contracts/contracts/message/apps/multibridge at multibridge \u00b7 celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts      All other bridges/cross-chain solutions such as LayerZero can be added easily via adapters. We are setting up a testnet transaction to demonstrate this end-to-end. @Wormhole team we hope that you can help to set up a relayer for this because otherwise the only easy way would be deploying on Avalanche and BSC testnet where Wormhole generic relayers are available to our knowledge. Feel free to DM! Now let\u2019s get to the solution specification.  Send Cross-Chain Messages through Multiple Bridges This is a solution for cross-chain message passing without vendor lock-in and with enhanced security beyond any single bridge. A message with multiple copies are sent through different bridges to the destination chains, and will only be executed at the destination chain when the same message has been delivered by a quorum of different bridges. The current solution are designed for messages being sent from one source chain to multiple destination chains. It also requires that there is only one permitted sender on the source chain. This would be the use case for Uniswap governance contract on Ethereum calling remote functions of contracts on other EVM chains.  Workflow  Send message on source chain To send a message to execute a remote call on the destintion chain, sender on the source chain should call remoteCall() of MultiBridgeSender, which invokes sendMessage() of every bridge sender apdater to send messages via different message bridges.

  Receive message on destination chain On the destination chain, MultiBridgeReceiver receives messages from every bridge receiver adapter. Each receiver adapter gets encoded message data from its bridge contracts, and then decode the message and call receiveMessage() of MultiBrideReceiver. MultiBridgeReceiver maintains a map from bridge adapter address to its power. Only adapter with non-zero power has access to receiveMessage() function. If the accumulated power of a message has reached the a threshold, which means enough number of different bridges have delivered a same message, the message will be executed by the MultiBrideReceiver contract. The message execution will invoke a function call according to the message content, which will either call functions of other contracts, or call the param adjustment functions of the MultiBridgeReceiver itself. Note that the only legit message sender is the trusted dApp contract on the source chain, which means only that single dApp contract has the ability to execute functions calls through the MultiBridgeReceiver contracts on different other chains.

  Add new bridge and update threshold Below are steps to add a new bridge (e.g. Bridge4) by the dApp community.  Bridge4 provider should implement and deploy Bridge4 adapters on source chain and all destination chains. The adapter contracts should meet the following requirements.  On the source chain, the sender adapter should only accept sendMessage() call from MultiBridgeSender. On the destination chain, the receiver adapter should only accept messages sent from the Bridge4 sender adapter on the source chain, and then call receiveMessage() of MultiBridgeReceiver for each valid message. Renounce any ownership or special roles of the adapter contracts after inital parameter setup.   Bridge4 provider deploy and open source the adapter contracts. dApp community should review the code and check if the requirements above are met. dApp contract (Caller) on the source chain adds the new Bridge4 sender adapter to MultiBridgeSender on the source chain by calling the addSenderAdapters() function of MultiBridgeSender. dApp contract (Caller) on the source chain adds the new Bridge4 receiver adapter to MultiBridgeReceiver on the destination chain by calling the remoteCall() function of MultiBridgeSender, with arguments to call updateReceiverAdapter() of the MultiBridgeReceiver on the destination chain.  Updating quorum threshold is similar to configure a new bridge receiver adapter on destination chain. It requires a remoteCall() from the source chain Caller with calldata calling updateQuorumThreshold() of the MultiBridgeReceiver on the destination chain.  Example Use case: contract A on Goerli send message to contract B on BSC Testnet in order to call enableFeeAmount() for state change. Apply a 2-of-3 messages governance model with message bridge C, D and E.  Deployment and initialization  Deploy MultiBridgeSender on Goerli, set address of A as allowed caller. Deploy MultiBridgeReceiver on BSC Testnet. Each message bridge provider prepare their own SenderAdapter and ReceiverAdapter, named with a prefix of their bridge name. Take preparation of CSenderAdapter and CReceiverAdapter as an example.  Deploy CSenderAdapter on Goerli, set address of MultiBridgeSender as multiBridgeSender. Deploy CReceiverAdapter on BSC Testnet, set address of MultiBridgeReceiver as multiBridgeReceiver. Call updateReceiverAdapter() of CSenderAdapter, set address of CReceiverAdapter on BSC Testnet(chain id 97) as a valid ReceiverAdapter. Call updateSenderAdapter() of CReceiverAdapter, set address of CSenderAdapter on Goerli(chain id 5) as a valid SenderAdapter. Transfer ownership of CSenderAdapter and CReceiverAdapter to address(0).   Once all message bridges are ready, somehow let contract A call addSenderAdapters() of MultiBridgeSender with an address array of CSenderAdapter, DSenderAdapter and ESenderAdapter. Call initialize() of MultiBridgeReceiver, with an address array of CReceiverAdapter, DReceiverAdapter and EReceiverAdapter, and power threshold 2.   Sending your message Prepare a calldata for contract B for calling enableFeeAmount(), then somehow let contract A call remoteCall() of MultiBridgeSender with _dstChainId = 97, _target = <address of contract B> and _callData = <calldata you prepared>.  Result Imagine that the messages sent via C, D and E received by MultiBridgeReceiver on BSC Testnet in an order of 1.C 2.D 3.E. During receiving message sent via D, accumulated power reaches power threshold 2, which result in message execution(the calldata will be sent to contract B).  Notes to the community We are more than happy to answer any questions, help with tests, collaborate with similar-minded builders like @AlexSmirnov, iterate based on feedbacks and provide audits from community selected firms. Although Celer, being a 2018-vintage project, does not have the backing of large UNI-holding investors at this moment, we do trust the integrity and intelligence of all the Uniswap delegates to choose this positive-sum path that ensures the highest level of security and service quality for Uniswap\u2019s multi-blockchain expansion. We will update this post with testnet transactions once we worked through the small integration work using @Wormhole . ",

I want to take the opportunity to expand and point to areas for development where I\u2019m excited to see progress. I also wanted to more explicitly commend Devin and UF for their work in stewarding the process here and on other issues, which in sum, has resulted in a lot more momentum in community governance. Process-wise, the Uniswap Foundation holding a temperature check on which bridge to use in the BSC deployment served both to generally highlight the issue of bridge selection in cross-chain deployment, and advance the decision in this particular instance. Action begets action, and continued forward movement is critical in decentralized governance. The discussion around the merits of each bridge being considered here was absolutely better than leaving that discussion unconsidered at all. Was it comprehensive? No. That is why I abstained from voting. Was it forward progress? Yes, and I am glad to see that. Even more importantly this Snapshot highlighted the need for more bridging research - both on existing solutions for future deployments, and so that a single bridge selection doesn\u2019t need to be bundled to new deployments going forward (for example, as Martin proposes here.) That this came up as a result of this Snapshot is a win in my eyes. Coming on the back of this Snapshot, the focus moving forward is on improving the cross-chain deployment process from first principles. Encourage folks to follow and contribute to the new Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment discussion as a first step there. There\u2019s already good discussion emerging around multi-bridge deployment designs, as well as the merits of individual bridges. My view stands that the best outcome is for new chain dapp deployments to be bridge agnostic, and to embrace modular standards that foster more competition. Im looking forward to more forthcoming research / commentary on this topic. Disclaimer: Variant is an investor in the UNI tokens. Disclosures \u2013 Variant ",

                    "content": "Hi all. Following the community discussion on this proposal over the past week, the UF is posting here to answer some open questions and draw attention to next steps. Next Steps on the BNB Proposal  The final Governance vote will move forward with the results of the most recent Snapshot Poll. In other words, no votes voiced outside of the Snapshot poll will be counted in the results. The proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain will go forward to the final governance vote with Wormhole as the selected bridge. Delegates, as always, will have the opportunity to vote for or against the proposal in this final vote, based on their view of which choice is best for Uniswap.  Timeframe and Context on Bridge Selection Temperature Check  Dec. 11, 2022: The Request for Comment (RFC) to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB was posted in the Uniswap governance forum. This proposal initially contemplated HyperLoop as the bridge. After initial community discussions, DeBridge and Celer were considered as new options. Ultimately 0xPlasma, the proposer, decided to use Celer as the bridge for its proposal. Jan. 16 to Jan. 21: Temperature Check to deploy Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain using Celer as the bridge goes live. It passes with 20M UNI votes in support. At this point, the proposal could have moved forward to the final Governance vote. Jan. 20: GFX Labs summarizes its diligence on Celer in a forum post. Celer responds to GFX, and other delegate questions, on Jan. 23 (here) and Jan. 24 (here). This discussion focused on the security setup of Celer. [Note that the Assessment process will diligence Celer, and provide an independent review of its security setup for the community\u2019s benefit] Jan. 24: Wormhole posts in the forum. Jan. 25: LayerZero posts in the forum. Jan. 26: UF proposes an additional Temperature check take place to vote on a bridge for the BNB deployment. This proposal was made in order to 1) allow the BNB proposal to move forward in a timely manner, as the community had expressed its support for a BNB deployment in the initial Temp Check, and 2) to allow for a community review of relevant information on Celer, and to consider other bridge providers discussed in the forum: Wormhole, LayerZero, and deBridge. Jan. 27 to Jan. 31: A new Temperature Check is posted on bridge selection.  Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Process  As the BNB proposal governance process progressed, we also saw the clear opportunity to create a better process for future cross-chain deployment proposals. We have proposed the creation of an Assessment Group for bridges here. Community members will have until at least Friday February 17th to review and provide feedback on the process. Applicants to join this team can express their interest in the forum by posting the following: a. Name and affiliation, b. Qualifications as they relate to the criteria stated above, stated briefly, c. Explanation of why you are interested in becoming a member of this team. The exact process by which applicants become team members will be confirmed after community feedback is incorporated over the next 2.5 weeks. In the interim we are excited to hear from interested parties. Bridges that wish to be assessed may also post their responses to the questions listed in the forum until at least that date.  Clarity on deploying cross-chain with no bridge, and changing the bridge used for a chain  Upon deployment to X chain, the \u201cowner\u201d of the Uniswap v3 factory contract on that chain is set to a bridge contract which receives and relays messages from the Ethereum L1 timelock contract. It is technically possible to deploy Uniswap v3 without a bridge on X chain. However, an implication of that decision is that no future information can be communicated to that deployment by Uniswap governance. Uniswap governance would not be able to turn on the fee switch on X chain or \u201cadd\u201d a bridge later on. No fee tiers could be added, unless the deployment includes an affordance for anyone to be able to add any fee tier. If a deployment of Uniswap v3 to X chain is made with bridge A chosen, it is possible for Uniswap to later update the bridge to bridge B. This decision would go through the governance process. The final governance vote calldata would be sent from the Ethereum L1 timelock to the X chain deployment through bridge A, and would communicate a change of the Uniswap v3 factory owner from bridge contract A to bridge contract B.  General Comments  This proposal has received more attention than any Uniswap proposal in recent memory. It has drawn widespread attention to the role that bridges play in governance, and begun to inform a larger audience about the tradeoffs in and intricacies of bridge design. Delegates had the opportunity to speak directly to bridge teams to learn from them and ask questions. The discussion also highlighted the urgent need for a better process to be implemented for bridge selection. We mentioned this above, and are excited to receive your feedback and move this forward. It also highlighted the need for more extensive research into bridges for governance, and into bridge-agnostic solutions for protocols. The Uniswap and broader crypto community mobilized themselves to do considerable work in this area in a short period of time. Kydo proposed a Multi Message Aggregation method. Celer designed, deployed, and has already conducted tests for a multi-bridge implementation for Uniswap governance. Martin Koppelmann (Co-founder and CEO of Gnosis) proposed a general bridge framework that may operate independent of, and provide more security than, any single team or approach. This work would not have materialized over such a short time frame without the fervent community discussion here. These solutions, and more, will be processed and assessed by the Bridge Assessment team for future usage by Uniswap governance. Uniswap is one of the largest DeFi communities on Ethereum to pursue cross-chain deployments, and is having these difficult but important conversations in public. We hope our learnings, and the new process we create from here, will contribute to the creation of more seamless, standard processes and technological solutions that other protocols can benefit from as they consider deploying across other chains. While the focus on and fervor of the discussion was not anticipated by many in the community, including the UF, we believe the developments above are a net positive for Uniswap, and the space as a whole.

                    "content": "a16z voted against Proposal 31. We voted this direction for two reasons:   As many others have commented on, the selection of a bridge provider for cross-chain governance messaging should be a comprehensive, structured process that allows for equal comparative analysis between each option. While that didn\u2019t fully occur for this vote, @devinwalsh\u2019s new cross-chain bridge assessment process can help to solve this moving forward. Given the number of possible upcoming bridge deployments, we agree that it\u2019s important to have an independent third party weigh in with their relevant experience and expertise. Consequently, our vote against this proposal is to reset the Binance Uniswap v3 deployment process until the formal assessment is completed.   Second, we do not believe Wormhole offers the most secure or decentralized bridging option. The Wormhole bridge suffered a $326M exploit last year. The bridge then had another critical vulnerability that put all $1.8B TVL at risk. Wormhole has since reduced their maximum bug bounty from $10M to $2.5M. Additionally, the Uniswap DAO will not have the ability to run and control the bridge independently if Wormhole is selected as the provider. We believe this is an equally important factor to consider.   As Uniswap token holders, we are ultimately interested in the long-term success of the Uniswap protocol. We hope to see the Binance deployment process restarted so that all bridge providers can participate in a formal assessment process. We will evaluate all bridge providers in good faith and subsequently vote in the best interest of the Uniswap protocol\u2019s future growth and success. ",

Setting aside the bridge provider discussion after the completion of the Snapshot vote, we would like to elaborate upon our reasoning for voting to deploy on BSC, which some view to be controversial. Revisiting our post from December, it is evident that Pancake Swap has significant trading volume and utilization. For those who are not familiar, PancakeSwap is a direct Uniswap v2 fork. If Uniswap v3 were to be deployed to BSC, we could significantly reduce PancakeSwap\u2019s position in the DEX market and reduce the incentive for PancakeSwap to fork Uniswap v3 when the BSL expires in April. The best example of Uniswap v3 competing with a Uniswap v2 fork is Polygon\u2019s QuickSwap. Before Uniswap v3\u2019s deployment on Polygon, QuickSwap had the majority of Polygon DEX market share. Within two months of Uniswap v3\u2019s deployment, it took over most of Polygon DEX\u2019s market share.  Planning beyond proposal 31, we believe Uniswap should be deployed on other popular and up-and-coming EVM chains to reduce the incentive for forks to be launched post-BSL. There are currently five deployments of Uniswap v3 and one pending deployment (zkSync). In addition to BSC, we expect at least 2-5 more deployments before April 1st, approximately ten deployments by the end of April, and 20-30 by year-end. The question we should be working to solve now is what should Uniswap be doing to make certain it maintains its market share domiance post-BSL? ",

The risks were presented clearly to me vs the other bridges. However, it is important to expand Uniswap into other ecosystems.

With this in mind\u2026 The important component is getting the liquidity kickstarted on BSC before april; regardless of the temporary bridge.     devinwalsh:  Clarity on deploying cross-chain with no bridge, and changing the bridge used for a chain  Upon deployment to X chain, the \u201cowner\u201d of the Uniswap v3 factory contract on that chain is set to a bridge contract which receives and relays messages from the Ethereum L1 timelock contract. It is technically possible to deploy Uniswap v3 without a bridge on X chain. However, an implication of that decision is that no future information can be communicated to that deployment by Uniswap governance. Uniswap governance would not be able to turn on the fee switch on X chain or \u201cadd\u201d a bridge later on. No fee tiers could be added, unless the deployment includes an affordance for anyone to be able to add any fee tier. If a deployment of Uniswap v3 to X chain is made with bridge A chosen, it is possible for Uniswap to later update the bridge to bridge B. This decision would go through the governance process . The final governance vote calldata would be sent from the Ethereum L1 timelock to the X chain deployment through bridge A, and would communicate a change of the Uniswap v3 factory owner from bridge contract A to bridge contract B.    Devin\u2019s comments resolved my worries about bridge flexibility. My priorities for this proposal are expanding to BSC first, and the bridge is secondary. Once passed there is time to test out the multi bridge tooling without rushing to simultaneously launch on BSC. Wormhole\u2019s history shows that it has been battled tested through failures; and will suit the purpose of a temporary bridge for BSC. My biggest concern with DAO governance is the inability to make actions in a timely manner. ",

                    "content": " Proposed Implementation of a Multi-Bridge, Agnostic Solution Over the past few months, LI.FI (a bridge aggregator supporting 13 bridges) has been closely monitoring the development in Uniswap\u2019s Forum related to the BNB Chain Deployment Proposal, its subsequent Snapshot Poll which ended on Jan 31, and the current on-chain vote in favor of implementing Wormhole. While we applaud the interest shown by key stakeholders of the crypto ecosystem in finding a suitable bridging solution for Uniswap\u2019s Cross-Chain Governance, we strongly recommend that Uniswap not select one bridge provider for its BNB Chain Deployment Proposal. Specifically, we do not believe the BNB Chain Deployment Proposal should move forward before more research can be done, even if this may come as a letdown to many community members \u2013 be it bridge builders or other individuals. Instead, we urge the Uniswap Foundation and the Uniswap community to fully immerse themselves in the Cross-Chain Assessment Process outlined by @devinwalsh. While the sprint to move to BNB Chain before the business license expires is important, we believe finding a long-term solution for cross-chain governance to be far more important than the short-term win of deploying V3 code first. There will be new chains, new versions of Uniswap, but there will never be another chance to expand governance safely and securely on the first try. Uniswap is a market leader in design (AMMs), token structure (airdrops), and overall competency, and LI.FI believes that the model Uniswap chooses for cross-chain governance has a high chance of becoming industry standard. We \u2013 as members of the crypto industry \u2013 want to see this done the correct way, and from the start. Bridges, specifically arbitrary messaging bridges (AMBs), are in the nascent stages of development. Short-term, Wormhole, LayerZero, Celer, Axelar and deBridge are certainly viable solutions for cross-chain governance and have received substantial traction in terms of volume at the liquidity layer and development by dApps at the messaging layer. That being said, we at LI.FI have done the research on AMBs (Navigating Arbitrary Messaging Bridges) and have delved deeply into the pros and cons of eight different AMB solutions. Our conclusion is simple: no single AMB is tested enough to be considered a robust and secure solution that a project of Uniswap\u2019s size can solely rely on at this point. If there was a single, obvious AMB solution that could be trusted by Uniswap, then this forum post would not be necessary. Lest it be forgotten, two major AMBs were exploited in the past twelve months (Nomad and Wormhole), while LayerZero has also come under fire recently for its security model (Prestwich, L2Beat). We do not say this as condemnation, rather, we point this out to highlight just how difficult it is to build secure AMBs and the subsequent risks a dApp is exposed to by choosing a single bridging solution. In addition to this sentiment, we believe AMBs like Axelar, Synapse, Hyperlane, Multichain, Connext Amarok, and Hop deserve to be considered by Uniswap and the deadline of two and half weeks is too short for them to be formally introduced, debated, and voted upon again. To summarize, LI.FI stands staunchly behind the concerns previously raised by @Kydo, @AlexSmirnov, and @modong. LI.FI believes that a multi-bridge, agnostic approach is best suited for Uniswap cross-chain governance because of the following reasons:  By picking one bridging solution, Uniswap will be selecting a winner in a niche that is perhaps yet to find the most optimal solution, resulting in a lack of innovation going forward and a dominance by the AMB that will not help the space move forward in the right direction. With bridges, trust is a spectrum, and all the AMBs make different trade-offs resulting in unique strengths and weaknesses. However, when it comes to Uniswap\u2019s use case of cross-chain governance, security can never be a trade-off. This is where a multi-bridge solution comes in to overcome these trust trade-offs, offering better security than any one bridging solution. Aggregating the best, most trusted AMBs will be in the best interest of the Uniswap community as, irrespective of shortcomings in any individual bridge, Uniswap will always receive the best services required for cross-chain governance.  So, where do we go from here? More research is in order, which we believe should be two-pronged. 1. Cross-Chain Bridge Assessment Framework We would like to add our own feedback to Devin\u2019s framework and add an additional step to the process. The MMA solution or any other multi-bridge solution is built on the idea of Uniswap choosing multiple bridges as \u201cadapters.\u201d The first thing to do, therefore, is to determine which bridges meet Uniswap standards, as outlined by @devinwalsh. We believe that Uniswap should first build a unique framework to both quantitatively and qualitatively measure and allow for the ranking of different bridge solutions by the engineering team. This would decrease the workload of the engineering team by letting them focus on stress-testing bridge solutions without having to create the parameters of such a test themselves. As one of the largest players in DeFi, Uniswap has the chance to create the de facto bridge assessment criterion. By our estimation, there are four bridge framework solutions currently in the ether.   Crosschain Risk Framework \u2013 created by ConsenSys & LI.FI   L2 Beat Bridge Risk Framework \u2013 created by L2Beat  Assessing Blockchain Bridges \u2013 created by Joel John  With Bridges, Trust Is a Spectrum: A Quantified Framework \u2013 created by LI.FI and CryptoStats  Uniswap has the chance to build upon, combine, and quantify the works of four major research pieces without having to start from scratch. With that in mind, we recommend that Devin\u2019s initial Cross Chain Bridge Assessment make room for four researchers, who can help build this framework to assist the engineering team, who can then test out different bridging solutions based on the criteria mentioned in the framework and select which bridges make the cut to become a part of the multi-bridge solution. The researchers will then explain the decision of the team through easy to digest articles, which can be used by other builders to assess bridges for their own dApps and by users to expand their knowledge of bridges and make more informed decisions when it comes to choosing a bridging solution for their needs. To this end, collaborations with other public good infrastructure projects like L2BEAT, Ethereum.org, among others, should also be considered to spread awareness and educate the public about bridges. As Devin laid out, these individuals should be available for 10-15 hours per week over the next few weeks to participate in the assessment process, and to write up their findings in a report to share with the community. To this end, we recommend Peter Robinson, Arjun Chand, Ermyas Abebe, and Bartek Kiepuszewski (though we believe Uniswap should have the final call here). We believe the current timeframe is aggressive but doable. However, if the list of bridges were to expand, we would recommend pushing back the March 27th date.  826\u00d7445 22.2 KB  2. Consideration of Making the Universal Governance Model an EIP Uniswap pushing for a cross-chain governance EIP would be net positive for the industry, in our opinion, specifically in the context of a multi-bridge solution. Such an EIP would give dApps a shared template for creating safe, secure governance modules, while also giving flexibility for dApps to choose different bridging solutions based on their security, time, and cost preferences. To that end, we believe that Uniswap should create and propose a new cross-chain EIP based on the design outlined by Mo Dong from Celer and Alex from deBridge (with, of course, any tweaks recommended by the engineering and research team).  1035\u00d7540 116 KB  Additionally, there are two EIPs and one forum post that Uniswap should consider learning from and building upon in addition to the framework above.   EIP 5164, as explained by Brendan Asseltine, is a PoolTogether and Hop-backed EIP looking to standardize governance message passing. While EIP 5164 is not a perfect fit for Uniswap \u2013 it proposes that all bridges provide the same interface to apps so that apps can just build against this interface and choose one bridge later \u2013 it does provide insight into the difficulties that EIP writers will have in coming up with a single design.  EIP 6170, is a common smart contract interface for interacting with messaging protocols.  Principled approach to bridges, proposes block header based bridges.  In our estimation, none of these solutions have captured enough mindshare to become industry standard. However, they have all pushed the envelope in what can be done in standardizing messaging, and Uniswap could learn much from it. We recommend that Uniswap employ the same four-engineering team to standardize the MMA solution as an EVM-compatible EIP. Given Uniswap\u2019s position and influence in the ecosystem, it has the power to push an EIP that can potentially become the de-facto solution for any project indulging in cross-chain governance. Conclusion A multi-bridge, agnostic solution that the community invests resources into is a win-win-win for all the parties involved (Uniswap, bridging solutions, and the dApps that will implement this solution for cross-chain governance in the future). As Devin said, the developments as a result of the proposed deployment on BNB Chain are net-positive for the ecosystem. Open discussions about bridge designs and frameworks for assessing security risks associated with them are exactly what we need to fast-forward the maturity of the bridging solutions and enable the development of secure bridges. We look forward to the feedback of the UF and the community on our proposal. ",

I think these tech assessments and proposals could be better posted on this thread. My only question to the Uniswap community: are we ready to lose now a market share of the protocol on many new chains forever, or will we take a chance to speed up the deployment with current conditions and solve a bridge dilemma with the next proposal, when the solution will be found? For me, the answer is obvious: now or never  ",

With PancakeSwap detailing plans to launch their V3 model on the same day as the expiration of Uniswap\u2019s V3 BSL licence, it is crucial for the Uniswap governance to act swiftly and make a decision to remain competitive in light of PancakeSwap\u2019s dominance in BSC decentralized exchange market.   PancakeSwap already owns the largest liquidity depth  in their V2 system, and having PancakeSwap launch a V3+ V2 router would only result in further lowering slippage within their ecosystem. Failure to accept the on-chain vote as-is could not only result in a failure of Uniswap V3 garnering enough liquidity to be competitive over PancakeSwaps V2 model, but also hinder Uniswap V3 as a second-tier decentralized exchange on BSC.

                    "content": "Hey All. Sergey from the Axelar Network here. It\u2019s great to see Uniswap expanding! We note that choosing a cross-chain provider is a highly technical and delicate question that requires careful planning, resource allocation, and coordination for a successful deployment. We support pursuing the Cross-Chain Assessment Process outlined by @devinwalsh to better benchmark the pros and cons of each proposal and will post answers on that thread. The Axelar network is built from the ground up using Cosmos SDK and already connects over 30 chains including Ethereum, Cosmos chain, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and others (see https://axelarscan.io), and new chains are added regularly. The Axelar network has been running on mainnet since Jan 2022 and has processed over $1.75 billion of volume in >350k transactions. Axelar\u2019s ecosystem has thousands of builders using our decentralized and permissionless infrastructure, creating hundreds of unique cross-chain applications. Multiple connectivity paths can be connected to the Axelar network, leveraging its many-to-many transport and routing properties, improving the security of individual connections. Applications built on top can benefit from these improvements without additional changes. We propose to instantiate interoperability for Uniswap by leveraging the Axelar decentralized network, powered by Proof of Stake consensus and many safety features, and augment it with an additional Uniswap-specific validator set. The Uniswap-specific validator set may be elected via UNI governance, and be instantiated based on Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Authority, or any other validator selection rule deemed needed. A custom policy can be instantiated to authorize messages of different value/importance. See our recent blog post for how to instantiate deployments based on different validation logic using Axelar. We\u2019ll post full answers to the questions asked in Cross-Chain Assessment Process shortly and look forward to continuing the discussion with the Uniswap community. ",

I and Variant decided to vote \u201cno\u201d on the Uniswap v3 deployment to BSC. Earlier I commented that it\u2019s suboptimal for communities to be voting on singular bridges, and that the v3 BSC discussion has highlighted a valuable opportunity to rethink deployment design from first principles. Luckily, the ball is already rolling:  The Uniswap Foundation set up a new cross-chain bridge assessment process for evaluating modular deployment designs Martin proposed an additive security model that integrates multiple bridges Hyperlane detailed their design for a modular multi-bridging architecture that wouldn\u2019t require building out exhaustive infrastructure, and is easy to change. Their protocol provides a standard format for incorporating any existing bridge into individual \u201csecurity legos\u201d, which are composable and thus can be combined in any way to create a validating condition before an interchain message is accepted.  For example, you can build out these \u201clegos\u201d for Wormhole, L0, and Celer, and then use Hyperlane to combine these to create the condition \u201cmessage X is valid IFF all of these 3 ISMs have confirmed the message\u201d.   Zefram built a universal bridge that can wrap multiple bridges simultaneously, to reduce security assumptions tied to any single bridge  Uniswap is a leader within the broader ecosystem, and the process here has the potential to set a standard for new chain deployments. There\u2019s good progress in the works for building more modular deployment solutions, and I think it\u2019s better for the protocol to fully explore those \u2013 and other emerging solutions \u2013 before finalizing a v3 BSC deployment.
