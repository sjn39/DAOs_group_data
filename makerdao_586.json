                    "content": "It is common market practice that the borrower pays for the lender\u2019s counsel in the preparation of financing documents. These amounts may be subsequently financed under the financing documents, thereby enabling the borrower to finance such external legal costs. If the financing never closes, then the borrower assumes these external legal costs at its risk. As the Maker community seeks to scale the Real World Finance program, it is imperative that the Real World Finance Core Unit and the Maker community have the support of external counsel. This is commercially standard practice. To that end, this Poll seeks Maker community support of the approach that borrowers be required to pay for Maker\u2019s external legal support. To manage the borrower\u2019s costs, it is proposed that overall transaction legal fees be divided as follows: Fees incurred by Maker: External legal review of agreements relating to legal entities specific to interacting with the Maker protocol (e.g. Delaware statutory trust or similar legal entity required for the purpose of financing through the Maker protocol). Fees incurred by Borrower: All other external legal review associated with the transaction (e.g., legal due diligence, financing agreements, etc.). External counsel can easily allocate their time on the above basis. Borrowers may object to this approach as it will add to their transaction costs. However, it is common market practice. Further, it will ensure that borrowers carefully review their budgets and structures prior to engaging with Maker. Borrowers may want to have external counsel of their choice. This is not acceptable. Borrowers may be incentivized to find low-cost, inexperienced counsel. In the first instance, I can make one or more recommendations for the borrowers to consider. It may also be acceptable for borrowers to present two or more law firms for consideration in respect of any transaction. In any event, the final selection should have lender alignment. As I continue to provide legal support to the Real World Finance Core Unit, I will coordinate with the Real World Finance Core Unit to review the proposed firms and we will reach a collaborative decision on which firm to choose based on (1) relevant lawyer transaction experience, (2) comparative cost, and (3) ability to execute transaction on the proposed timeline. As an update, I am working with the SES Core Unit and the RWF Core Unit to on-board additional full-time and/or part-time lawyers to support the RWF Core Unit\u2019s activities. I have the part-time support of two finance lawyers in Singapore to support potential Asia activities and I am in discussions with English law and NY law qualified finance lawyers to support Europe and the US respectively (likely on a part time basis). Updates forthcoming. If this Informal Poll is supported, I will submit the Informal Poll as a Signal Request.     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     ",

The only thing I would suggest though is that this sort of legal expense sharing scheme should reasonably come with a deal process flow that first ensures agreement on a term sheet level on the main business issues and something like an in-principle offer of facility before external legal advice gets materially engaged. With the borrowers acceptance of said term-sheet/in-principle offer, a final legal due diligence and document drafting/agreement with appropriate external advice can commence under the expense sharing terms you so very reasonably suggest. Just to make sure nobody (Maker & borrower) spends too many external legal fees without first being on common ground in business and economic terms. What do you think? ",

However, couple things to think about here:   Structure - typically, the lender has a very defined legal structure already in place, so when the borrower is asked to pay the legal fees, that fee is well defined an typically does not deviate much, because the legal structure is well defined, and council just needs to complete due diligence, draw up docs and perhaps perform some minor legal work. So my thought is this needs to be in place so that the borrower and council have a defined structure to work off, and its not open-ended.   To @Allan_Pedersen point, there is usually a term sheet that precedes legal, and this term sheet spells out the terms, including the legal costs. I think thought needs to be given to how such a term sheet may be offered to the borrower and how would community voting/approval play into this scenario - would a term sheet require a signal request, an on-chain vote, or none at all?

This makes complete and total sense. And this has been my approach to the current transactions. It is important for both the lender and the borrower to be sensitive to, and manage, external legal expenses.     prankstr25:  there is usually a term sheet that precedes legal, and this term sheet spells out the terms, including the legal costs. I think thought needs to be given to how such a term sheet may be offered to the borrower and how would community voting/approval play into this scenario - would a term sheet require a signal request, an on-chain vote, or none at all?   The basic terms of the transaction should be outlined in the MIP6 application. The RWF Core Unit, working with me and other lawyers supporting Maker directly, will develop the basic terms of the term sheet. Once we have alignment with the borrower, we will formally engage external counsel to review the financing agreements. It is also common market practice for the lender\u2019s counsel to hold the pen on the documents. I am not suggesting that this be the general approach. Borrower\u2019s counsel can still hold the pen. Solid legal support for Maker will eliminate any \u201cadvantage\u201d that document control may afford. ",

                    "content": "First, I should introduce myself briefly. I am Eli Cohen, newly joined General Counsel for Centrifuge. I have +20 years of experience as an external and in-house lawyer in TradFi, with Euroclear Bank, Singapore Exchange and CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and crypto markets most recently at Block.One building the Bullish exchange. A couple of points to note in regard to this proposal:  It is typical for banks to require borrowers to pay their legal fees for a financing deal, but this is not usual market practice in bond offerings. As Maker is a DAO and not a bank, the structure is more similar to a bond offering rather than a financing by a regulated financial institution. Based on the very thorough Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions posted by @eumenes on 17 Jan, MakerDAO will be the beneficiary of a number of key legal opinions (true sale, substantive non-consolidation). This should limit substantially the need for Maker to have its own legal representation for the deal and the work would be minimal (e.g.,document review). Before this proposal is decided, the DAO should reach consensus on whether it intends to act as traditional TradFi lender \u2013 or not. If DeFi adopts all the elements of the TradFi world, it will likely miss out on the innovative and disruptive benefits of the technology. Positioning Maker as \u201cjust as good as a bank\u201d may result in the loss of a competitive edge and missing out on deals to other DeFi players.  I agree with @prankstr25\u2019s comment that this should be part of a term sheet and that borrowers should only be asked to pay for legal work for Maker once a firm commitment has been made by Maker to proceed with the transaction. The legal work at this point should be clearly defined and in line with what borrowers would do in other transactions. We should also make sure that overall the term sheet offered to borrowers is competitive. Onboarding with Maker is already a long and much riskier approach than going to a bank. The harder this process gets the more Maker has to be able to undercut the financing fees more traditional lenders charge. ",

As such we are very open to innovating, streamlining and automating TradFi practices.  But Maker also needs to carefully consider the key rights and protections it requires as a senior secured lender.  So we encourage folks to present innovative approaches to lending but also need to understand what TradFi rights and protections, if any, we are being asked to forego. Also I would note the in ABS/MBS bond offerings, the Issuer/Borrower pays for both its counsel and the structuring agent\u2019s counsel, as there is not a bondholders counsel.  But these deals are based on relatively clear standards and need to have rating agency approval. And they are ultimately priced in the market so deals with weaker structural protections will have that factored in their execution pricing. And the borrower also pays for the rating agencies that rate the deal, and the rating agencies use their own counsel so arguably the borrowers is paying for bondholder counsel ",

                    "content": "@elidco - Welcome to the Maker community. I look forward to the on-going collaboration with you and the Centrifuge team. A few observations on your post:     elidco:  As Maker is a DAO and not a bank, the structure is more similar to a bond offering rather than a financing by a regulated financial institution.   Maker is a DAO and not a bank. That is true, but that fact should not be dispositive as to whether Maker should benefit from professional external legal advice. And as noted by @Eumenes, bond offerings (even investment grade quality bond offerings) will have active counsel participation paid for by the issuer.     elidco:  MakerDAO will be the beneficiary of a number of key legal opinions (true sale, substantive non-consolidation). This should limit substantially the need for Maker to have its own legal representation for the deal and the work would be minimal (e.g.,document review).   True sale and substantive non-consolidation are only two of many legal and contractual issues that arise in a transaction. To suggest that receipt of these two opinions (or any legal opinion alone) as being sufficient for Maker\u2019s reliance is not correct. High-quality legal advisors provide legal, regulatory and commercial support. Typically, a legal opinion only addresses legal matters - i.e. the transaction is enforceable, not in violation of law, etc. The legal opinions do not address the commercial reasonableness of a transaction. It may be a bad deal for the lender, but the law firm will opine it is enforceable as written.     elidco:  If DeFi adopts all the elements of the TradFi world, it will likely miss out on the innovative and disruptive benefits of the technology.   To the contrary, Maker fully supports innovation. It is why I am here. However, an innovation in one aspect of the financing process does not, automatically, mean that the rest of TradFi gets thrown out. It simply means we adopt that new innovation and implement it within known, well-tested structures. If someone innovates on another part of the TradFi structure, we will adopt that too. Over time, I expect we can jointly improve the overall financing process.     elidco:  Positioning Maker as \u201cjust as good as a bank\u201d may result in the loss of a competitive edge and missing out on deals to other DeFi players.   Ultimately this is a question for the Maker community. However, if diversification and asset stability are important to (1) support the credibility of the DAI peg and (2) provide surplus, then a more conservative approach may be appropriate. Other DeFi lenders may have a different objective. This is no different than the real world. Commercial banks, private credit funds, government export-credit agencies, and World Bank Group-related financial institutions all have different mandates and risk tolerances.     elidco:  borrowers should only be asked to pay for legal work for Maker once a firm commitment has been made by Maker to proceed with the transaction.   What is meant by a \u201cfirm commitment\u201d - does this mean after the posting of a risk assessment and approval by Maker Governance? This does not seem appropriate.     elidco:  The legal work at this point should be clearly defined and in line with what borrowers would do in other transactions.   What are the \u201cother transactions\u201d - TradFi? Having 15 years in a law firm billing clients and 10 years as in-house counsel managing +$3million a month in legal spend, I am fully supportive of cost management.     elidco:  Onboarding with Maker is already a long and much riskier approach than going to a bank. The harder this process gets the more Maker has to be able to undercut the financing fees more traditional lenders charge.   Perhaps. We are working hard to streamline and operationalize our processes. The Methodology for Structured Finance transactions is one aspect. If a prospective applicant understands Maker\u2019s requirements and proposes a structure that addresses very reasonable creditor concerns, I suspect that the process will be more efficient and the applicant will benefit. Again, welcome and I look forward to our collaboration. ",
