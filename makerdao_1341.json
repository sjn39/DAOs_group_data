                    "content": " Executive Summary  There is some concern among the mandated actors that the GSM Delay is too short. This is an informal poll to gauge sentiment and community discussion. The results of this poll will be considered before making any formal recommendations to change the GSM Delay.   Introduction The Governance delay period (GSM) was designed to give the MKR token holders a chance to review any changes that will go into the Maker Protocol and act accordingly if those changes are deemed malicious. Mandated actors are concerned that the current delay of 48 hours is insufficient to defend the protocol. There was record voter participation in the June governance cycle. Almost 300k MKR voted in recent polls (example). This is about double the amount of MKR that has typically been actively involved in governance. Toward the end of 2020, the GSM period was set to 72 hours. During the DsChief 1.2 upgrade, which took place on 2020-12-02, the delay was changed to 48 hours. PECU currently feels good about the stability of the protocol and encourages an increase in the delay. If the GSM delay is raised substantially then it will often happen that the previous week\u2019s executive spell will still be pending to cast at the same time that the current week\u2019s executive spell is passed. PECU affirms that it is technically feasible to keep more than one executive in-flight. Hence, the outcome of this poll will have no impact on the weekly governance cadence.  General Background Quoting from the manual: A longer GSM Pause Delay gives non-malicious MKR Holders and users of the protocol more time to become aware of and react to a governance attack on the Maker Protocol. It also gives users additional time to opt-out in the event of non-malicious but disagreeable changes to the protocol, such as an increase in Liquidation Ratios that might cause the liquidation of a user\u2019s Vault. However, having a longer GSM also enforces a slower reaction time on Maker Governance as a whole, which creates risk in the event of time-critical issues:  Extreme market volatility. Technical issues in the Maker Protocol. Attack on the Oracles. Extreme network congestion.  Any of the above situations may require swift action from governance, however, the swiftest response still requires the GSM Pause Delay to pass before the changes go live in the Maker Protocol.    Preferred GSM delay  48 hours (no change) 3 days (72 hours) 4 days 5 days 6 days 7 days Abstain     0 voters     If you feel moved, please detail the reason for your vote in a comment. ",
