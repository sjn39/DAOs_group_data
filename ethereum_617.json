                    "content": "Hello all! Happy 2019! We\u2019re only a little over 2 months away from the Council of Paris, happening alongside ETHCC in Paris. Here are some items from this morning\u2019s @council-volunteers call, which happen Wednesday morning 8AM PST / 17:00 Central Europe time. Charging for Tickets I proposed that we charge for tickets for the Council of Paris 2019. Our costs for food (lunch and coffee) are roughly 30EU per person, and food is also the single largest cost. So, this seems like the right number to ask for. The second reason for charging for tickets is to make sure we have a more accurate idea of how many people are attending. As always, \u201call are welcome\u201d \u2013 so anyone not able to pay would still be welcome. This just makes sure that we ask people to support the event right up front, and get commitment to attend by paying. Ideally, we would collect ticket fees in ETH \u2013 participants are active in the Ethereum community, and creating a wallet and getting access to 30EU worth of ETH doesn\u2019t seem too much of a barrier for new participants. Anyone have thoughts on why we shouldn\u2019t charge for tickets? Participant Numbers We are planning for 200 participants. ETHCC is, I think, planning for about 1000 attendees, so at 20% this seems a decent guess. We did find in Prague that many more people registered than attended, so either Kickback (for \u201cfree\u201d events) \u2013 or actually charging for tickets \u2013 we think will help get more commitment from participants. For space planning, we mainly need to be concerned with the maximum amount for a \u201cmain stage\u201d gathering, plus looking at smaller classrooms / break out spaces. Think this number will be lower or higher? How many participants do you think we should be planning for? Event Ticketing We ask that people register / get a ticket so we can 1) plan numbers 2) communicate with them. As above, it also means collecting fees to help cover costs. I have reached out to the Kickback team to ask if they would actually let us charge for tickets (that is \u2013 no refund!). If we do get enough sponsors, we could refund tickets still, but this all comes down to budgeting and sponsorship interest. I have also used Tito for tickets in the past (just for ticketing / event management) \u2013 but we would need to ask for payment via ETH in some other way. Eventbrite would be the same \u2013 could do the ticket event management, but would need to take ETH payment separately. I will be researching this area, if other people have favourite event ticketing apps that can send email updates, please share! Alternate solutions on how to accept ETH for tickets while also gathering name and (optional) email address for communications also welcome.  P.S. Yes we are looking for more volunteers and sponsors. Talk to @tomislavmamic or message @council-sponsorships  who is the lead organizer to get involved. We\u2019ll ideally finalize ticketing and open registrations at the end of next week, so start planning your ring topics and other things you want to discuss! ",

To handle \u201cpaid event\u201d, it\u2019s technically not difficult to modify payout logic so that the max payout can be adjustable by the organiser, etc. Having said that, we just announced using Kickback for  various ethereum meetups around the world, and supporting both free and paid event for March deadline is not feasible for us (especially coming up with UI which makes sense for both free and paid event). We just did a bit of brainstorming in our team and came up with a couple of solutions which could serve the purpose. Option 1: Use Kickback as is Currently we have the infamous \u201ccooling off\u201d feature where event organiser can claim the remaining ETH if attendees do not withdraw their ETH within one week cooling period. In the past 10~30% of people haven\u2019t withdrawn but the figure may become lower as your commitment is 3~5 higher than the usual. This is the default way to have \"optional donation\" but this does not give you any assurance to cover the cost which you are after (NOTE: We are planning to get rid of this feature in Q1). Option 2: Abuse Kickback You (ETHMagicians) can just RSVP along with other participants but only mark yourself in so that you can get all the ETH. This is actual the dispute case #1 which I described here, but you guys can try it as one off experiment in the following conditions.  You will write description and make sure that people are aware that they may not being marked as attended despite the fact that they do attend. Kickback will not be responsible for involved in any disputes. You will still encourage participants to help you refer sponsorship In case you could not raise enough sponsorship and you don\u2019t kickback, then we will modify our site to delist from our event listing page (/events) after the event ended. This is because having 1/200 attendees is unintended use of our platform and we would like stop confusing people visiting the site later on. As a platform usage fee, we usually charge $1 per attendance. If you decide not to kickback attendees, then we do charge per RSVP as you guys are not marking anyone as attended.  Would either of them solve your problem? If you really want to make modification to our code, then I suggest forking our old BlockParty code and deploy on your own though this misses lots of new features (eg: sign up, email notifications, better admin UI, etc). Weather you decide to use Kickback or not, I am more likely to attend ETHcc/EthMagicians and would happy to help. ",

I try and run things on Heroku so I don\u2019t have to deal with servers  \u2013 but it does look like there is a pretix docker image and I could arrange to have someone get this setup \u2013 either tickets.ethereum-magicians.org or I would use the tickets.ethereumevents.global domain that I own. And then developing a custom Ethereum payment system that integrates with pretix  I\u2019m interested in working on a community / EthMagicians ticketing solution that can accept ETH (and DAI and other arbitrary ERC20s) and especially at the beginning of the year there could be lots of others that want to use this throughout 2019. I\u2019m not sure if we can get this done quickly enough. We could use a self-hosted pretix for registration and then follow up in a couple of weeks? a month? once a payment solution is deployed?

So I saw this message, logged in to pretix, verified that the transaction was in the EthMagicians wallet and then \u201cmarked the order as paid\u201d in pretix. I also added a comment to the order with a link to your transaction in Etherscan. Please, do you have any notes on the ticket process or the instructions? I am proposing we go ahead with this method for now. I can give access / permission to other people to also help manage pretix and edit the wording and so on.
