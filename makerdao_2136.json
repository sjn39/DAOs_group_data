A lot of good questions were asked and hopefully I answered them satisfactorily. Omnistrat brings plan-based governance to DAO operations. We believe it is a better model for tapping the wizdom of the community, building stronger plans with broader consensus, and fostering better coordination. It also contributes to the universal coordination toolkit (UCT) Rune envisioned in his Endgame Plan. The video of the presentation and project demo will be posted to Youtube. The presentation used is already linked in the original post above. Please check it out and get in touch with me if you want to pilot Omnistrat in your core unit or future MetaDAO! ",
