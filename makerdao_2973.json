                    "content": "Market Speculation Discussion\u2013All opinions are my opinions With the recent excitement behind the Return of DAI to the Peg, I have started thinking of many reasons as to why this has happened. My first impression\u2013it\u2019s from the news that the community wants to implement the PSM. My other thoughts\u2013perhaps the measures the community has taken via Governance decisions, discussions, and other actions. Or perhaps short-sellers are out and moved-on to other trades, or/and arbitrageurs. The current Maker blog Governance Poll: Accelerate the Peg Stability Module Launch titled \u201cGovernance Poll: Accelerate the Peg Stability Module Launch\u201d states that: \u201cThe PSM will be initially rolled out for at least USDC and (time permitting) to the other stablecoins as well. Debt ceilings will be made high enough to allow as much supply as needed to return the peg to 1.001 USDC.\u201d As I type out this opinion, DAI is 1.0012 to USDC on Coinbase Pro. But I\u2019ve been thinking\u2013is the return to the Peg community driven, Fund/Arb driven, etc., or just a return of CONFIDENCE in DAI, or perhaps POPULARITY? Now before you shush me away  I can tell you that while roaming/lurking around Degen Telegram channels and Discord\u2013I\u2019ve seen messages like, \u201cI\u2019m going to ape-in with 1,000 DAI\u201d. Or, \u201cMaker is adding ________ as collateral\u201d, and \u201cI\u2019m an LP with DAI/%&#\u201d. What I am saying is, the talk of the DeFi community is starting to turn a little positive with regards to Maker and DAI (if I am right, I hope I don\u2019t jinx it ). Okay\u2013we All don\u2019t want to probably talk about it but in my opinion after the Black Thursday events Maker lost some supporters. And it felt like back then on TG, Discord, Crypto Twitter, most wanted to see the protocol fail. Now I\u2019m seeing a resurgence of ETH heads wanting to use DAI, maybe not as much as USDC (would be cool if someone had a study on this) but we are starting to get there. Not quite\u2013but once we get there\u2013that\u2019s when we know it\u2019s on! What are your Thoughts? Do you believe the Peg is returning because_______________. ",
