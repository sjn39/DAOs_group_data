I bought GTC just so I can participate, but this shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. The reason for this is because the growth of Akita has a direct impact on the current and future value of VB:s donation to Gitcoin. The Akita team and its community is the driving force behind increasing the value of the Akita token and the value of this donation. Since Akita plays such a major role in increasing the value of the donation, I think it makes sense to make it easier for that community to vote. ",

(I honestly have a hard time with the fact I have to write this in an online forum to get the point across, around how ridiculous dog meme coins are) The coins being liquidated to an asset with greater economic utility is the only rational play to be made here, furthermore, having outside parties be allowed to directly vote destroys the value proposition of liquid democracy. If the AKITA community want a voice in what happens inside the Gitcoin community they are free to acquire one. To expect one for nothing is foolish. ",

While one solution is to sell all the tokens at market but that would 1. cause immense slippage. 2. cause prices to dump and undue distress to the Akita community. I think the fairest way to distribute those tokens is to airdrop the akita tokens to GTC holder addresses wrt the % of their GTC holdings. This will not cause prices to fall sharply since many would hold on to the tokens and at the very least not everyone will sell at the same time. Also if Akita holders believe in their project and their dev team continues to build features to their product this would be a great way to introduce new people to their project and many will buy more from market too if they see value in the project.
