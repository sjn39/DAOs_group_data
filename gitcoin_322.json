                    "content": "Hey all! Over the last few years, Gitcoin has been building solutions around how we fund the public goods we care about, most successfully using quadratic funding, a novel mechanism designed by Vitalik, Glen Weyl, and Zoe Hitzig in 2018. The way this mechanism works is simple, projects in Ethereum can list themselves as public goods in need of funding, and participants can democratically allocate funds from a community managed matching pool by donating some of their own money. By its design, quadratic funding incentivizes every member of the community to fund the infrastructure they want to see in direct proportion to how useful it will be to them, providing a possible solution to our digital tragedy of the commons. Given the interest we\u2019ve seen so far from an amazing group of stewards, and some of the recent heated debate we\u2019ve seen around what to do with AKITA, I\u2019d like to propose a workstream around how we think about best leveraging quadratic funding, and in particular how we decide some of the operational details of the Gitcoin Grants matching rounds we run each quarter. Some ideas for what this workstream might address include:  Best practices for managing the Gitcoin Grants matching pool and multisig by proposing round sizes, themes, and parameters for stewards to review and vote on Creating policy regarding what is/is not an acceptable grant (what counts as a public good?) Deciding on what a fair dispute resolution process for grants might look like Helping to manage the broader GitcoinDAO treasury and push forward positive-sum, multiplayer games through inter-DAO collabs like token swaps  If you already know this is a workstream you\u2019d want to be part of and you\u2019ve already stated your intent to be a steward here, just fill out this workstream-specific Doodle so we can find some time for a first call: https://doodle.com/poll/nz2izg52xzdh6u9h?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link If you\u2019re not sure if this is a fit but don\u2019t want to message publicly, feel free to DM me on our Discord server:    Discord    Join the Gitcoin Discord Server!

Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.   When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).   Anti-sybil is improving but it can\u2019t be perfect.   If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.   So, we need a much more objective mean of funding. Ideally funding amount should be calculated by an algorithm, not by stupid us. We don\u2019t yet have an algorithm capable to predict the future of the human work. The solution is to use a prediction market to predict a future algorithm results. So the market decides. Traders (when motivated by money) are much more careful, hard working, and through than some random quadratic voter. Traders are therefore multitudinous that much reduces randomness and bias. They are to follow an objective algorithm that motivates them and so the market is striving for objective results. So, I provide a software that \u201cforces\u201d traders to \u201ccalculate\u201d how much which project to fund. There will appear a new profession: people that search for underrepresented public good projects and do SEO for them. That\u2019s important. It should be in addition to quadratic Grants. Users should have choice where to pay. This software is almost fully implemented (and there is a little outdated pull request to integrate it into a GitCoin page). The proposal:  Pay for quality audit of the smart contracts. Assign me to finish integrating it into GitCoin site. Do a good design. Deploy on production.  Here is the PR and more details:  Integrate \"future salaries\" into GitCoin \u00b7 Issue #8183 \u00b7 gitcoinco/web \u00b7 GitHub Future Salaries system by vporton \u00b7 Pull Request #8265 \u00b7 gitcoinco/web \u00b7 GitHub  We need both quadratic funding and this thing.

I\u2019m a humanist, solarpunk, engineer and in crypto since 2016. I\u2019m super interested in funding public goods as before I built together with +1800 persons and without raising a single USD apart from gitcoin donations, a social media website for helping during the pandemic, it was called FightPandemics.com, the idea was to launch a social DAO, but I realized that the majority of people don\u2019t really grasp human and social capital and when I saw the rise of NFTs I realized that creators could potentially fund social causes that they care about and that\u2019s how DoinGud started. On DoinGud, every creation will have a social cause attached to it. I\u2019d love to be part of this working group and co-create with you. ",
