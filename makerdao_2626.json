I feel that there are risk topics that aren\u2019t related to collateral (technical risk, system design risk, etc), so it might be good to have sub-categories (if that\u2019s a thing on discourse.) I also think it would be tidier to separate the meta-discussion on the risk framework and models from the execution of it on individual examples of collateral too. ",
