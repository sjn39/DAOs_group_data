That is actually also much different that I was expecting. I was quite sure until recently that executives can be reused, so we can go back to old settings of a system. ",

Said in Maker terminology - A spell once cast can not be cast again. As jernejml says we can always create a new spell with the same values if it is needed - but as with any spell, it will require enough votes in order to become the new hat. This behaviour functions as a way to protect the system where each new spell can only be cast if it exceeds the amount of MKR on an existing spell. ",

I wonder if there is no attack vector there. What if now someone put MKR on some old executive so it get higher than current hat, wouldn\u2019t it increase requirements for all new votes? You would need more vote that most popular executive not more than current hat. And it is not so theoretical as it seems. I see currently on https://mkrgov.science/executive 50k MKR\u2019s sitting on 08 Jan 20 vote, so if someone put theree additional 3k it would be harder to vote out than current Hat on vote passed 06 Dec 19 there is more than 36k on vote passed 22 Aug 19 (sic!) theree is almost 13k Or \u2018it is a feature not a bug\u2019 ? Like You want MKR holders to give ability to contestate current directions of governance by putting MKR\u2019s to some old proposal and basically freezing governance? It is significantly easier with all this votes sitting on old proposals probably completely unintentionaly ",
