Currently, the foundation is providing for that but it isn\u2019t expected to last forever. DAI is insured by the surplus buffer (owned by MKR holders) and MKR issuance. The DAI surplus buffer can be redeemed by DAI holders with an ES. MKR issuance in time of crisis is detrimental to MKR holders as it can come with a low issuance price (Maker buy and burn MKR when the price is high and issue MKR when the price is low). Maker doesn\u2019t have any financial resources to encourage DAI usage or enforce the peg. The strategic reserves fund (SRF) intent is to provide financial resources and processes to MakerDAO in order to address those 3 concerns.  A poll on such idea gained support with the Maker community: [Poll] Creation of a MakerDAO strategic reserves (solving the peg). This Declaration of Intent is the next step. Declaration Detail  The overall intent is to raise and manage Maker funds by defining a new component of Maker Protocol : The strategic reserves fund (SRF) Main goals of the SRF are:  Allows MakerDAO to cover operational expenses in the future and stop being dependent on the foundation for that. Increase DAI product utility by conducting operations in the open markets (DAI product utility should be correlated with MKR price) Provide a revenue stream uncorrelated from DAI stability fees Provide funds in case of DAI subsystem failure to avoid issuing MKR at a low price and dilute existing MKR holders Due to the novelty and the complexity of the task, all implementation details provided here are only tentative and the final implementation can deviate. All details are provided for illustration on the intent.   There are 4 subcomponents in the SRF intent: Fund raising, Strategy, Tactics and Gouvernance. The Maker Protocol is currently composed mainly (only?) by the DAI Credit System that contains all the vaults and the surplus buffer. The SRF is not connected to the DAI Credit System. The failure of one doesn\u2019t impact the other (in case of ES, SRF is not affected). The net asset value of the SRF belongs to MKR holders with no recourse from DAI holders or vault owners.   Fund raising This intent recognizes that strategic reserves can\u2019t be minted. The SRF will start with MKR tokens as assets. Those will be sold on the market as needed. A floor price will be decided by MakerDAO governance under which MKR can\u2019t be sold in order to protect MKR price. 3 sources of MKR are considered:  Issuance of a fixed amount of MKR tokens (e.g. 20k) at the creation of the SRF Transfer of some MKR tokens from the foundation in exchange of taking some foundation expenses (using a net present value of future expected expenses) Issuance of MKR tokens when MKR tokens are burnt through flap auctions (keeping the MKR outstanding amount fixed). This is the most likely way. An alternative would be to suck() DAI from the Surplus Buffer to the Strategic Reserves.  Strategy MakerDAO governance will set the strategy of the SRF as general guidance and operational boundaries with an on-chain vote. Initial guidance can be:  Main objective: Buy and burn MKR tokens when the price is cheap Secondary objective: Generate yield by providing liquidity to pools that improve DAI usability  A boundary framework can be set as follow to begin with:  Allowed assets:  MKR DAI USDC: max 50% of assets PAX: max 50% of assets TUSD: max 50% of assets ETH: max 10% of assets Uniswap liquidity pools: max 50% of assets, with underlying assets limits   Allowed smart contracts:  Maker Vaults Maker Oasis Uniswap trade: only to sell MKR tokens above $500 or to buy MKR tokens below $300 Uniswap liquidity pools   Allowed external wallets:  None   Maximum amount per transaction: $110k  Tactics MakerDAO governance will also set the tactic that should be used to implement the strategy. While strategy contains broad objectives, hard boundaries and is not expected to change frequently, tactics are like a script to follow. The tactics can be changed more frequently depending on the environment while staying within the boundaries of the strategy. There can be many concurrent tactics. For instance, here is some tactics: MKR price protection  If net asset value of the reserves are > $10M and MKR price below the boundary framework ($300)  Buy up to $100k MKR tokens per day on Uniswap    DAI peg enabler  Sell up to $100k of MKR tokens per day to USDC on Uniswap with a selling price above $600. Add the proceed to a USDC-A vault Generate the maximum allowed DAI Sell those DAI to USDC, PAX and TUSD on Oasis.  The selling price should be between 1.005 and 1.015 Inside this range, it should be the price obtained on coingecko for the previous day minus 0.1%    The scripts are executed by the SRF gouvernance. The SRF governance is mandated to follow the script. It is nevertheless expected that unexpected circumstances will override the script by doing nothing and asking for MakerDAO to update the tactics. For example: strong suspicion on a USDC issue, USDC $ price outside of [0.995,1.005], \u2026 SRF Governance While tactics are implementations of the overall strategy, they are set in motion by the SRF governance. The SRF might be implemented as a multisig wallet that will require 4 out of 7 validators. Those 7 validators will represent the SRF governance. They are elected or removed by an on-chain vote by the MKR holders. The SRF Governance elect a Treasurer that will report each week the evolution of the SRF. A template report will be defined. There might be a need to create a Treasury domain team in the future, espacially when the Strategic Reserves Fund will be used to pay for MakerDAO expenses (staff and oracles). This will also require work on MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer.

SebVentures:  Maker will need at some point financial resources to pay for its own expenses   In my humble opinion better solved by diverting parts of the continuously generated funds from the Stability Fees to a specific purpose when this is needed. Timing the buys of MKR? I think it has been pointed out by other forum members that none of us will be able to time this correctly.     SebVentures:  Maker doesn\u2019t have any financial resources to encourage DAI usage or enforce the peg.   The idea that Maker will be a trader of its own currency is maybe not the best. To outright speculate in DAI in order to enforce the peg - I do not think that is going to work. You either trust the markets to work or you do not. Trying to enforce certain market outcomes is only going to leave Maker frustrated and broke. Fiat central banks, with vastly more resources compared to Maker, gave up on hard long lasting pegs decades ago. One nice example is the British attempt to protect the value of GBP in 1992 - the Black Wednesday episode.     SebVentures:  Maker doesn\u2019t have any financial resources to encourage DAI usage   If anyone out there has ideas for a Marketing Plan I think they would be welcome. This could be financed as a standalone effort, no need to create a strategic fund for this purpose. ",

As of today, we can guess it will be feed by DAI from fees and not MKR minting (the peg is no longer such a big issue, we have some time). We need to have reserves to pay for domain teams. You can\u2019t tell your workers that they will not be paid because there was an ES and the surplus buffer is empty. This proposal is not timing MKR purchase. It just says that having reserves avoid to mint MKR at the wrong time. Increasing the surplus buffer is not smart but we still need to be able to have a bigger buffer when DAI outstanding will be in billions. There is an illustration that we can buy MKR when it\u2019s really cheap and when we have too much reserves. Not sure that was too aggressive. It doesn\u2019t say we can\u2019t continue to burn MKR from the surplus buffer. The bigger issue with this MIP is the SRF governance, it should use the Chef contract construct like the executive vote. But that\u2019s more of an implementation detail, it doesn\u2019t change the overall idea of having a Treasury. ",

If Maker is going to actively trade its own asset the organization will have to be set up in an entirely different way compared to an organization that is limited to setting the framework for traders. Trading own asset will require a huge fund (which you are proposing) as well as traders, bots and strategies that are just as cutting edge as what the rest of the market can provide. This again will require both manpower and brainpower, likely to such an extent that it will hinder Maker to develop towards a protocol-type structure. (Where I am convinced the real value lies as it is the only way Maker can really scale). Maker (as-is) is already falling behind on core tasks such as staffing and collateral onboarding and now  you want to add more tasks? While I value your input I respectfully disagree with your proposal. ",

So to execute such a tactic safely, it will probably be necessary to develop some sort of oracle-protected trading strategy, or to go through the usual flap auction mechanism. The same applies to open market operations with DAI, including on other AMM venues. This point isn\u2019t really crucial to the spirit of the Declaration of Intent, but I wanted to flag it to make sure you everyone is aware that this is non-trivial. ",

The remaining reason is to be able to pay the Core Unit. Many have devised contingency buffers that are designed to be outside Maker Governance reach. So Strategic Reserves would not solve that. I\u2019m aware a lot of protocols have treasuries on the side of the protocol. For MakerDAO the protocol itself is the treasury (and highly leveraged). It could make sense to have logical separations, but having physical separation is not good. Strategic Reserves could be easier to design and more flexible (as not being linked to the rest of the Maker Protocol code. Could be an idea for the Maker Labs CU.
