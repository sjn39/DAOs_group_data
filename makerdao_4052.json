Agenda Intro by @JuanJuan Presentation by SAM_CAURIS  Cauris Global Fintech Fund \u2014 https://www.caurisfinance.com/index.html  MIP6: [CIM] MIP6 Application: Cauris Global Fintech Fund  Cauris is a mission driven company that applies advanced technology to solve financial issues while providing high risk adjusted returns to its investors. We aim to give 100 million more people access to capital. We believe that access to credit is key to empowering individuals and enabling economic growth. According to the World Bank, to close the gap on financial inclusion and enable the gig economy, medium & small enterprises need $5.2TN in financing. Traditional banks unfortunately have been unable to fulfil this gap as illustrated by the fact that only 25% of Africa\u2019s population has a bank account vs. 90% in OECD countries. As shown above, there is clearly a need to disrupt the traditional banking system to make financial inclusion around the globe a reality. At Cauris, we believe that fintech is the fastest way to efficiently connect millions to financial services, and that DeFi provides a unique opportunity to democratize and lower the cost of financing. Driven by this mission, we are finding the best-in class fintechs operating in international markets which are providing working capital and access to financing to consumers and SMEs. We use a combination of strong underwriting and legal protections to secure our debt investments in fintechs.

Welcome to another MakerDAO collateral call. My name is Juan. I am the facilitator for the SES CU. Today, we have another RWA call. We are going to be exploring Cauris and the team behind them. We have a very interesting presentation ahead. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

Is that on a demand basis, or is it more of a relationship where you have offered revolving credits? 46:15 - Someone: First, you mentioned that this is similar to a revolving line. Is it similar to revolver or to an invoice financing line? Revolvers are unsecured: what type of secure lien do you have on the underwriting loan? Second, do you have any buy back agreements with the originators? 48:05 - Someone: To make sure I understood correctly,  let me ask a last question. The revolver line is secured on the overall assets of the company,  is it secured as an extra lien on the lending collateral, or the ending collateral is pledged just to size the line? 48:52 - Frank Cruz (from chat): What type of analysis do you perform to anticipate losses and how do you monitor the compliance of covenants?   Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 52:46  Is there anything else that the team would like to say before closing the call? Where can people find you if they want to know more about these topics?  Alexandre Liege: There is a MIP6 application with our email addresses and how to contact us.   We can keep the discussion going at the forum. Thank you for presenting; it was really nice having you. Thank you to everyone else for coming!   Credits   @gala produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
