The idea has been around since at least the withdrawn MIP31 and was recently resurfaced by @MakerMan in a forum discussion of MKR liquidity. The simplest way to accomplish this is to add protocol owned DAI/MKR LP shares to Uniswap V2. Specifically, we will take 10M DAI from the surplus buffer and about 5k MKR from the treasury, and deposit these together into Uniswap LP shares.  Pros  Simple No need to wait on sweeping tokenomic redesigns that have had difficulty finding consensus (e.g., Sagittarius Engine, gbMKR, etc) Mostly orthogonal to MKR flap auctions  Helps identify a minimum and maximum MKR price for both flap and flop auctions Automatically buys low, sells high, and captures the spread Obtains some return on otherwise idle capital sitting in the surplus buffer Extremely gas efficient (i.e., set up and forget about it)   Cons  Potentially interferes with the ability to raise lots of DAI from MKR sales Trading strategy is practically opposite to flop auctions    Future Directions  DAI/MKR LP vault to create leveraged positions (maybe with liquidations turned off?) Potentially an attractive vehicle for long-term core unit employee compensation (i.e., DAI/MKR LP shares) A MIP (or instant access module) that provides a formula to size the LP position. The LP position should always be much smaller than the surplus buffer to try to avoid flop auctions. Upgrade the voting system to allow DAI/MKR LP shares to vote Integration into more sweeping tokeconomic redesign     Allocate 20M to protocol owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This signal will run for two weeks and close on 2022-02-24T07:59:00Z. If support for Yes exceeds No then the question will proceed to an on-chain poll. Edit: By LFW\u2019s request, I hereby amend this signal to end in three weeks 2022-03-03T07:59:00Z because of EthDenver. ",

There are some additional considerations though, like if you think the market will move in anticipation of the deposit. Might be a thing if overall liquidity is thin relative to the deposit but that\u2019s a governance consideration more than a technical one. I guess a big problem with this is that you\u2019d need to set an approval from the pause proxy to the uniswap router, which upon reflection is not ideal. I think I\u2019d feel more comfortable with a separate contract that allows for MKR + Dai deposits and then permissionlessly handles deposit/withdrawal in a separate transaction. More work, but a lot safer.  Quoted from here ",

Either through something like a AAVE loan with MKR as the backing collateral or a direct sale of your MKR. I.e you take 10K MKR sell half for DAI and then use that to make your liquidity pool.   Using Aave would involve more smart contract risk. Also, couldn\u2019t Aave liquidate the loan if MKR price dropped? As for taking 10k MKR and selling half for DAI, how would you do that slowly without moving the market price? And it\u2019s more complicated. You\u2019d probably need to delegate this to a human trading desk. That\u2019s possible to do, but it would take a lot more time to set up. Using the surplus buffer is technically the simplest solution.     Andy_McCall:  Also why 20MM?   Dunno, it seems like we can afford to withdraw another 10M DAI from the surplus buffer. Oracles did it recently and nothing broke. Certainly you don\u2019t want to go much bigger than 10M DAI because we need some surplus buffer to avoid flops.     Andy_McCall:  Also also why a V2 pool? Why not a gelato pool on v3?   I think the V2 pool is technically easier to access with a non-interactive script. I\u2019m trying to think of a way to do this that would involve writing as little code as possible. V3 also has a lot more smart contract risk than V2. I\u2019m thinking V2 because that\u2019s the conservative choice.  To sum it up, I know that Uniswap V2 probably is not ultimately the best way to invest part of our treasury, but it is:  Simple Won\u2019t take a lot of time to write the code or audit the code Doesn\u2019t introduce a lot of smart contract risk Doesn\u2019t need us to recruit and hire anybody Doesn\u2019t need babysitting. It\u2019s mostly automated already Is relatively conservative Offers immediate benefits without adding that much risk Is easy to unwind once we are ready to move to something better  ",

While I do think establishing such a pool has merit these are the most important objections I have to the current proposal:  Financing this from the surplus buffer Insufficient elaboration on expected returns and risk Undermines flop auctions which is our capital of last resort.  Let\u2019s start with financing. The surplus buffer is much debated. The general consensus seems to be that it is currently too small. In fact right now there are people arguing that the current limit of 250M is not only right, but should probably be even higher. I do not share that view, but I do share the view that the surplus buffer has a role to play as the first line of defense against bad debt. As such we need it to be liquid at a moment\u2019s notice. That means any use of it should be unwindable instantly, and with close to zero expectation of loss. To add to this, as was pointed out in this proposal, the amount it contains was recently lowered by 10M. These funds went to making sure fundamental operations of the protocol continues to function. That reduction is reason enough in itself to worry and is the opposite of an argument to lower it even more. A much more sensible approach would be to divert all the funds from the MKR treasury and convert half of it into DAI. As of writing MakerDAO has a return on capital of around 4,5%. That means that any new venture we want to finance should have a reasonable expectation of matching that for the same risk level. From the discussion a figure of 5% is presented but with no elaboration of where this is coming from or any data to back it up. A liquidity pool can also not only be assessed by the fees it generates but also on what the chances are of impermanent losses becoming actual losses. I fail to find any information about the expectations and estimations for potential losses. Lastly the setup of this pool runs reverse to our flop auctions. This may not be a big problem, but I would like to see a more thorough analysis of expected effect on flop auctions. Flops are our last resort of raising capital and if this makes even a tiny chance we will be unable to raise enough capital in a black Thursday type event, it would be terribly irresponsible to go through with this. Lastly I want to say that this post might come across as a bit negative. As I stated at the start, I think this idea has merit, but we should do a little more research before we actually allocate any funds to such a project. ",

Sure it has a manager but if the market moves too far too fast you can\u2019t easily manage the liquidity in this properly. The v2 is going to sit quietly acting as a liquidity arb source and compound fees \u2018automatically\u2019. It will always have some liquidity available at whatever price.   No manager, or network access required and zero hazard manager loses control during a sharp price move. Because of the above it is also more network efficient. As to the amount I agree it is arbitrary but we were talking about handing over 10K MKR to windermute and we want liquidity right?  10K (or 1% isn\u2019t an unreasonable start).    The point here is the more LP one supplies the greater chance it will be used, earn fees, and start sopping up MKR. Realize to get at the first 5K of MKR in this LP (if 10K is paired and deposited) will take a 4x price rise (the LP value will only grow by 1/2).  Similarly the price of MKR has to drop 75% before 1/2 the DAI is freed and the value here only drops by 1/2. The last 10% of the MKR in this contract only becomes accessible if the price rises about 100x. Also NOTHING needs to be done to manage this, these Uniswap v2 50:50 LP vaults when filled with TOKEN-STABLECOINs have extremely useful properties when looked at from a DAO perspective. (i.e. if this LP ends up just being there permanently into the future).  If Maker earns even 2-3%/yr on this LP it is a win both from a profit sense and a liquidity providing one. People seem to be massively hot to just spend DAI to burn MKR when we can put up the DAI with MKR and provide liquidity for a market and earn some return doing it? Seems like a better use of MKR and DAI at this point to provide desperately needed MKR:DAI liquidity for trading. ",

Allocating 10M DAI and $10M MKR to an LP would not change the MakerDAO balance sheet per see at t=0 if we use a look-through approach.  While it would increase the amount of DAI by 10M, it would not have a second-order effect on the USDC PSM as those DAI would still be owned by MakerDAO (indirectly through the Uni LP). Same for the MKR part.  From a smart contract perspective, it could lead to a reduction of 10M of the Surplus Buffer (as expected here) or an increase of 10M of the Surplus Buffer if this position would be added as a PSM-like component. It would increase DAI outstanding by 10M. Nevertheless, it would lead to a significant asset risk due to exposure to MKR which is up to 10M (the DAI part of the LP). Obviously, the correlation between the MKR and the \u201cbad situation at MakerDAO where we need the SB\u201d is quite high. Here are some stats of the MKR/ETH LP. I would assume that an MKR/DAI would be having a similar APY (a bit better due to the lower correlation between MKR and DAI, a bit less because people are mainly trading with ETH). Notice how the liquidity was decreasing (this is with a constant v3 LP at 15M, Sushi is 18M also decreasing sharply).  image1796\u00d7540 54.3 KB  So overall, this allocation is most likely not a good risk/reward. Nevertheless, it is good for solving the MKR liquidity issue and a good step to get non-loans assets under MakerDAO balance sheet (but one that doesn\u2019t move the needle and is not scalable). ",

The 5k MKR that is sitting in the treasury is not circulating and does not really affect the value or market cap of MKR.

I think in some respects this discussion might be a little premature. From other posts it seems that if this SR passes it is not going to result in direct implementation, but rather to further exploration by other CUs. From my perspective the base idea is worth exploring, but it probably have to go through a few iterations to make sure it\u2019s safe and profitable. ",

MKR is a relatively liquid asset compared to other similar tokens, for example MKR is more liquid than UNI or YFI on-chain, see the slippage below.  740\u00d7335 45 KB  Currently there is 2775 ($6.2m) in Univ2, 5415 ($12.1m) in Univ3 (relevant for buying MKR), 3615 ($8.1m) in Sushi, 5894 ($13.2m) in Balancer and about $7m of liquidity in Bancor, totaling to about $40m MKR liquidity. Is adding $10m or 25% really going to change the situation significantly? We can\u2019t be sure that we will actually profit from providing this liquidity, we can easily lose to impermanent loss, as MKR is not a high trading volume token and there are already many existing trading pools and pairs, so it is questionable if trading fees will be greater than IL. Generally holding a low trading volume asset will outperform LPing return in the case where the asset appreciates in price. The protocol owned liquidity in the form of LP is a good way to lose everything you have in the case of an emergency. We should hold our non-MKR part of capital in the treasury separated from MKR. If MKR goes to 0 and we do MKR/DAI, we lose everything in that pool. There are also better yielding opportunities for DAI than MKR/DAI LP. Dai in surplus buffers is there to cover potential losses and enable us to be more aggressive towards new products, such as Multichain strategy, D3M, etc. Higher SB directly leads to higher revenue from these new products so the dai is not being idle. I also think there should be a more long-term strategy developed for surplus buffer usage and management in general. This proposal seems a bit random without a solid added value proposition compared to having a higher level of protection to me. We would be spending \u2153 of our current surplus towards this, while we should be building it up, to support a more aggressive approach towards new stuff that has been in development for some time now and will be in production soon, that will generate growth and new cash flows.

Anyways here are some themes:  Profitability Shout out @rema  for running the numbers faster than all of us. Looks like if we want to deploy MKR pairs, or any protocol-owned liquidity, we have to signal & come to a consensus on all the edge cases (to reduce the load on PECU plus have a clear objective). Additionally, we\u2019d have to run the simulations for profitability, which I think is a bit more important than liquidity at the moment especially with SB where it is now.  Desks?     Doo_StableLab:  The cost of operating another Core Unit will be greater than potential benefit we get.   Fair point! The only reason I suggested that was because arbitrageurs source most of the profits in today\u2019s environment (v2 is easy yes, but there is liquidity and platforms all over the place). That breadth was why I suggested a Maker desk. Seed the desk, but make that team manage the inventory and the platforms. Returning some profit share and gaining liquidity along the way for select pairs seems like less effort on PECU. In addition, they can grow select domains, CEX & DEX throughput on DAI pairs, etc. Doesn\u2019t have to be a core unit, it\u2019s just the ool we got. My exchange experience/bias is showing, forgive me.  Experiments? Perhaps I might be spoiling the soup but a starter experiment we might do, at least for hands-off LP management via v2, is with ENS:DAI LP? (s/o to @PaperImperium and @MakerMan ) We could signal for that on a different vote, see the effort and trade-off, hash out if it\u2019s feasible, and see the changes in the wild. Plus in addition, we\u2019d have an analog for measuring profits. ",

                    "content": "    psychonaut:      SebVentures:  it would lead to a significant asset risk due to exposure to MKR which is up to 10M (the DAI part of the LP).   Can you unpack this? Can you walk us through what specific sequence of events you imagine and the corresponding effects?   So the idea is MakerDAO can always mint DAI and MKR. Minting DAI is creating a liability on ourselves (which is a no-op) and minting MKR creates some equity which is accounted for in a mark-to-market way. Again kind of a no-op. We can merge those to generated assets in a Uni V2 MKR/DAI position. I\u2019m arguing that you should always net the token under your control (DAI and MKR) on the balance sheet (in a look-through way if needed). So it doesn\u2019t take space in the balance sheet and doesn\u2019t impact anything really. It\u2019s more of an off-balance sheet position. But let\u2019s keep it on-balance sheet as it is easier to understand.  If you prefer a technical way, you can suck 20M DAI from the Surplus Buffer and buy $10M MKR to ourselves (putting 10M back in the Surplus Buffer), creating the LP and add this LP to a PSM-like contract that will give you back 20M DAI that can be used to refill the PSM. You end up with an SB 10M bigger. So both in the accounting method and the technical method, you end up with a 10M bigger SB and 10M bigger DAI debt. The amount of MKR outside the control of MakerDAO didn\u2019t change. Perception of the market could change as there is now $10M MKR at risk to be in the market. I doubt it will have much of an impact. Now, what happens if the price of the LP changes (due to the MKR price or fees)? If the price of the LP goes down by 67% we will incur a 13.3M loss. Net of the 10M increase in SB, it is a 3.3M loss to the initial surplus buffer. There will be 6.7M DAI released on the market that will reduce the PSM (not important). If we unwind the position (and remove the MKR) the loss will be 6.7M.  image699\u00d7446 7.13 KB  On the other hand, if the price of the LP increases by 10%, we will get an increase of 2M of the Surplus Buffer. But again, if we unwind the position, the MKR position being increased, the net profit will be only 1M.  So overall, a 20M MKR/DAI LP position will expose to a 10M notional risk linked to the price of such LP. It is not a 20M exposure due to the fact that we are using MKR which can be minted (or taken from DSPauseProxy). And MKR should be deducted from the asset side at market price. So if we assume to play safe and use an asset risk capital need of 10M, the RoE would be 10% (5% return over 20M allocated capital). Probably not optimal but not the end of the world. It seems as well that such a position is counter-cyclical in the sense of the amount of MKR in circulation is being reduced when MKR price fall and increased when MKR price increase. But the impact is hard to think of. I will explore more if this signal gets traction, but overall, I don\u2019t think this idea is costing a lot. It should be assessed on the strategic value of higher MKR liquidity and developing PCV first, the former being quite debated in this thread (and for months now). ",
