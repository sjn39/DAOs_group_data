Doesn\u2019t this have the feel of a hail mary, a last-ditch effort with little chance of success? That is, we plan to take on more RWA risk, but the buffer for absorbing losses is much higher variance. If I understand correctly, one of the underlying assumptions to justify MIP84 is regulatory risk:    MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation   we do not have the ability to be comply with financial regulation in the same way centralized stablecoins can, and the Endgame Plan consciously chooses to optimize for resilience against authoritarian attack rather than financial risk.   That is, we need to start preparing for Eagle/Phoenix Stance now, while we still can. But do we really? Now that some time has elapsed since the OFAC Tornado Cash sanctions and people have had time to digest what happened and calm down (see Jake Chervinsky, Katie Haun, and Michael Mosier), I would like to reexamine whether regulatory risk for Maker has actually changed. I tried to analyze this question. In summary, I\u2019m not sure whether I fully understand others\u2019 concerns. DAI does not have an on-chain DenyList (a.k.a. blacklist) and such is likely to be demanded by regulators?  In contrast to Tornado Cash, vanilla DAI transfers are public. Although USDC and Tether have on-chain DenyLists, DAI could be regulated with an off-chain DenyList at the edges where there are fiat off-ramps.  Whether the DenyList is on-chain or off-chain, why does it matter? It is already possible to transfer value on Ethereum via a token that is not encumbered by an on-chain DenyList, that is, using ETH. So DAI doesn\u2019t seem very novel in this regard.    Did OFAC\u2019s Tornado Cash sanctions change the regulatory environment for Maker?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If you vote Yes please explain your reasoning below in a reply. As this is an informal poll, the results will prompt no particular action. ",

Some blockchain projects act unethically or are outright frauds; they are getting flushed out. But are we in this category? I would like to remind you that Maker is more transparent than most TradFi banks/financial institutions. Moreover, the project has been incredibly profitable for two years and will likely return to massive profitability within 3-6 months. We have a lot to be proud of. It is not the moment to prepare to scuttle under furniture like a cockroach. No, we should be making decisions from a sound state of mind: courage, confidence, clarity, creativity, and calm. ",

If we can demonstrate that the governance and decision making of MakerDAO is \u201cTRULY\u201d decentralized, we have a lot of wiggle room to navigate and stay the course. I\u2019m afraid pretty much everything about the Endgame MIP set \u2013 and the way it is being covertly implemented over the past several months consuming DAO resources and competing with mandates that HAVE been approved by MKR votes \u2013 is a nuclear bomb for this project and unleashes untenable regulatory risk for everyone associated.

There are two legal actions at issue. The Order is a consent order under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, agreed to by the bZx LLC and two individuals. The complaint is a civil action under the jurisdiction of the district court targeting the DAO. It defines the bZx DAO as \u201can unincorporated association comprised of holders of Ooki Tokens (or of BZRX Tokens, when the Ooki DAO was doing business as the bZx DAO) who have voted those tokens to govern (e.g., to modify, operate, market, and take other actions with respect to) the Ooki Protocol (formerly named the bZx Protocol) during the DAO Relevant Period.\u201d I\u2019ll also flag this post I made a while ago again: The Real Legal Risks - #17 by 0xbocaJ ",
