If there are txs to my contracts I can detect potential changes; I grab the latest block and look at the hydrated tx list for \u201cto\u201d values matching my contracts. Unfortunately I can\u2019t easily detect internal transactions that alter the state of my contact. To my knowledge there is no easy way to do this; neither the \u201cto\u201d nor \u201cfrom\u201d values are addresses I can predict. Will eth 2 clients and their http/ws endpoints allow easier \u201cwatching\u201d of contracts in this manner? i.e. for changes in smart contract state, no matter the source, initial tx target or manner?
