Introduction  An Oracles susceptibility to market manipulation is linked to the quality of its Data Model. As markets and liquidity profiles evolve, it is important to periodically revisit Data Models for collateral assets to ensure they accurately reflect a comprehensive view of a token\u2019s market. These changes seek to strengthen Oracle Data Models by removing data sources whose influence has waned, and replacing them with alternative sources with superior volume, liquidity, and preferred quote pairings.

Avoiding adding Uniswap V3 ETH/USDT for now to minimize latency from recursive lookups since USDT is one of the most commonly used quote tokens.  YFI/USD  Removed Gemini Removed Uniswap V3 due to poor liquidity and lack of volume Appended Kraken USD pairing Appended Balancer V2 YFI/WETH, low volume but high liquidity Appended Sushiswap V3 YFI/WETH, low volume but high liquidity   Summary  The changes to the Data Models are centered around the philosophy of:  maximizing the amount of capital a market manipulator would need to deploy to manipulate a median including USDT pairs for price-discovery, while minimizing impact of USDT failure preferring USD pairs whenever possible no reuse of exchanges in a Data Model to mitigate the impact of a rogue exchange operator avoiding inclusion of exchanges with reputation for wash trading unless absolutely necessary AMMs with wide-band liquidity provision are more capital intensive and risky for 3rd parties to manipulate minimize recursive queries between Data Models as much as possible   Oracle Address(es)   BTC/USD Medianizer - 0xe0F30cb149fAADC7247E953746Be9BbBB6B5751f BTC/USD Oracle Security Module - 0xf185d0682d50819263941e5f4EacC763CC5C6C42 LINK/USD Medianizer - 0xbAd4212d73561B240f10C56F27e6D9608963f17b LINK/USD Oracle Security Module - 0x9B0C694C6939b5EA9584e9b61C7815E8d97D9cC7 MANA/USD Medianizer - 0x681c4F8f69cF68852BAd092086ffEaB31F5B812c MANA/USD Oracle Security Module - 0x8067259EA630601f319FccE477977E55C6078C13 YFI/USD Medianizer - 0x89AC26C0aFCB28EC55B6CD2F6b7DAD867Fa24639 YFI/USD Oracle Security Module - 0x5F122465bCf86F45922036970Be6DD7F58820214  Changelog  Updated BTC/USD Data Model Updated LINK/USD Data Model Updated MANA/USD Data Model Updated USDT/USD Data Model Updated YFI/USD Data Model ",
