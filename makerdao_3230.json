                    "content": "Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @Akiva, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi image1128\u00d7763 124 KB Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates Feb 2021 Table Notes:  Competitive rates are based on lowest stablecoin borrow rates on each lending venue for particular collateral, except when stablecoins are used as collateral (in such case only DAI borrow rate is compared) Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards at Compound & Cream and due to rates and rewards accrued on deposited collateral Risk premiums were recently updated for every Vault type except stablecoins where we used values from last governance votes. Links to calculations can be found in the table above. Lending products between secondary lenders and MakerDAO are not standardized and therefore rates can not be strictly compared.  Lending Market Overview The lending market keep having high rates as we are still in a bull run. Nevertheless, it\u2019s lowering a bit Competitive Landscape Rates at competing defi lenders increased markedly in January versus the previous month, with Aave in particular experiencing several rate spikes. Both Compound and Aave have seen rates fall somewhat towards the very end of January, although they remain above levels from early December. image815\u00d7449 66 KB Source: loanscan.io Looking forward, Cream Finance will begin supporting Uniswap and Sushiswap LPs as collateral beginning this month, and Aave is adding support for Balancer BAL token. Alpha Homora has also launched v2 which offers support for a variety of LP tokens. Once they are live, the new product offerings may increase competition Maker faces for these collateral assets. Compound is also considering a proposal to increase WBTC collateral factor from 60% to 75% (equivalent to lowering liquidation ratio from 166% to 133%), which will increase competition for BTC backed loans. Proposed Rate Changes ETH-A: SF increase from 3.5% to 4.5%  Since the last Rates Change Proposal more than 400M DAI-from-ETH-A have been minted, raising our debt exposure significantly. The increase of the SF is not fully covering the Risk Premium and we will most probably need to make another raise within this month if the pace of minting is not getting slower in the next days. From a pure risk perspective we should raise the SF much higher to prevent further debt exposure, since the only other weapon we have (Surplus Buffer) is only a long term strategy (see ongoing Signal Request). We are still better than the average competition, anticipating that the rates at competitors will rise as well. ETH-B: SF increase from 6.5% to 7.5%  ETH-B already hit the Debt Ceiling for almost a month and Maker Community does not want to raise it due to the high risk exposure. The SF-increase is following ETH-A here, hopefully moving some vaults over to ETH-A. WBTC-A: SF increase from 4.0% to 4.5%  Almost 100M DAI-from-WBTC-A has been created in the last month, raising our debt exposure. Adjusting the SF therefore, bringing it to parity with ETH-A. Raising it even higher might make our product less competitive. BAT-A: SF decrease from 8.0% to 6.0%  DC and DAI-from-BAT decreased a lot. Also, there was one big vault on BAT-A with a fairly low CR that closed as well. As debt exposure is lowered and the high risk vault is gone, we can safely reduce the SF. LINK-A: SF increase from 2.0% to 3.5%  DAI-from-LINK has tripled in the last month, making it necessary to adjust the SF. We are still better than the competition, but might need to adjust depending on the future debt exposure. COMP-A: SF increase from 2.0% to 3.0%  Economically it makes no sense to supply COMP as collateral right now, as Compound is giving far better rates (-6.73%). Nevertheless, there is a single vault responsible for 6M of DAI. The Risk Premium itself is higher due to low liquidity of COMP, but if we match that we would probably force the vault owner out of the system. BAL-A: SF increase from 2.0% to 3.5%  BAL-A usage - though still pretty low - increased a bit in the last 2 months. Competitive rates on BAL increased as well making it reasonable to adjust to the market rates as well. YFI-A: SF decrease from 6.0% to 5.5%  Based on the current debt exposure (~7M ) the Stability Fee could be a bit lower, however there is more YFI coming in expected so it would not be wise to go much lower on the rates. We already overshoot once on the SF for YFI (in the other direction though). UNIV2DAIETH-A: SF increase from 1.0% to 2.0%  The fees for this collateral type were set based on the SF of ETH-A when UNIV2DAIETH-A was initially proposed. It should be half of ETH-A SF, we decided to keep it a bit lower since we want to encourage DAI-from-LPs in general. DC was maxed within 3 days and the debt exposure will surge as soon as we increase the DC. Uniswap based LP-tokens just got added to Cream and will get added to Aave soon - we are fine with subsidizing so we keep the first mover advantage. UNIV2USDCETH-A: SF increase from 1.0% to 2.5% Same as UNIV2DAIETH-A - a bit more since USDC is having a little more centralization risk and we do favor DAI-based LP-tokens. Depending on the future growth of LP-token-based vaults, we might need to go a lot higher here. UNIV2WBTCETH-A: SF increase from 1.0% to 3.5% Same reasoning as UNIV2DAIETH-A - was proposed during times of very low SF for both ETH and WBTC-based vault-types. No Change KNC-A: No changes (2.0% SF) No changes are proposed as debt exposure is still insignificant. ZRX-A: No changes (2.0% SF) No changes are proposed as debt exposure is still insignificant. MANA-A: No changes (5.0% SF) No changes are proposed. LRC-A: No changes (3.0% SF) No changes are proposed. UNI-A: No changes (3.0% SF) No changes are proposed. AAVA-A: No changes (4.0% SF) No changes are proposed. RENBTC-A: No changes (6.0% SF) No changes are proposed. USDC-B (50,0% SF) No changes are proposed. USDC-A, TUSD-A, PAX-A, GUSD-A, USDT-A: No changes (0.0% SF) No changes are proposed. Final Note With more than 4.7B TVL and 1.6B DAI outstanding MakerDAO remains committed to offer competitive and stable rates to our customers. Nevertheless, the growth we are facing might force us to increase SF before the next monthly meeting, mainly on ETH-A, if demand continues to push risk higher. Right now, the SF is the only arrow in our quiver until we have higher Surplus Buffer and Liquidations 2.0. Proposed SFs will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on Monday 8th February, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on Friday 12th February. ",

As my work on the crash in slow motion showed, we are not talking about credit risk here. It\u2019s mainly operational and market risks which are super difficult to assess. Speaking for myself, I hope increasing the SF will limit the exposure before we need to stop being competitive. The surplus buffer is also increasing meaning we can increase risk (but not at the same pace sadly). Still waiting on RWA and derivates of DAI to be less crypto beta exposed. ",

One concern I have is that it appears we are not optimizing for best market rates, and this potentially puts us at a disadvantage to grow our market share of the stable coin market. At this stage of Makerdao, much like any early startup, we should be optimizing for growth (and corresponding network effects), rather than trying to squeeze out any profits more than what we need to run the DAO and protect against systemic risks from a black swan event. When I look at Dai\u2019s position in the market, we are firmly in 3rd place in many metrics including token operations, total supply, active addresses, and transaction volume. I understand that we need to raise rates to protect against risk, but are we thinking as creatively as possible to keep rates very low? For example, we are now building up our surplus buffer and over the coming months it will hopefully grow to 30 million, but what can we do more immediately to protect from a black swan event that will allow us to keep rates low? I still like offloading risk with a partnership with Nexus Mutual and appreciated @Hugh_Karp\u2019s presentation in the governance meeting. Since we don\u2019t give out farming rewards, we need to subsidize low rates to reach escape velocity and catch up to USDC. ",

Those are now decorrelated thanks to the PSM. Having a huge USDC position is also a way to ensure that DAI keeps the peg should the DAI demand diminish. Black Thursday and the inability to keep the peg have hurt the DAI position. Increasing the DSR is an option to add new DAI users. There is most likely a lot of other stuff we should be doing. But dealing with the rate is, in my opinion, a weak tool to increase DAI adoption. ",

For instance, for ETH-A the Risk Premium is 6% currently and up to 10% at a DC of 1.7B. Obviously, those are just indications. As my work on the crash in slow motion showed, we are not talking about credit risk here. It\u2019s mainly operational and market risks which are super difficult to assess.   I suppose that is really my point. The market risks of how much ETH could move (downward) and its cascading impact on liquidations should drive the risk premium for the loss. I easily could be missing the logic that was applied to the model, but I don\u2019t see where that simulation-style risk analysis determines that Risk Premium (default risk where MKR has a loss). In my eyes, that is paramount to determine. ",

Granted i fully acknowledge that simulations are complex in nature (and liquidity at a known price can disappear at a moments notice); however i would think the key characteristic is the ability for the dao / protocol to divest at a known price (hence the put comment at the top). Maybe some of the algos that determine options pricing are things the DAO could consider\u2026 PUTs in this context (w/ ETH as collateral) would work better than other collaterals as the derivatives market is emerging w/ ETH\u2026 for sure derivatives for other collateral types are way behind.

We are relying on volumes because a lot of trading is still out of AMMs (LINK being one good example). We need to adjust it somehow so that AMM pool size is used as a metric. Usually large pool size also means higher volume, but at BAL volume is unusually low compared to pool size. And pool size is actually most informative for slippage estimation. ",

Competitive Landscape The rates at competing defi lenders increased in the first three weeks of February, but then decreased by ~5% in the last week due to the sharp drop on all crypto assets. Chart1200\u00d7742 79.9 KB Source: loanscan.io Proposed Rate Changes MANA-A SF: decrease from 5.0% to 4.0%  While the debt exposure almost doubled to 1MM in the last month, the liquidity also improved a lot on MANA. This allows us to decrease the Stability Fee to encourage more minting of DAI. UNIV2WBTCDAI-A: decrease from 3.0% to 2.0% So far no DAI has been minted with this LP-collateral. Since it is a DAI-based LP-token, we think it makes sense to decrease the Stability Fee a bit to see if this stimulates minting. RENBTC-A: decrease from 6.0% to 5.0% 908\u00d7524 35.2 KB Ren just got acquired by Alameda which decreases the counterparty and custody risk of RenBTC. RENBTC is - while still probably a bit riskier than WBTC - a good way to diversify our BTC-exposure. Decreasing the Stability Fee should hopefully help on getting some more debt exposure for this collateral. ETH-based UniV2LP-tokens: increase by 1% We want to increase the Stability Fee for all ETH-based UniV2LP-tokens by 1% for two reasons: We increased the Stability Fee for ETH-A/ETH-B in the Mid-Month Rates Changes Proposal by 1/1.5% and auctions on LP-Tokens have been performing a bit worse than other auctions. Impact on the Stability Fees:  UNIV2DAIETH-A: increase from 2.0% to 3.0%  UNIV2USDCETH-A: increase from 2.5% to 3.5%  UNIV2WBTCETH-A: increase from 3.5% to 4.5%  UNIV2ETHUSDT-A: increase from 4.0% to 5.0%  UNIV2LINKETH-A: increase from 4.0% to 5.0%  UNIV2UNIETH-A: increase from 4.0% to 5.0%  UNIV2AAVEETH-A: increase from 4.0% to 5.0%   No change ETH-A: No changes (5.5% SF)  After a last week\u2019s market correction, DAI debt on major collateral assets decreased and DAI demand increased as vaults deleveraged their positions. This also had an effect on DAI minting from USDC. In the current situation where crypto prices seem to be moving in a side-ways pattern we don\u2019t foresee a rate increase. However if prices start increasing again with the same pace observed in the last few months and debt growth continues, we may need to react on rate increase, potentially before next month\u2019s rate meeting. ETH-B: No changes (9.0% SF) Same as ETH-A, no change for now. ETH-C: No changes (3.5% SF) Same as ETH-A, no change for now. WBTC-A: No changes (4.5% SF) No changes are proposed BAT-A: No changes (6.0% SF) No changes are proposed KNC-A: No changes (2.0% SF) No changes are proposed ZRX-A: No changes (2.0% SF) Debt exposure has increased significantly, but mostly by one vault (4MM) that seems to use every existing DeFi product and has a net-worth of >300MM. Although the newly calculated risk premium is at 7% we may not want to cause losing this user (and potentially others) by increasing the rate and lowering it thereafter. LINK-A: No changes (3.5% SF) No changes are proposed. COMP-A: No changes (3.0% SF) No changes are proposed. LRC-A: No changes (3.0% SF) No changes are proposed. BAL-A: No changes (3.5% SF) No changes are proposed. YFI-A: No changes (5.5% SF) The debt exposure has increased significantly, but mostly from one big vault with a CR of >450% (yearn treasury) which doesn\u2019t severely affect risk premium. No changes are proposed. UNI-A: No changes (3.0% SF) No changes are proposed. AAVE-A No changes (4.0% SF) No changes are proposed. USDC-A, TUSD-A, PAX-A, GUSD-A, USDT-A: No changes (0.0% SF) No changes are proposed. Final Note The market has cooled down significantly in the last weeks, which is one major driver for not making any big changes on the Stability Fees. If the debt exposure is growing with the same rate as in the beginning of the month, we will need to propose changes to the rates before the next usual meeting. Proposed SFs will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-03-07T23:00:00Z, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on 2021-03-11T23:00:00Z. ",

Around 400MM of DAI has been minted from ETH-A alone, the increase of SF has not slowed down the minting rate.  Additionally something else changed: Two weeks ago 15% (or 132MM of DAI-from-ETH-A) were coming from vaults with a CR of <225%. Today it is 38% (or 500MM of DAI-from-ETH-A). This recent worsening of CR distribution considerably increased the risk profile of ETH-A according to @Risk. The Rates Group will tackle the situation in more detail in the next meeting, but as immediate action @Risk-Core-Unit will run an onchain-poll about increasing the SF for ETH-based vaults starting next Monday:  increase the SF for ETH-A by 1% from 4.5% to 5.5% increase the SF for ETH-B by 1.5% from 7.5% to 9%  We will have ETH-C soon so we have another option for vault-owners who want to stay heavily overcollateralized - but the risk has been heavily changed in the last weeks so we are forced to mitigate it.
