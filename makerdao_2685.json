On the first half we will have Lucas presenting Centrifuge and on the second half Matthew Rabinowitz with 6s Capital. Personally, and I believe everyone else joining me here, we want to see progress in bringing RWA into the platform. We have a lot of information scattered, industry experts and a lot of people that have a say, so we are at a point where we need to organize and structure a working plan and move things forward. S\u00e9bastien Derivaux has posted a thread to make a working group that will hopefully make things move forward, people rally around it, maybe have regular calls and a clear action plan. Do you want to comment about it, Seb?  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, I\u2019m leading this group to find a way to get RWA on Maker as soon as possible and mainly to offer a third view. Now we have Centrifuge proposing one kind of collateral and 6s proposing something a bit different and I want to explore a third way to merge those assets to get RWA into Maker as soon as possible and in a better shape for all Maker.   Frank asked on the chat if this meeting will happen every Wednesday. Not yet, but ideally we would leave with some action points. That could be one of them and there\u2019s this forum thread that S\u00e9bastien posted so ideally we would get people\u2019s value around that and get something concrete going on.  S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Yes, there is a Google Doc that will be expanded and everyone is free to comment on it. Lucas Vogelsang: I would really support having RWA focus call every other week. I think that what Seb proposed here, using the working group as a vessel, it\u2019s a good idea.   Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

Can you comment on this? 23:20 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I thought that on your website you need to have some KYC for your investors, would that be needed for Maker or is it not too important? 25:25 - Will Remor: Would it be possible for you to share some of the data that the asset originators are collecting in terms of those industry numbers and in different reports in past performance, the data fields that have been collected? 26:55 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I have a comment for the working group, maybe it would be good to have very clear steps on what do we have, what\u2019s next, what do we need, from the risk point of view, the technical point of view, any MIP that should be approved for it to happen and maybe do a FAQ section where we can post these questions with answers and supporting documents. I think that will be very useful.  6s Capital  MIP21: Real World Assets - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender  MIP13c3-SP4 Declaration of Intent & Commercial Points - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets as Collateral for a DAI loan   Matthew Rabinowitz Presentation 27:45 Intro983\u00d7550 140 KB Disclaimer1001\u00d7567 288 KB Peter Drucker quote1004\u00d7575 77.9 KB Why?981\u00d7501 77.2 KB What is needed?981\u00d7497 93.1 KB What are we trying to accomplish?975\u00d7498 97.6 KB Why and how is this different?978\u00d7497 105 KB Smart Contract and Legal Risk Graph978\u00d7550 76.7 KB Change your perspective977\u00d7552 120 KB How is it done today?987\u00d7557 63.2 KB Today, from the eyes of the developer980\u00d7552 115 KB Today, from the eyes of Maker979\u00d7558 136 KB Objective976\u00d7545 90.2 KB Future, they eyes of the developer999\u00d7567 132 KB From the eyes of a senior debt facility980\u00d7567 170 KB From the eyes of Maker987\u00d7553 93.6 KB How do we scale?975\u00d7561 44.8 KB Assembly Line per Tenant980\u00d7541 239 KB Strategy: Developer Assembly Line983\u00d7547 106 KB Real Estate Research983\u00d7551 117 KB Phase II Development981\u00d7558 166 KB Phase III Closing976\u00d7553 126 KB Phase IV: Construction982\u00d7556 196 KB Divestiture/Disposition981\u00d7556 178 KB Three Fundamental Risk areas979\u00d7547 93.5 KB Legal Contracts984\u00d7554 118 KB Smart Contract Risk994\u00d7567 120 KB LendCo984\u00d7542 126 KB BorrowCo982\u00d7549 134 KB Market/Tenant Risk980\u00d7545 165 KB Maker Risk981\u00d7554 55.9 KB Compare and Contrast978\u00d7551 134 KB Graph982\u00d7555 93.6 KB Key Takeaway979\u00d7545 185 KB Proposed Tenant Selection979\u00d7550 115 KB General Sequence978\u00d7552 147 KB Next Steps978\u00d7552 204 KB Contact979\u00d7557 148 KB Discussion  44:40 - Akiva: I think that it\u2019s best if you release some information about the trust and the trust agreements as early as possible, because not only does the Maker Community need due diligence on your specific agreements but many people in the Community may also be wanting to do some diligence on a more general space of trust law so that we understand not only your proposal but also how it works in the context of the more general law. 45:50 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: With the structure that you are proposing, Maker Governance gives you a scope in which you can find projects and execute them, can you explain how broad the scope is that you are proposing and how you want to work with the Maker Community to define this? 47:50 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Is there data that you can share about that? 48:05 - Frank Cruz: Can you please expand on what the Maker representative would need to do such as signing documents on behalf of the community, reviewing documents, reports, etc? 49:35 - Frank Cruz: Is that an on-chain action? Reviewing the contract is fine, but do you see that there would be a Governance vote or an approval on-chain that would have to happen once these representatives review it? 51:45 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: We have a similar situation with the Dark Fix mechanism in Maker where the protocol needs to trust someone, so maybe we can borrow concepts from that. 52:30 - Frank Cruz: I fully agree with you on having an opt-in on every asset and every transaction. It\u2019s better to say like there should be a mechanism to hold this whole mechanism if it goes out of bounds. And this is also what we are proposing with our asset originators because I see that it makes sense in some extent otherwise you end up overloading your Governance Ether (?) and even the representatives that you are proposing to do too much, right? And one other questions is: Do you have one shared equity tranche among all these projects or is it just that each individual project has a piece of equity. So the question is, if one of the projects is a complete default, will that just lead to basically 30% being covered or would it lead to the equity from the entire pool of assets in this category be impacted?  54:50 - Frank Cruz: I was going slightly somewhere else with my question. Let\u2019s say, you have two properties that you are developing, both of them worth a million, both of them with 300,000 in equity, if one of them returns zero dollars, Maker in the end would not be able to get the 600,000 that is equity from both projects but that particular project is only covered by 30%. Right? 55:55 - S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Maybe I can reframe the question, if I understand correctly, the question is if we are doing a loan to 6s Capital and is it an individual loan for each project?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 56:40  As much as I would love to continue discussing about these topics, we are passed the hour, so we\u2019ll call it a day for today and regroup in two weeks from now. Again, call to action, go to the forum on Seb\u2019s post and sign up if you want to attend potential meetings and get documents. Next week, we are going to have Marc Zeller and Stani from Aave discussing their token and then Tyler Winklevoss from Gemini discussing GUSD. Thanks to Lucas, Matthew, Seb, and everyone else for participating.  Credits  Gala Guill\u00e9n produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
