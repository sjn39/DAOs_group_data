Furthermore, I also propose that the UNI that is used to create a governance proposal be locked until the voting is done. This would also apply to people who cast their votes as well. I added another poll so that we can decide as a community on what a fair % of uni to be burned on submission of a proposal would be. EDIT: if this garners enough attention and votes from the community, I will need help going through the necessary channels in order to make this a real proposal that we can vote on. Thank you to all and together we can make UNI \u201cfunction\u201d in a beneficial way for the community.    UNI Burn/ Lock Up  Yes, a proposal spam deterrence would be great. No, keep the current system.     0 voters        % burned on proposal  2% burn 3% burn 5% burn 10% burn     0 voters     ",
