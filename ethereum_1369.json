There will be more coming off the network and with 1559 and POS around the corner, I do not expect redeployment. Indirectly the devs have made this possible due to 1559 and POS so I would like to thank them for making it happen. Thanks for keeping faith with the founding yellow paper and removing the \u201cplague\u201d of ASICs from the network.  image1920\u00d71086 247 KB  ",
