It is mkr holders who voted originally to compensate vault holders during black Thursday, not the foundation. This compensation by mkr holders was voted for out of good will rather than any acceptance of responsibility for losses. This claim of responsibility for losses is I think the main thing the foundation is trying to avoid. The maker protocol and terms and conditions, as well as the open documentation, explained the particulars of the auction process, and that it was possible to lose all funds in a liquidation event. The oasis UI could have been better and had a disclaimer about the 13% liquidation penalty, and that this is the LEAST a vault owner would lose in the event of liquidation and perfectly efficient auctions. That being said, mkr holders, and the protocol, has no control over oasis or any other UI that uses the makerDAO contracts. In any case, the maker community, and presumably mkr holders(although they are largely an anonymous group who we have no way of eliciting feedback from unless they are part of the community), are still trying to find a path forward since the last compensation proposal was voted down.
