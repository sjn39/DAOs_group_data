Solution We have developed an internal tool called Envoy that we use to keep track of new and expiring proposals. It is a simple Node.js application that regularly scrapes the governance page and forwards alerts to a frontend Telegram bot. We are sharing this tool with the Maker community in case other delegate teams run into the same problem. You can now join the Telegram channel here to start receiving alerts: Telegram: Join Group Chat We have also developed a similar tool for Aave which you can find here: [Tooling] LBS Blockchain - Envoy Proposal Alerter - Governance - Aave  Feedback Any feedback or suggestions on the tool would be greatly welcome.
