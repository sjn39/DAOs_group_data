                    "content": " Overview Following up on the update from @nadia at the G&R-call on May 6th I had the pleasure to join a call with the Yearn-team to find out what they are missing in our portfolio so far. One of their needs is a YFI-based vault-type similar to ETH-C with a higher Liquidation Ratio to get a lower Stability Fee. Yearn is currently using YFI-A to run their treasury and would like to mint a lot of more DAI but are blocked by the line of YFI-A. This poll is to find out if the community supports the idea of creating a new vault-type for YFI  with a higher Liquidation Ratio (200%, 225%, depending on a decision by @Risk-Core-Unit) a lower Stability Fee (again, decided by @Risk-Core-Unit) a much higher gap than YFI-A (at least 300MM, also based on an assessment by @Risk-Core-Unit)   Pros  more DAI in circulation further building up the cooperation between both protocols   Cons  as the treasury would move away from YFI-A we would lose some fees (that might get compensated by a higher DAI volume)   Should we add a new YFI-based vault type with a higher LR and a lower SF?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This Poll will run until 2021-06-02T22:00:00Z and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary. If the domain teams feel this should run shorter so it can be implemented earlier, I will update here accordingly. ",

                    "content": "Several people have already asked me my thoughts on this, so let me weigh in both immediately and unambiguously: This is the way forward for Maker in its current form. The liquidations yesterday were overwhelmingly smaller vaults that lacked the ability, attention, or resources to recapitalize in a congested, sharply deteriorating market. Not only does the overwhelming majority of our revenue come from a few dozen users with several dozen vaults, but those users have heretofore acted in more risk-averse ways, while also actively managing their own risk. Not only is this one of our largest users, but they are asking for an even more risk-averse way to increase their credit line with us. They also demonstrated strength yesterday, buying back their tokens, just as we did. This is the kind of long-term relationship that is the bedrock of Maker\u2019s current profitability, and we should encourage more of these lower-risk, lower-rate vault types. As their business grows, so will ours. Not only is that in the long run higher profit potential for Maker, but it also speeds up the increase of DAI out in the wild \u2013 which we desperately need to grow faster. Contrast this with focusing on a wider array of collateral \u2013 many collateral types do not even come close to covering their own oracle fees. While I do not think we should stop experimenting with new crypto collateral types, the easiest avenue of growth of DAI supply and Maker\u2019s profits are to court more mature, large customers such as Yearn. ETH-C, despite being the newest vault class, has quickly become the third largest in terms of debt issued, and has issued almost 2.5x the debt of the next largest class (LINK-A). There is demand for this type of product, and if we do not meet it with DAI, someone else will meet it with something else. I fully support this proposal, pending an evaluation by Risk. And I would like to see as many deals like this as we can get. ",

It\u2019s good to think about worst case scenarios, but in this case, the apocalytic estimates look pretty similar in percentage terms. That said, I suspect the exact DC is probably negotiable, but I don\u2019t know. From a portfolio perspective, we also need more deals of this size so we are not so heavily exposed to individual counterparties. Many of these deals are individually risky \u2013 the Nexo ETH-A vault alone has ~36% estimated slippage \u2013 and having more of them makes the protocol as whole safer. Also, while it is true YFI-ETH correlation is pretty high at the moment, most things are. And in the past appears to be only about half as correlated as it is today. Will it be tightly correlated in the future? Who knows. But we desperately need some diversification in our underlying revenue sources. Maker is even more reliant upon ETH-A alone for its revenue than it was last year as a percentage. ETH-A accounts for ~48% of all past stability fee revenue. Forward projections assuming current rates and debt levels put it at ~77% of all stability fee revenue for 12 months. We need to remember we hold a basket of these, and while I am sure we can find comfortable terms for this one on its own merits, remember that we need diversification of not just our collateral portfolio, but of our user portfolio. Yearn does not appear to my quick look to be anywhere close to one of our largest customers, and adding them does increase our exposure to YFI and Yearn, but also dilutes our exposure to Nexo and other large customers. Add in that they seem to be conservatively managed and bought back just like we did while the market was in a tail spin, and that seems like it should make them more creditworthy than anonymous users in the standard YFI vault class.

In the case of the worst possible scenario ETH will be a much stronger and reliable asset to back dai. Diversification of users is preferable, but we must consider all factors when deciding such actions. Just the fact that it happens that Nexo is a large user, does not imply we should increase our debt limits to levels where we are not comfortable with. Increasing YFI exposure via SLP-YFI-ETH would be a safer approach. ",

Yearn is absolutely a blue chip, and I expect they\u2019ll see increasing success as time goes on. But Yearn multisig has the ability to dilute MakerDAO at any time. Eg. if they were hacked and needed capital to avoid collapsing, the rational course of action would be to mint more tokens even if it caused Maker to lose money - nothing against the yearn team but incentives seem pretty clear. You see this in tradfi all the time - when a business gets in trouble they withdraw as much value from their credit lines as possible to get breathing room. In this sense, lending against YFI with Yearn as the counterparty is very similar to unsecured lending - if they don\u2019t have the ability/willingness to pay us back, holding YFI tokens as collateral won\u2019t do us much good. A special B2B vault for Yearn could be fruitful. We could offer them better pricing taking account their high collateralization and experience with position management. But given the minting risk, I think the gap value should not be any higher than we have for the existing YFI-A vault. And 300M of debt against YFI simply won\u2019t work with current market cap and liquidity levels. ",

I don\u2019t think anyone is advocating that they get to pick the terms for us. Just that we should pursue a deal and see if there\u2019s one that\u2019s good for both parties ",
