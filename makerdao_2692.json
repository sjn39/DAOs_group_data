                    "content": "The peg is so horribly broken that it\u2019s very hard to argue the community hasn\u2019t already abandoned the peg, the product, the users, and at this point is just burying its head in the sand. As a user, if you looked at the urgency governance is trying to address this issue - which goes the very heart of the project: Maintaining a stablecoin - Would you feel a sense of confidence that this is the project you can trust with your money? The focus appears to be on raising rates right now??? and discussing features that would take months or years to build. There\u2019s only one solution at this point that can actually fix the peg in the short run, and provide a somewhat acceptable peg and thus product and user experience: lowering stablecoin LR and increasing stablecoin DC. The community has already recognized this as the only viable solution quite a while ago, and is moving towards doing both of these things. But in typical Maker fashion it is happening at a snails pace, with plenty of process, red tape, mips, waiting around, waiting for this or that day, doing more process, waiting even more, taking tiny steps that aren\u2019t commensurate with the magnitude of the problem etc etc. Normally this is a good thing, because in normal situations Maker Governance is supposed to be slow and meticulous. But we are not in normal times, and the instinct to be slow and \u201crisk averse\u201d means we are sleepwalking into the irrelevance and death of this project. There\u2019s absolutely no justification for being so insanely slow when we are destroying out reputation, damaging our users, and just dropping the ball utterly and completely on our core mandate. It\u2019s time to stop with the slow half measures that do nothing. It\u2019s time to stop pretending that bureacracy, process, waiting around and doing barely anything in the name of \u201cbeing careful\u201d is prudent when we are in the middle of a crisis that has now lasted 6 months, and is only getting worse. We are on the edge of failure and we need to prove to our users that Maker governance isn\u2019t yet a dead player. I propose we take very strong action with risk parameters to immediately bring the dai peg to 1.01, which still won\u2019t be a real long term fix, but will at least provide some short term pain relief, and add some certainty and hope that there is a way forward for this project, while we work on the long term fix which is collateral onboarding with better prioritization that what has been onboarded so far. I propose we create an emergency executive vote for monday with the following parameters: USDC-A LR: 101% USDC-A DC: 250 million PAX LR: 101% PAX DC: 150 million TUSD LR: 101% TUSD DC: 100 million These parameters would hopefully overshoot their DC capacity, meaning that it would create so much pressure on the Dai price above 1.01 that it would create a ceiling of 1.01 that the price couldn\u2019t exceed, until all of the free DC was used up. There are already other polls on the forum that are moving in this direction, just slower. But these polls were from a week ago when the peg didn\u2019t look at horribly broken, and I think people would vote differently if they could see how bad it would get just a short while later, and how it is clearly just gonna continue getting worse and worse if we do nothing. I\u2019m sure at this point some of you have a strong urge to debate and vote and discuss and wait around and make proposals about what the specific risk parameters of this or that should be etc etc etc. But now is way too late for that. If waiting around and having tons of process in the middle of a crisis was so great, why did we reach this point in the first place? Once we take action to relieve pressure immediately, once we get some semblance of control back, then we can go back to having slow process with lots of discussion over details. If the DCs I proposed are way too high, we can easily lower them. But micro management should be done when we are in control, not when we are drowning in our own inertia. I\u2019m giving you a life raft. Will you take it?     yes - cap dai price at 1.01 no - don\u2019t cap dai price abstain     0 voters     ",

You\u2019re betting on either dai demand falling, or collateral onboarding picking up. Both of those things are very uncertain and we\u2019d be counting on people participating out of altruism. I think dai users deserve and demand having a user experience supported by hard guarantees, rather than altruists volunteering to take on risk and potential losses. There\u2019s also a negative feedback loop where broken peg inhibits supply growth. The best example of this is the yETH fiasco where the broken peg prevented a potential fix from working safely. If we put these measures proposed here in place, I believe yETH could immediately be turned back on safely. ",

I voted \u201cYes\u201d because this is really an unexceptable situation and any solution is better than doing nothing (i.e. talk about RWA, change the rates a few percentages, raise the DCs\u2026).

This is going to happen regardless of liquidations imo. Not saying that we shouldn\u2019t pursue something like this because of that. The demand for DAI is essentially limitless now given the number of AMM\u2019s including it. This is especially true of curve. Anytime the amount of USDC or USDT increases in curve (or anything like curve), it pushes the DAI price up if there is not enough DAI minted to cover it. In order to mint USDC and USDT, all that needs to happen is dollars entering a bank (and possibly not even that when we\u2019re talking about tether.) In practice the best case outcome here is that DAI becomes largely a wrapper for stablecoins until such a time as the DAI can be supplied from real world assets. This could be years. Unfortunately, this is still the best way to maintain the peg without breaking the \u20181 Dai is backed by $1 of collateral\u2019 promise or implementing negative rates. ",

However when market conditions change, we need to have the flexibility to mint 100s of millions of DAI via stable coins. I am against lowering the LRs. Once lowered, they cannot be easily raised and this \u201cstop gap solution\u201d becomes a new normal. If we want overflow emergency vaults with different parameters like this, then I think we should go the USDC-B route and create new vaults.

As already mentioned in different threads, such low LR will allow very small # of whales to max out the vaults caps (see 201x leverage possibility at just 1.005). Having a low number of whales is adverse due to the big price impact when one of them decides to convert back to USDC whereas having more diverse set of whales will allow for smoother moves. ",
