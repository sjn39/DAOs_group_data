Welcome to the 20th Meet Your Delegate call hosted by GovAlpha. Today, we are joined by the delegation from RiskDAO. We will give a quick run-through of their platform, what they stand for and why they wanted to join as a MakerDAO Delegate.   Delegate Introductions  RiskDAO|nonstopTheo 00:37 Visit: RiskDAO Delegate Platform  Contents:   Delegate Statement \u2013 1:03   Previous contribution to the MakerDAO ecosystem \u2013 2:26   Other contributions to the DeFi ecosystem include \u2013 5:21   About nonstopTheo \u2013 6:44      nonstopTheo: I am a freelance contributor to DeFi protocols. I recently started to talk more with some of the RiskDAO members, and the connection came together, and we decided that we want to collaborate specifically on governance efforts. I spend most of my time around research and analysis, so that can be quantitative stuff like on Dune or Flipside, or it can be purely qualitative, as in just reading research and going through specific protocols. My background is in corporate finance and corporate development. I worked in Investment Banking, and then I worked for a large corporate, but that was many years ago, and I have been full-time crypto for the last couple of years. I also have experience with financing in RWA and some governance-related topics.   Questions 11:24   Payton Rose: Do you see any opportunities for Maker that you would like to pursue?  nonstopTheo: We want to see Maker grow. We want to see DAI\u2019s market share grow. I just went through some dashboards before the call, and you look at the trend, and it is not something to celebrate too much about. Regarding what collateral you can use, the market is getting tougher. You do not want to expand the collateral into long-tail stuff in a market that favors short-tail tokens.    13:44   Patrick: What are the decision-making steps you will take?  Yaron: If the question is about the decision mechanisms. Right now, on the technical level, the delegation contract is owned by a multisig. Not by any individual. It is a two-out-of-three multisig. Broadly, we will try to base everything on data, but the vision you share is a lot about pragmatism. Eventually, we plan to be active not only on risk decisions but to be a full delegator.    15:59   Tim Black: What are the growing pains for the DAO?  nonstopTheo: One of the things of growing pains is the process you have to go through. The thing about the MetaDAOs is how you attract a community of contributors who are aligned in their vision and work ethic and how they can work together even if they are spread across the globe. Yaron: The RiskDAO has the privilege of building everything bottom-up, growing slowly, and adding a few people at the time because we are a small organization.    18:22   Payton Rose: One of the excitements around the Endgame is the chance to rebuild more intentionally with the knowledge of what we have learned. That vote should start on Monday, which will also be your first official day as a Recognized Delegate. It seems an interesting time to join.  18:58   Raphael Spannocchi: The stability fees are now very low. Is that sufficient to attract capital, or are other parameters more important?  Yaron: Traditionally, much of the capital in MakerDAO was sensitive to stability fees which is the interest rate. Right now, the market will be less sensitive, but on the other hand, MakerDAO depends a lot on USDC or the so-called derivatives.    22:16   Raphael Spannocchi: Can you think of any other steps Maker could take to attract more decentralized collateral and offset this RWA happiness that we currently have with USDC?  Yaron: Not Rune\u2019s Endgame, but one endgame for all off DeFi lending markets, not only MakerDAO, is trying to compete somehow with C5 and give real leverage.    25:07   Payton Rose: Are there any changes and innovations you would like to see in our user experience?  Yaron: Integrating with a smart contract is challenging. MakerDAO was our first integration, but only because we had some prior knowledge of MakerDAO. It is a very steep learning curve. It is very hard to enter, but a very elegant and well-designed code once you are in it. It is a strong effort to learn it, but once you do, you will learn to enjoy it.    26:53   Payton Rose: Do you see yourselves putting forth many efforts?  Yaron: We do not have plans for a platform to promote the protocol within MakerDAO.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 28:36  It was a pleasure hosting this call\u2014one last call out to the delegate platform. If you have further questions if you watch this recording, and if you think of anything else, feel free to drop them there, and we look forward to engaging with you guys.
