                    "content": "Hi Folx, UNI is a supported collateral asset in MakerDAO. The UNI-A vault has a debt ceiling parameter which limits the amount of DAI that can be borrowed. A connected system called the \u201cdebt ceiling instant access module\u201d allows any user to adjust the debt ceiling for UNI-A within limits set by Maker governance. The instant access module has 3 parameters:   line is the maximum permitted debt ceiling.  gap is the target available debt over the amount currently being borrowed.  ttl is the minimum amount of time required before the instant access module can be triggered again.  For UNI-A, they are currently set to:   line (max debt ceiling) = 50 million DAI  gap (target available debt) = 3 million DAI  ttl (cooldown period) = 12 hours  Every twelve hours, a user can call the exec function on the IAM contract to increase (or reduce) the current debt ceiling for UNI-A so that it is 3 million DAI over the currently borrowed amount, up to a maximum of 50 million DAI. Below are the steps for doing this. 1. Check cooldown period has finished The instant access module will only work if the 12 hour cooldown period has elapsed. To check if the cooldown is still pending, go to the events tab of the instant access module contract on Etherscan: DssAutoLine | 0xc7bdd1f2b16447dcf3de045c4a039a60ec2f0ba3 Search for the UNI-A hex code using the page search function (ctrl+f):  0x554e492d41000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000  image2046\u00d7634 101 KB If the most recent event with the UNI-A hex is over 12 hours in the past, the cooldown in finished and you can proceed to the next step. 2. Execute function Visit the instant access module contract page on Etherscan here: DssAutoLine | 0xc7bdd1f2b16447dcf3de045c4a039a60ec2f0ba3 Click \u201cconnect to web3\u201d. Confirm the connect via the metamask pop up. Select the function \u201c2. exec\u201d, and under \u201c_ilk (bytes32)\u201d enter the hex code for the UNI-A vault type:  0x554e492d41000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000  Click \u201cwrite\u201d and then confirm and sign the transaction via metamask. image2058\u00d7524 32.5 KB 3. Confirm debt ceiling change Check daistats.com for information on the UNI-A vault. After executing the function successfully, you should see the debt ceiling be 3 million DAI higher than the currently borrowed amount. image766\u00d7242 17.6 KB Credit to Aaron from the Maker community for making the original instructions I\u2019m cross posting!
