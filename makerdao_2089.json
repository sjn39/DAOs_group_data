                    "content": "PECU is including the following two housekeeping tasks for the next executive (week of 23rd of January 2023):  Sunsetting the old Flashmint Module As outlined in this forum post last year, PECU reduced the upper limit of the MCD_FLASH_LEGACY contract and introduced an updated contract, MCD_FLASH. Since then, MakerDAO has been operating with both contracts each utilizing a 250M upper limit. With reduced usage and significant time in the market, PECU would now like to fully sunset the legacy contract and increase the newer contract to the original amount of 500M DAI. This will have the effect of the old legacy contract no longer functioning. Any keepers that reference this contract should switch over to the new contract. The FLASH_KILLER will also be removed from the chainlog as this was specific to the legacy contract. For reference, as per the chainlog: MCD_FLASH_LEGACY: 0x1EB4CF3A948E7D72A198fe073cCb8C7a948cD853 MCD_FLASH: 0x60744434d6339a6B27d73d9Eda62b6F66a0a04FA FLASH_KILLER: 0x07a4BaAEFA236A649880009B5a2B862097D9a1cD  Caging the old Aave D3M In preparation for the new Aave D3M which will be launched in the coming weeks, PECU will be caging the old aD3M [DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI] contract as it is no longer used.
