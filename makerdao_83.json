                    "content": "The Maker Foundation recently notified the community it will be dissolving Rocket.chat, which is one of MakerDAO\u2019s primary communications channels. Mandated actors have discussed alternative options along with Tech-Ops and would like to get feedback from the community before proceeding. Please consider this a starting point for a discussion on how we as a community want to manage this transition.  The Options The options being considered include:  Discord Keybase Matrix Rocket.Chat Slack Workstorm   General Sentiment Other mandated actors can speak for themselves but the general sentiment seems to be in favor of Discord since many in the crypto/blockchain community already have Discord accounts, Discord is a common choice among crypto projects, and the platform is highly customizable. There is some concern that moving to Discord could compromise the culture that\u2019s been cultivated in Rocket.chat, increase difficulties around moderation, and increase the amount of spam/scams/nonsense community members have to deal with day-to-day. Platforms like Rocket.chat have a higher barrier to entry since new users must sign up for an account and most people don\u2019t already have accounts but this helps decrease the amount of spam/scams/trolls/etc\u2026 A higher barrier to entry may not be a big deal for regulars in the community but it could pose an obstacle to more casual or occasional users simply looking for help or information and/or to community growth in general.  Mitigating Spam/Scams/etc. Spam, trolls, scams, etc. can be problematic regardless of what communication channel we decide to go with but different platforms come with different pros and cons. To help mitigate these issues, we can:  Have a \u201cTrollbox\u201d or \u201cRandom\u201d channel for off-topic discussions. Link specific channels with channels in Discord servers run by Core Units. Require users to pass a CAPTCHA before posting. Allow Facilitators to moderate conversations Hire professional moderators Maintain a public list of handles of moderators and mandated actors.  If you have other ideas, please mention them in the comments. ",

Will there be one official centralized server? Something in between? How will the permission structure be set up? Dedicated or cloud service?   Discord doesn\u2019t offer self-hosted servers, so we rely on Discord to run the infrastructure. This is a centralized solution, and unfortunately splitting it up into individual core unit servers doesn\u2019t really help with that, it just makes it harder to communicate and interact between core units. I feel like it\u2019s probably better to go with an official server. Core Units will be free to operate their own servers, and / or to setup their own private or public group channels within the official server. I think if we use Discord as a primary solution, we should look at one of the more decentralized options as a backup solution. Matrix looks very cool, and could be setup such that it bridges messages from Discord.     Tosh9.0:  Perhaps a technical operations CU, should it ever come about, is the appropriate party to run an \u201cofficial\u201d server at first before we are able to move to a more decentralized model.   The tech-ops folks we know and love (previously of the Foundation, and looking to form a core unit in the future) have agreed to handle the actual setup. We\u2019ll also try to figure out a way to give actual ownership to the Dai Foundation in line with their mandate.     Tosh9.0:  Permission structure meaning choosing admins? I say leave it to governance \u2013 Signal, Gov Poll and Executive. We have time before the Oct. 31 deadline to get this right.   I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really valid to have on-chain governance votes on admins and such. The communications platforms are more of a DAO / community issue than an Maker Protocol issue. It also feels a bit silly, does the average MKR Holder care who is administrating the communication platforms? Not sure. We\u2019ll need to put together a set of information for the tech-ops folks so they can actually set this up. Namely:  Channels structure (names, private/public). Users who need to be invited. Roles structure and permissions (high level, we will do the rests). List of moderators who are willing to help maintaining channel(s), or set of channels. Server name, logo, rules, welcome message for the users and other practical things.  I think the current plan is for @seth and I to work on putting this together over the next few weeks. I don\u2019t see any reason we couldn\u2019t publish it in the forum for comments and adjust to feedback. We could include one or more discourse forum polls to confirm the community is happy with the setup. ",

To piggyback on @LongForWisdom\u2019s response, who runs the server is less important than who can maintain backups. On Discord, at least, admins can create backups so even if Tech-Ops is managing the implementation, we should be sufficiently decentralized so long as there are a few different admins who are maintaining backups.
