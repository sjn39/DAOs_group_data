Delegates are not servants of the DAO nor or are they beholden to the DAO in any way. They are representatives of their delegators and nothing more. Delegates have no inherent right or reason to proactively manage the activities of the DAO beyond voting on proposals as they come up. The whole point of a DAO is to have different sets of people creating proposals and voting on proposals. When you have the same people creating and voting on proposals, then there is no need to have a DAO. You then just have the same kind of organization that we\u2019ve been trying to escape. This is how it is today. If you don\u2019t like it, then you need to change the way that the DAO works and how its incentives are structured. ",

If you are an MKR token owner you have the right to Govern. You could choose not to, that\u2019s your prerogative. To me, MKR token is a governance token, and I choose to govern wether i\u2019m a delegate, or not. It\u2019s been that way since my inception to the DAO. And since 3F Delegate, delegates to its token contract, then ser I will use my right to govern and vote as I see best for the benefit of MakerDAO. What can I tell you. You and I are built differently. ",

Recognized Delegates get compensated based on how much MKR is delegated to them. There is no incentive whatsoever to be \u201cbeholden to the DAO\u201d (whatever that actually means) if your delegators do not value that particular principle. I\u2019m not here to support the momentum of the current system because I feel that it\u2019s overly centralized and opaque. I\u2019d like to see it change. So I\u2019m certainly not beholden to it. Shadow Delegates and Recognized Delegates have the exact same role as far as governance goes. RD\u2019s are just incentivized to do it consistently and clearly and SD\u2019s are not. ",
