                    "content": " The Commons: shoring up OP\u2019s liquidity, governance, and funding capacity Hi, I\u2019m Jack from Velodrome, a leading Optimism dex that recently received a 3mm OP grant from OP Labs, a close collaborator in the build of our protocol. We\u2019ve mostly been heads down building and showing up in partner discords, and we\u2019re looking forward to participating more in OP governance. Consider this our first effort in earnest to engage, following some observations we\u2019ve made.  OP grants to date are meeting some common needs\u2026 Congratulations to protocol teams who have successfully received grants from the Optimism Collective. As part of Velodrome\u2019s research on how best to apply, we read and catalogued every governance proposal to see which approaches seemed reasonable and what the community had to say about each. A few key themes jumped out:  Through Phase 0 and round 1 of Phase 1, a total of ~40.3mm OP approved for distribution Of this, 40.0mm OP \u2014 ~99% of the total \u2014 earmarked for payment (to be likely sold) The only OP designated for some use is for protocol-owned liquidity  We observed successful grants primarily seeking, loosely speaking, three forms of aid: liquidity (35%), user acquisition (28%), and ecosystem engagement (21%). All of these (necessary and valuable!) forms of help essentially amount to a guarantee of a protocol paying someone OP, which would then in all likelihood be sold for ETH or some stablecoin.  \u2026and are a lot for OP to digest Across the three largest dexes featuring LP, there are roughly 10mm OP in liquidity pools. If we assume the ~40mm distributed OP to be sold evenly over the next six months, we\u2019re looking at 6.7mm OP sell pressure \u2013 two thirds of all the OP in liquidity pools \u2013 every month. Simply offering OP to be market dumped for these purposes in this way is an attempt to outrun the token\u2019s degradation, hoping that eventually enough economic value will be generated by the community before the glamour surrounding the OP token\u2019s potential fades to oblivion. People have hypothesized that it could come from blockspace demand. It could be MEV, transaction ordering, or even community-level partnerships. But there is currently limited tangible value accruing to the Collective, and as far as we can tell there haven\u2019t been significant moves on this issue \u2013 and the need to address it is likely imminent. So we\u2019re offering a broader proposal, one we believe could make a huge difference for the ecosystem. It would help the OP token meet its intended purpose \u2014 sustainably fund public goods that may otherwise go unsupported \u2014 while lending a crucial layer of relevance to the Optimism Collective as a governing community. We call it The Commons.  The Commons: securing public infrastructure OP does in fact have a valuable function in permissionless settings: you can pair it with other tokens on AMMs and use it as a central liquidity node, the same way WETH works on Mainnet or, say, OSMO on Osmosis. This has the effect of providing liquidity to less central tokens, all while increasing the base token\u2019s price stability. So rather than simply doling out OP to protocols, under this plan Optimism\u2019s governance would reserve some portion of tokens currently earmarked for distribution each round to be used for liquidity pairing. To gain liquidity for their native or utility tokens, applicant protocols would now offer the Optimism Collective some of these tokens for pairing. As an example, we\u2019ll look backward at the roughly 15mm OP being distributed to help with some form of liquidity. Let\u2019s say OP had instead set aside 10mm of that OP for pairing with native tokens. Roughly speaking, the following would occur:  25% of all previously distributed tokens would instead be earmarked for pairing Selling pressure is reduced by nearly 25%, or 1.7mm OP per month, to 5mm OP per month Adding 10mm of OP into liquidity would double the amount of OP currently in LPs to 20mm OP in LPs. So we\u2019ll have gone from dumping 67% of aggregate OP in LPs to 25% every month.  In addition, assuming a 35% benchmark APR we at Velo are using, the current $10mm (assuming OP at 50c) gained from liquidity provision would return roughly $1.75mm over 6 months, not including compounding [note: may vary substantially due to the many potential ways of deploying LP across different platforms].  Good for protocols The selling point for protocols is simply this: they\u2019re already asking for more liquidity from Optimism than what\u2019s provided by this example and, even outside of OP grants, are incentivizing protocols such as Curve (and, yes, Velodrome). This is all to say that there clearly exists demand for this sort of liquidity backstop. This proposal would provide them this exact service while also giving them a responsible steward of their tokens. And, because this action lends some material value to the Collective, our hope is that it kickstarts similar initiatives accruing additional value and signals to the broader market that there is a nascent economic engine beneath us.  Becoming the Collective By obtaining a wide range of ecosystem governance tokens, the Optimism community will gain broader governance power, creating a new layer of metagovernance available to Collective members to help shape the ecosystem for public benefit. The Collective\u2019s status as stakeholder of participating protocols would then be formalized and made actionable. Delegates can now vote not just on Optimism-specific proposals but also on individual protocols\u2019 proposals. Collective members now have a direct channel to partner with Optimism protocols, and some could even act as specialized representatives on behalf of Optimism. There is a lot of design space here. This exact scenario has already played out for Velodrome. Some of you might know that when we first designed our token distribution, Velodrome took the initiative to grant Optimism 5% of our initial token share. This has proven to be one of our best decisions yet; Optimism has already gotten back its initial $150,000 grant to us in token value alone, and in the meantime it has collected substantial fees and compounded its power to incentivize liquidity in ways that have been beneficial for the ecosystem. And most importantly, that ownership has facilitated a close partnership between us and OP Labs; we actively work with them to help them use our protocol to best serve their interests. Community member dcao has illustrated this mode of value creation through recomposition succinctly:  image1118\u00d71000 123 KB  This is unironically true.  The Bet The Working Constitution calls for the Optimism Collective to \u201cundertake a series of governance experiments\u201d to, among other things, \u201csustainably fund those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond\u201d and \u201cminimize the discrepancy between collective impact and individual profit.\u201d We\u2019re asking the Collective to take the experimental bet that acquiring a stake in partner protocols in exchange for crucial, clearly desired support does indeed serve this vision\u2014that properly seating the Optimism Collective\u2019s capacity in the combined value of participants\u2019 efforts and successes will lead to new directions in shared responsibility and prosperity. And we\u2019re asking protocols on Optimism to do more than express support for the public good as a concept and take another bet, that they will in fact be better off by formalizing a commitment to the public good and inviting the greater Optimism community to the table. It wouldn\u2019t be for nothing \u2014 they would gain a responsible holder of their tokens, in addition to all of the other benefits they stand to gain from partnering more closely with the Optimism Collective.  We\u2019re Optimistic There\u2019s a reason why, when we were invited by Optimism to migrate from the Fantom ecosystem and build a liquidity hub, we shifted our entire trajectory as veDAO toward this new space. We saw in Optimism a unique ecosystem where it seemed that people were putting money where their mouth was when it came to experimentation in governance modes. And now that we\u2019re here, we want to help Optimism take real steps in proving that its philosophy of mobilizing new governance structures to build and maintain public goods can and does work. One step in this direction, we think, is the communal ownership of liquidity, which we believe can be a public good. It helps that owning liquidity also happens to be a value-accretive activity, which in turn will help us fund more public goods in a sustainable way. This, of course, all comes back to the question of why we have OP the token in the first place. Its sole purpose ought to be to fund public goods for the betterment of the community\u2014so let\u2019s make sure that this token can continue to do so by supporting its value through meaningful economic action.  Open questions We invite discussion on this issue, as there are some details and specific cases we have a view on but could use more perspectives. For instance:  How would this be incentivized or required? Would there be some \u2018bonus\u2019 OP pool set aside? How much OP currently requested for liquidity as a proportion of the total OP distributed should be targeted? How do we factor protocols\u2019 market cap (or having any token on OP) into these considerations? Would OP compound LP positions or accrue vote power (in the case of, e.g., positions on Velodrome and Curve)? Can we call this layer-owned liquidity (LOL)? What would be the actual mechanics of managing the LPs? Who administers them?   Proposed timeline We suggest that new grants be frozen until we consider this proposal. It is critically important that the Collective appreciate the likely inability of the current liquidity infrastructure to handle projected sell pressure. We look forward to hearing thoughts on this.

                    "content": "Couple of points:  36M that was distributed in Phase 0 was for liquidity and user on-boarding so I dont see a problem if those token are sold out or dumped. That was their sole purpose, on board liquidity according to their proposal  Yes, this assumption is wrong.  If we assume the ~40mm distributed OP to be sold evenly over the next six months, we\u2019re looking at 6.7mm OP sell pressure \u2013 two thirds of all the OP in liquidity pools \u2013 every month.  Not all of the token will be sold, token distribution plan from their proposal is from 6-24 months and few of them are not using their token as an LP reward, so token distribution will be gradual. This is nice idea but will not work  Delegates can now vote not just on Optimism-specific proposals but also on individual protocols\u2019 proposals  It will cause bias, if I have a say in project X and they submit a proposal here on GF fund, only option for me to abstain from discussion. This will work out just fine on organizational and/or project level, just as you mentioned below  Velodrome took the initiative to grant Optimism 5% of our initial token share. This has proven to be one of our best decisions yet  And going back to last point, I dont expect anyone from OP foundation to comment on your proposal because I will see bias. We are mixing two things here, price of OP and Public Good.  why we have OP the token in the first place  For public good we have dedicated 20% fund and its distribution is based on different logic which I am really excited about.  We suggest that new grants be frozen until we consider this proposal  Again, in my opinion, this we should not do. Pausing will only hurt our progress we have made so far. Few point because this proposal is mixing couple of things.   In Phase 1, we are not just focusing on LP, we are also looking into user on boarding via different approach, application migration and integration, marketing and even development support if idea is unique. Now we are asking projects to submit KPI based proposal if its based on LP incentives and we are working on making sure that its sustainable, long term. Again, opinion varies according to delegate but from what I see, we are looking beyond just LP.   This seems to be focused on price of token with a mask of public good. We should keep them separate.   Personally, I dont see a proposal if token are being dumped as long the reason is justified in their proposal. Again, depends on proposal. At the end of day, 1 OP will always has 1 voting power as it should be, after all its a Gov token.   If you feel project proposal need improvement, join us and help us improve it.   Pausing will not help but asking question and providing feedback to project proposal will.   I see, you have marked it as Ready, unfortunately, I am not in favor of this proposal.    I want to mention few things. We have an excellent gov model(token house and citizen house) which motivated me to join this gov and I think, it need feedback and suggestion. We are in dire need of community engagement, if i look at the stats on this forum, user involvement are going down each passing day. What can we do for that ?Last voting cycle, we had 17M vote count on proposal. I think liquidity will see some boost once fraud proof and bedrock is implemented, current market sentiment is also having some impact on that. Again, I might be in minority here, liquidity is not \u201ccritical\u201d problem here but lack on user involvement is. Resolving bias is another concern but that need a separate thread. We have few thoughts and thread going on to improve overall gov process. Please join us there.     Economic sustainability ideas for $OP \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       Starting from first principles, this is my opinion for how $OP can be economically sustainable. My general philosophy is elegance, simplicity and minimal friction. No lockups, staking rewards and similar mechanisms - $OP will always be a frictionless, liquid token.   Revenues Assuming a MEVA/PBS-like setup, builders (sequencers) bid in ETH. Note: depending on the implementation, users may pay fees in other tokens (e.g. OP, DAI) to dapps/builders, but this is abstracted away from Optimism Collect\u2026         Solving voter apathy \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       In the last round, only ~12% of circulating supply voted for proposals. We now have a single delegate that can pretty much override the entirety of active governance (effectively, a 51% attack on Optimism Collective). We are seeing many token holders not delegate at all, or delegate to inactive delegates.  We have seen this be an issue with proof-of-stake chains. They solve this by basically bribing token holders to delegate their stake. A better way would be sharing sequencer revenues with dele\u2026         Incentivizing effort from governance participants with retroactive rewards for good decisions Rules and process       There is a general problem in DAOs of low participation in governance votes. Some DAO\u2019s offer POAPs to Snapshot voters to encourage more voters, but while this increases the number of participants it does not necessarily increase the number of useful participants. What we want is a way to get people to apply more effort into their voting decisions, thus increasing the likelihood of a better outcome.  From reading discord chats there are certainly those who\u2019s priority becomes obtaining the voting\u2026         Update of the PHASE 1 protocol nomination template \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       This is a joint collaboration of:  @OPUser (delegate),  @Netrim @NicoEsp @DeFi_LATAM_Joxes @Defi_LATAM_axlvaz  (DeFi Latam & Optimism Espa\u00f1ol [no oficial])  If I am missing the name of any contributor, please let me know.  Summary  Noting the number of proposals and consultations made by the delegates to the proponents. We request, along with other delegates and government members, this modification to the application template. So that projects/protocols/proponents can more robustly and strongly\u2026         What is Public Good to You \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       If you are active here and/or on discord, you might have seen some discussion on Public Good. I have been thinking about it and in last few days, after reading, learning and discussion within my circle, my definition of Public Good has changed a lot.  I have came to realization that its scope is much bigger than I initially thought and when we add RPGF to it, its gets more complex.  What is public good.  By definition public good can be anything that has two properties, non-rivel in consumption \u2026     ",

Wanted to make a comment not about the discussion here, but about your manner of discussion. I\u2019ve noted in several posts that you are quite dismissive of ideas you do not personally agree with, without providing clear rational or full engagement with contrary arguments. You are not worried about token price, and do not think token price is connected to governance activity. Does that make these opinions true? Why is liquidity not a crucial problem? How are you defining liquidity? Why will Delegates voting on individual protocol\u2019s proposals cause bias? Why should you abstain from a governance discussion or vote when a protocol submits to OP if you also participated in a governance discussion or vote on that individual protocol? Being a delegate somewhere should not curtail ANYONE from participating in governance elsewhere. This is core to the entire ethos of decentralization and autonomy. You claim that \u201cthis assumption is wrong\u201d re: the distributed grant OP being sold evenly over the next six months. First of all, be acknowledge that this is a hypothetical, but offer no clear numbers on how many protocols are using OP as Lp rewards. What makes YOUR assumption that \u201ctoken distribution will be gradual\u201d accurate? Can you please provide evidence for this assumption? This proposal emerged out of a comprehensive review of every single grant proposal submitted to OP, and was also discussed prior to publication with members of the OP team itself.     OPUser:  And going back to last point, I dont expect anyone from OP foundation to comment on your proposal because I will see bias. We are mixing two things here, price of OP and Public Good.   That is right, because they are mixed. Tokens have both economic value and governance value, and the very \u201cpublic good funding\u201d that the OP token is being used for DEPENDS on token value. No public good\u2019s funding without the token having economic value.     OPUser:  we are also looking into user on boarding   This entire proposal is core to user onboarding. Maintaining economic value of $OP is fundamental to attracting new users to Optimism.     OPUser:  I think liquidity will see some boost once fraud proof and bedrock is implemented, current market sentiment is also having some impact on that.   Can you explain why you believe this? and why you are not concerned that a massive distribution of the OP token will result in a token price that could certainly result in negative tailwinds for Public Goods funding, governance, user activity, and more?

                    "content": "We were excited to hear OPUser\u2019s thoughts due to their thoughtful feedback on our current draft proposal. We intend to clear up the entirety of their concerns voiced here, most of which we believe merely require some clarification.  36M that was distributed in Phase 0 was for liquidity and user on-boarding so I dont see a problem if those token are sold out or dumped. That was their sole purpose, on board liquidity according to their proposal Yes, this assumption is wrong.  We made no value claims about where the tokens were going, just observing that for 99% of all tokens being distributed, the ultimate recipient is likely someone who is unmotivated to hold OP vs market selling it. Of course there\u2019s nothing wrong with paying people to LP, use, or build on your product! Velodrome ourselves are using our grant for the same purposes \u2013 because these are things that protocols need. This is why we believe protocols have good reason to opt into our proposal, which addresses liquidity, by far the most requested need, and prolongs the efficacy of these programs. That Governance is fine with using OP for these purposes doesn\u2019t make it less unsustainable, which is our claim.  Not all of the token will be sold, token distribution plan from their proposal is from 6-24 months and few of them are not using their token as an LP reward, so token distribution will be gradual.  Going through the individual approved applications, we saw the distribution being heavily stacked toward the 6-12 month horizon. We certainly can provide supporting data if this is enough of a sticking point. But even if tokens were distributed equally over 18 months (which is VERY generous); you\u2019d still see unmitigated sell pressure of roughly a quarter of all LP\u2019ed tokens each month. By the time the 6th month came around, the value of the grant would likely be a small fraction of what it would have been if spent at the start. Some GF proposals have already asked for an inflated amount of tokens, claiming they are anticipating this fact! One thing we didn\u2019t cover in our proposal would be that this observed sell pressure will heavily encourage front-loading of distributions by partner protocols, as they will stand to be better off using their tokens now and risk missing out on future grants than comply with expectations to get a second distribution worth a small fraction of the first.  It will cause bias, if I have a say in project X and they submit a proposal here on GF fund, only option for me to abstain from discussion. This will work out just fine on organizational and/or project level, just as you mentioned below  If you believe that the Optimism Collective\u2019s ownership of project governance tokens would bias your personal decisions, either you have graver concerns about the functionality of decentralized governance structures in general \u2013 or you (possibly correctly) believe that you, OPUser, individually have outsized influence on the collective, such that you can sway things for your personal benefit, which would naturally be problematic from a decentralization standpoint. Separately, how would this structure be more problematic than an individual personally owning a large stake in project X and thus being conflicted \u2014 which of course is almost certainly the case for many delegates and perhaps something unavoidable? To be honest, we believe this feature is the most exciting thing for committed delegates, as it reflects in our view a compelling experimentation around decentralized governance (and capitalism) \u2013 a collective stake in participating organizations.  This is nice idea but will not work  This opinion, on the other hand, in response to our data- and experience-driven proposal, has no support. Why not share your bias against this? Pretty sure we can address any material concerns you may have.  And going back to last point, I dont expect anyone from OP foundation to comment on your proposal because I will see bias.  Why would this be the case? Spell out exactly how they\u2019d be biased. Is it because you think this benefits Velodrome? Note that nowhere do we mention Velodrome as a place to LP tokens; that is up to the OP Collective. If this is why you are concerned, do you believe that their small stake in Velodrome is enough to materially sway their interests? There are many fantastic places to LP tokens, each with its benefits. Uni naturally has unique strengths, Beethoven\u2019s well known for its farming abilities, etc. And consider the opposite: it is entirely possible that they influenced us to make this proposal for the good of Optimism because, as tokenholders, they have a say in what sorts of communications we put out. And that would be a good thing. [To be clear, though, this proposal was entirely conceived by the Velodrome team.] If someone from the Foundation were to comment on this, we would expect participants here to see them as people who put the Collective first. We\u2019re genuinely confused at how you could expect otherwise.  We are mixing two things here, price of OP and Public Good.  Of course we are. We recognize the need to paint a veneer of propriety such that we don\u2019t have random tokenholders screeching \u201cbut token price\u201d, but until the OP Collective can figure out a way to accrue a material treasury, the token is how we have the ability to fund public goods. What we\u2019re doing is offering a mechanical and governance-driven means of ensuring that this method is sustainable. Seeing the token go to zero critically hamstrings the Collective\u2019s capability to fund public goods or RFPG, which limits protocols\u2019 capacity to facilitate user/liquidity/protocol onboarding, which lowers the stakes for governance participation, which leads to a death spiral. We are laying out our concerns with the weight of experience of having seen this play out in several contexts \u2013 and, we believe, our expertise, having professionally consulted for protocols (e.g., Redacted) and layers (e.g., Boba) on this very subject, to say nothing of our deep history in complex tokenomics. We are sounding the warning here because not attending to this is a grave mistake. Let\u2019s drop the pearls, people.  Again, in my opinion, this we should not do. Pausing will only hurt our progress we have made so far.  Pausing would prevent OP from multiplying the sell pressure overnight. Can you explain what sort of progress would be stalled in support of this? Why would delaying, say, two weeks have a material impact?  In Phase 1, we are not just focusing on LP, we are also looking into user on boarding via different approach, application migration and integration, marketing and even development support if idea is unique. Now we are asking projects to submit KPI based proposal if its based on LP incentives and we are working on making sure that its sustainable, long term. Again, opinion varies according to delegate but from what I see, we are looking beyond just LP.  As far as we can tell, none of these entails doing anything other than paying somebody OP so they can sell for stables. Would love to see an alternative \u2014 so much so that we\u2019ve suggested one!  This seems to be focused on price of token with a mask of public good. We should keep them separate.  Already addressed above, but we\u2019ll emphasize: this is an aesthetic objection to a material concern. The token price is not its own end; it is the sum total of Optimism\u2019s operational capacity. Moreover, this a rank misreading of our proposal, which is in fact not focused primarily on the token price.  The broader objectives you yourself have raised include participation in governance. Our proposal increases the stakes for governance. The Constitution calls for experimentation in modes of governance; we\u2019ve outlined in detail a way to dramatically expand the scope of governance. You provide links to discussions on how to accrue value to governance; we\u2019re not sure what else you can call our proposal.   Personally, I dont see a proposal if token are being dumped as long the reason is justified in their proposal. Again, depends on proposal. At the end of day, 1 OP will always has 1 voting power as it should be, after all its a Gov token.  Again, we\u2019re not making value claims about the intended purpose of these tokens. We\u2019re devising a win-win-win way to sustain these intended uses of the tokens.  For public good we have dedicated 20% fund and its distribution is based on different logic which I am really excited about.  Sure, but again we\u2019re commenting specifically on the current program\u2019s sustainability, on which we\u2019re not picking up any material pushback.  We are in dire need of community engagement, if i look at the stats on this forum, user involvement are going down each passing day. What can we do for that ?Last voting cycle, we had 17M vote count on proposal. I think liquidity will see some boost once fraud proof and bedrock is implemented, current market sentiment is also having some impact on that.  You can\u2019t get around the fact that governance participation will pick up when there are higher stakes and modalities to it. Merely accepting the status quo of meting out rapidly depreciating tokens to a few dozen protocols is simply not enough to bring in outside participation, and tech updates will of course do precious little to affect that. But because we have a vested interest in making sure Optimism thrives, we will certainly do our part.  We have few thoughts and thread going on to improve overall gov process. Please join us there.  Sure, we\u2019re happy to explain how this proposal would address all of these concerns. We\u2019d actually considered doing this already. We\u2019ll consider this your active encouragement to do so.  I see, you have marked it as Ready, unfortunately, I am not in favor of this proposal.  You might be, but we hope others reading can critically evaluate this on its merits. It would indeed be a concerning thing for governance if participation is so low that OPUser\u2019s opposition is enough to stall what we believe is the first immediately actionable way to address an imminent threat to Governance\u2019s power to satisfy one of its core mandates. Nonetheless, this is the only change you\u2019ve convinced us to make in our proposal, if only because we want to encourage more discussion (and clear up some particulars) before finalizing, and marking it as READY may have discouraged that. We are encouraging readers and delegates to think bigger; we want Optimism to grow up and meet its potential, and to do so we must be receptive to experimentation, especially when there is a sound thesis and solid support behind it.

                    "content": "For any token incentive program, the most important measure is Emissions over Revenue. Projects almost always overpay for growth at the beginning ($1 of Emissions leads to less than $1 of fees), with the goal of flipping that ratio in the future. It\u2019s worth noting that in Optimism\u2019s case, the stated goal for OP incentives is that they not only lead to more transactions (revenue) but also more liquidity and users. Importantly, none of the Phase 0 programs have started distributing OP, so we cannot really measure this Emissions/Revenue ratio for Optimism. This also means your OP sell pressure numbers are hypothetical and probably overstated. You assume every single OP token will be sold on the market which is misleading, I think it\u2019s fair to assume at least some amount will be held or staked in liquidity pools. Backing this claim up with data from another network\u2019s liquidity mining campaign (ex. Polygon or Avalanche) would be helpful. I know that in both cases, native token incentives for dapps led to growth in all of the key areas: transactions, liquidity, and users. And they did this without having the native token collapse from sell pressure. My biggest problem with the proposal is that it would see the Optimism Treasury take on significant impermanent loss risk. Token pairs with high divergence are more likely to suffer from impermanent loss, and it\u2019s fair to assume OP will continue to be more volatile than say, ETH. Arbitrageurs will rejoice if OP is naively overallocated into constant product AMMs. While having the Optimism Collective act as meta-governance in the ecosystem might accrue some value to the OP token, I think it would challenge the network\u2019s claim of being credibly neutral. Optimism functions as an extension of Ethereum, and maintaining credible neutrality is a must. Optimism was already accused of showing certain apps favoritism, and this proposal could make things much worse.     jackanorak:  This is unironically true.   Unironically, impermanent loss invalidates the meme. By pairing OP with long tail tokens on AMMs, the Collective would lose value on many of their positions.     jackanorak:  We suggest that new grants be frozen until we consider this proposal.   This is a ridiculous suggestion. The Collective should continue giving grants to projects they believe can convert incentives into more Optimism transactions, liquidity, and users. Overall, this proposal uses a lot of hyperbole and does not establish itself as clearly better than the OP incentives that dozens of projects are about to kick off, many of which will enhance the OP token\u2019s on-chain liquidity. Pairing OP with new projects\u2019 tokens on AMMs is not \u201cfunding public goods\u201d, I hope other readers and delegates see this clearly. I believe the OP token\u2019s utility will reach maturity only once sequencing/block production is decentralized. This is where it will derive most of its value, and trying to append weird and somewhat risky utility onto it now is a bit short-sighted. I am not in favor of this proposal and would vote against it. Disclosure: I am on the Rubicon team. Regardless of how it would impact our protocol, I simply think this is not a wise move for the Collective. ",

Consider: Status quo, Optimism distributes 100 OP. Our proposal, Optimism distributes 75 OP , reserves 25 OP and solicits 25 OP equivalent from partner protocols. Setting aside the likely farming benefits to offset IL (after all, that is the compensation!), think there\u2019s basic math you\u2019re not seeing here. Not really sure why you claim hyperbole in the proposal. We\u2019re not saying that the grant program be stopped indefinitely - we consider it a means of prolonging its efficacy. The fact of your calling it \u2018weird\u2019 I think gives your game away.

The fact of expanding and iterating on modes of governance is not \u2018weird\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s literally baked into the Working Constitution. Really unsure how else to respond here other than to reemphasize, this is not a wholesale stand-in for grants; it\u2019s not necessary to use a program such as Avalanche as a counterfactual. We\u2019re talking about changing how protocols get the thing they\u2019re asking for \u2013 dex-based liquidity \u2013 in a positive-sum way. Even if we suppose that some marginal incentivized liquidity provider would miss out at the start, there remain the same outside incentives (and the same liquidity) to encourage plenty of new users, capital, and development \u2013 and, again, with our plan you could be comfortable in the likelihood of being able to prolong existing liquidity mining programs (and start new ones), along with all the others, to continue to bring in this activity.

You are right here and I am also looking at how it will turn out, you also know, those funds are already distributed and there no point discussing about it now. All we can do is wait, see and learn from it.  Yes, absolutely. The last batch was intended as a demonstration to provide a sense of scale. Of relevance is the next batch (and so on), which is why we were asking to hold off on this series of grants, just for a week or two, to consider this proposal. We\u2019ve submitted this proposal as a team, but I would volunteer to dedicate myself solely to this project to make sure we could get to consensus quickly enough to continue rewards.

I have seen, many projects are quite responsive to feedback and willing to amend their proposal.  We can def do more of this \u2013 but it\u2019s addressing the symptom and not the cause. Our proposal intends to remove that kind of guesswork altogether.  It not about me or you, I am talking in general. We had seen this in past voting cycle as well, If an entity has stake in a project, they choose to abstain from their proposal.  If I\u2019m understanding you correctly, you\u2019re saying that delegates with personal stakes in protocols currently abstain from votes where there might be conflicts of interest. I think that\u2019s fine \u2013 if fragile \u2013 as a means of preventing capture (as we\u2019ve seen in politics). In any case, what we\u2019re proposing is a step away from these types of conflicts, as the only shift is the addition of governance to firms\u2019 capital bases, not individuals. To say that personal conflicts would enter into it in a more significant way than in the status quo would be to say that governance itself is captured by individuals, which is an entirely different matter (one, incidentally, this proposal is also attempting to address).  I see here we have different opinion, from what I understood, GF funds are for token house and users holding token have say in this. Of course, at initial stage OP Foundation can decide to approve or reject it but only when a proposal is approved by token house.  I think we have the same understanding here. We were just saying that the OP Foundation should have by this point more than demonstrated their commitment to and interest in Optimism\u2019s success as a primary matter.  2 Weeks would not be a problem, I was thinking a pause for months.

I don\u2019t want to overstep my bounds here with you, especially because I sympathize with this sentiment (and strictly adhere to it when it comes to Velodrome), but unfortunately in the case of funding public goods, the price is of relevance in that it dictates OP\u2019s ability to do so. I think we ought to be able to refer to its instrumentality to this end while avoiding the ugly speculative discussion that comes from hyperfocus on it.

Optimism functions as an extension of Ethereum, and maintaining credible neutrality is a must. Optimism was already accused of showing certain apps favoritism, and this proposal could make things much worse.   Just realized that we missed this question on an important topic - apologies. Would hope you\u2019d expand on this thought, as we\u2019ve struggled to find any direct line between our proposal and any sort of loss of credible neutrality. Governance is either neutral or not; what it has governance over ought not to affect neutrality. If your belief is that simply expanding the purview of governance leads to a loss of neutrality [don\u2019t want to misrepresent tho], that implies the desire for highly limited governance, a view I\u2019d really like to hear explained in light of what\u2019s been posted on the forum to date.

You assume every single OP token will be sold on the market which is misleading, I think it\u2019s fair to assume at least some amount will be held or staked in liquidity pools.  I\u2019m not so sure, considering the moral panic you seem to exhibit at the thought of impermanent loss. Feel free to back your assertion with some data on how much farmers LPing tokens A + B getting paid in token C choose to farm token C. Any seasoned farmer can tell you it would not be much. Or feel free to consider how much long-term holding or LPing you get from users getting incremental tokens for use rewards, or devs getting paid in OP. And in any case, there would have to be substantial retention of tokens for there not to be a material impact. A 50% haircut in our estimates is still demonstrably intolerable if what we\u2019re trying to swing as OP is sustained funding of public goods.  For any token incentive program, the most important measure is Emissions over Revenue . Projects almost always overpay for growth at the beginning ($1 of Emissions leads to less than $1 of fees), with the goal of flipping that ratio in the future. It\u2019s worth noting that in Optimism\u2019s case, the stated goal for OP incentives is that they not only lead to more transactions (revenue) but also more liquidity and users. Why not? Those incentive programs grew their respective network in all of Optimism\u2019s target metrics. They are great comparables and I am not sure why you want to dismiss them.  Again, there\u2019s nothing in our proposal that impedes the growth of any of these things. It provides if anything more stable liquidity, thus facilitating more trades, investment, etc., better rates due to greater activity on lending and trading protocols, etc. We\u2019re not saying the net effect ought to be any different from Avalanche Rush or any other programs \u2013\u2013 the concrete benefit to these protocols and their users doesn\u2019t change one iota. So yes, they\u2019re good models for OP globally. No, they\u2019re not a counterfactual here.  I guess I do not feel the urgency you do or see this \u201cimminent\u201d need for utility. Incentives are about to kick off on almost all Optimism apps and Bedrock will be online later this year. I don\u2019t buy the theory of the coming OP liquidity crisis, and as I mentioned, you did use unrealistic estimates.  Even if you were to discount our estimates of sell pressure by 50% we\u2019re talking about massive, sustained sell pressure by any reasonable measure. Saying you don\u2019t \u201cfeel the urgency\u201d without any evidence or modeling does not help anyone here make sound decisions.  And I see hyperbole throughout the proposal, not just the suggestion that grants should stop.  Would love to see specific examples of how we\u2019ve strayed from data or reason. To answer the question of \u201cwhat else is hyperbolic\u201d by saying \u201cwell, it\u2019s everywhere\u201d isn\u2019t productive.  So a network\u2019s token accruing value from block production is \u201cspeculative\u201d but pairing the token with long tail assets in constant product AMMs is \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cdata-driven\u201d. Gotcha. Could not disagree more. There is way more value for OP in block production than there is in \u201cpartnerships\u201d.  Whether OP collectively resolves 1. what it\u2019d look like, 2. whether it would outweigh potential risks, 3. ultimately whether to go with it, among other issues is, yes, a matter of speculation. Certainly it could accrue material value, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the wrong path! I\u2019ve had these conversations myself, and there\u2019s much to be gained. But something like this being implemented is months and months away, and the sell pressure we\u2019ve described is occurring as we speak with little other than market markers to mitigate it. And in that time, the weeks and weeks of incentives being voted on by OP will depreciate, and so on. And, yes, what we\u2019re describing is a mechanical buffer against this sell pressure that also happens to carry many side benefits. It\u2019s a positive-sum construction.  Gotcha. Could not disagree more. There is way more value for OP in block production than there is in \u201cpartnerships\u201d.  Not really sure where this adversarial tone is coming from. It\u2019s not an either-or; it\u2019s a matter of meeting needs as they come. Any sort of opinion you may have over what\u2019s good or bad is more helpful when it\u2019s backed by evidence or modeling. ",

First time this was raised was this thread.  35% of all approved OP for distribution has been for the purpose of incentivizing liquidity on a dex. We\u2019re offering an alternative means to achieve the thing protocols are directly calling for. That\u2019s what I mean by redundancy.  The other issue I am not understand is who is going to own the created LP, since Optimism provides OP, the dex provides their token? So in the case of Velodrone, it would be VELO. But then you need to create the LP for it, and that LP will have only one owner.  The owner of the LP would be the Optimism Collective. They would be LPing the tokens, they\u2019d have governance rights over the consitituent tokens, and they would be earning fees and emissions on these tokens.  If your proposal tries to tackle price, too early to tell and like others have said, many assumptions on your initial post, some of which I don\u2019t agree.  Then feel free to substantively rebut our estimates or assumptions. So far nobody has.  If your proposal tries to tackle governance participation, the issue is very different and this proposal does nothing.  Again, please substantiate with a thesis. Ours is this: governance participation will increase when governance participation means more than who gets to distribute tokens. Having direct ability to help inform the direction of constituent protocols is a meaningful step forward for the Collective and is in our view among the most powerful possible draws to participation. I\u2019ve read the forums and haven\u2019t seen a compelling alternative raised so far. If there\u2019s one you have in mind, please direct me. ",

Already explained why the marginal effect of this proposal passing (even if we were to get all of the liqudity) is insignificant and possibly a liability; if we are that dominant, all the liq mining rewards in the status quo are going to veVELO holders (i.e., not LPs) directly as revenue. If this proposal passes, we lose a big chunk of that. But we\u2019re still coming from behind. Synthetix, Perpetual, and Lyra, the largest players, continue to do most of their incentivization on Curve and v3. Beethoven and Zipswap are also certainly relevant as outlets. ",

One thing i like about DAO is chautic co-ordination and just because we have different opinion does not mean either of us a wrong, it just that we see differently.

I think we can agree to disagree, you dont see this as an issue and I do. Not that I support of this proposal but I like that you are quite motivated about this and want to have a discussion. So, my suggestion would be,  update the proposal with exact words, who will own the LP address, OP foundation ? or someone else ? This need clear answer. What would you suggest to do with the LP rewards. Give some of your suggestion ? How long will this LP last ? Who will make a call do dilute the LP and /or its rewards. Do you see Impermanent loss as a problem? What would you recommend to mitigate this ?   Assuming we have other project token and want to participate in their DAO  How this will work ? Lets say OP foundation has the token owned by multi-sig, now who will vote and participate in the DAO ? will it be foundation or the delegates ?  Update this to the proposal, if you have already answered them, please link them to the proposal. and please remember to tag me if any comment is pointed directly towards me. ",

For obvious legal reasons, OP Labs & employees do not discuss token value, but I don\u2019t think I will rock anyone\u2019s socks if I say that a strong token opens more possibilities for governance to make an impact. I love to see a proposal in this direction, even just as a side effect. I will also second the fact that liquidity is a real need. I often hear from the bizdev team that liquidity is one of the main concerns of projects. The situation has largely improved already, but it\u2019s still possible to do much better. Giving the collective governance power in protocols is also something you like to see. It\u2019s a good way to maintain alignment. I think there can even be a discussion about projects having the ability to use their LP funds to vote in Optimism governance. Projects are important and valued actors whose voice should carry weight (though this should be made very carefully, to avoid projects having a disproportionate governance weight). My take away from the recent situation with the delegation of Perpetual Protocol\u2019s OP allocation is that we\u2019d like to give protocol a voice, but we have to be mindful that it does not take over the voices of other token holders. Finally, we have to be cognizant that there are many dexes on Optimism, and we can\u2019t be playing favorite. On the other hand, this is not Optimism, not Communism and I would like to see the market play a role. I think a fairly simple solution is to let projects decide on which dex they want to deposit their liquidity (subject to governance approval to avoids griefs such as creating a new dex specially for the occasion). They will do what is in their best interest, competition will play its role, and hopefully all will be well. (To be fair, this is implied in the proposal, which mentions Velodrome and Curve, I think it\u2019s worth spelling explicitly though.) Velodrome did indeed draft this, so I do expect they are confident they\u2019ll be able to benefit from the proposal (though I do think everyone in the ecosystem benefits from it becoming stronger). They don\u2019t have to be the only dex benefitting however. There\u2019s been a lot of back-and-forth in this thread between the Velodrome team and other parties from other dexes. I\u2019d love to see what less directly involved member of the community think as well. ",

Now that we\u2019ve settled questions about process, I\u2019ll turn to the individual q\u2019s you posted earlier, as they\u2019re similar to the open questions we laid out in the original proposal. There is enough overlap where I\u2019d rather post them here, and then once we\u2019ve discussed, we can amend. Excited to get back to the proposal at hand.  Who will own the LP address, OP foundation ? or someone else ? This need clear answer.  Foundation multisig is probably the most low-friction way to custody this while final governance is sorted out.  What would you suggest to do with the LP rewards. Give some of your suggestion ?  In our initial proposal, we left this an open question and invited thoughts. The three primary actions are:  Sell LP rewards to compound LP positions, possibly through autocompounder Compound LP rewards into more capacity to influence broader liquidity \u2013 if v3, possibly buy back OP for more public good distribution or acquire votepower in a veDEX \u2013 if veDEX model, such as Velo or Curve, accumulate voting tokens to gain general votepower Sell LP rewards for some other purpose \u2013Buy back OP for public good investment \u2013Acquire more governance of partner protocols \u2013(pending legal clearance, lol) general treasury mgmt  As you can see, there are a few different paths, but each of them presents an interesting opportunity for the Collective. My personal suggestion would be some combination of compounding voteshare and buying back OP, both of which directly free up Governance\u2019s hand to facilitate more funding, but this is very much an area where I\u2019d invite some other perspectives.  How long will this LP last ? Who will make a call do dilute the LP and /or its rewards.  Our thinking was that this would be more or less permanent until the protocol signaled a lack of need, at which point the funds would be at Optimism\u2019s disposal. We could say that Optimism commits to holding protocols\u2019 governance tokens in perpetuity while reclaiming its OP for more public goods distribution.  Do you see Impermanent loss as a problem? What would you recommend to mitigate this ?  As an impediment to passing this proposal, no. The analogy I used above is that it\u2019s silly to refuse to accept $100 of free money because you\u2019re worried you might lose $10 of that. The primary reason for doing this in the first place is to take OP you were already going to give away and put it to work for the same purpose it was originally being requested for\u2013but also put it to work for you. How efficiently it works for you is secondary because your alternative is getting 0 value for yourself. As an operating matter, yes there are possibilities to mitigate this, but I believe it\u2019s downstream of getting something like this passed.  How this will work ? Lets say OP foundation has the token owned by multi-sig, now who will vote and participate in the DAO ? will it be foundation or the delegates?  This is a super exciting area where I don\u2019t have a clear direction! I think this is a much, much bigger question on which I would be thrilled to have this proposal spark discussion. Fortunately, even if this passed we would have some time to sort it out. Of primary importance is meeting protocols\u2019 liquidity needs, which currently represent over 1/3 of all approved OP distributions. ",

Last time when we try to involve foundation with joining multi-sig with different project they said no because of bureaucracy, So I would start with getting their permission here. Are they willing to take this responsibility.  If you are able to resolve this, then I would agree that we have made some progress.     jackanorak:  Foundation multisig is probably the most low-friction way to custody this while final governance is sorted out.   This proposal will impact all upcoming proposals, So I would assume this going to voting on snapshot and for that reason, If I were you, I would do some math here and extend the analogy. We know how many token are left in GF fund, you are proposing 25% from from our side and 25% from project side. Run some number and show us the data with, even if it has 10% of variance.  As an impediment to passing this proposal, no. The analogy I used above is that it\u2019s silly to refuse to accept $100 of free money because you\u2019re worried you might lose $10 of that.  We have gone through this many time and I dont agree with this logic. So, i wont repeat again.  The primary reason for doing this in the first place is to take OP you were already going to give away and put it to work for the same purpose it was originally being requested for\u2013but also put it to work for you. How efficiently it works for you is secondary because your alternative is getting 0 value for yourself.  Few other thoughts:-  What about those project that does not have token or cant afford to give 25% of their share ? Buying OP and putting into foundation treasury would be a good idea where both house would vote to distribute it to public good. I would remove DAO all together if foundation is accepting to hold the address, or mention specifically that decision(on other project DAO) will be done by OP Token house, foundation role would be just cast those votes. Goal here is to keep Foundation as neutral as possible. We are asking projects to give co-incentives, are you planning to keep that part or remove it ? Also put 5 dex of your choice where you want to keep the LP. Would you suggest putting all in a single dex or distribute it between 3-5 ? Dex selection should also need voting, I think ? In order for anyone to call Velodrome bias because you are drafting this proposal, I would suggest taking a voting snapshot of the date this proposal was submitted.  ",

Delegating donated LP funds to protocols is a fascinating idea I don\u2019t want to lose. Been struggling to propose an actionable approach to getting distributed OP delegated to these major stakeholders, and this feels like it could be a win-win in that it also incentivizers partners to participate. Would hope to see mutual governance influence in the long term, and the discussion on Perp\u2019s distro stands to disenfranchise a major group Agree on the idea of letting projects decide their own dex \u2013 had had this thought. Removes a ton of overhead. I want to make clear: my guess is that we would benefit primarily through TVL, through the ecosystem\u2019s sustained growth, and through sustained OP token value (which would allow more OP incentivization over time). I\u2019ll say again that, economically speaking, this has an unclear effect on us because partner protocols see a lower cost of liquidity and thus may end up bribing less. For a non-bribe-oriented dex such as Uniswap, my guess is that this would be a strict improvement.  Overall, I think we need to remember that we are doing these grants as a collective. We\u2019re granting a ton of rewards because we believe they will generate more economic activity throughout the ecosystem. My call to everyone here is to try more positive-sum thinking when considering these grants and asking \u201chow does everyone win\u201d vs \u201cdoes that protocol get more than me\u201d. In my view, this proposal stands to positively directly affect all stakeholders and increase the Collective\u2019s capacity to continue to do so. ",

                    "content": "I would break my takes into two parts: high level (concepts) and implementation level (approach to execute/distribute properly) On a high level     jackanorak:  Simply offering OP to be market dumped for these purposes in this way is an attempt to outrun the token\u2019s degradation, hoping that eventually enough economic value will be generated by the community before the glamour surrounding the OP token\u2019s potential fades to oblivion. People have hypothesized that it could come from blockspace demand. It could be MEV, transaction ordering, or even community-level partnerships. But there is currently limited tangible value accruing to the Collective, and as far as we can tell there haven\u2019t been significant moves on this issue \u2013 and the need to address it is likely imminent.   I mostly agree with this statement. Liquidity is one of many key metrics and plays a vital role in adoption whether we want to accept this or not. Regarding governance fund phase 1, I think it would help protocols on OP to bootstrap users together with liquidity over to OP. However, I have observed that many protocols difficult to match incentives with OP tokens. My take on this is most protocols foresee that the OP token value will be dumped for a while given economic value is limited and still underrealized by the market norms. If the market value of OP dropped, it will lead to difficulty for protocols to inorganically bootstrap new users/liquidity from granted OP. After I read this proposal, I took EVM (Polygon, BSC) and non-EVM (Osmosis) as references, and it proved that the chain representative tokens are mainly used as the main pair (or second to stablecoin(s)). Referring back to Optimism, based on what I can find, there are only WETH and VELO that are highly paired with OP. The rest are heavily paired with USDC. On an implementation level I would not comment on this since I still could not think of ways to execute the liquidity pairing properly. (not saying your proposal is wrong, maybe just me that is unable to imagine it) ",

I agree that projects should have voting power in Optimism Collective, but for sure the voting power of projects should not exceed or equal the voting power of the community.  I absolutely agree with this sentiment. Part of what I found appealing about Norswap\u2019s suggestion was that it seemed like a pretty tractable way to both grant and set boundaries around protocols\u2019 governance power. But we\u2019re still in early stages of discussing implementation (assuming there\u2019s appetite for the broader strokes of this proposal), and I\u2019d love for you to stay involved on this front.  Context: don\u2019t mix DEXs incentives and Public Goods. This need in stimulus is the result of similar projects with low liquidity. We need more exceptional ideas.  I couldn\u2019t agree more with this belief. Liquidity provision is foundational to DeFi health at this current stage of development, but it\u2019s also primarily an intermediate means to an end. Most dapps, DeFi or otherwise, don\u2019t even really need tokens! The observation that a disproportionate amount of rewards went to liquidity provision (again, important at this current stage) was part of the motivation behind wanting to at least in part separate this service from others, so that projects could be encouraged to think more expansively about how best to use the Optimism Collective\u2019s capacity. It doesn\u2019t need to all be going to LPs (which imo is is a pretty convenient way to funnel grants and vote power to project teams, as we may have already seen in some cases).  Public Goods is something special, which I hope will focus on research, innovation, education\u2026 And I don\u2019t agree with \u201cmetagovernance\u201d = \u201cmetamonopoly\u201d.  Could you please expand on this? Would like to have a discussion around your concerns. We could do this in the forums in case we have to do a back and forth. ",

If there is broad agreement that this is something generally worth pursuing, one way or another we need to make sure it\u2019s done as part of a deliberate campaign. The worst thing would be to push scattershot rewards, fragmenting the centrality of liquidity between, e.g., WETH and OP, which could hurt the systemic efficiency of swap liquidity.
