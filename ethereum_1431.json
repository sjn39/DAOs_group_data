A vanilla NFT by EIP-3754 can naturally combine the two into a new system that is ideal for on-chain representation of the logograpic language systems.  Applications On-chain chatting, blogs, micro-blogs systems can be built for communities using these languages with this new standard. ",

Examples include _hanzi_ in Mandarin, _kanji_ in Japanese, _hanja_ in Korean, and etc.  ## Motivation A logograph is a written character that represents a word or morpheme, whereas a unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of texts. A vanilla NFT by EIP-3754 can naturally combine the two into a new system that is ideal for on-chain representation of logograpic language systems.  ## Examples Instead of sending the Chinese letters of the Great Wall \u957f\u57ce, two EIP-3754 tokens with ID#38271 and ID#22478 are sent in order to represent the two letters. The receiving end decodes the IDs and retrieves the original logographic characters.  ## Applicability On-chain chatting, blogs, micro-blogs systems can be built for communities using these languages.
