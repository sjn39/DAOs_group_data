                    "content": "Hello all. I wanted to share some thoughts I had after attending the Meta Magicians ring in Prague. Many of the ideas were expressed by participants then and there, so some of this is review, and some of this is my own extrapolation. I wasn\u2019t sure which category to classify this under, so I just put in Council Sessions, since it\u2019s an outgrowth from the Council of Prague. There\u2019s a tl;dr at the end. One of the sort-of existential conversations the Magicians seem to be having is a question of self-identity. What does it mean to be a Magicican? What kinds of organization are necessary for the Magicians, and how should they affect/interact with the rest of the Magicians? I wanted to offer an opinion. The core tenet of the Magicians seems to be a dedication to creating an empowering ecosystem around Ethereum. This vision is deliberately vague, and therefore exists along a multitude of fronts.  I would argue that any group with a goal this vague faces the challenge of how much to calcify its tenets and centralize, and how much to embrace the chaos. Let me try to elaborate. The trend certainly seems to be in favor of more people participating in/with Magicians as time goes on. With no formal acceptance process, \u2018joining\u2019 is essentially zero-friction, and there isn\u2019t really a concept of leaving the Magicians, so the number seems to really only go up. As the numbers go up, there will be an increasing amount of noise. Using this Discourse as an example, there will be more threads started per day, threads will get longer on average, and at a faster pace. It will be increasingly difficult to find relevancy when looking for a specific topic, or when seeking to develop a relationship with a set group of actors in the space. At Councils, there will be more rings, each Ring will be larger, meaning it will be harder to cover ground, and with less of a chance for each individual to express themselves. This is not inherently bad. It does, however, provide an incentive for centralization. Centralization often acts as a filtering mechanism which allows actors to tone down to manageable levels of noise. Coucils could limit participation, could put a rank system in place which would cause certain members to be heard more, etc. In some ways, this would facilitate a subset of conversation. I would like to argue in the opposite direction, though. I think the Magicians should embrace the chaos. I believe the idea at originally branding the Magicians as a disorganization sought to capture the commitment to frictionless participation. This belief that anyone should be able to participate, to me, is worth preserving. The spirit of Ethereum is decentralization, after all. How can the Magicians stay disorganized at scale? Let\u2019s look at the challenges again. We mentioned (social) scale as a threat, but there are also other elements to be considered. Who owns this Discourse? Anyone following the Bitcoin space knows of the controversies surrounding bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org. These are websites that are owned by individuals (or, in other words, centralized). Is this okay? What about donations? Who is in charge of managing those funds? Let\u2019s refer to this category of problem as assets. I would like to argue that Bitcoin has the right idea as far as assets go. I think I remember Cobra having a very cogent Tweetstorm about this. If I remember right, the gist was that if Bitcoin is truly decentralized, no one can stop him or anyone else from owning a website and putting whatever he wants on it. The idea would be that the Magicians are more of a concept than an entity (I want to get back to this and use a different terminology later, but I\u2019ll stick with concept for now). If so, any individual is free to interpret however they wish. The Discourse may be privately owned and hosted, but the Magicians remain a concept greater than any of its owned assets. This may be extreme, but I would argue the same in terms of funds. I believe there should be a central address for donations, managed by whoever, and that it should be clearly branded that while the fund is meant for the Magicians, that it is privately managed, and in no way represents the Magicians Foundation or anything of the sort, because no such thing exists. This means that the financial facet of the Magicians would be completely centralized, but the Magicians would not be. Perhaps multiple funds would spring up. After all no one person would have the monopoly on raising funds for the Magicians. This would mean putting the brand Magicians completely in the public domain. A very legitimate concern was raised in the Council. If the brand is completely in the public domain, nothing stops malicious actors from using it to defraud people. Malicious actors could make an event, call it a Council, shill their garbage while saying that they\u2019re Magicians and the full weight of the Magicians says that this is Satoshi\u2019s True Vision., and will Moon with Lambos imminently. While anyone in the know would know this is a scam, it seems to be a fact that there are always those not in the know waiting to be rekt. This is a serious issue. I do not have a good answer to it. I\u2019m arguing in favor of decentralization because I think the alternative has other tradeoffs that I don\u2019t want to see, but, then again, I\u2019m posting all this here because I\u2019m interested in the community\u2019s opinion about the tradeoffs. As for social scale, Boris and others expressed an interest by the Council of moving off the original vision of having Councils a few times a year based on the major conferences. I think this is critical. I think we need to move to a model where not everyone knows everyone, but rather socially scale by creating smaller settings. I think a critical part of Magicians is the ability for each member to speak and be heard in a small, comfy setting. This can only be done at scale by breaking into smaller groups. I heard the idea of regional meetups, which I think is a great idea, but I would like to contribute a bit more about how I think such a thing might look. While regional meetups would allow smaller groups in person, and there is rough consensus that in person is a very necessary thing, the disadvantage of smaller IRL groups is lack of expertise. As groups get smaller, the chances of finding an expert in what you want to discuss goes down. I\u2019m a big believer in the education part of the Magicians, so I propose a second layer of scale. I think there should also be an online decentralization and scale. Any group of Magicians with a common interest should band together and brand together (so others can find them). Perhaps we could resurrect the Guilds term for this, though I don\u2019t think that there should only be one by topic. Nor do I think they should be restricted to one platform or website. Make a Discord, a Riot, a Telegram, or, if you must, a Slack. (I hate Slack.) While a directory of such Guilds might be nice, I\u2019m not sure it would be feasible, and would probably either be incomplete or too noisy to figure out. I think the big conference Council model probably should stick around, but might slide to being more Meta, or perhaps more smaller Guilds, Rings, Chapters or whatnot coming and meeting. To return to terminology, right now the term describing the (dis)organization is a Fellowship. What I\u2019m proposing mildly reminds me of something more like a Brotherhood. I don\u2019t know much about Freemasons, but I suspect that 1) They don\u2019t all know each other, and 2) They immediately feel camaraderie when meeting another Mason, or feel at home in chapter away from home. To a certain degree I feel this as a religious Jew when I meet fellow coreligionists away from home. Brotherhood is a gendered term, and I don\u2019t mean to impose it. I propose, in the habit of creating new words and terms, to brand as an Otherhood. I feel like it captures the idea of loose organization, being bound together by common goals even without knowing everyone else under the umbrella, and a commitment to a more family-like attitude towards each other. Tl;dr: I propose keeping all individual assets in the hands of individuals, and branding them as not representing the totality of the Magicians, putting the Magicians brand in the public domain, creating regional Chapters of the Magicians, creating more small-group online Guilds of Magicians with like interests, and rebranding as an Otherhood.

Councils, Rings, and so on need to be self-organized, but there is no overarching organization with an established membership. I wouldn\u2019t say that our Vision is vague. I think our Principles are clear, but open. I agree that the original notion of three short yearly meetings shouldered on other major events has already outgrown its purpose of easily attracting new Magicians.  I had no idea that we would grow so large so quickly. I\u2019d suggest that we have a single, yearly Council, a week in length, and do other work online and in other meetings organized as smaller groups see fit.  I think a face-to-face meeting of the Fellowship as a whole is necessary to maintain community cohesion. That would need to be coupled with a single online category on this website as a place to reach consensus on issues affecting the Magicians as a whole, including the Principles themselves. I\u2019ve tended to think of reserving Guilds as a term for groups of RIngs when we get too many of those to deal with.  But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. And I don\u2019t see that Fellowship is a bad enough name to warrant a change at this point. \u201cFellow\u201d is sometimes gendered, (unfortunately) but not in formal contexts, and I think Fellowship is generally not.

I believe I have some (partial) solutions to the problems you have mentioned.     wschwab:  I believe there should be a central address for donations, managed by whoever, and that it should be clearly branded that while the fund is meant for the Magicians, that it is privately managed, and in no way represents the Magicians Foundation or anything of the sort, because no such thing exists.   I would avoid central funds management so much as possible. Central funds management will cause power centralization for sure. In order to avoid the centralization, I have proposed a solution Donations to the un-organisations which I would like to implement at least in Ring of Architects. So I believe we don\u2019t need an organization or central management to accept donations. Would like to see any feedback to the topic.     wschwab:  Malicious actors could make an event, call it a Council, shill their garbage while saying that they\u2019re Magicians and the full weight of the Magicians says that this is Satoshi\u2019s True Vision., and will Moon with Lambos imminently. \u2026 This is a serious issue.   What we can do against, we can create a short and standard \u201cpubic disclaimer\u201d that should act as a \u201ccreed\u201d in public. Any Magician presenting himself as the part of the Fellowship should start his (public) speech with the \u201ccreed\u201d. It may act a little bit religious, but it is not about religion. It is about self-determination in public and how the public perception works. If anyone will start his speech with the \u201ccreed\u201d like \u201cNobody can act on behalf of Fellowship\u201d it will become damn difficult for someone to collect money in name of Magicians. In order to create the \u201ccreed\u201d, we should enlist biggest misuses we try to avoid. A malicious actor collecting funds in the name of Magicians is a good example, but it is not only that one. Hereafter we could try to create a should and standard \u201cdisclaimer\u201d preventing this.     wschwab:  I think a critical part of Magicians is the ability for each member to speak and be heard in a small, comfy setting.   I am very strong supporter of the freedom of speech, but there is no right to be heard. Human attention is scarce and anyone should have right to focus it as he like. What we should do, we should give people an ability and tools to setup meaningful information filters and workflow processes. I am working here on some workflow system for similar case and would appreciate any help and feedback.     gcolvin:  I\u2019ve always preferred to call us a non -organization rather than a dis -organization.   I would make the next step and create a name and rules for Un-Organisations, which are opposite to DAO. It could be something like DAU / DANO / DAUN  , but we need a name for Un-Organisations. We are already have some properties for Un-Organisation:  it has a brand should be able to accept donations made to the UnOrgs it refuse any governance and centralization as much as possible but be able to use brand and donation for good.  As I mentioned above I have proposed some kind of token (or NFT) solving some of problems, but it may need deeper discussions before it get implemented.     gcolvin:  I\u2019ve tended to think of reserving Guilds as a term for groups of RIngs when we get too many of those to deal with. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it.   I doubt it will be possible to group Rings into meaningful Guilds. At least I don\u2019t see any process or suitable systematic.  I believe, we should spend or efforts on interoperability between Rings, and probably propose re-organization for similar rings (strictly voluntary), instead trying to press them into some artificial scheme.     gcolvin:  But Ethereum Technologists\"   If we are thinking about alternative names, I would prefer \u201cEthereum Engineers\u201d as somebody who more focused on applied aspects of the Ethereum Technology. We already have \u201cEthereum Scientists\u201d at https://ethresear.ch and I find this distinction between science and engineering very useful. ",

One thing is, we haven\u2019t had people run with the wand and actually DO other things.

I still see not a lot of consistent doing, and not a lot of consistent \u201cthis needs to be done\u201d. That is, I think, a side effect of a forum for long form discussion.

That would need to be coupled with a single online category on this website as a place to reach consensus on issues affecting the Magicians as a whole, including the Principles  themselves.   I\u2019m most interested in this as well \u2013 a summer meeting that has a couple of days of everyone in plenary \u2013 and then time after for further doing in smaller groups \u2013 maybe with one more day at the end to summarize for everyone.

I feel that decentralization needs current reaffirmation - things tend to clump together over time, and this is a concentrated effort to sort of keep the chaos.     Ethernian:  I would avoid central funds management so much as possible. Central funds management will cause power centralization for sure.   The problem lies in funds being inevitable. This isn\u2019t a question of to money or not to money, it\u2019s a question of how money. I agree that central fund management is centralization, so I\u2019m proposing that it be so to speak cut-off the funds from the organization. Any funds can be handled arbitrarily by whomever holds them, so they have nothing to do with the consensus of the larger Magicians. I was a bit carried away when I referred to a rebranding. I meant it more to convey an idea than to actually propose that the actually to change the name. I think this is really true of a lot of the branding conversations, though. Discussions, including my own, about nomenclature are slightly theoretical, as the rough consensus of what people are actually calling things will ultimately decide. I think the idea of smaller meetups with a meta meetup is a great smashing idea. I want to start a thread about ideas how to proceed with local-level involvement, but I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll get to it. ",

The 2 day council meets a broader set of goals, and the work week gets us the minimum we need.   An idea: Straddle a weekend, with the main 2-day Council on Saturday/Sunday, but work space available for a week.  People who can afford more time spend more time.  People with little time can come for the weekend only. ",
