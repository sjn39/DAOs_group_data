This standard is used to tokenize securities and is based on ERC-20, on top of which we added 2 permission layers :  the first permission layer being linked to the identity of the transaction\u2019s receiver and its eligibility following preset rules defined by the token issuer (using ERC 734/735 for the identities and checking if the required claims are present on the identity and are signed by the trusted claim issuers) the second permission layer being based on global restictions applied to the token as such, e.g. maximum amount of token volume per day, maximum amount of token holders, \u2026  You can find the complete description of the EIP-42 here GitHub - TokenySolutions/EIP42: proposition of the eip42 standard for security tokens Thanks in advance for your consideration and your feedbacks  ",
