So I\u2019ll keep it short, 2 things are different this time  They have to provide all docs US authorities requested by 15th Jan and this time there is no extension They\u2019ve been printing USDT at unprecedented scale (for full details read those 2 twitter threads: https://twitter.com/pat_jane_crypto/status/1344673896675618818 https://twitter.com/pat_jane_crypto/status/1346118494115524609 )  We all know they are shady and the least reliable stable coin, so I was very surprised to find out they were added as collaterial type, making the wonderfully and only decentralized DAI less so. USDC was easier for me to swallow, but USDT? This is dissaster waiting to happen. I can see the limit for USDT is minimal right now, but I guess this is just the start? ",
