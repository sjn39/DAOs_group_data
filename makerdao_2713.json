                    "content": "The things in DeFi are developing fast - almost every popular project (i.e. Uniswap, Aave, Loopring, USDC\u2026) is working on a new version as soon as the current version is in production. DAI released v2 (SAI=v1) last year and AFAIK nobody works on v3 version yet. Ther are some improvements in the making (the governance site, liquidations\u2026) but they are just fixes for the current version with no major new features. Is there any plan for new DAI contracts written from scratch or at least for a major redesign and enhancement of the current contracts? I\u2019m afraid that if DAI doesn\u2019t evolve and catches up with new developments (incentives, yield farming, L2 voting and transfers\u2026) that it will fall behind the competition and slowly die. We must not be fooled by a rather large DAI MCap growth - DAI is far from secure from competition as we saw projects rising from nowhere to hundeds of millions in MCap/liquidity in weeks. What are your thoughts about that problem? Do you think v3 is unnecessary in 2020/2021 and that DAI will thrive on first mover advantage and the robustness of the current design? Is there a funding available for v3 development (the Foundation\u2026)? Is there a will from current Maker develeopers to work on a new version? ",

It is likely from here that we will see many smaller changes and it will be harder to define a v2 vs v3 since the change will happen continuously. ",

As to what Maker looks like in 2021.   My concern is that Maker will not be able to evolve faster than the rest of the DeFI space and is left behind with nothing in v2 and looking to create a v3 to compete with the rest of the markets.
