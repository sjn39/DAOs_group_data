We could use the unbacked Dai to buy and burn MKR, for example, or to pay for much needed dev support to accelerate protocol improvements.  Furthermore, printing unbacked Dai would help fix the peg without taking on the protocol risk of massive amounts of centralized stablecoins -not just through selling the Dai but also lowering the collateral backing to say $0.99 from current $1.00. People buying Dai now are essentially buying unbacked dai - as they pay $1.03 for something backed by $1.00 in collateral. Some people may worry that the Dai price would crash- but this can be managed by limiting the amount.  In reality it would just help us restore the peg.   Once the peg is restored, we could use the SF income to burn the unbacked Dai before we start burning MKR again. Printing unbacked Dai when Dai is above its peg and selling the Dai to burn MKR is effectively just borrowing from future MKR burns when the SF income is high - but this would allow much better peg management and avoid risks and negative PR of taking on massive amounts of USDC to fix the peg. It would allow us to have a smooth rate of MKR burn whereas now we essentially have zero and in some future time we hope it will be restored. ",

I can only speculate based on discussion I have seen around this and the proposals that are stuck (MIP20 vox) and the like. I think the 1:1 DAI to collateral backing value is considered one ot the key Maker value components and a large portion of the community is unwilling to give on this value particularly to manage the PEG.  The reason I pointed this out as an option was the observation that during BT the protocol ran with an approximately 1DAI to .93 collateral value with the PEG trading at like 1.02 for a week.  The market believed the hole would be filled and DAI liquidity was scare so it traded above 1 and continued to do so even after the hole was filled.    My thought was that we needed to try to just mint 1M unbacked DAI (1% of float at the time) and see if the markets even flinch.  If they would then we have a lever, if they don\u2019t - we don\u2019t. The community was almost unanimously against doing anything like this with comments that doing it would break trust in Maker with DAI users/holders. I consider the 1:1 DAI collateral backing to be almost a #1 priority for the community.  This taking full priority to a PEG in 1.01-1.02 range for months now.   The second priority appears to be a general loathing of taking on substantial stablecoins to help manage the PEG and a concern over centralization of risk into stablecoins for DAI generation/value.   Once you have these two constraints there isn\u2019t much room left for PEG management other than onboarding some large borrowers/asset players like RWA and trying to grow this system hoping growth will solve the PEG problem. While I think this will help I grow more sure we need additional DAI liquidity levers but I can only speak from an observational perspective.   So far 1:1 backing of DAI is priority #1 in a great majority of the community and I think for good reason(s). ",

Its really holding the protocol back and making it more likely that Dai becomes irrelevant.   I think RWA are fine but its going to violate what I consider to be the most value aspect of Dai - on chain transparency and decentralization.

Why do so many people support it?   Others will have to speak on this.  It was just my observation that breaking the 1:1 DAI collateral backing value to be something the vast majority involved here and in governance rejects. BTW:   We already have variations of RWA with \u2018some\u2019 verification transparency.   The quesiton becomes do you believe the verifiers fiducial responsiblities in this regard.   I will say one thing IF these protocols only limit themselves to stablecoins and crypto assets we will never get robust markets or real growth.   Quite literally crypto needs to take on some Real World Risk to make the next growth phase.   I also agree it won\u2019t be without some pain in the road but I think the risks are worth the rewards.   I want to see crypto value grow to over $1T into the $10T range and the only way I see this happening is with RWA in this space. ",

Conceptually I have advocated for a secondary surplus that if one connected the DAI minted for it to the value of the assets in it (i.e. accessible by DAI during an ES) this would retain a 1:1 backing between the combined systems (primary collateral + primary DAI + secondary collatera + secondary minted DAI) where the key component to this is during ES governance could NOT connect the secondary surplus collateral to the secondary surplus DAI minted to buy that collateral.  In this way one breaks the 1:1 backing value on the primary system while keeping it in the sum of the primary and secondary. The secondary being a secondary surplus where DAI is minted by the primary system to buy assets to stick into the secondary providing DAI liquidity into markets but keeping this extra DAI backed only in the secondary surplus reserve and governance being in control of whether or not to connect the collateral in the secondary surplus to the outstanding DAI during an ES to re-establish 1:1 backing value or not. This was a way to create a tilt off 1:1 backing in the primary system while still retaining a protocol 1;1 backing generally. ",

I support current use of USDC vaults to fix peg, but don\u2019t kid yourself that this strategy doesnt have significant risks and negative publicity associated with it.  Printing unbacked Dai is only other alternative to centralized stablecoins to fix peg and keeps protocol more decentralized and unique.

Dai, by definition and design, is backed by more than its value in collateral, because if there is an ES and the system defaults, Dai holders are supposed to be able to redeem their Dai for its value in collateral. If the Dai is unbacked, then for this end it is completely worthless. I would rather have the entire system backed by a single, centralized stablecoin than have unbacked Dai, because that still gives the currency intrinsic value (such as it would be). I, for one, don\u2019t particularly care to pay attention to the price of an asset; I care about its underlying value. The difference is, the market can (in theory) make up whatever price it wishes, but an asset\u2019s value is relatively stable, is intrinsic to the asset, and therefore is not assigned by the market\u2013a constant struggle to find the right price for a given value. Look at the DotCom bubble\u2013Internet companies during this period were experiencing phenomenal growth in price, but the bubble collapsed because the price did not match the underlying value of the assets in question, and the market corrected itself (much to the detriment of speculators). This can go the other way, too; an asset can be priced under its value, and when this happens great gains can be made. Tl;dr I don\u2019t care about the peg, not in particular. I don\u2019t care what Dai is trading at on the market. I care about the value behind the Dai, and unbacked Dai by definition has no value behind it. This, I think, is the real reason why so many people are against it. It\u2019s speculating versus investing. ",
