                    "content": "Hey all, The dust parameter is the minimum possible debt of a vault. Currently all vault types have 500 DAI dust value. The last time governance increased dust from 100 DAI to 500 DAI was in November. Since then, the price of ETH has more than doubled, which leads to an increase in the USD cost of transactions for any given gas price. Additionally, gas prices have increased sharply in the past few weeks and are frequently over 100 gwei. From such a high base utilization rate, gas prices could potentially spike to extremely high levels during a price crash (for reference, gas prices increased by a factor of more than 10x on Black Thursday). This table  shows what is the minimum debt (dust) size tolerated if gas price increases and we want auctions to clear without a loss for Maker. For instance, when liquidating a 150% collateralized position in a distressed scenario where gas price increases to 500 Gwei, auction costs (kick, tend, dent, deal, trade) for keepers amount to about $420 of gas fees. This means the debt size (or dust) can not be below 840 DAI in case the keeper makes such a transaction with zero profit or loss and no loss is made for Maker. If you assume about 10% profit for the keeper, minimum tolerated debt size already increases to 930 DAI. Assuming an additional 10% price drop during the 1 hour OSM delay before a vault can be liquidated, this would further increase minimum tolerated debt size to ~1030 DAI. Also note that unwinding of a vault costs approximately 400k gas which again, making it less economical for vault owners to deleverage if gas prices spike. I believe governance should consider increasing dust above current 500 DAI level due to concerns mentioned above. There are also other negative effects that low dust levels may cause, particularly related to keepers\u2019 reduced incentive to bite smaller vaults. The fixed gas costs compared to small dusty positions they bid on might outweigh their expectation of profits in a competitive bidding strategy that takes 6 hours.  Signal request poll: What should be the new dust level? (please select all options you would support in an on chain vote)     500 DAI (no change) 1,000 DAI 1,500 DAI 2,000 DAI 2,500 DAI Abstain     0 voters      Next steps: This poll will close on Friday, January 15. I\u2019ll submit this for an on chain poll if a majority of forum voters support changing the dust parameter. ",

By raising the dust further, this could be perceived as a message that Maker is moving away from its retail investment base towards institutional investment focus. To give an example, in Latam, the Brazilian Real is normally one of the strongest currencies in the region. A dust at 1,000 DAI = + 5,000 BRL just to open a CDP position. For other countries in Latam, you can add many more 0s to that figure. Given the current economic situation, this would significantly reduce Maker penetration for vaults into those markets, removing most retail investors from the picture. One consideration to balance Risk vs Market penetration is to think about how to manage the debt size (dust) once both the bull-run and volatility reduce. Keen to hear your thoughts. ",

Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have Dai stable, the protocol generating fees and keepers making good returns in relative safety rather than maintain a dust limit which puts all of that at risk simply to ensure that low income users can open  a vaults?

I don\u2019t think many people from third word countries are opening CDPs at 500usd anyway, right now. What we could actively do (now, or soon), is to invest resources on a Working Group to investigate L2 solutions for MakerDAO. E.g., Next week we are going to have a call to talk about the onboarding of STAKE (staking token of xDAI).

I think 500 is too high, but am willing to let it sit there while we figure out more efficient ways to preform liquidations. I think raising the dust limit is the easy way out. There are so many more creative solutions out there than can have the same effect of securing the protocol without turning away small vault holders/new users. I was attracted to the MakerDAO sphere because it was offering collateralization to anyone that understands how to use it. If we increase the dust limit, it will be a huge barrier to entry, potentially turning away new users who wouldn\u2019t feel safe \u201ctesting\u201d the vaults with too much money. I think L2 offers a lot of solutions for this but we also don\u2019t have to wait around for that or Liquidations 2.0 to start improving the underlying problem.     yaronvel:  Another way could be using, e.g., 10k DAI of the surplus buffer to give gas rebate to liquidators of small Vaults   While this might be a hard sell to MKR holders, I think we need to step back and realize these thoughts as equally valid to raising the dust limit. At the end of the day, if there are no vault users there is no DAI and I think we should be very careful with any proposals that effectively price potential users out of our ecosystem. This is an incredibly intelligent and gifted community, why don\u2019t we use our collective brain-power to come up with some novel solutions to incentivize keepers that encourage true DAO participation from everyday users at the same time.

Yes, we need to look into this because last time something like 10% of the existing vaults were 100 DAI or less and I imagine that number is far greater with 500 DAI.     ultraschuppi:  but we have to be clear about this: in the current gas-situation it is probably not economically sound to open a vault for 500 DAI   Economically sound to who? The vault ecosystem allows users to decide what is in their best interest, this is what makes Maker different from traditional finance. If I think it\u2019s worth $100 in fees to avoid selling my crypto before my next paycheck comes in, I should be allowed to make that choice. Otherwise we offer no competitive advantage over traditional finance IMO.     ultraschuppi:  our users are DAI-users, users of the vault system is just a fraction of it.   I wanted to push back on this as well. The only way DAI is created is though the vaults. So if we are closing off access to vaults to average people we are drastically limiting the use cases of DAI and thus DAI users. If only wealthy people can access these instruments we are then competing directly with the banks who already offer collateralization to wealthy clients. There is a huge market of people that are not served by this and DAI is able to capture them. To me, having a vault with a low limit creates endless opportunity across the globe. Someone can start a small business without having to sell off their assets in doing so. The beauty of the system is that you can maintain your long position on a number of assets while also accessing funding at way lower rates that credit cards and traditional debt instruments. The system will definitely survive if people can\u2019t afford to do that, but I think it\u2019s a much more elegant and resilient platform when we make it possible to use no matter what your net worth is.

I would imagine that 10k USD (DAI) is a small price to improve user UX. But the approval process itself might be harder than the actual implementation. Anyway, from my side I am more than happy to implement such rebate smart contract, that just give rebate to eth accounts that call bite of small vaults. this is very easy to verify on-chain, and can be done outside of the core protocol. Knowing bite will be called, eliminates the attack vector @monet-supply mentioned (of whales splitting their vaults into many small sizes). We are even willing that B.Protocol will seed it with 1k DAI (as this is our interest as well). The implementation is something i can do over the weekend, and the risk for funds is very minimal. But getting the community approval will take much more time than that\u2026 So if you or @flipflopflapdelegate want to take the lead on the community, I can commit on implementing it (if accepted by the community).  this is a proposed solution to Maker as a whole, does not benefit directly with B.Protocol in any way.

The collateralization of crypto assets is part of our value proposition to the public, just like maintaining the peg is. For Maker to succeed, IMO, we have to be focused on both. Lastly, I don\u2019t think my comment that it feels like we are walking down the path of catering to whales and institutions is harsh. Not to unnecessarily inject politics here, but it\u2019s worth noting that the US government finally issued a second general stimulus to its tax paying citizens for COVID relief. After nearly 6 months of waiting, these people received the equivalent of 600 DAI. Both inside the US and outside of it 600 DAI is a lot of money to many individuals. If we forget that, we will no longer be able to serve average people and all that is left are big players that already have countless options for collaterilizing assets. Cutting out small vault holders is a huge risk to the longevity of our platform. ",

From a first time user point of view though, we will start to face another challenge which is not only that it requires a high amount of collateral to start with, but a high amount of collateral to check and make sure this is legit. The old adage of try a small amount first is being eroded here, and where $4,000+ of collateral is small enough for people to test with is an even smaller group of people. In the original CDP Portal for SCD, we use to see quite a few vaults starting with around 0.1ETH generating like 10 Dai, and then verifying it was all ok and depositing much more. This is no longer possible. However, I am going to vote for 2,000/2,500 Dai for the minimum because although I think we can handle the 1,000 or 1,500 right now, having to raise it every few months leads to more frustration by users who end up with warnings about their vault being below the minimum etc. So I think we should aim for a Value which should be able to last as long as possible.

You do not have to borrow more to unwind your position, but if you wish to generate more DAI you must do so in excess of a 2,000 DAI total debt.

                    "content": "Hi everyone! The dust parameter is the minimum possible debt for a vault. You can learn more about the dust / \u201cdebt floor\u201d in the documentation here. The dust value of all vaults is currently set to 2,000 DAI. Governance most recently raised the dust parameter in January, when it was increased from 500 DAI to 2,000 DAI due to increasing gas costs and rising ETH price. Since then, the potential costs of participating in auctions has grown, as evidenced by the recent market drawdown where sustained gas prices reached well over 1200 gwei. This table shows the gas costs in DAI for liquidation based on ETH and gas price, and also shows the minimum debt (dust) tolerated for auctions to clear successfully without a loss to Maker. For instance, when liquidating a 150% collateralized position in a distressed scenario where gas price increases to 1,500 Gwei, auction costs (kick, tend, dent, deal, trade) for keepers amount to about $1,580 of gas fees. This means the debt size (dust) can not be below 3,160 DAI in case the keeper makes such a transaction with zero profit or loss and no loss is made for Maker. If you assume the market price of collateral continues to fall during the OSM delay and auction period, and the final auction settlement price is 15% below the vault\u2019s liquidation price, the minimum safe debt size (dust) would be 5,750 DAI to ensure Maker does not make a loss.  1374\u00d7744 189 KB  Note that ETH-B vault is potentially a special case, as there is only 30% excess collateral available to protect Maker from losses. Using the same hypothetical inputs as above (1,500 gwei gas and 15% deficit of final auction settlement price vs the vault\u2019s liquidation price), the minimum safe debt (dust) for ETH-B vaults would be 15,060 DAI to ensure Maker does not experience losses.  1092\u00d7740 158 KB  Also note that unwinding a vault costs approximately 400k gas, which makes it less economical for vault owners to deleverage themselves during a market decline where gas prices spike. I believe governance should consider raising the dust parameter due to the risk considerations mentioned above. Given ETH-B vault type\u2019s higher risk, I will include a separate poll for the ETH-B dust parameter versus other vault types. Drawbacks of increasing the dust parameter include less access and worse user experience for small size vault users. While community members have raised the possibility of deploying vault infrastructure in another environment with lower fees (Ethereum L2, xDAI, etc), this would likely take substantial time and resources to set up and won\u2019t provide a solution to small users in the short term.  Signal request poll: Please select all options you would support in an on chain vote (multiple choice)  What should the dust value be set as (all vault types excluding ETH-B)?     Abstain 2,000 DAI (current value) 3,500 DAI 5,000 DAI 7,500 DAI 10,000 DAI     0 voters      What should the dust value be set as (ETH-B)?     Abstain 2,000 DAI (current value) 3,500 DAI 5,000 DAI 7,500 DAI 10,000 DAI 15,000 DAI 20,000 DAI     0 voters      Next steps: This poll will close on Wednesday, March 10. I\u2019ll submit this for an on chain poll if a majority of forum voters support changing the dust parameter. ",

L2 and rollups will help with scaling, but even this is not likely to reduce transaction costs on L1. By pooling many users\u2019 transactions together and spreading the cost of posting proofs among all of them, L2 adoption might actually make L1 transaction costs even more expensive because the L2 users will be less price sensitive. Potentially liquidations 2.0 could help with the dust issue more generally by improving auction efficiency, and subsidizing gas for the \u201ckick\u201d stage of auctions. To continue serving small scale users sustainably, I think Maker will eventually need to deploy vault infrastructure to alternative L2/L1 platforms. ",

I hear you. 5k DAI minimum debt is a pretty large amount even for relatively wealthy users. In the short term, a potential ETH-C vault could be modified to have a slightly lower dust value than the other vaults. Looking at the chart for an ETH vault at 175% collateral ratio, the same 1,500 gwei gas and 15% auction price drop vs vault liquidation price yield a minimum safe dust value of around 3,500 DAI. image1240\u00d7732 163 KB ETH-C will charge lower borrowing rates than ETH-A, so in a way we would still be subsidizing risk from smaller users. But this could be a more feasible way to continue offering small dollar loans with less risk. I think the best course of action would be to wait for ETH-C to be onboarded to the protocol, and then we can create a signal request to reduce the dust value of that vault type if the current gas and ETH price environments still support the reduction.
