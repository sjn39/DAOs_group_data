                    "content": "In the words of Charlie Munger, investing requires a latticework of mental models. From the Farnam Street blog: In a famous speech in the 1990s, Charlie Munger summed up the approach to practical wisdom through understanding mental models by saying: \u201cWell, the first rule is that you can\u2019t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang \u2019em back. If the facts don\u2019t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don\u2019t have them in a usable form. You\u2019ve got to have models in your head. And you\u2019ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models.\" From the wisdom of Charlie Munger\u2013to \u201cwords of wisdom\u201d from our Community Member Chris Mooney \u2013 who today preached to the community during the G&R call, dated December 3, 2020 about the need to be very careful. If you did not attend or were twiddling your thumbs during the meeting ( I space out like Walter Mitty all the time)  Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:  Down 3 engineers on the Foundation side since our beloved Mariano left (adding 1 more engineer next week) We are definitely Bottleneck on our Technical Capabilities Need to revisit the priority on the MIP-6 collateral index  Maker is a cornerstone of DeFi\u2014would be harmful if we cut corners. At the rate DeFi is moving (oh and Rug Pulls per day) very concern Maker should be focus on being a solid protocol/backstop Maybe we should pump the breaks? Bound to make a mistake. So true IMO. We are building a rocket ship with a \u201ccommunity\u201d (that was priceless @brianmcmichael), hence it\u2019s a difficult thing to do    Here\u2019s the Vid of the segment where Mooney drops some def lyrics\u2013a.k.a. words from the wise:     What do we make of this? What do we do as a community? Do we listen to the wise, or run like the wind? BTW\u2013credit to @MakerMan for asking the tough uncomfortable questions. I guess now, it\u2019s time to ask ourselves some tough questions\u2026 EDIT: 4/12/2020 or 12/4 if you\u2019re a Yankee\u2014misunderstood: Down 3 engineers TY @lollike for the correction ",

Then I just re-read the title of this post. Thanks @flipflopflapdelegate. MakerDAO has grew so much in the last 6 months, >1billion DAI, etc, that it is sometime natural to keep pushing the accelerator. But the basis is still fragile/experimental, we need to keep this in mind. E.g., in the call of 03-Dec-2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gadMkrlm5dY @NikKunkel discusses how recently there was a complete outage in the Oracles communication protocol, fortunately without (known) consequences. This has been dealt with quickly by the few Engineers at the Foundation. But with the numbers being so low, we will not always be so luckly. YES. We probably need to slow down a bit and reinforce that base layer of MakerDAO, which is definitely technical and engineering-oriented. ",

In this case you have done just that, because we are trying to build a revolution here, and if we stumble that\u2019s fine, but if we breakdown, or lose the trust of the community it\u2019s all over. I agree we should be narrowing the scope a bit, as from my prospective there\u2019s no way a risk management team of any size can properly access so many proposals when they are all interconnected and the passage of some will lead to more outsize risk on another. Perhaps a focus on our prioritization list could prove most helpful, allowing time and resources to be spent on doing the top priorities well while we try to draw in more community members to help with the work load of the rest of the list. Just my two cents. As to your post @iammeeoh I like the sentiment, but I\u2019m a little confused where it means you think we should be headed. Portfolio theory suggests that the most efficient portfolio is a \u201cmarket portfolio\u201d where assets are held in direct relation to their size of the market capitalization, with \u201crisk-less assets\u201d being used to to push the curve toward the owner\u2019s personal risk tolerance.  Obviously this would be hard to do on a lending platform, but I do think we should start looking into correlating our DC\u2019s with the market share as to keep the system from taking on too much single asset risk. As it stands now, we are overexposed to ETH, which I assume is why so many new tokens are being pushed for collateral. However, I think simply lowering the SF on a couple of the other assets could accomplish the same thing and take way less work from the engineers. Is this the type of solution you think we should be pointing toward or are you suggesting that we need to come up with a better way to manage projects? ",

If you are talking about my final line:     iammeeoh:  YES. We probably need to slow down a bit and reinforce that base layer of MakerDAO, which is definitely technical and engineering-oriented.   What I meant is that perhaps we should define the focus of 2021 more towards:  Moving away from the Foundation as much as possible, i.e., create Domain teams that are independent of the Foundation (so, for example, we know EXACTLY how many engineers/groups are working on something), and 100% under the scrutinity of the the DAO community Keep growing the community, rewarding contributors (in all domains/direcitons/fields) and community management tools. Soon we will reach the Dunbar\u2019s number, and that will surely determine great complications. reach maturity until the DAO can really call itself \u2018self-sustained\u2019 for at least 6 months, without any help from the Foundation.  rather than simply trying to grow the number of DAI as fast as possible towards 10billions. Of course we can develop all the points above and also try to reach 10b DAI. But I see a risk in running too fast before having established solid foundaitons. ",

They have created symbiotic relationships with other protocols so as to eliminate redundancy and increase the amount of human capital under one shared vision. They knew that at the rate that they are iterating they would need smart contract auditors. Instead of focusing on raising funds over and over again to pay a third party, they decided to invest in yAcademy to onboard smart contract auditors which will pay off in the long term by auditing their contracts in-house and possibly generating revenue from auditing other protocols\u2019 smart contracts. I think MakerDAO can likewise create synergies and increase the personnel that is helping build the protocol by aligning the interests of everyone involved. For example, B. Protocol and Yearn should be more closely tied to the fate of MakerDAO by creating a symbiotic partnership with whitelisted leveraged vaults and a dedicated pool of capital as a backstop for liquidations. It would benefit everyone. We should also be looking at protocols that can help scale the protocol using cross-chain interoperability like REN, PERP, RUNE, etc. I have had contact with the founder of CrescoFin who is equally interested in bringing RWAs to DeFi. He runs a regulated quasi-bank from Switzerland whose securities are listed on Bloomberg Terminal. It seems to me that someone with his expertise would be an invaluable partner in our effort to diversify the concentration risk of cryptocurrency assets. ",
