In particular the https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmxt6giqs42mxr4uskyxaunuw1ua4txwgtnxw4ogbuusht DSR vote is in a virtual tie between 2% and 4% with only 14 MKR separating the two as of the time of me writing this. Personally I voted for 3% initially and later moved my vote to 4% after it became the localized winner within my preferences. I\u2019m hearing that others do the same as well. I think it makes sense to be able to capture this sentiment and reach a compromise number if there is a half and half split like is happening now. In terms of technical implementation, I think we can make this switch with only front-end changes. Current vote options seem to be encoded as a uint256 which gives us the option represent those 256 bits as 8-bit choices (255 options + no vote) with 32 choices available. (Maybe someone more familiar with smart contracts can correct me here if I\u2019m wrong) Also, I am a programmer, so happy to build out this change myself if Maker is strapped for dev resources. ",

For now, I think the ranked choice voting idea is simply trying to find a better way to lock in MKR holder\u2019s preferences regardless of what other MKR holders are voting for.  Put simply, it will allow you to vote your exact preferences on a topic rather than compromise or capitulate based on what others are doing.  Most importantly, ranked-choice should not suffer from identity constraints. NOTE: the executive voting process is not being discussed in this proposal.  This is just an alternative to the current polling mechanism we are using. ",

I am not sure how well the logging system can handle this, and we would want to pull the index off the smart contract event, so we may just want to re-encode this as an array in the log; however, I did like the compact representation in Sam\u2019s idea.

A mechanism of this type removes the need for identity. It\u2019s one potential method to smooth the voting distribution (improving decentralization), while decreasing the governance burden for the long tail of MKR holders. I haven\u2019t thought through all the details (ex: what if the top representative has enough MKR that splitting their holdings allows them to occupy two of the top N spots), but the upsides are promising.
