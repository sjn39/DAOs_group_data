We are working with @s_ben and @hernandoagf on the consolidation of a short year-end report, to better understand and show the community what the performance of SourceCred has been to date. Bearing in mind that we are working on a new instance more focused on encouraging specific governance actions in Maker, we believe that it will also help us to understand, in a couple of months, the evolution that the implementation of the protocol has had. Motivation We would like to know the real impact the tool has had on our community. If it has benefited a small specific core group with the SourceCred cash flow, or does it draw in newcomers and outsiders, if the protocol has worked as an incentive to get new people interested in governance or if we can prove it is actually creating more quality posts in the forum. Potential new features In addition, we are working on automation to improve processes and UX with a new Discord bot. With this new bot, users will be able to   Register (adding your username and your wallet) to opt for cred and grain   Check your cred and grain   We would like to know what aspects of SourceCred you would like to be able to ask the bot. Please let us know what you think about it and do not hesitate to tell us all the ideas you have about how we can improve this tool for the entire community. ",
