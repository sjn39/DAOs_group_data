This post will effectively nullify MIP7c3-SP4, proposed on 2020-08-09 and ratified on 2020-10-30. Wil Barnes and Lucas Manuel, who were also onboarded via this proposal, have left the project and have been offboarded previously. The MIP7 process for onboarding Mandated Actors via domain teams was superceded by the Core Unit model and it is our position that the MIP7 model is now obsolete. We will continue to operate in our roles as contributors and advisors to the Protocol Engineering Core Unit under Facilitator Derek Flossman. ",

With the move to the Core Unit model, Core Unit Facilitators became like domain heads, so the term \u201cMandated Actor\u201d covered both the Core Unit Facilitators and the elected folks of the DAO that came before the set up. Mandated actors have an important role in Governance as the ultimate power to list votes sits with the Governance Facilitator. Governance Facilitators cannot be expected to be experts in every area the DAO ventures in to, so having an elected person - in charge of a specific mandate - makes the delegation of critical decisions much more straight forward. If a mandated actor objects to an item being included for vote they can stake their reputation over that mandate to put the breaks on. Likewise in urgent situations they can stake their reputation to bring an item to vote that relates to their mandate. Hopefully that clears up the need for the role and how even if all of the folks from before the Core Unit days left/stepped down, we would still have a need for the functionality in the current set up. We could change our Governance structure to correct for this, but at the moment if we leave questions of governance inclusion to individuals, those individuals have to be able to defer to experts the DAO has appointed.
