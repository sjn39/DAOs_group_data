We are working to create programs and protocols that better serve our builder community. If you are a builder, please take 90 seconds to fill out this two-question survey. Thank you! Jump to Survey \u2014-  Bear Cycles Don\u2019t Last Forever   However, the severity of recent events in crypto has some of us asking ourselves, \u201cWhat is Web3 for?\u201d, and \u201cIs Web3 good for the world?\u201d. Our answer? The FTX debacle just further illustrates how much decentralization, transparency, and antifragility truly matter. According to the Ethereum Foundation, these values are always what was intended for Web3. While the events surrounding FTX and Alameda Research have had negative effects for most everyone involved in crypto and Web3, perhaps this needed to happen for crypto to flush out bad actors, and return to its original values. Case in point: for Web3 to continue to exist, the future must be decentralized.  500\u00d7609 607 KB   In This Issue of the Digest  DAO Happenings This Week   Governance Forum Top Posts   This Week\u2019s GreenPill Episodes   New and Active Governance Proposals   Upcoming Events   Opportunities for Builders       DAO Happenings This Week   Join us for a \u201cGR15 Retro Quadratic Friends Spotlight\u201d Twitter Space tomorrow(11/18) at 3p ET. @BenWest chats with a few members of #Quadraticfriends @TheMetaCatalyst, @WeSeedRefi, @AfroCryptoPunk and @40acresdao.

See the latest here.   # OpenData Community Hackathon Results by epowell101  The OpenData Community is an independent DAO started by GitCoin\u2013 and more specifically, by the FDD workstream. The first Open Data Science Hackathon ran in October, and effectively launched the DAO. In this post, Evan gives the results of the hackathon! Congratulations to hackers ataraxiae, jennifertran, the Slay Sibil team, and the poupou-web3 team! The results were voted on using Quadratic Voting. The ODS community welcomes data scientists, a community builders, degens, project developers, and who who wants to use web3 data to build on the decentralization ethos of Ethereum. Join us in the Discord!   Allocationism: Towards a Holistic Purpose, Vision, & Strategy by DisruptionJoe  Joe puts forth the concept of Allocationism, which is the name he gives to the new \u201cpower distribution substrate\u201d we are building at Gitcoin. In a nutshell, Allocationism provides a means to coordinate more effectively and make real-world political impact using the protocols, community, and culture we are building at Gitcoin. Joe challenges the DAO to dream bigger in the post, saying that we need to create a stronger purpose statement, and a stronger vision and better strategic clarity in the DAO. Joe offers that uniting the DAO around Allocationism is potentially a much stronger and more galvanizing purpose than \u201cfunding our shared needs\u201d. This post was offered by Joe to spark discussion. Add your feedback in the replies!    Decentralized social graph as an oracle powered by the wisdom of the crowd for the era of Plurality by tkgshn  tkgshn offers some thinking behind DeCartography, which is a protocol that outputs data from the Plurality social graph as an oracle. tkgshn asserts that DeCartography is an effective sybil defense tool to prevent collusion. This ideology is based on the concept of \u201cPlurality\u201d, and the author offers that DeCartography might better be called, \u201cPlurality Quadratic Funding\u201d. You can read a draft of the whitepaper here, and you can add your feedback in the comments.     Latest Episodes from Green Pill   Ethereum is Punk | Green Pill #62 \u2013 This is the third and final episode in a three-part series about the concept of Punk. What is it, and what kind of punk best maps to Ethereum as an ecosystem? In this episode, we show a talk that Kevin gave at Devcon Bogota in 2022, which walks through Cypherpunk, Solarpunk, Lunarpunk(part one of series), and Terrapunk(part two). Ultimately, Ethereum is the punk that we make of it.   Is Crypto Good for the World? with David Hoffman & Juan Benet | Green Pill #63 \u2013 After one of the toughest weeks in crypto history, many are left wondering, \u201cis crypto even good for the world?\u201d.
