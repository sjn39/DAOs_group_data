If you\u2019d like to present, check out this thread.  Agenda  Intro by @juan   Fortunafi - https://www.fortunafi.com/  MIP6: [FFT1-DROP] MIP6 Application: Fortunafi DROP: Revenue Based Financing Assets \u201cFortunafi is a yield and lending protocol for tokenized real world, cash flowing assets. In traditional capital markets and securitizations, the process from asset creation to a final securitization bond product requires numerous counter-parties that capital market participants must pay to verify information regarding the assets that are being bought, sold, and financed every day. This results in a less efficient and more expensive process. Fortunafi is verticalizing the entire process by bringing significant efficiencies to Asset Originators and better yields to investors by eliminating the various rent seeking capital market participants. This type of yield has historically only been available to the largest institutional investors (Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, Private Equity Funds, Hedge Funds, etc). Fortunafi is made possible by the technologies from Centrifuge, Maker, Balancer, and several other Decentralized Finance projects.\u201d  Attn: @amyjung, @juan, @sebventures, @_nick, @hinchliff, @will, @bcd, @psychonaut, @planet_x, @longforwisdom, @jason, @ejbarraza ",

Today we have another session with real-world assets, or real-world finance. We\u2019ll have Nick from Fortunafi presenting their project. Before we start, I don\u2019t know, Seb, if you want to give some real-world finance updates, maybe an update on MIP21, MIP22 or what\u2019s happening (00:57)  Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

How are you structured?   11:18 \u2014 Payton Rose: Worst-case scenario would be that a company you just vetted starts selling next to nothing. That would be the worst-case scenario given that you have the senior debt   12:07 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Nick, is CORL one of the companies you\u2019re investing in or is it one of your partners that you use to invest in different projects?

I see that you\u2019re pulling from these APIs, but do you ever offer the client the opportunity to input the data themselves? And to what extent do you go through the data and verify that it\u2019s accurate even if it\u2019s pulled from an API? 35:53 \u2014 Gred DiPrisco: Do you ensure that the companies are getting regular audits or that their accounting is being done by CPA? 36:30 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n (paraphrasing Planet_x\u2019s question in the chat): Do you have an idea of the volume of these pools and their potential growth? 38:55 \u2014 Nick Garc\u00eda (repeating a question from Tadeo after a connection issue and then answering it): What is the target client SaaS companies, what size or maturity? 41:45 \u2014 Payton Rose: I know that the community greenlight poll just went live for Fortunafi drop token. I was wondering if it would be worthwhile to explain what that token is or what it tracks. Is is the basket of the entirety, just a few you\u2019re selecting\u2026? 43:06 \u2014 Phil Chang: Derek, would you mind talking through the back-test that you\u2019ve posted on the MIP6?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 49:34  NIck and Derek, you\u2019ve already mentioned the websites of the projects, but I don\u2019t know if you want to maybe mention them again and where people can find you, if you\u2019re on Twitter, LinkedIn\u2026(49:45) Thank you for coming. Next week we\u2019re going to be speaking with Kain from Synthetix  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
