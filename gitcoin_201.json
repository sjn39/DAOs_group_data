                    "content": "Hi there guys  Today, it\u2019s always a PITA to get testnet tokens (like Goerli ETH). To the degree that, personally, I ended up \u201cbuying\u201d (!!) some Goerli ETH to someone who had a bunch\u2026 to save time and preserve my mental health  The problem is that faucets are being emptied by bots all the time so faucet providers restrict in extreme ways how many tokens can be withdrawn because, besides a google captcha, they don\u2019t know how to fight bots. This seems like something that\u2019s right in Gitcoin\u2019s alley! We could add a faucet feature to gitcoin to help devs access the most \u201cpopular\u201d testnet tokens without having to wait days to amass barely 1 testnet ETH  Basically, the faucet would be \u201cGitcoin passport protected\u201d. Each passported user could withdraw up to 10 testnet ETH per month for example, immediately, no questions asked  Given the amount of devs on Gitcoin, I think it would be very successful and would on-board many devs on Gitcoin passport. Wdyt? ",

                    "content": "[IDEA Update] we could also make the withdraw rule even more efficient to prevent the faucet to be emptied too fast and to benefit the community of GTC holders: \u201cYou cannot retrieve more testnet tokens than you have GTC tokens in your wallet, with an upper limit of 100 testnet tokens\u201d That\u2019s only an example that needs to be refined but you get the idea: \u201cThe faucet is reserved to the Gitcoin community. All you need is to be passported and hold some GTC\u201d Less open but totally fair imho. ",
