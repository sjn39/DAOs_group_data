                    "content": "Below we have included a Q&A that contains introductory information about Anchorage, our businesses, and the potential for working with Maker. Introduction of Anchorage Q1: What is Anchorage Digital? A1: Anchorage Digital is an institutional platform for digital assets with the first federally regulated cryptocurrency bank founded on the premise that institutional investors shouldn\u2019t have to choose between security and asset productivity. Anchorage\u2019s suite of expanding products and services spans world-class digital assets in custody, on-chain participation activities, trading, financing, and settlement. Anchorage was founded in 2017 by pioneers in security engineering, Nathan McCauley and Diogo M\u00f3nica. Today, Anchorage is valued at over $3 billion, with a team of the brightest minds in security, finance, and distributed systems\u2014all focused on building the future of finance. Q2: What is Anchorage Lending? A2: Within the broader Anchorage Digital umbrella, Anchorage Lending LLC, CA serves as a trusted financing agent for institutional lenders and borrowers and leverages Anchorage Digital Bank\u2019s offering to custody loan collateral. Anchorage Lending LLC, CA operates as a California licensed commercial lender (License No. 60DBO-119768) and primarily originates both crypto-backed open and fixed term loans as well as ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) equipment fixed term leases and loans to crypto-mining operators. Generally speaking, Anchorage only lends to the highest quality institutions, who have all undergone our rigorous, OCC-level KYC / AML onboarding process and credit and risk underwriting assessments. Crypto-miner borrowers must additionally be located in the United States or Canada, have strong balance sheets, a history of profitability, operational excellence, an existing data center with machines online, low cost electricity, and a renewables based power source. Key members of the Anchorage Lending team include Jennifer Liu (who heads the team), Andrew Levy (Anchorage Lending\u2019s internal counsel), Francis Corvino (Mining Analyst), Rafael Rosa (the lending team\u2019s credit structuring lead), and Peter Mallik, who will be working intimately with the Maker team to implement a potential arrangement. Q3: How do Anchorage and Maker DAO currently work together? A3: Anchorage and MakerDAO are already working together on a few initiatives. First, institutional clients may custody both Maker and DAI tokens at the Digital Bank. Second, Anchorage\u2019s technical architecture allows institutions to participate in Maker Governance without sacrificing the safety or security of private custody. As such, Anchorage\u2019s institutional clients can either participate directly in on-chain Maker governance proposals or transfer MKR to Delegates who will vote on their behalves. The Delegates program was designed specifically to enhance and increase decentralized governance and Anchorage built its custody suite to unlock the power of distributed consensus. And finally, Anchorage allows clients to borrow against and trade MKR and DAI tokens through its lending and agency trading desks. Q4: What additional opportunities exist for Anchorage and Maker DAO to partner? A4: In the near term, Anchorage Lending would like to partner with Maker so that Anchorage can expand its term loan offering. To satisfy crypto-mining related borrower demand, Anchorage Lending requires a diversified, stable, and robust term funding base. In the longer term, Anchorage may require additional funding for both its open and fixed term crypto collateralized loans. Q5: Why is Maker DAO an optimal partner for Anchorage? A5: Anchorage is looking for a partner that: (1) understands the unique profiles of esoteric, crypto-native credit assets and business lines and wants to participate in them, (2) exhibits deep ties to the broader crypto ecosystem (and is a player as opposed to an observer), (3) possesses a sophisticated understanding of structured credit, and (4) has proven financial resilience and transparency through a variety of market conditions. Maker is one of the few organizations that meets all four criteria. In addition to being a crypto-native protocol, Maker has already structured impressive deals with top-tier, sophisticated originators (financial institutions and banks) to finance traditional assets like construction and real estate loans. And now, Anchorage is intrigued by the notion that Maker is expanding its real world asset footprint to include crypto-mining equipment financing. We believe that Anchorage Lending\u2019s origination capabilities (including our servicing, risk management, and default mitigation operations) coupled with Maker\u2019s financing reach will help both organizations reap the benefits as the broader crypto-lending market grows. Q6: What can MKR token holders expect from Anchorage next? A6: Once this introduction has been digested by the broader Maker community, Anchorage will, with advice from Maker\u2019s RWA team, draw up a MIP6 application that will provide an in-depth account of our crypto-mining equipment lending business along with the proposed parameters of a commercial arrangement between Maker and Anchorage.
