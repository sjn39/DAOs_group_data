I will edit here so people can see the current status and items yet to be worked on.  My time is limited and LongForWisdom is a much better forum organizer so bear with me. WORKING GROUP consists of @psychonaut @LongForWisdom @MakerMan @monet-supply @Vault2288 @befitsandpiper LATEST UPDATE: 20200619_2300 EST The Compensation Plan has been posted for community review here.     Vault Compensation Plan Proposal Governance       Hi All,  Thanks very much for everyone\u2019s patience while we worked on getting this plan together. I have copied the plan document below and attached a google doc version. @MakerMan and I will be presenting on next week\u2019s Governance and Risk meeting to go over it, and I\u2019ll try to answer any questions people have in this post as well.  For status updates, refer to this thread.  Any vault specific info can be posted here.  Without further ado:  Compensation Plan Pursuant to the on-chain \u201cVault Compe\u2026   FIRST UPDATE (EDITED) 20200521 Status Update While working on a comprehensive compensation plan we discovered there are more classes of people affected by Black Thursday than just those who were liquidated. One example is @Vault2288 but there are others. Trying to reconcile the issues to present to governance a Compensation Package to vote on, as well as fund successfully, becomes more complicated because the amount of compensation will be determined not just by the class of vaults selected but also the compensation \u2018formula\u2019 offered so that governance can be presented with a price tag. This is a non-trivial task and made even more difficult without resources\u2026 ",

Only thing to report is that with no new data I am breaking down and grabbing data \u2018one vault at a time by hand\u2019 from oasis and saving the data into a text file so I can run code to pull all the information for all vaults into a csv for complete analysis.   Reminding me of where I was at with data collection over a month ago before my first report. Doing this all by hand one whatever at a time. now the number is in the thousands vs. the hundreds. Random example:  https://oasis.app/borrow/59?network=mainnet I am up to vault 72 currently\u2026   But most vaults down here are N/A on oasis and defiexplore anyway. I with this could go faster everyone but the resources are just not coming forward.  I hope everyone is safe and trying to enjoy the holiday. All the best, MakerMan ",

Initial data consistency checks looked pretty bad, but are improving as I find slight errors in the code by checking and cross checking particular vault reports against oasis etc. One thing I know we will need.   Someone or group that can produce another independent dataset that can then audit my work.   defiexplore folks said they whipped the code to produce this dataset together pretty quickly and did not consistency check it.   I will have \u2018some\u2019 consistency checks particularly when it comes to liquidations. I STILL HAVE NOT gotten any word from anyone about why two vaults that should have gotten collateral back from liquidations have not (e.g. 2724, 4056) and have concerns there may be other vaults that are in a similar situation we don\u2019t know about.    These should not affect the compensation too much as the collateral \u2018should\u2019 be somewhere.  (i.e. if this is a problem it is a different problem than we are trying to compensate for with this package). I am going to work on this under the assumption the data for the most part is intact and correct.  I will spot check some individual vaults and will provide the data I punch out on a vault by vault basis for each vault owner wanting to check the data that went into determining their compensation package.   If there are errors or discrepancies hopefully these will recify with an auditor and we will deal with on a case by case basis. My work place is going to be one of the first places to \u2018open up\u2019.  I start my 64hr 7days this weekend so while I am hopeful I will be able to do work on this in the next few days it just may not be possible.   Everything feels so close but each time I get to a new step I have to do a lot of consistency checks on a pretty massive chunk of data.   It makes this time consuming and error prone work that for all you vault owners and governance needs to be done correctly. If it was me as owner of this business I would have handed this off to two professional firms for a fee and by now had this all done and over with for everyone long ago. ",

Then it will simply be a matter of punching out the entire MCD analysis over the Black Thursday time frame(s) and seeing what vaults come up outside of the liquidation analysis already done. Compensation group getting back to finalizing a plan once we have a new analysis in hand.   Hopefully within a week (max) provided no analysis or other hiccups we all will have something ready to hand off to governance. I have zero issue with people kicking other cans here because at a minimum we are going to need an auditor to step up and do their own check on everything and no-one is warming up the auditor here. Worst case I hand everything off to pro auditor groups to deal with all of this and free myself of this beast to return to more fun things to do. ",

Thus far, this has been largely a thankless task for those involved, and I know they are finding it difficult to balance time spent on this against other commitments to work and family, so thank you!  With regards to the queries about the Foundation, the issue is complicated by the lawsuit. I imagine they want to avoid anything that could appear to be an admission of responsibility and potentially used against them in the future. This is what happens when a company gets a lawsuit called against them.     Peter_Albrecht:  Just start the compensation for the vaults where you are certain!   I\u2019ve seen this sentiment appear a number of times. Put simply, the working group is concerned (justifiably in my opinion) that governance is not going to approve multiple rounds of compensation. Give this concern, it seems better to ensure that all the compensation is done at once. While this is probably frustrating for those of you who are in the \u2018straightforward\u2019 group, I suspect you would have a different opinion if you were one of the edge-cases.     hsingh21:  I agree we are just not moving fast enough   The use of \u2018we\u2019 in this statement particularly annoyed me (in addition to the general tone), as with one exception, I am not aware of any Vault Holders meaningfully helping to resolve the issue. If anyone wants to help, MakerMan stated the following:     MakerMan:  One thing I know we will need. Someone or group that can produce another independent dataset that can then audit my work.   I\u2019m also seeing the reoccurring theme of Vault Holders being \u2018strung along\u2019 and that the intention is to never compensate anyone. It is naturally difficult to judge what MKR Token Holders as a whole are feeling, but the previous vote showed that token holders were in favour of compensation. Since then, MakerMan has been working on an analysis, and others have been contributing time where they can. To be quite honest, all those involved want to be done with the whole issue just as much as you do. If we didn\u2019t intend to make compensation a reality, we wouldn\u2019t be making the effort. If we try to half-ass a solution, then either it will leave some uncompensated, or it will fail to pass the required governance vote. I genuinely believe that this process - slow as it has been to get started -  is the best chance of Vault Holders seeing any compensation. ",

The cost should be immaterial in context. It\u2019s crazy that @MakerMan should be putting up his own money along with his time. I don\u2019t know that funding an investigation to get to the facts would amount to an admission of guilt.

But if we put this into perspective against what courts do with these things should be significantly faster even if it probably won\u2019t satisfy anyone fully.    We all are learning how to apply new decentralized models and unfortunately are finding it requires more people, working longer to get the same thing done as a centralized model. I am hoping to have a better update by the weekend and no later than early next week. Be safe, sane, and secure folks. EDIT:  One last thing a few of you have written me offering help and I really appreciate this and would take people up on it but what we really needed was a developer who could pull on-chain data and then be able to cross check issues as they cropped up.  It literally took me a week to get an answer on missing collateral.   A few weeks just to get the on-chain data for my first report.   It looks like good crypto devs are hard to find and even harder to hang on to.    Right now I think the working group is pretty settled with our movement forward and data from my liquidation and compensation report on hand.    We are still going to need an auditor to check over everything and no-one in the group has even moved forward on that step other than to have it \u2018as a step\u2019 in the compensation plan. If a professional on-chain analytics group wants to assist here please feel free to contact me [email\u00a0protected] or hit up @rich.brown or @LongForWisdom as contacts on this because we know we will need an auditor here at some point once governance decides the conditions for compensation to simply check my work which will be a vault by vault compensation breakdown over the ETH BT liquidation class.  320-960 vaults more or less depending on conditions and time frames. BTW:   A number of you fall outside this class - I am keeping notes on all of you I just don\u2019t know exactly how we are going to deal with the first class of compensation claims, much less the class that falls outside the first.  The compensation group is hammering out details of this as I post this update. ",

Don\u2019t worry, god willing I won\u2019t be going anywhere but I wanted to step back from being the \u2018self appointed\u2019 lead on this trying to drive everything to step back somewhat and let someone else elected by the group to drive the train for everyone. Hopeful we will be moving what seems to be a very heavy burden sooner rather than later.   I looked at some of the discussion from the last CC on the topic of incentivizing people to work within the protocol.   @rich.brown I know is pretty adamant that we don\u2019t get this until we can figure out the details of compensating people for effort.     [Agenda/Discussion] Scientific Governance and Risk - Thursday, June 11 9AM PST (4:00 PM UTC) Governance and Risk Meetings       Episode 96: June 11, 2020 Agenda   00:00: Intro with Rich Brown  1:58: Governance at a Glance with LongForWisdom  13:48: Oracles: The MIP10 Backlog with Niklas Kunkel  21:30: MIPs Update with Charles St Louis  24:55: Inclusion Polls Review with LongForWisdom  39:52: Smart Contracts and TUSD with Mariano Conti  1:00:19: State of the Pegs with Vishesh Choudry  Video https://youtu.be/Bym7DvajOgI  Introduction Agenda Summary and Talking Points Rich Brown 00:00   Welcome to the May 14th edition of th\u2026     There are many people that step up here because we have an idea we might be able to make a better world by making a better \u2018bank\u2019 but eventually people run out of gas, because they are paying for their own gas (the idea of making time to literally \u2018give away\u2019 takes something from somewhere).   Rich put it well - people need to eat - but go further than this.   If governance doesn\u2019t figure out HOW to compensate people we are always going to get people leaving because they simply are unable to sustain effort with nothing coming back. I don\u2019t see our MKR whales offering to create some new initiatives backed by some financing on their own (maybe we really don\u2019t want this anyway) so the best we can hope for is to offer them via governance mechanics to provide that financing.

Paragraph Summary MIP14 defines a generic process for transfering DAI from \u2026     We are going to need a really good auditor just to check my work.  I might be good, but like everyone am fallible and so far no-one has really stepped up who is equipped and experienced to tackle the auditing for this compensation proposal should it pass governance polls/votes. Everyone wants a decentralized this that or the other thing.   My analysis on this subject suggests you can pick any job in a centralized system and it will cost 2-3x in a decentralized one.  This is mostly due to additional checks and balances required to do this in a decentralized manner.   Look at POW with BTC.  Solves the distributed ledger problem at a pretty high computational/energy cost.   I believe the same will be true generally of decentralized systems. Unfortunately we can try to run at these things but in the end a high degree of patience, and yes work and time will be required to reach the goals we seek.   We are also going to fail miserably, in costly ways, often.   I don\u2019t think we can avoid this, but we can at least be preparred for these results. I think people understand this.   Particularly our vault owners and those in this system.   I am a vault holder.   I really love I don\u2019t need permission to drop collateral into the system and mint some cash.   It is my job to watch my liquidation point and try not to be overly aggressive unlike our standard financial systems that lever right to the edge in centralized ways, with centralized administrators.   There is so much work to do it is daunting.  The idea we could break this so that everyone in this system loses everything, scary.   But this is what makes building a better world so exciting.    We might not be able to change the BS existing systems, but what we might be able to do is transform them from the inside out. It is why I am here (and I think many others) because I believe if I want a better system for myself I need to offer what I have got.  We have to do this for ourselves, no one except you , me all of us can make this happen.   I believe in time not just I will be rewarded, but perhaps everyone on the planet.    I want to urge people who read this.  I know many of you here got wiped out and are feeling left out.  You aren\u2019t.   I stand and will always stand here for the bigger group of people, gently and politely nudging and sometimes pounding the table to move this system in the directions I think are best for the entire community and not just one part of it.   It is my hope that as long as I have breath I will be able to contribute positively to this space.  It is also my hope that more people join computer keyboards with minds and similar goals to not just expect something, and someone else to do it, But that (as Rich says) you will join US in making Maker better for all of us.   The beauty of this project is that there is so much to do, I think there literally is a place for everyone with energy, talent and above all the desire to contribute.   I think in time we will solve the compensation issues - not just for those who got caught in BT - but for everyone who contributed and contributes positively to this project. ",

Thanks juanjuan for the nice comments.   I have not forgotten you and once governance gets us to a point of decision I can take the data I have and roll out vault by vault compensation I may hit you up for some double checking of my work with the spreadsheet data.     juan:  I would like to make it more readable for the general public?

Or maybe all this belongs somewhere else. Anyway, happy to help.   Actually I would be happy to have someone take the document and do an edit.  I actually have this in LibreEditor or Writer so can punch it out however if you would like to take a stab at editing to make it easier for people to read.    This was a report that I was trying to get out in a pretty advanced time frame and keep it reasonably concise so yeah it could use an editing cycle.    I can e-mail you a copy or probably better we google docs it?    At some point if I can ever get my hands on an accurate history of ALL vaults I really want to re-do this whole analysis ON ALL vaults but this is a much larger project that requires key elements I don\u2019t have in place yet. I think it is why I have stayed away from working on that.   It was probably the best I was going to do with the constraints I was working under and I didn\u2019t see the value of returning to that because the compensation report probably was going to be redone anyway and in truth a better liquidation and vault status report system is something that \u2018should\u2019 come under Maker governance perview ala MIP13 and compensation for it via MIP14 (or something like it). IF I can raise more funds and then enlist some talent making a really good Maker Analytics site would be of use.   First goal is a really solid live analysis of vaults vault actions etc.  I see @hexonaut working on a start with mkranalytics.com (a plug for your site Sam  ) so he with his team might just get together what I am thinking before I can even get a start on it.

I thought it fizzled out. @MakerMan @monet-supply It\u2019s good to hear that something is coming together for a compensation plan. I don\u2019t know the plan\u2019s details, but it seems like it\u2019s near done. I would have considered allocating a portion of future SF revenue for compensation. Maybe other ways are better? No idea. Years down the road, I think the Black Thursday event will ultimately be an event we can proudly point to as a show of strength. It\u2019s in our history, it happened, and it shows that incentives within MakerDAO are properly aligned. Poor governance -> Governors foot the bill There\u2019s something important to consider with regards to compensation though. There may be great arguments for not compensating. It was the risk they took. They knew going in. Sucks to suck. It does suck to suck though\u2026 I\u2019m sure a lot of people are salty about what happened. I would be. When we try pointing to this event, what\u2019s stopping them from producing counter critiques? It doesn\u2019t cost us that much to do right by them. It can be a one-time pass, like the DAO hack. There weren\u2019t any more ETH forks. What do we gain though? We have that many fewer people (rightfully?) upset with us. I think it will be a good look for Maker to eat this. We vote on it like any other poll! ",

Then just build something like a secondary surplus out of the primary one (instead of buying bakc MKR) to pay back the bond holders at term with the accumulated SF or MKR flop then to make up the difference. Setting the rate and seeing if enough DAI depositors would buy would be interesting. Right now interest on a 4% 1 yr 2.5M DAI bond (100K DAI interest here if I have my math right) could be covered by the current surplus vs. selling MKR.    Would people deposit DAI to earn 4% if they had to lock it for a year?   Is this a good thing to do?  Realize since this bond is basically going to pay out on a compensation plan it effectively only sops up liquidity temporairly.   Do MKR holders benefit here by not having to deal with further dilution? I think in time debates will grow on creating a secondary surplus operational account that also serves as a warchest with either stablecoin assets, or better assets anticorrelated with markets.     System Reserves Risk       While governance is currently focused on restoring the peg and improving liquidity, I\u2019d like to open up a conversation about system reserves in preparation of a return to normal conditions (item 12 of the initial problem space from MIP1c2).  Bank capitalization metrics can provide some useful insight. The global banking system generally requires regulated financial institutions to maintain core capital ratios of 4%, meaning that their balance sheet common equity needs to be 4% of their total ass\u2026     ",

Pull the uniswap and OSM price feeds at the time of all of these events.  Just a few things I had in my list @hexonaut   But I am looking at more general vault analytics - not just the liquidations.   Perhaps as you get things together I might take what you have at the time and do a mock up of what I would like to see and feed it back to you and your team.   Literally we don\u2019t want to just see the live data, we want to see ALL the analytics presented as a time sequence so we can track \u2018changes\u2019 not just see the state of the system generally at the time we look. In principle since this all lives on-chain in a linear fashion one could just allow the user to put in a block or time and see \u2018the state of the analytics\u2019.  If you allowed a user to download a snapshot of whatever they were looking at then it would be easy to fish out changes and to do analytic checkpoints one could make time graphs of.   One thing I have always wanted to see was either @cyrus or @vishesh vault liquidation state 2d graphs % liquidated at collateral price against collateral value and to watch this change over time with the price of the collateral (ETH in the case I am thinking). I liken this to another idea I had of looking at bid/ask in an exchange and when the price moves (up or down) due to a large buy or sell checking how well the book say 1hr to 5min previous was an accurate representation of market depth.   Same thing is true of ETH vaults liquidation points and how much DAI was actually burned vs. what we expected would be burned in the case of a collateral price down turn. ",

The compensation group felt it was important to make sure that vault owners are active, and by being forced to \u2018do\u2019 something to get compensation they understand and accept the terms of the compensation offer.  We wanted things set up (some contract with an API or whatever) so that once the vault owner acted to accept the compensation that the funds would then be automatically deposited in their wallet. ",

Which is reminding me as we grow the surplus slowly here the team should start talking about increasing the surplus so we don\u2019t end up buying MKR back at high prices when we need to build something of a warchest for compensation. I know this whole waiting thing is tough on everyone, feels like no-one cares, nothing will happen.   Hell I don\u2019t even have a crystal ball on this.   I know everyone is concerned about getting the PEG dealt with and this whole COMP/compound issue driving markets in wierd ways.    Yeah there always seems to be something more important that gets addressed first around here.   Will see if we can get the can kicked so we can at least get a forum poll on whether we should put up Poll 1 since we need a yes to that before we can get to the meat of this in Poll 2.    The real stop will be when we come to need funds with the surplus at 200K or setting the compensation method and percentage\u2026 We are working with @LongForWisdom the second governance facilitator to make sure we don\u2019t make a mistake here trying to on-chain poll this when there is lots of other stuff to do.    Literally it is a matter of governance bandwidth and the community bringing this up in importance so we can make the next moves one way or another. Sorry this isn\u2019t moving faster but Compensation groups hands are somewhat tied here.   We want to push this, but we also want it to pass so vault holders at least have a chance to say yes or no to something individually. If you have any friendly spirits you call on - make a special sacrifice.   j/k ",

Dai supply and demand are at an all time high, locked collateral is higher than it was pre-Black Thursday, many of the Vault owners burned were smaller holders.   MKR holders didn\u2019t fully read the proposal or care enough to read the details / through the steps   The proposal may require too many subsequent votes and some may want the problem resolved sooner or with one vote.   One option is to combine phase 1 & 2 into a vote, along with a $0 compensation plan.  This may oversimplify the proposal and will need work, but perhaps if MKR holders could see the exact payout / consequences to the system and vote for those, as well as a 0 compensation vote if the sentiment has shifted ex) -All vaults between date1-date2 get x% of vault value and are compensated in Dai [XM Dai to be paid out] -All vaults between date1-date2 get y% of vault value and are compensated in Dai [XM Dai to be paid out] -etc -etc -No payout to vaults (0 Dai to be paid out) like i said I think this is far oversimplifying the proposal but it\u2019s a general idea that will need work.

All this does is slow compensation or take us out of dangling some hope to you folks and then yanking it away.   It was and is a hazard of this process, the psycholgical pain to people hoping for some hand out and feeling like they will get something and then having it taken away being a real concern of mine.   It would be a reason that we should put up another poll after some discussion regarding whether to continue the efforts to develop a plan (discussions etc.) or whether governance is done with this BT compensation discussion once and for all - literally to lay this to rest for everyone vs. going through these ups/downs.

Having this stated so clearly next to the contract, strongly suggest that this is at risk. It does not say minimal penalty or something like that) As the oasis.app is a direct link from the makerdoa.com website, this makes the website recommended by maker. (and trustworthy) Another concern is the example on the website: getting a loan 200% collateral. In the event of a market crash, there will be no time to do anything to stay above 150% as network will be congested and a market drop of 25% in eth are not uncommon. The example shown on oasis.app  is: 25 eth: current 2900 DAI at 200% collateral: (current eth @ 232 USD). This means that in the event that eth goes to 174 USD, user can loose all funds, so with a 25% drop in ETH price. As a new ETH crash will most likely happen again, I would suggest to change the oasis.app website and remove this 13% penalty and just mention user can loose all funds when his collateral gets below 150% . Why (in my opinion) misleading users with this 13% statement? This will encourage people to avoid taking irresponsible risks imho ",

Still, there is a long term objective to grow the platform and be clear to the users so I would expect that interests are well aligned True, there are terms and conditions. Also, in the questions section, it also stated that the CDP holder might not get market price for the collateral, receiving less that this 13% penalty. But why work with this 13% penalty as it is highly suggestive? My point is: When are CDP\u2019s liquedated? I believe this happens not that frequenlty, only in the event of extreme price drops. Question: is this  data available ? I mean, liquidation of CDP\u2019s as a function of time and correlated with extreme ETH price drops?  How often is a CDP liquidated without exceeding this 13% penalty? Thanks for all the effort in this topic, I lost significant amount of ETH. I should have spend more time in understanding the protocol and risks, but it would have helped if the website would be more clear. Ofc I hope for a compensation in some way, but I also like to give constructive feedback how users experience this platform. To my opinion, the oasis website should clearly state indicate the risks. Especially the risks in the event of a market crash. I believe Blakc Thursday learned us the following: -Slow transaction and high fees might make it difficult for a CDP holder to add funds -DAI peg can be lost (March 13 DAI @ 1.08 USD), adding higher costs -Auction might not deliver fair market value (more clear on website) -Due to the auction , ETH price has dropped even more due to the extra selling pressure of the ETH they got for 0 usd\u2026). This introduced even more risk for CDP holders\u2026 I just don\u2019t see how to grow a platform longterm while knowing that a certain percentage of users of the platform will loose funds and be disappointed as they find out that13% just best case. Hope for a good solution for all involved , thanks! ",

Compensation can be made without admission of guilt or responsibility. It is an act of goodwill and that\u2019s it. Compensating vault owners does NOT put them in a worse legal position. The Foundation is shirking responsibility, plain and simple. And they will pay for their shortsightedness. ",

We learned about this protocol from those Defi advocates, through various channels, like podcasts as well as twitter. We became seed users and suffered losses during \u2018Black Thursday\u2019 event. Some of them turned their back on and said: those plebs just don\u2019t understand the risks. But it\u2019s very hard to expect everyone to understand the details of the code. I feel it\u2019s a good opportunity to raise the awareness of the whole Defi community, especially \u201cthe plebs\u201d. The lawsuit against MakerDao, did draw some attention from people outside of MakerDao community. Let\u2019s continue with it by joining force with the effort: write to [email\u00a0protected]. Let\u2019s join this telegram group to work together: https://t.me/joinchat/GVVDihyJDH_ZgXiEUYCkEQ  Let\u2019s try to make a voice on crypto twitter, rather than just in this thread (which will only be viewed by several people). In the end, even if we couldn\u2019t get back our compensation, it\u2019s still valuable to provide a lesson to the plebs of the community. It should be \u201cpositive\u201d for the overall Defi movement. ",

It\u2019s not a threat, just an observation of human nature. If someone is trying to help you and you treat them with suspicion and disrespect, they will be less likely to want to help you. To me this feels like the opposite of elitism.

They\u2019re not sitting in an ivory tower and laying down proclamations, they are here on an internet forum listening to your input, despite the negativity.     ItsGus:  If a few peoples morale is the difference between whether millions of dollars gets compensated or not, then there is a serious problem.   To some extent this is a valid observation. I don\u2019t find it too terribly worrying for the future though.

                    "content": "    make_dao_2020:  We have made the process so much more complicated last several months. It was just a YES or NO vote, but turns into a series of votes which would take years to finish.   The compensation group came up with the best plan that addresses the issues.   The first poll was a simple Yes/No to the plan.   I really think the issue wasn\u2019t that it didn\u2019t pass.  Even if it won with 25K to 18K I would be like where were our other 50K Maker on this because as some point an executive has to pass to move funds etc. and 45K Maker isn\u2019t going to pass an executive.     make_dao_2020:  What positive things could I do at this stage? I\u2019ve stayed silent for the last couple of months and even offered to help at some point. Do you think that\u2019s positive? Is this a platform for all, including those suffered loss?   Unclear.   I think it would be interesting if affected vault holders wanted to present their own plan.  Appreciate the offer to help and compensation group may take you up on this.    A lot of people are focusing on why people voted no.   The real question is why 50K MKR that voted before DID NOT vote this time.   Since they didn\u2019t even vote I don\u2019t even expect to hear from them.   I can only surmise two things:  This important poll simply didn\u2019t run long enough so we could get a clear message from the community. There is enough Maker to pass an executive why didn\u2019t they vote on the compensation plan \u2018for or against\u2019.   I think really this is the issue.   If we can muster MKR to pass an executive why didn\u2019t they bother to vote at all on the compensation plan to have their voice heard.   Perhaps they don\u2019t believe this is an important issue - either to settle once and for all with a NO vote, or to push forward with a YES vote.  I have had enough feedback from No voters to have a good sense of why they voted no:  some NO voters believe risks were clear enough to anyone who took time to understand the liquidation system.   ANYone who thinks the 13% liquidation fee only applies to their collateral didn\u2019t take time to understand that the liquidation fee applies to the borrow and if the market at the time of auction is significantly below what is needed to recover funds borrowed as happened during BT the system loses funds.   In fact the system (i.e. MKR holders also lost 5.3M DAI) which everyone wants to forget. some voters voted NO because they believe it sets a bad precident.  compensating once means they will have to compensated again in the future.   Saying NO now sends a message that no-one is going to get compensated for anything that goes haywire in the system A few people stated \u201cpeople were ready to profit from borrowing, but are not ready to lose when things go bad\u201d  private profit/private losses.  These are the basic ideas from a few people (3-5) that i am pretty sure voted about 2-5K MKR.  what we don\u2019t have is anything from anyone who voted yes.   I voted yes with my tiny amount of MKR because I felt if anything we could control the compensation offered well and that another couple Million here to potentially smooth things over with the community while we improve the system was worth the PR and smoothing over.  As this drags out the postive return here diminishes it needed to be done quickly early imo.  I also felt that the statement regarding Maker not having to compensate anyone should send a strong enough message that this won\u2019t be happening again for any reason.   Any future event I will be voting my MKR as a NO to any compensation, even if I happened to have one or more vault(s) that gets eaten by the system somehow. As to the current reaction.  I think it is reasonable given the situation.    I think the expression of dissappointment vs. anger might get more sympathy. For me I am stuck trying to understand why 50K Maker that did vote in the earlier poll, didn\u2019t decide to weigh in here.   I am thinking at the time we had much more MKR paying attention where as now it is not.  I honestly don\u2019t know what to do about that.   I also think important polls that don\u2019t need any kind of executive to do anything need to run longer than 3 days.   This was a poll that should be open until we hear one way or another from at least an an amount of Maker that can pass an executive. (approx 100K) to get a definitive word.   Frankly 45K Maker no matter how they voted isn\u2019t giving me a strong message one way or another unless somehow it was almost a slam dunk one way or another.   I will also point out that both votes show there is significant division in the community on this issue. ",

This was the wrong poll, we should be running a poll that moves us one step closer to compensation the phase 1 poll.

On a distant and very similar planet in the Multiverse\u2026 an open-source airplane industry arises. Once, a plane crashes. Families of the air crash victims ask for compensation but an air company denies arguing that all blueprints and specs of aircraft are accessible in a public library and contain all information regarding risks.

A company that develops airplanes, control towers, and related technologies argues it\u2019s not liable because all information regarding air control is accessible and everyone is aware of the risks. It\u2019s a common-sense that air controllers are humans and on some very hot days they drink too much water and can simultaneously leave a tower to go to a toilet.   I\u2019m not saying these analogies have no flaws, it\u2019s just a way to look at the problem from a different angle. ",

Not Satoshi (aka BTC). So yes. It is natural to be compensated in the currency, which was lost or maybe stolen from or maybe by the company holding it for me. We crypto people don\u2019t care about USD. We do know the risk. When we are going long on ETH. We know what we are doing. All the dezentralised shorts can be done on dydx. You go to MakerDao for long position, dydx for short positions. On black thursday i sold all of my alts in to ETH\u2026 Locked them in to the CDP. Then boarded a plane. When it landed, then it was alraedy too late. 0 bid. Since then i was working hard (doing real work) to get some small position of ETH build. I was not saying or writing anything. I was waiting for MakerDAO to show face and maybe acting fast before the imminent bull run, to compensate the 0-bid victims. All 0-bid victims are decapitated Bulls.  All the decapitated Bulls voices will get louder, when we go further in to the bullrun. All the unrealised gains\u2026 Speaking about traditional Finance. Of course, they are compensating you in full. As long as they do not go for insolvency. So my question is then - is MakerDao solvent or is it insolvent? If it is not than maybe it will get insolvent, when all the decapitated Bulls (0-bid victims) walk the streets and start a riot (on social media). Crypto is not so much about technology. It is more about networking and building trust. Please do not mess with your network or you will lose all the trust you earned so far. Rather double down on the trust layer and compensate in full.

I have my own in different frustrations.  @equivrel has commented and I completely agree with him that every vault liquidation is a failure of the system both for vault owners and the system itself.   While I will still work on the compensation plan until I get something from governance regarding this issue there is not a lot I can do. I agree with @LongForWisdom I\u2019d love to see vault owners affected by this:     LongForWisdom:  working together to create your own proposal   Honestly what I am looking for at this point is having a poll put up on whether the Compensation group should continue to move forward on this - AND money being put up to pay for the work that has been done and to cover work into the future OR governance to say NO - they are done with this.  I consider it unfair not just to the compensation group trying to work on this but all of you affected vaults to be left hanging here with no real guidance one way or another on which way this is going to go. Given that Maker auctioned MKR to raise 5.3M DAI it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to have raised another 2-3M and offered it up in a compensation package yet to be determined.   Raising the funds or allocating them would have gone a long way to assuaging the angst here and if the funds could have gotten out some of it would probably have dropped right back into Maker vaults and experienced this nice run from 200-300DAI/ETH.   Now instead of 1ETH for 200DAI it is 1ETH for 300DAI meaning the cost to maker to compensate either has gone up to give same amount of collateral, OR (the more likely) whatever the amount of collateral returned will be going down. Literally I am out of ideas at this point for how to get any movement one way or another here except for a singular poll that should be set to run until we get an executive level amount of MKR voting one way or another. If anyone has better ideas at this point I\u2019d love to hear them.  WHile the Compensation commitee still grinds on this I think it would be great for vault owners to form their own Compensation group and put forward a proposal. ",

Poll (1) Should compensation group continue to work on this issue, AND 1a for governance to put up a bounty for work on this - ongoing - and at completion one way or another. Not sure how/whether to include the whole compensation of the Compensation Plan group in poll 1 but I think governance needs to pony up for work done and work wanted.   Poll (2) Allocate Compensation for BT victions 0M, 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, 5M DAI. After (1) we can think about (2).   (3) the whole \u2018how\u2019 part of compensation we simply leave aside because I think the discussion thorn is going to be (1) whether MKR wants to proceed with any plan. and then the real thorn (2) how much to fund it all with.

What are you expecting to happen that hasn\u2019t already happened? The members of the community that are most motivated to work on compensation are working on compensation. Not all MKR Holders are on board with compensation, especially compensation via diluting MKR. The way to convince MKR Holders to compensate the effected parties is to produce a workable compromise that takes their concerns into account. The reason that many MKR Holders are not on board with compensation is because the responsibility for the issue is shared between multiple parties. Suicide is a permanent answer to a temporary problem. If you or anyone else is contemplating suicide, I\u2019d encourage you to call a hotline in your area. You can find a list here.     Kukkio:  What MakerDAO wants are signatures for not to be sued. Because if I would sue, than I would go for the full compensation (I am a bit of a lawyer myself) lost gains included. I just don\u2019t want to go trough the hassle. Believe me - You don\u2019t want the hassle aswell.   To this, there is already a class action lawsuit against the Maker Foundation. I\u2019m sure one of the others here can get you in touch with the people organising it. ",

Its only a matter of time before the news will come again and talk about Maker Dao and the 0 bid debacle. Luckily there are other options for stable coins out there, so us as users dont necessarily have to worry about defi. But if the Maker foundation wants to continue to exist and build more awesome products like Dai then they have to find a way to give the collateral back. Simple as that. And again thanks so much @LongForWisdom and @MakerMan. But if you are not involved with the Maker foundation or close to Rune or whoever steers in this direction, then we cant win this battle. ",

Compensation is paid in MKR sent directly to the addresses associated with the vaults, no exceptions. That means that if you lost 10 ETH, you get 2000 DAI worth of MKR. The MKR dispensed in this way comes out of MKR burned as vaults repay their loans. There is no long term inflation of the MKR token, merely a slowdown in the already scheduled deflation.  This is good for liquidated vault owners because they get a better deal than they would have at the time, even if it means taking less than their ETH would be worth today, had it been returned. It also doesn\u2019t get into any question of percentages. What matters is the amount of ETH that was auctioned below market value, not 15 percent or 17.5 or 21 or whatever. It is good for Maker because it repairs the breach of trust with many of their long term users, and makes proceeding with the class action lawsuit more or less impossible because compensation has been provided. It is also good for Maker because paying compensation in MKR gives 0-bid ETH victims a vested interest in not attacking the Maker project, as it would make the value of their compensation decrease. It is also good for Maker because there is no permanent inflation of the MKR token. ",

I can tell you If I was given 200 per ETH in MKR next week I would take it, and move on with my life. Maybe we can get as many people as possible to agree with these terms on this thread (if they do) and see if it can go anywhere? Would have to move fast though, the longer this takes the more likely the price of ETH could be 1000 by the time this idea would likely be paid out and then no one would take it. I think some people will still proceed with the class action because they want more $$ which is fine, but at least those of us who want to settle would have the option to do so. Probably cost Maker less in the long run. ",

I pushed my liquidation level down to USD 125 (give or take) for example. This figure is the only figure that matters. We all agree, that the results from the auction were faulty. CDP owners had no control over the situation. Also the CDP owners never had the chance to bid at the auction. This should be handled differently in the furure. The foundation had (or should have had) full control over the auction. For the mishandled auction the foundation has to take full responsibility. There should have been a Tether/USDC/DAI trading pair long ago. This was also the responsibility of the foundation. So Dai price at the moment of the auction does not matter. The rest is easy. (Liquidation Price) minus (DAI dept (in USD not market price)) minus (13%penalty) = ETH or BAT or WBTC to be payed out. This formula should be easy enough for coding. The payout of DAI is total nonsense. Every 0-bid victim should get a single use NFT (nonfungible token), which he or she can use to claim compensation. To claim the NFT, KYC will be necessary. So involve CIVIC or the likes. KYC is the same, what is necessary to go trough a long, very long court process. OK actually KYC is not necessary, if the Formula is implemented. Because that is what full compensation looks like. It is a small part of the Collateral, but this is it. KYC is needed to get the people to agree to a lesser or other kind of compensation (in MKR).

As to an alternate proposal.   Given that flopping MKR for DAI will soak up DAI liquidity when the PEG is pushing 1.03 I think governance isn\u2019t going to approve anything that flops MKR for DAI to make payouts.  (I personally would vote my MKR as a NO to such a proposal at this time because of this) Based on other ideas above perhaps it would make more sense to simply run a simpler poll that sets compensation in 1/2MKR for 1ETH of compensation and run a single compensation poll that asks governance to set the % amount of ETH to compensate and the MKR rate to above. The question is would vault holders affected be happy if they got back some N% of their ETH in N/2% of MKR?   Where N is the collateral return percentage that is not going to be above 25%?   MKR/ETH ratio has for the most part been holding around 2ETH:1MKR (right now a little lower) so if this holds perhaps would be more pallatable for governance to approve. ",

The link is fine, but nevertheless here\u2019s a copy of my proposal:  Maybe it would be better to repeatedly offer a poll with the compensation amount initially set to a maximum value and lower it gradually until a vote passes or zero is reached? This would minimize necessary actions for MKR holders.  This is essentially the simplest version of this scenario:     MakerMan:  run a simpler poll that sets compensation in 1/2MKR for 1ETH of compensation and run a single compensation poll that asks governance to set the % amount of ETH to compensate and the MKR rate to above       sah:  With your proposal 0 compensation is possible.   That would just mean that MKR holders reject to compensate vault holders. You can\u2019t force them for a compensation anyway. ",

Vault compensation poll2242\u00d71336 341 KB The latest vault compensation poll 13.July to 16.July has only 33 unique voters and was about how to compensate. Not about the if. We should offer a way simpler and faster way. It is way to complex and cumbersome. And it intends to compensate with DAI. If more DAI is needed, then more MKR will be issued to the large MKR holders (auctions are in large batches). The small people should  stay away. That concentrates and centralizes MKR even further.

(There is mentioned, that in the next poll should be decided if compensation is issued in DAI or the collateral, and to what percentage). https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 This is all made just to complicated and does not serve the users or the MKR holders to reach a fair conclusion. At this late time in the bull run there is still a fair and simple way for fair compensation. A single poll can and should bring a solution. Issue more MKR and use MKR tokens for compensation. The Poll should have 6 options: 1) Full compensation in MKR with fixed rate of 1MKR per 2ETH; 1MKR per 2200 BAT. (Collateral in BAT or ETH) times (24.67%) minus (stability fee); 2) 80% compensation of 1); 3) 70% compensation of 1); 4) 60% compensation of 1); 5) 50% compensation of 1); 6) do not compensate with MKR (other solution needed). Which ever option gathers most votes, is to be executed. Some executive from the foundation should put it in Maker words\u2026 The fixed exchange rate for MKR/ETH/BAT is open for discussion.

July 13 to 16 was a proposal declined for how to compensate 0 bid victims. https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmzcg1cq8c27vtd3ydfzer8hzon7mdwuu2enfzugxwqpbm The How question is the one still to be answered. The maximum mathematical compensation FORMULA is     Kukkio:  (Collateral in ETH) x 25.42% minus (stability fee in USD) = maximum compensation.   But MakerDAO doesn\u2019t have the ETH or BAT for full restitution. So we have to find a compromise. At debate is if the compensation can be done with MKR instead. The Maker DAO working group decided long ago, that any restitution will be payed in DAI with a reference price from March 12 2020 (black thursday). That is basically mathematically the smallest possible payout. ",
