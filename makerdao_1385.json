                    "content": " MIP76: Makershire Redux  Preamble MIP#: 76 Author(s):  @Aes, @adcv, @SebVentures, @juanbug Contributors: @luca_pro, @MakerMan  Tags: Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2022-07-06 Date Ratified: 2022-08-22 Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip76-makershire-redux/16400 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmTYQskE   Sentence Summary Makershire Redux is a 10M pool allocated across Liquidity Pools to support DAI liquidity/utility and earn yield.  Paragraph Summary [TBD]  Component Summary MIP76c1: Scope Describes the scope of the utilization of the pool. MIP76c2: Risk Profile Describes the risk profile of the strategies and allocations. MIP76c3: Operating Guidelines Lists the operating guidelines of the pool. MIP76c4: Funding Breakdown Quantifies the aggregate amount to be deployed through this pool. MIP76c5: Fund Allocation Specifies how the pool will be allocated, dictated by community feedback.  Motivation The Maker Protocol holds approximately $5.2B in stablecoins effectively earning zero yield. There are multiple efforts underway (off-chain and on-chain short-term bonds) to invest the majority of stablecoin exposure. Our aim is to begin generating yield on balance sheet assets and support DAI liquidity/utility, creating a new revenue stream for the protocol. We believe the future of finance and treasury management is on-chain and that now is the time to start formally researching, investigating, and implementing DeFi-native yield-generation strategies. Once we have the engineering bandwidth and performed the necessary level of due diligence, we will propose a method to quantify the desired level of exposure and an automation solution (e.g., D3M for Stable LPs, DSSKiln & G-UNI, etc). The first iteration of this proposal raised the following concerns in the community:  Usage of MIP47 protocol-owned multi-sig wallet considered inadequate. Flexibility of the SPF to re-allocate capital without explicit community approval.  After discussing with the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PE-001, @PECU) how this pool could be managed, it was confirmed that a protocol-owned smart contract solution could be used to avoid requiring a multisig. This could be functional for both L1 and L2 chains, depending on the needs of the community. Because of the assets that this contract would control, PE-001 recommends an audit.  Specification  MIP76c1: Scope The 10M pool called Makershire Redux is employed to invest protocol capital to support DAI liquidity, utility, and diversify MakerDAO revenue streams:   Improve DAI liquidity/utility.  E.g., bootstrap liquidity of DAI on L2s and other networks by providing liquidity and participating in DAI yield farms.    Providing Liquidity on DEXs for DAI/USDC, DAI/ETH, MKR/ETH, DAI/MKR etc.  Experiment with strategies with the goal of automating them later.     Key Information  Official Contact or Group Name: Makershire Redux Total Amount: 10M DAI Wallet Address: DS-Pause Proxy   MIP76c2: Risk Profile The Makershire Redux strategies are limited to DAI, USDC, USDP, MKR, and ETH (+stETH). The allocations will be limited to ETH Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, and potentially Polygon and Avalanche if the community desires. The positions may require high concentration in situations where we seek to bootstrap liquidity  MIP76c3: Operating Guidelines  The MakerDAO community will determine the initial and ongoing allocation pool. Investment strategies will be implemented fully on-chain for maximum transparency. A real-time Dune dashboard will provide insight to the extent possible into the performance of the fund. Further improvements will be made on an ongoing basis to reporting quality and to increase the frequency of information availability. Monthly reporting will provide liquidity and yield metrics. Asset allocation changes can be made through Signal Requests followed by a three day on-chain vote ratification   MIP76c4: Funding Breakdown Makershire Redux is a 10m DAI pool. The total funding will be done in one step when this proposal is ratified. Twelve months following the ratification, all funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer and a full post-mortem will be posted for the community to evaluate and decide if the project is worth expanding, maintaining, or shutting down.  MIP76c5: Fund Allocation The community has voted to support the Stable LP Allocation rather than the Volatile LP Allocation. A comparison of the two options is listed below for reference. Stable LP Allocation as of 7.1.22  image1156\u00d7197 36.1 KB    Arbitrum fees are estimated as allocations would bootstrap liquidity Yields estimated using Uniswap, yield aggregators (e.g., Coindix), and various Dune dashboards.    Comparing the Two Options Stable Only  Yield less correlated to market conditions Lower yields and de minimis risk of impermanent loss Less liquidity pools to choose from  Stable & Volatile:  Yield more correlated to market conditions Higher yields than Stable Only in a sideways or upward market. Will underperform in a downward trending market More liquidity pools to choose from   Addendum The Stable LP allocation has received the majority of the community\u2019s support, therefore the Volatile LP Allocation has been moved to the addendum for reference. Volatile LP Allocation as of 7.1.22  image1156\u00d7427 72.3 KB    Arbitrum fees are estimated as allocations would bootstrap liquidity Yields estimated using Uniswap, yield aggregators (e.g., Coindix), and various Dune dashboards.

This could be functional for both L1 and L2 chains depending on the needs of the community. Because of the assets that this contract would control, PECU recommends an audit.   Wouldn\u2019t a very simple compromise be to have SF CU acquire the G-UNI tokens and then move them into the maker governance proxy for safekeeping without the need to implement any smart contract logic that would acquire the tokens. A spell that would move the tokens from the proxy to a multisig from which they could be liquidated could then be used to either move them into a smart contract that can sell them or move them to a multisig owned by a CU. I think a large part of the risk could be mitigated by this as the tokens would only be held in a multisig controlled by the CU for a few days. This would only work if these assets aren\u2019t traded frequently. ",

As you note yourself, in a downward market, if you are LPing ETH/DAI and ETH drops in price, depending on your strategy the yield can easily be net negative, so how did you arrive at e.g. 40% yield on ETH/DAI 0.3 % LP on Optimism?

If the portfolio is limited to only stables the risk of IL is not really a concern because you\u2019re effectively just exposed to USDC solvency risk - which Maker is already exposed to anyway. I would suggest to vote for only stables to start off if IL is a major concern of the community. You\u2019re discussing a 10M investment as if it\u2019s a $10M expense but it\u2019s not. I would strongly suggest we take a sober look at this and realize that the risk here is limited to:  GUNI smart contract risk - but that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about at length when onboarding GUNI as a collateral type Risk of loss of funds in a 10M transaction - we can reduce risk easily by deploying 1M at a time Risk of custodying funds in a multisig - my proposal of moving the LP tokens to the Gov Proxy would fix all of this  I think though in general the idea to look at this as an \u201cexpense\u201d is bad and asking PECU to build smart contracts for this way too epxensive given the very limited downside there is with a very clear upside.

                    "content": "Hi all, Sharing a general perspective on the proposal from the @Risk-Core-Unit.  Proposal Overview Makershire Redux proposal would allocate up to 10 million DAI towards liquidity provision strategies. The program would seek to improve DAI liquidity and utility, while generating yield for the protocol. Depending on the particular LP strategies employed, this could create exposure to a range of defi protocols, bridges, validator sets/sequencers, external stablecoins, and volatile crypto assets.  Risk Factors High level risk factors of asset management strategies include:   Maker technical risks: Funds management strategies may involve new contracts and integrations which increase risk of bugs  Domain and bridge risk: Funds deployed on external domains may be exposed to risk of compromised admin keys or multisigs (for bridge validation and or domain/bridge upgrades), smart contract failures, and validator/sequencer misbehavior  Stablecoin credit risk: Certain strategies are exposed to potential default of an external stablecoin  Defi platform risk: Strategies have exposure to technical, infrastructure, and custody risks of supported defi protocols, including indirect exposure to asset price volatility and solvency risks through collateral mechanisms  Market risk: Certain strategies are exposed to price changes of volatile assets, including inventory gain/loss and divergence loss  Risks of each use of funds should be assessed specifically before assets are deployed into strategies. Where feasible, Maker should attempt to quantify risk factors to arrive at expected risk adjusted returns for each deployment. This can then be compared against potential utility value from increasing DAI liquidity, and alternative options of supporting liquidity through incentives payments instead of DAO controlled assets.  Risk Evaluation Certain risk factors are already broadly present within the Maker balance sheet: for example Maker has large exposures to USDC through the PSM. This means shifting assets from PSM balances into asset management strategies involving USDC (such as liquidity pools) may not significantly impact the overall risk faced by the protocol. Assessments should focus on cases where particular risk factors would be increased in comparison to existing balance sheet composition. Primary net new risks include exposure to new defi platforms, cross chain asset deployments, and price risk from volatile asset strategies. Members of the protocol engineering team have put in considerable work to evaluate cross chain risks as part of Maker\u2019s L2 deployment plans. The following framework on L2Beat may be helpful for structuring risk discussions: \u200b\u200bL2Bridge Risk Framework - Methodology & Framework - L2BEAT In their current form, all L2 and sidechain bridges involve some degree of trust in the platform operator, due to admin controls for upgrading bridges and/or trusted parties involved in cross chain message validation. There have been several recent high profile cases of bridge failure, including the Ronin and Harmony bridge hacks (caused by compromised admin keys) and Wormhole hack (caused by smart contract bug), so the risk of loss from cross chain asset deployments is very real. In addition, Arbitrum and Optimism currently feature a single sequencer with limited capacity to challenge state transitions (fraud proofs are not fully enabled), which creates another form of trust requirement. Each of these centralization risk vectors is likely to decline steadily over time as the respective teams deliver on their roadmaps. These centralization risks don\u2019t necessarily rule out deployment of funds in cross chain strategies, but the risks should be thoroughly evaluated. MKR voters can then decide if the potential benefits of a strategy are sufficient to offset risk of loss. The below spreadsheet offers a simple tool to help compare strategy tail risks against expected returns or benefits. Estimated loss distributions are collected into an annualized charge off rate / risk premium, which can then be deducted against yields to calculate an expected risk adjusted return for a strategy. This methodology is somewhat subjective (users must arbitrarily assign probabilities based on their best available information and judgment) but it can still be helpful in translating general concepts of risk into numerical figures. Tail Risk Evaluation Tool How to use the tool:  The sheet is view-only, so start by making a copy using the option under the \u201cFile\u201d menu For each row (eg. \u201cIncrease in Maker Tech Risk\u201d or \u201cDomain / Bridge Risk\u201d), enter an expected yearly probability for each possible loss rate between 10% and 100%; the 0% loss column will automatically calculate based on other entries The blue column beside \u201cSum of Risk Exposure\u201d represents the annualized loss rate estimate (similar to risk premium) based on provided inputs  In addition to ensuring risk adjusted returns are adequate, Maker should also maintain sufficient capital in the surplus buffer to cover possible losses from any significant strategy risks (eg. risk of bridge failure). Makershire\u2019s proposed assets of $10 million is currently well within Maker\u2019s capacity to absorb losses.  Strategy Reviews Below are brief reviews of the risk factors impacting each proposed strategy.  Ethereum G-UNI DAI USDC 0.01% and 0.05% Uniswap v3 is a highly reliable defi protocol, and risk of hacks can be considered to be near zero. Gelato contracts are also fairly battle tested, with months of successful operation holding hundreds of millions in assets. This integration would likely require limited new Maker contract infrastructure, and would also not be exposed to cross chain bridges or external validators/sequencers. Quoted yields represent the fully leveraged return of using the GUNI vaults. This means that for each 1 million of treasury assets invested, this would generate an additional 50 million DAI worth of exposure; assuming constant DAI demand, these additional assets would likely cause partial displacement of the PSM (PSM exposure declines as GUNI exposure increases). All component assets are USD stablecoins, so there is no market risk. The position would be exposed to USDC credit risk, but this can be considered fairly low (USDC is backed by \u201crisk free\u201d investments including bank deposits and short term treasury bills, with frequent audits). This position would likely displace USDC PSM exposure, but because 50% of the GUNI position is held in DAI but still faces potential downside risk on the full position if USDC depegged, the total USDC exposure per unit of DAI demand met is roughly 2x higher for GUNI DAIUSDC vaults vs USDC PSM. To give a simplified example: assume a total supply of 100 DAI, 50% backed by overcollateralized ETH vaults and 50% backed by USDC PSM. If Maker onboards G-UNI DAIUSDC as collateral, and the vault sees 10 DAI minted while total market demand for DAI remains unchanged at 100 DAI, this should result in the following ending balances: 105 total DAI supply, 50 DAI from ETH, 10 DAI from G-UNI, and 45 DAI from USDC-PSM. Total exposure to USDC has increased by 5 DAI, because the entire 10 DAI minted from G-UNI comprises credit risk exposure to USDC, but only supplies the market with 5 DAI (the other 5 DAI is held within the LP token). Summary:  Minimal Maker technical risk Minimal defi protocol risk No domain or bridge risk No volatile asset market risk Exposure to USDC credit risk: Each 1 million DAI in funds committed increases portfolio level USDC credit risk exposure by ~$25 million (assumes 50x leverage vault is used)   Optimism and Arbitrum Uniswap v3 DAI USDC 0.05% These positions share significant similarities with the above GUNI positions. There is no exposure to market risk from volatile assets. The positions are significantly exposed to USDC credit risk, and due to 50% DAI holdings could increase total USDC exposure of the Maker portfolio somewhat. Uniswap presents minimal risk, but Maker may need to use relatively less tested mechanisms to control these positions on external domains. While Optimism and Arbitrum are both Ethereum L2s, they are still in a guarded phase of development. The teams control admin access to upgrade bridge contracts, which could lead to a total loss of funds if they were compromised. Additionally, both platforms use a single sequencer and neither have fully functional fraud proofs available, which increases risk of significant downtime or invalid state transitions. In a worst case scenario this could also cause permanent loss of funds. Summary:  Some Maker technical risk Minimal defi protocol risk Some domain and bridge risk, likely to decline over time as roadmaps progress No volatile asset market risk Exposure to USDC credit risk   Ethereum Uniswap v3 DAI ETH 0.05% and 0.3% Exposure to ETH market risk (and divergence loss) makes this strategy considerably more likely to result in capital losses versus stablecoin LP strategies. For full range strategies (equivalent to Uniswap v2 exposure), the LP value would change proportional to the square root of ETH price change. For concentrated strategies, delta with respect to ETH would vary between 0 (when price is above range maximum) and 1 (when ETH price is below range minimum), but downside market risk would never be more than holding an equivalent value of ETH directly. However, concentrated liquidity strategies would face amplified divergence/impermanent loss. Additionally, management of the position may require significant operational and technical work. Generally a full range or static range strategy would be simpler to manage and is likely to involve lower operational and technical risk vs a dynamic strategy that frequently shifts liquidity. However, static or full range strategies may also receive lower yield due to less concentrated liquidity or the possibility of price moving out of range. Certain third party protocols offer dynamic liquidity management as a service, but they would significantly increase protocol risk and may not have a proven track record of outperforming static strategies. Summary:  Maker technical risk depends on liquidity strategy; minimal risk for static strategy, moderate risk for dynamic strategy Minimal defi protocol risk; risk would increase if using a third party liquidity manager No domain or bridge risk Significant market risk (but never more than holding equivalent value of ETH directly) No stablecoin credit risk   Optimism and Arbitrum Uniswap v3 DAI ETH 0.3% The risk considerations for these strategies are similar to above. In addition, this would likely face somewhat higher Maker technical risk (for mechanisms to control assets on the external domain) as well as bridge and domain risk exposure to Arbitrum and Optimism. Summary:  Maker technical risk depends on liquidity strategy; low risk for static strategy, moderate risk for dynamic strategy Minimal defi protocol risk; risk would increase if using a third party liquidity manager Some domain and bridge risk, likely to decline over time as roadmaps progress Significant market risk (but never more than holding equivalent value of ETH directly) No stablecoin credit risk   Ethereum Uniswap v3 MKR ETH 0.05% An MKR ETH pool strategy would face similar technical and operational risk factors as the Ethereum DAI ETH strategy. But market risk would be significantly greater, as both component assets are volatile (instead of \u00bd volatile asset exposure). Additionally, the price of MKR (and to a lesser extent ETH) is correlated with Maker protocol business conditions, which means the value of this position could decline significantly in a case where the protocol faced losses and needed to utilize reserves. There is also significantly increased operational risks of using a dynamic liquidity strategy for this pair. Shifting liquidity ranges could create the appearance of a conflict of interest or trading on non public information. Summary:  Maker technical risk depends on liquidity strategy; low risk for static strategy, high risk for dynamic strategy Significant operational risk for dynamic liquidity strategy using MKR token Minimal defi protocol risk; risk would increase if using a third party liquidity manager No domain or bridge risk High market risk, and increased risk correlation with Maker\u2019s general business conditions No stablecoin credit risk   Reconciling Proposal Goals The Makershire Redux proposal includes two broad goals: generate yield using idle protocol assets, and increase DAI liquidity and utility. These goals are not necessarily fully aligned with each other. The strategies with the best risk adjusted return may provide only negligible benefits to DAI liquidity (eg. Uniswap v3 Ethereum strategies where there is already plenty of liquidity), while strategies providing most utility for DAI may have low or even negative risk adjusted return and/or unpredictable exposure to volatile assets. In cases where DAI utility is the primary goal of a strategy and returns are low (or negative when adjusting for reasonably expected tail risks), it may be more effective for Maker to simply pay liquidity incentives rather than deploy our balance sheet assets. In some cases (eg Optimism) Maker may be able to influence significant additional incentives from partner domain or defi protocol teams. This could also reduce utilization of key engineering resources, which frees up capacity to pursue other opportunities. This forum post on multichain liquidity strategy may be relevant, as well as the Growth CU\u2019s application for OP co-inventives. Positions involving MKR liquidity may be better addressed in the context of general MKR buyback strategy (eg. flap auctions, dss kiln, etc). For example, this article from 2020 advocated replacing buyback and burn with LP token accumulation (\u201cbuyback and make\u201d). ",

With all due respect, speaking as a (mostly self-proclaimed) domain expert, I would assert that the centralization risks of L2s and multisigs should rule their usage out entirely for MKR holders. Each L2 and sidechain has a multisig with unknown signers in unknown jurisdictions with unprovable security. These multisigs are capable of changing any aspect of the chain - including wiping out token balances, reversing transactions and rolling back the entire network state. Moving protocol-owned funds to any of these L2/sidechains would involve reckless trust in the complete unknown. With USDC, we know we have to trust Circle.

                    "content": "(following are my personal opinions) The risk situation for multisig bridges is not great. However, Arbitrum and Optimism are both headed towards full decentralization and inheritance of Ethereum security. Once key safeguards are in place and proven out (decentralized bridge contracts, fraud proofs, etc), I imagine your position would shift and be more willing to integrate with these domains. But if we wait until that point to even begin integrating, it is likely that we will be hopelessly far behind from a business/market share perspective and it will be extremely costly and maybe even impossible to attain minimum necessary utility and liquidity for DAI. If we can take limited risks (small enough capital commitment that we could survive the small chance of total failure) that help bridge this gap and support DAI liquidity in the interim, I think this could be a good risk/reward and push DAI further towards a sustainable, highly decentralized end state. If on the other hand we forgo L2s until they are in a fully decentralized state, there\u2019s a real risk DAI will never achieve a sustainable scale and we\u2019ll all be stuck using centralized stablecoins. I somewhat agree with you on L2 risks, but rather than not putting any funds at risk, I think we should focus on not risking more than we\u2019re willing (and can afford) to lose. ",

Yes, absolutely.     monet-supply:  I somewhat agree with you on L2 risks, but rather than not putting any funds at risk, I think we should focus on not risking more than we\u2019re willing (and can afford) to lose.   Then why aren\u2019t we taking the same approach with TradFi? For RWA vaults, we have massive legal agreements. Why? Because real-world institutions can screw us. They can steal, they can freeze, they can cheat. Without the legal agreement, we\u2019d be crazy to give them the DAO\u2019s money. How is this different with L2s or sidechains? Yes, they are transparent. So at least we\u2019d know as soon as they lost the DAO\u2019s funds. But by then, the DAO\u2019s funds are lost\u2026 or stolen\u2026 or hacked. Would we forego a legal agreement with a bank just because they gave us full real-time visibility into our account? No. An L2 or sidechain with a god-mode multisig has the capability of doing whatever it wants with DAO funds at any moment it chooses. The security of funds on these networks relies solely on the integrity of the multisig and the humans with the signing keys. So, why doesn\u2019t an L2 or sidechain with a god-mode multisig warrant the same level of legal protection as a TradFi institution? We can\u2019t just rely on the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d of DeFi devs for the security of MakerDAO-owned funds. We need to be rational, logical and prudent. If we are going to entrust protocol-owned funds to an L2 or sidechain with a multisig that has unknown owners in unknown jurisdictions with unprovable security, then we need legally binding agreements with those multisig signers and the company behind the network we\u2019re dealing with to protect the interests of MKR holders. Anything less would be reckless. I\u2019d encourage anyone with a legal background (i.e. @SESLegalResearch) to explain to me if and how I\u2019m wrong here by comparing L2s/sidechains to banks & real-world institutions in this way.

Our view is that the risks of not proceeding with providing liquidity on L2s and losing market share to new stablecoins being launched by competitors (e.g. AAVE, Curve) who have fully deployed their projects on L2s are much higher.   Will Makershire be treating multisig-secured L2s and sidechains with the same or greater level of scrutiny as it does with TradFi institutions that have far more oversight & safety precautions? If not, then how does Makershire justify entrusting funds owned by MKR holders with completely unknown multisig signers in unknown jurisdictions and unknown security? Just saying \u201cwe have to take risks\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. Again, we need to look at this through the same lens as we do with TradFi. Anything less is just hypocritical. ",
