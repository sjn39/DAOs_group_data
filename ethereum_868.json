With Geth 1.9 also adding a Prometheus endpoint to expose its metrics, it seems like it would be worthwhile agreeing on standard names for a few of the core metrics like current chain height and peer count. It\u2019s a minor thing but makes it easier to use a single dashboard to monitor nodes using different clients. I\u2019ll write this up as an informational EIP if no-one screams too loudly. Eth 2.0 an informative spec for metrics at https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-metrics/blob/master/metrics.md though I\u2019m inclined to be even less prescriptive and basically just define the metrics, omitting anything about how to configure the client. I\u2019d suggest metrics for:  Current chain height: ethereum_block_number  Best known block number (similar to highestBlock from eth_syncing JSON-RPC but would be the current chain head when not syncing rather than null): ethereum_best_known_block_number  Current peer count: ethereum_peer_count   Them names for metrics around CPU and memory usage tend to be pretty standard so those metrics enable almost the entire dashboard I\u2019ve been using which is a really nice overview. You can generate quite a useful dashboard with just those.  There are also some for fast sync (pivot block, number of times pivot block change, downloaded world state, known world state remaining) which may be worth setting some standard names for even though they won\u2019t apply to every client. And there will always be a ton of very client specific metrics which we shouldn\u2019t even attempt to standardise. ",

I left this on the PR as well but for people following along here: This is something that clients would implement, but exactly how they integrate with Prometheus is up to them - there are a few ways a client and Prometheus could be configured to work together and no real benefit in trying to standardise it. What is useful is if a client is sending metrics to Prometheus (via whatever means), that these few properties have the same names and meanings.  Then you can create a dashboard like https://grafana.com/api/dashboards/10273/images/6473/image to monitor groups of nodes. I\u2019m not exactly sure what category this should go under.  Interface is a possibility and would definitely be the case if it were standardising how to integrate with Prometheus.  I\u2019ve put it as Informational here because its essentially a recommended convention. It\u2019s not trying to be the definitive spec on metrics for clients and its entirely optional whether clients choose to support it or not. It\u2019s just a little more convenient if they do. I don\u2019t mind which category it winds up in though. ",

I will address each point separately below but mostly these seem to boil down to needing a list of Ethereum clients which I don\u2019t believe should be required in an EIP. For example the Chain ID opcode spec being included in Istanbul and in final status makes no attempt to list the clients which would be required to implement it or which have previously implemented a EIP-155 chain ID.     fulldecent:  Inline links should be moved to the bottom of the document.

I\u2019m unable to find any such requirement for EIP formatting and it reduces readability by separating the links from the content they apply to.     fulldecent:   What is a Prometheus Metrics Names?    There is a link provided to the Prometheus website which provides additional information and documentation. However, it seems reasonable to expect at least a minimum level of understanding of Prometheus here and is clearly understandable when reading the EIP in full.     fulldecent:   \u201cMany Ethereum clients expose a range of metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus\u201d \u2013 which clients?

The aim of this section is to identify potential backwards compatibility issues, which this statement does by itself. Claiming that no clients are affected by the issue would need to be justified, but merely pointing out the potential compatibility issue doesn\u2019t need further justification, it is simply a statement of fact.     fulldecent:   Assertions are made on behalf of other implementations: \u201cClients that want to avoid this incompatibility can expose the metrics under both the old and new names.\u201d However no other clients are referenced and nobody is available to retort this statement.    As mentioned above, I don\u2019t believe the EIP needs to provide a list of Ethereum clients.  The point of final call is to raise the level of attention so that any technical concerns can be raised. If you are aware of reasons this would not mitigate the backward incompatibility that would be good to hear.     fulldecent:  In general this EIP is a prescription written by one vendor to specify \u201chere is how I am doing something, other people may be doing it differently, they should change\u201d.   I believe this is an unfair characterisation of this EIP. The EIP was inspired by the ETH2 beacon chain metrics spec and is not simply a listing of the metrics that Pantheon exposed. Pantheon metrics had to be changed to match this EIP.     fulldecent:  At this time, for the reasons above, I believe this document is proper to be published as a technical note for the vendor\u2019s product documentation, but it does not meet the technical acceptability standards to be published as a final EIP standard.   The issues you\u2019ve raised appear to be entirely editorial in nature.  There\u2019s no concern raised that suggests the spec is insufficient for clients to implement, no additional backwards compatibility concerns raised etc. I certainly agree that for this EIP to actually have value it needs to be widely adopted by clients, but publishing a technical note in a single client\u2019s documentation can\u2019t achieve that. It requires a common specification that can be pointed to and clients can follow which is what EIPs are designed to achieve. ",

There are quite a few final EIPs that use inline links (EIP-165, EIP-137, EIP-6, EIP-1167, EIP-1344, EIP-1283 and interestingly ERC-1155 does it both ways).  I\u2019ve brought it up in the EIPs Gitter mostly because it seems like it would be useful to have a clear style guide to point to.     fulldecent:  Will you please provide a link to explain what Prometheus Metrics Names are?   I\u2019m happy to provide additional information but I must admit I\u2019m rather struggling to know how to explain it any further without just sounding contrite.  A Prometheus Metric Name is the name assigned to a metric reported to Prometheus.  But that\u2019s essentially what the simple summary already says. Admittedly that section has not come through the editing process particularly well. It should, and has been fixed to, read: Standardized names of common metrics for Ethereum clients to use with Prometheus, a widely used monitoring and alerting solution. If that\u2019s insufficient, could you propose some wording that would make it clearer?     fulldecent:  It is not possible for me or anybody to evaluate the backwards incompatibility issues based only on the information in the EIP because there is insufficient references to prior art to be backwards incompatible with. In other words, the EIP does not stand on its own. This is a technical deficiency of complying with the EIP process and is grounds to not promote to final status.   I think this is the crux of the desire to list clients, but I believe the logic is flawed.  Reasoning about backwards compatibility shouldn\u2019t be based only on the information in the EIP, and it isn\u2019t for other EIPs. Where there are known backwards compatibility issues, they are listed in the EIP but the review of the EIP necessarily uses outside knowledge to determine if there are other potential compatibility issues which have been missed. EIP-1 does not require an EIP to include a complete list of implementations that may be affected, merely to identify a description of any backwards compatibility: From EIP-1:  An EIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.  and:  Backwards Compatibility - All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.  Notably, the description of the proposed enhancement has to be complete, but the backward compatibility section simply lists the incompatibilities, not a complete list of clients which might implement or be affected by the change.  You can see this in practice by how rarely clients other than Parity and Geth are mentioned despite the fact that they are heavily affected by a huge range of EIPs and even Parity and Geth are typically only mentioned as clients that have implemented the changes.

Reading above, it appears there was some feedback around Backward Compatibility, and while EIP authors are encouraged to heed community and editor feedback I don\u2019t believe this particular feedback is a blocker for merging to Final if the author decides to. @ajsutton Can you submit a PR to move this to either Final or Abandoned?  On a personal note (not as an Editor) I think the backward compatibility section is fine in general.  There may be value in mentioning the possibility that a client is exposing one of the metrics but with a different meaning, perhaps with a recommendation on how to transition between the previous definition and the new definition.
