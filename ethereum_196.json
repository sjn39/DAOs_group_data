                    "content": "There are currently a large number of (optimistic and ZK) rollup projects, at various stages of development. One pattern that is common to almost all of them is the use of temporary training wheels: while a project\u2019s tech is still immature, the project launches early anyway to allow the ecosystem to start forming, but instead of relying fully on its fraud proofs or ZK proofs, there is some kind of multisig that has the ability to force a particular outcome in case there are bugs in the code. L2beat\u2019s risk analysis page shows a large amount of stats about various rollups, including the status of their training wheels:    l2beat.com    L2BEAT \u2013 The state of the layer two ecosystem L2BEAT is an analytics and research website about Ethereum layer 2 scaling. Here you will find in depth comparison of major protocols live on Ethereum today.      However, as of today this information is not well-standardized, making it difficult for users to understand what specific trust model a particular rollup is using. Rollup teams may even have the incentive to keep quiet about their present-day trust model, focusing the discussion instead on the fully-trustless tomorrow. This post proposes a simple milestone-based schema to help us categorize rollups into three different stages, depending on how heavily they rely on their training wheels. This is intended to achieve a few goals:  Make it easier for users to identify the extent to which a particular rollup depends on \u201ctrust in a specific group of humans\u201d vs \u201ctrust in code\u201d Help motivate rollup projects to improve on their trust models, reducing the risk that trust minimization gets deprioritized because it is \u201cless visible\u201d than eg. flashy UX improvements Give the ecosystem some precise milestones to coordinate around and celebrate, letting us say when \u201cThe Surge\u201d is half-complete or fully complete, paralleling \u201cThe Merge\u201d  This schema is NOT intended to imply a moral judgement that movement to maximum trust in code as quickly as possible is the only correct course of action. Rollups absolutely should have a clear roadmap to taking off training wheels, but they should take training wheels off only when they are ready.  The Schema  Stage 0: full training wheels Requirements:  The project should call itself a rollup. All rollup transactions should go on-chain. There should exist a \u201crollup full node\u201d: an independently runnable software package that can read the L1 chain, extract and the rollup chain, and compute the current state of the rollup chain. If it disagrees with a rollup state root posted into the contract, it should give an alarm. There should be machinery that allows users to either post rollup transactions or at least ensure a withdrawal of their assets with no cooperation from the operator. That is, the operator cannot freeze or steal users\u2019 assets by censoring users; their only possible tool for doing so must be to post a false state root. It\u2019s okay if the on-chain mechanism for posting new state roots is simply a multisig, with no active fraud proof or validity proof whatsoever.   Stage 1: limited training wheels Requirements:  There must be a running fraud proof or validity proof scheme, which has the practical authority to accept or reject which state roots get accepted by the rollup contract. There can exist a multisig-based override mechanism (\u201csecurity council\u201d) that can override the fraud proof or validity proof system\u2019s outputs and post state roots, to be used in case the proof system code is bugged. However:  The multisig must be 6 of 8 or stricter (that is, >= 8 participants AND >= 75% threshold) At least a quorum-blocking group (that is, enough participants to prevent the multisig from acting) must be outside the organization that is running the rollup.   There can exist an upgrade mechanism, but if it has a lower threshold than the multisig, upgrades must have a mandatory activation delay of at least 7 days or the maximum length of the fraud proof game, whichever is longer. The goal of this rule is to ensure that the upgrade mechanism cannot be used to intervene in real-time disputes.   Stage 2: no training wheels Requirements:  In the event that code does not have bugs, there must not be any group of actors that can, even unanimously, post a state root other than the output of the code   This somewhat awkward phrasing (\u201cIF the code does not have bugs, THEN no one can override it\u201d) is meant to permit use of security councils in ways that are clearly limited to adjudicating undeniable bugs, such as the following:  The rollup uses two or more independent implementations of its state transition function (eg. two distinct fraud provers, two distinct validity provers, or one of each), and the security council can adjudicate only if they disagree - which would only happen if there is a bug If someone submits a transaction or series of transactions that contains two valid proofs for two distinct state roots after processing the same data (ie. \u201cthe prover disagrees with itself\u201d), control temporarily turns over to the security council If no valid proof is submitted for >= 7 days (ie. \u201cthe prover is stuck\u201d), control temporarily turns over to the security council Upgrades are allowed, but must have a delay of >= 30 days  ",

Agree that it would be very useful to have a defined framework for rollup classification as they progress through various stages of training wheels. From the Coinbase perspective, this would be a valuable resources for presenting our users with a standardized risk assessment as they interact and move assets across different rollups. We would be excited to collaborate on fleshing this out and making this a resource that can be standardized across the broader ecosystem. As currently specified, this seems like a reasonable v0 that we can expand on. One additional requirement I might suggest would be to encode something about the fraud proof or validity proof mechanism being available in such a way (e.g open source) that it can be reviewed by 3rd parties.

                    "content": "Like @jessepollak said, I think this is a good v0 proposal that would benefit the entire rollup ecosystem. As more and more assets are held in rollups, it\u2019s becoming increasingly important for users to have a clear understanding of the security model of the system they\u2019re using. A standardized security framework is going to be a key part of this. My primary feedback is that there are \u201cnice to haves\u201d that aren\u2019t necessarily covered by a framework like this that can have a real impact on the overall security of the network. For example, the ability to easily preview and upgrade and understand its implications can be the deciding factor between a bug slipping through and a secure system. Of course, that\u2019s not strictly required but, like I said, it\u2019s a nice to have that has a real impact. IMO a good v1 version of a framework like this looks sort of like a tech/skill tree. You have specific key requirements that are necessary for advancement to the next stage but you can also unlock bonus items that give you \u201cpoints\u201d but aren\u2019t requirements for advancement. You might be able to extend this model by assigning points and required features such that the requirement for advancement is X number of points and some set of necessary features. Assigning points also reflects the relative value of different features (especially non-critical features) and can help teams prioritize their work. I\u2019d really like to see comments on this proposal from other rollup teams so we can start to build consensus. Generally, the sooner the better with a framework like this. Rollup risk is only increasing and this is a critical first step in pushing rollups towards real security. ",

On one hand, we have the main security technology - validity proofs - turned on from the get go, we\u2019ve never submitted a state update to StarkNet without having a STARK proof for it (same holds for all StarkEx systems). So that maps to somewhere between Step 1 and 2 (currently our upgrade period is less than 30 days, so not Step 2). On the other hand, we have decided to deploy decentralized operation at the sequencer+prover level at the very end. Roughly, the steps we\u2019re taking are thus:   Functionality - i.e., having the basic structure of the system, accounts, format, state, fees, etc. This has been completed (well, there\u2019s Cairo 1.0 and regenesis but it\u2019s a soft one, meaning the system is already functional)  Performance - this is where we\u2019re at now, and it means increasing TPS.  Decentralization - having decentralized everything - provers, sequencers, etc.  The main reason we followed this path is to move fast. Easier to solve functionality and performance when the operators are not yet decentralized. ",

To give folks some idea, with the current framework:   Stage 0 rollups: Optimism (missing FPs),   Stage 1 rollups: Arbitrum (FPs are behind a whitelist) + with small adjustments to msig structure zkSync v1 and dYdX could be listed here,   Stage 2 rollups: Fuel v1,   Here\u2019s a (very) quick mockup of how we could present such info to the user:  image2300\u00d7618 197 KB  Few points:  IMO naming should indicate that \u201cStage 2\u201d is final and desired.

It would definitely be much clearer to newbies than the current risk framework, which has excellent info but doesn\u2019t really help users understand which properties are more important. Though perhaps rename \u201cstage\u201d to something clearer like \u201csecurity level\u201d. And happy to accept alternate namings, tier etc.   In Stage 0, \u201crollup full node\u201d for zk rollups might not meet this criteria as often zk rollups don\u2019t push all tx on chain but only state diffs.   Ooh, good point. I guess there are a few paths to take:  Accept that for rollups that only publish state diffs, a \u201cfull node\u201d would just play the state diffs to compute the current state The rollup must offer a ZK-SNARK verifier that attempts to verify that there are valid transactions that created the transitions, though it\u2019s ok if it\u2019s not \u201cplugged in\u201d and these SNARKs are only published with a delay Make the decision that rollups that only publish state diffs are \u201cnot rollups\u201d until they get to stage 1  I\u2019m inclined to lean toward (1) particularly if we brand \u201cstage 0\u201d as \u201cunder construction\u201d, because then users would understand that that\u2019s what stage 0 means and it has very few guarantees. But something like (2) could work too. Maybe survey the ZK-EVM teams on this to get their views? ",
