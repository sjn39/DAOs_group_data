GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST IS GIVEN AND ACCEPTED ON THE FOLLOWING TERMS . Borrower does hereby mortgage, pledge, grant, convey and assign to Lender, the Collateral to secure to Lender the payment of the Indebtedness and all amounts secured by this Agreement as they become due and except as otherwise provided, Borrower shall strictly and in a timely manner, perform all of Borrower\u2019s obligations under the Indebtedness and this Agreement. Borrower hereby absolutely assigns to Lender all of Borrower\u2019s right, title and interest in and to all present and future payments from the Property. In addition, Borrower grants Lender a Uniform Commercial Code security interest in the Collateral. The rights of the Lender stated in this Agreement with respect to the Collateral are in addition to all other rights which Lender may have by law. TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Collateral unto the Lender, its successors and assigns, forever. COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION. The word \u201cCollateral\u201d as used in this Agreement means the following described property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and wherever located, in which Grantor is giving to Lender a security interest for the payment of the Indebtedness and performance of all other obligations under the Note and this Agreement: All equipment, machinery, fixtures, goods, inventory, accounts (including but not limited to all loan receivables), deposit accounts, money, general intangibles, documents, documents of title, instruments (including but not limited to all promissory notes), letter-of-credit rights, letters of credit, documents, deposit accounts, investment property, money, other rights to payment and performance, and general intangibles (including but not limited to all software and all payment intangibles) and chattel paper, as those terms are defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code, all attachments, accessions, accessories, fittings, increases, tools, parts, repairs, supplies, and commingled goods relating to the foregoing property, and all additions, replacements of and substitutions for all or any part of the foregoing property; all insurance refunds relating to the foregoing property; all good will relating to the foregoing property; all records and data and embedded software relating to the foregoing property, and all equipment, inventory and software to utilize, create, maintain and process any such records and data on electronic media; and all supporting obligations relating to the foregoing property; all whether now existing or hereafter arising, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or whether now or hereafter subject to any rights in the foregoing property; all products and proceeds (including but not limited to all insurance payments) of or relating to the foregoing property; and all proceeds of any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, proceeds of any voluntary or involuntary disposition or claim respecting any thereof (pursuant to judgment, condemnation award or otherwise) and all goods, documents, instruments, general intangibles, chattel paper and accounts, wherever located, acquired with cash proceeds of any of the foregoing or proceeds thereof. In addition, the word \u201cCollateral\u201d includes all the following, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and wherever located: (A) All accessions, attachments, accessories, tools, parts, supplies, replacements of and additions to any of the collateral described herein, whether added now or later. (B) All products and produce of any of the property described in this Collateral section. (C) All accounts, general intangibles, instruments, rents, monies, payments, and all other rights, arising out of a sale, lease, consignment or other disposition of any of the property described in this Collateral section. (D) All proceeds (including insurance proceeds) from the sale, destruction, loss, or other disposition of any of the property described in this Collateral section, and sums due from a third party who has damaged or destroyed the Collateral or from that party\u2019s insurer, whether due to judgment, settlement or other process. (E) All records and data relating to any of the property described in this Collateral section, whether in the form of a writing, photograph, microfilm, microfiche, or electronic media, together with all of Grantor\u2019s right, title, and interest in and to all computer software required to utilize, create, maintain, and process any such records or data on electronic media. Despite any other provision of this Agreement, Lender is not granted, and will not have, a nonpurchase money security interest in household goods, to the extent such a security interest would be prohibited by applicable law. In addition, if because of the type of any Property, Lender is required to give a notice of the right to cancel under Truth in Lending for the Indebtedness, then Lender will not have a security interest in such Collateral unless and until such a notice is given. GRANTOR\u2019S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL. With respect to the Collateral, Grantor represents and promises to Lender that: Perfection of Security Interest. Grantor agrees to take whatever actions are requested by Lender to perfect and continue Lender\u2019s security interest in the Collateral. Upon request of Lender, Grantor will deliver to Lender any and all of the documents evidencing or constituting the Collateral, and Grantor will note Lender\u2019s interest upon any and all chattel paper and instruments if not delivered to Lender for possession by Lender. Notices to Lender. Grantor will promptly notify Lender in writing at Lender\u2019s address shown herein (or such other addresses as Lender may designate from time to time) prior to any (1) change in Grantor\u2019s name; (2) change in Grantor\u2019s assumed business name; (3) change in the management of the Corporation Grantor; (4) change in the authorized signer(s); (5) change in Grantor\u2019s principal office address; (6) change in Grantor\u2019s state of organization; (7) conversion of Grantor to a new or different type of business entity; or (8) change in any other aspect of Grantor that directly or indirectly relates to any agreements between Grantor and Lender. No change in Grantor\u2019s name or state of organization will take effect until after Lender has received notice. No Violation. The execution and delivery of this Agreement will not violate any law or agreement governing Grantor or to which Grantor is a party, and its certificate or articles of formation and governance documents do not prohibit any term or condition of this Agreement. Enforceability of Collateral. To the extent the Collateral consists of accounts, chattel paper, or general intangibles, as defined by the Uniform Commercial Code, the Collateral is enforceable in accordance with its terms, is genuine, and fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations concerning form, content and manner of preparation and execution, and all persons appearing to be obligated on the Collateral have authority and capacity to contract and are in fact obligated as they appear to be on the Collateral. At the time any account becomes subject to a security interest in favor of Lender, the account shall be a good and valid account representing an undisputed, bona fide indebtedness incurred by the account debtor, for merchandise held subject to delivery instructions or previously shipped or delivered pursuant to a contract of sale, or for services previously performed by Grantor with or for the account debtor. So long as this Agreement remains in effect, Grantor shall not, without Lender\u2019s prior written consent, compromise, settle, adjust, or extend payment under or with regard to any such Accounts. There shall be no setoffs or counterclaims against any of the Collateral, and no agreement shall have been made under which any deductions or discounts may be claimed concerning the Collateral except those disclosed to Lender in writing. Location of the Collateral. Except in the ordinary course of Grantor\u2019s business, Grantor agrees to keep the Collateral (or to the extent the Collateral consists of intangible property such as accounts or general intangibles, the records concerning the Collateral) at Grantor\u2019s address shown herein or at such other locations as are acceptable to Lender. Upon Lender\u2019s request, Grantor will deliver to Lender in form satisfactory to Lender a schedule of real properties and Collateral locations relating to Grantor\u2019s operations, including without limitation the following: (1) all real property Grantor owns or is purchasing; (2) all real property Grantor is renting or leasing; (3) all storage facilities Grantor owns, rents, leases, or uses; and (4) all other properties where Collateral is or may be located. Removal of the Collateral. Except in the ordinary course of Grantor\u2019s business, including the sales of inventory, Grantor shall not remove the Collateral from its existing location without Lender\u2019s prior written consent. To the extent that the Collateral consists of vehicles or other titled property, Grantor shall not take or permit any action which would require application for certificates of title outside the State of Delaware, without Lender\u2019s prior written consent. Grantor shall, whenever requested, advise Lender of the exact location of the Collateral. Transactions Involving Collateral. Except for inventory sold or accounts collected in the ordinary course of Grantor\u2019s business, or as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Grantor shall not sell, offer to sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Collateral. While Grantor is not in default under this Agreement, Grantor may sell inventory, but only in the ordinary course of its business and only to buyers who qualify as a buyer in the ordinary course of business. A sale in the ordinary course of Grantor\u2019s business does not include a transfer in partial or total satisfaction of a debt or any bulk sale. Grantor shall not pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise permit the Collateral to be subject to any lien, security interest, encumbrance, or charge, other than the security interest provided for in this Agreement or Loan Agreement, without the prior written consent of Lender. This includes security interests even if junior in right to the security interests granted under this Agreement. Unless waived by Lender, all proceeds from any disposition of the Collateral (for whatever reason) shall be held in trust for Lender and shall not be commingled with any other funds; provided however, this requirement shall not constitute consent by Lender to any sale or other disposition. Upon receipt, Grantor shall immediately deliver any such proceeds to Lender. Title. Grantor represents and warrants to Lender that Grantor holds good and marketable title to the Collateral, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except for the lien of this Agreement. No financing statement covering any of the Collateral is on file in any public office other than those which reflect the security interest created by this Agreement or to which Lender has specifically consented. Grantor shall defend Lender\u2019s rights in the Collateral against the claims and demands of all other persons. Inspection of Collateral. Lender and Lender\u2019s designated representatives and agents shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine and inspect the Collateral wherever located. Taxes, Assessments and Liens. Grantor will pay when due all taxes, assessments and liens upon the Collateral, its use or operation, upon this Agreement, upon any promissory note or notes evidencing the Indebtedness, or upon any of the other Related Documents. Grantor may withhold any such payment or may elect to contest any lien if Grantor is in good faith conducting an appropriate proceeding to contest the obligation to pay and so long as Lender\u2019s interest in the Collateral is not jeopardized in Lender\u2019s sole opinion. If the Collateral is subjected to a lien which is not discharged within fifteen (15) days, Grantor shall deposit with Lender cash, a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security satisfactory to Lender in an amount adequate to provide for the discharge of the lien plus any interest, costs, attorneys\u2019 fees or other charges that could accrue as a result of foreclosure or sale of the Collateral. In any contest Grantor shall defend itself and Lender and shall satisfy any final adverse judgment before enforcement against the Collateral. Grantor shall name Lender as an additional obligee under any surety bond furnished in the contest proceedings. Grantor further agrees to furnish Lender with evidence that such taxes, assessments, and governmental and other charges have been paid in full and in a timely manner. Grantor may withhold any such payment or may elect to contest any lien if Grantor is in good faith conducting an appropriate proceeding to contest the obligation to pay and so long as Lender\u2019s interest in the Collateral is not jeopardized. Compliance with Governmental Requirements. Grantor shall comply promptly with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities, now or hereafter in effect, applicable to the ownership, production, disposition, or use of the Collateral, including all laws or regulations relating to the undue erosion of highly-erodible land or relating to the conversion of wetlands for the production of an agricultural product or commodity. Grantor may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance or regulation and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Lender\u2019s interest in the Collateral, in Lender\u2019s opinion, is not jeopardized. Hazardous Substances. Grantor represents and warrants that the Collateral never has been, and never will be so long as this Agreement remains a lien on the Collateral, used in violation of any Environmental Laws or for the generation, manufacture, storage, transportation, treatment, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance. The representations and warranties contained herein are based on Grantor\u2019s due diligence in investigating the Collateral for Hazardous Substances. Grantor hereby (1) releases and waives any future claims against Lender for indemnity or contribution in the event Grantor becomes liable for cleanup or other costs under any Environmental Laws, and (2) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Lender against any and all claims and losses resulting from a breach of this provision of this Agreement. This obligation to indemnify shall survive the payment of the Indebtedness and the satisfaction of this Agreement. [Conform to Underlying Loan Portfolio] Maintenance of Casualty Insurance. Grantor shall procure and maintain all risks insurance, including without limitation fire, theft and liability coverage together with such other insurance as Lender may require with respect to the Collateral, in form, amounts, coverages and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender and issued by a company or companies reasonably acceptable to Lender. Grantor, upon request of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least ten (10) days\u2019 prior written notice to Lender and not including any disclaimer of the insurer\u2019s liability for failure to give such a notice. Each insurance policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or default of Grantor or any other person. In connection with all policies covering assets in which Lender holds or is offered a security interest, Grantor will provide Lender with such loss payable or other endorsements as Lender may require. If Grantor at any time fails to obtain or maintain any insurance as required under this Agreement, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) obtain such insurance as Lender deems appropriate, including if Lender so chooses \u201csingle interest insurance,\u201d which will cover only Lender\u2019s interest in the Collateral. Application of Insurance Proceeds. Grantor shall promptly notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Collateral. Lender may make proof of loss if Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty. All proceeds of any insurance on the Collateral, including accrued proceeds thereon, shall be held by Lender as part of the Collateral. If Lender consents to repair or replacement of the damaged or destroyed Collateral, Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of expenditure, pay or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration. If Lender does not consent to repair or replacement of the Collateral, Lender shall retain a sufficient amount of the proceeds to pay all of the Indebtedness and shall pay the balance to Grantor. Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within six (6) months after their receipt and which Grantor has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Collateral shall be used to prepay the Indebtedness. Insurance Reserves. Lender may require Grantor to maintain with Lender reserves for payment of insurance premiums, which reserves shall be created by monthly payments from Grantor of a sum estimated by Lender to be sufficient to produce, at least fifteen (15) days before the premium due date, amounts at least equal to the insurance premiums to be paid. If fifteen (15) days before payment is due, the reserve funds are insufficient, Grantor shall upon demand pay any deficiency to Lender. The reserve funds shall be held by Lender as a general deposit and shall constitute a non-interest-bearing account which Lender may satisfy by payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor as they become due. Lender does not hold the reserve funds in trust for Grantor, and Lender is not the agent of Grantor for payment of the insurance premiums required to be paid by Grantor. The responsibility for the payment of premiums shall remain Grantor\u2019s sole responsibility. Insurance Reports. Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to Lender reports on each existing policy of insurance showing such information as Lender may reasonably request including the following: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the property insured; (5) the then current value on the basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of determining that value; and (6) the expiration date of the policy. In addition, Grantor shall upon request by Lender (however not more often than annually) have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine, as applicable, the cash value or replacement cost of the Collateral. Financing Statements. Grantor authorizes Lender to file a UCC financing statement, or alternatively, a copy of this Agreement to perfect Lender\u2019s security interest. At Lender\u2019s request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect, protect, and continue Lender\u2019s security interest in the Property. Grantor will pay all filing fees, title transfer fees, and other fees and costs involved unless prohibited by law or unless Lender is required by law to pay such fees and costs. Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender to execute documents necessary to transfer title if there is a default. Lender may file a copy of this Agreement as a financing statement. If Grantor changes Grantor\u2019s name or address, or the name or address of any person granting a security interest under this Agreement changes, Grantor will promptly notify the Lender of such change. Reports. Grantor shall furnish to Lender, upon request, certificates and reports required by the Credit Agreement. GRANTOR\u2019S RIGHT TO POSSESSION AND TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS. Until default and except as otherwise provided below with respect to accounts, Grantor may have possession of the tangible personal property and beneficial use of all the Collateral and may use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Related Documents, provided that Grantor\u2019s right to possession and beneficial use shall not apply to any Collateral where possession of the Collateral by Lender is required by law to perfect Lender\u2019s security interest in such Collateral. Until otherwise notified by Lender, Grantor may collect any of the Collateral consisting of accounts. At any time and even though no Event of Default exists, Lender may exercise its rights to collect the accounts and to notify account debtors to make payments directly to Lender for application to the Indebtedness. If Lender at any time has possession of any Collateral, whether before or after an Event of Default, Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if Lender takes such action for that purpose as Grantor shall request or as Lender, in Lender\u2019s sole discretion, shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, but failure to honor any request by Grantor shall not of itself be deemed to be a failure to exercise reasonable care. Lender shall not be required to take any steps necessary to preserve any rights in the Collateral against prior parties, nor to protect, preserve or maintain any security interest given to secure the Indebtedness. LENDER\u2019S EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender\u2019s interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor\u2019s failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor\u2019s behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender\u2019s option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note\u2019s maturity. The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon Default. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement: Payment Default. Grantor fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness. Other Defaults. Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Grantor. Default in Favor of Third Parties. Should Borrower or any Grantor default under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Grantor\u2019s property or Grantor\u2019s or any Grantor\u2019s ability to repay the Indebtedness or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents. False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor\u2019s behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter. Defective Collateralization. This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason. Insolvency. The dissolution or termination of Grantor\u2019s existence as a going business, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Grantor\u2019s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor. Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness. This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor\u2019s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute. Events Affecting Guarantor. Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness. Adverse Change. A material adverse change occurs in Grantor\u2019s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired. Cure Provisions. If any default, other than a default in payment is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured (and no event of default will have occurred) if Grantor, after receiving written notice from Lender demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within 30 days; or (2) if the cure requires more than 30 days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender\u2019s sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, at any time thereafter, Lender shall have all the rights of a secured party under the New York Uniform Commercial Code. In addition and without limitation, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies: Accelerate Indebtedness. Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness, including any prepayment penalty which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to Grantor. Assemble Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to deliver to Lender all or any portion of the Collateral and any and all certificates of title and other documents relating to the Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Lender at a place to be designated by Lender. Lender also shall have full power to enter upon the property of Grantor to take possession of and remove the Collateral. If the Collateral contains other goods not covered by this Agreement at the time of repossession, Grantor agrees Lender may take such other goods, provided that Lender makes reasonable efforts to return them to Grantor after repossession. Sell the Collateral. Lender shall have full power to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise deal with the Collateral or proceeds thereof in Lender\u2019s own name or that of Grantor. Lender may sell the Collateral at public auction or private sale. Unless the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender will give Grantor, and other persons as required by law, reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or any other disposition of the Collateral is to be made. However, no notice need be provided to any person who, after Event of Default occurs, enters into and authenticates an agreement waiving that person\u2019s right to notification of sale. The requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is given at least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition. All expenses relating to the disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation the expenses of retaking, holding, insuring, preparing for sale and selling the Collateral, shall become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Agreement and shall be payable on demand, with interest at the Note rate from date of expenditure until repaid. Appoint Receiver. Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, with the power to protect and preserve the Collateral, to operate the Collateral preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the Rents from the Collateral and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness. The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law. Lender\u2019s right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Collateral exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount. Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver. Collect Revenue, Apply Accounts.

Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender\u2019s rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement, the Related Documents, or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor\u2019s failure to perform, shall not affect Lender\u2019s right to declare a default and exercise its remedies.

All agreements between Borrower and Lender are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever whether by reason of advancement of the proceeds of the Indebtedness, acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness hereof, or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be advanced hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, (to the extent not preempted by federal law, if any) and any subsequent revisions repeals, or judicial interpretations thereof, to the extent any of same are applicable hereto and thereto. If, from any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of any provisions hereof or of the Indebtedness or any other agreement referred to herein or therein shall, at the time fulfillment of such provision be due, involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law that a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto the obligations to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any circumstance the Lender shall ever receive as interest an amount which would be excessive interest, it shall: (a) be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Indebtedness; or (b) be refunded to Borrower and not to the payment of interest. It is further agreed, without limitation of the foregoing, that all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged, or received on the Indebtedness evidenced or secured hereby that are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum lawful contract rate, shall be made, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by amortizing, prorating, allocating, and spreading throughout the full stated term of the Indebtedness so that such rate of interest on account of such Indebtedness, as so calculated, is uniform throughout the term thereof.

No Waiver by Lender. Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender\u2019s right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender\u2019s rights or of any of Grantor\u2019s obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender.

Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible, the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) \tThe Borrower shall, at its sole expense and effort, have the right, by giving at least fifteen (15) Business Days\u2019 prior written notice to the Lender, at any time when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to require Lender to assign all of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to one (1) or more banks, financial institutions or other entities selected by the Borrower and to execute all documents necessary to effect the assignment. Such assignment shall be in the form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The Borrower shall remain liable to the Lender for all other Obligations owed to Lender under this Agreement as of such effective date. SECTION 2.13. Commitment Increases. (a)\tThe Borrower and Lender may from time to time agree that Lender shall make, obtain or increase the amount of Commitment by executing an Increased Facility Activation Notice substantially in the form of Exhibit C specifying (i) the amount of such increase, and (ii) the applicable Increased Facility Closing Date. The Lender shall have received: (i)\ta certificate, dated as such Increased Facility Closing Date and signed by the Manager of the Borrower, stating that (a) the representations and warranties contained in Article IV hereof are true and correct on and as of such Increased Facility Closing Date, and (b) as of such Increased Facility Closing Date, no Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii)\tif reasonably requested by the Lender, duly executed resolutions of the Borrower authorizing the request for and the incurrence of such increase in the Commitment (to the extent not already authorized in a prior resolution which authorization remains in full force and effect) and (iii)\tif reasonably requested by the Lender, an opinion of counsel to the Borrower, dated as of the Increased Facility Closing Date, substantially in the form of the opinion delivered by the Borrower on the Closing Date. (b) \tLender shall execute an Increasing Lender Supplement (each, an \u201cIncreasing Lender Supplement\u201d), substantially in the form of Exhibit D, whereupon such Lender\u2019s Commitment shall be increased by the amount specified therein. (c) \tUnless otherwise agreed by the Lender, on each Increased Facility Closing Date the Borrower shall prepay all then outstanding Loans made to it, which prepayment shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts payable in connection therewith, and, to the extent it determines to do so, reborrow Loans from Lender (after giving effect to the new and/or increased Commitment becoming effective on such date). Any prepayment and reborrowing pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be effected, to the maximum extent practicable, through the netting of amounts payable between the Borrower and the Lender. (d) \tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, on each Increased Facility Closing Date, this Agreement (and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto) shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the increased Commitment evidenced thereby. Any such deemed amendment may be effected in writing by the Lender with the Borrower\u2019s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). SECTION 2.14. Extension of Maturity Date. (a)\tInitial Term.  This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until the Maturity Date. (b)\tRenewal.

(c)\tThe Borrower may, by notice to the Lender not less than 90 days prior to the Initial Extended Maturity Date, request that Lender extend such Lender\u2019s Maturity Date for additional one-year periods (each, an \u201cExtended Maturity Date\u201d and the maturity date in effect prior to such extension, the \u201cExisting Maturity Date\u201d); provided that no more than three (3) such requests shall be made.  Lender, in its sole discretion, shall advise the Borrower whether or not Lender agrees to such extension. If Lender agrees to such extension, it shall notify the Borrower, in writing, of its decision to do so within 15 Business Days of such notice. If Lender determines not to so extend its Maturity Date it shall so notify the Borrower promptly after making such determination.  If a Lender does not give timely notice within such 15 Business Day period to Borrower of whether or not Lender agrees to such extension, it shall be deemed to have denied.  The Lender shall notify the Borrower promptly of its determination. (d) \tIf Lender denies Borrower\u2019s request to extend, the Borrower shall have the right on or before the applicable Extended Maturity Date, at its own expense, to require Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.06) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more banks or other financial institutions approved by the Borrower (an \u201cAdditional Lender\u201d), provided that (x)  such Additional Lender shall be subject to the (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld); (y) such assignment shall become effective as of a date specified by the Borrower; and (z) the Additional Lender shall pay to Lender in immediately available funds on the effective date of such assignment the principal of, and interest accrued to the date of payment on, the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to the  Lender hereunder. (e) \tNotwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section shall not be effective with respect to Lender unless (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the applicable Extended Maturity Date after giving effect to such extension; and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in Article IV shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the applicable Extended Maturity Date as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, true and correct in all material respects as of such specific date and, for purposes of this Section, the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.04 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01) (provided, that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representation or warranty that already is qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof). As a condition precedent to each such extension, the Borrower shall deliver to the Lender a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the date of such extension and signed by the Manager of the Borrower certifying as to compliance with this Section 2.14(e).

At closing of this Note (assuming no Event of Default under this Note or any other Loan Document) the Lender will, following compliance with Lender\u2019s requirements, make one or more advances at Borrower\u2019s request and Borrower will make payments, all as provided herein and in accordance with the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that there will never be owed on this Note, an amount greater than the principal sum of $15,000,000.00. Lender may re-advance any amounts which may have been paid upon the principal balance in accordance with the Credit Agreement. INTEREST RATE . Interest shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the unpaid balance of this Note from time to time outstanding which is not past due, except as otherwise provided herein, as follows. \u201cApplicable Rate\u201d means, for any day, a rate per annum (rounded, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (1) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, plus or minus (2) a 0.25 basis point spread as set forth in the applicable Note, and plus (3) a risk adjustment if requested by the Trust Sponsor. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall be the lesser of (a) the Applicable Rate or (b) the Highest Lawful Rate (hereinafter defined). Any change in either the Applicable Rate or the Highest Lawful Rate shall, after Lender gives only such notice as may be required by applicable law or regulation, be effective for purposes of determining the rate as of the opening of business on the date of any such change. \u201cPrime Rate\u201d means the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the \u201cPrime Rate\u201d in the U.S. or, if The Wall Street Journal ceases to quote such rate, the highest per annum interest rate published by the Federal Reserve Board in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (Selected Interest Rates) as the \u201cbank prime loan\u201d rate or, if such rate is no longer quoted therein, any similar rate quoted therein (as determined by Lender) or any similar release by the Federal Reserve Board (as determined by the Lender); each change in the Prime Rate shall be effective from and including the date such change is publicly announced or quoted as being effective. The \u201cHighest Lawful Rate\u201d is the maximum lawful rate which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received, or reserved by Lender in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Delaware (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under Delaware law), taking into account all charges made in connection with this Note which are treated as interest under applicable law. If at any time (i) the Applicable Rate, (ii) interest on matured unpaid amounts, if applicable, as provided for herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, together with (iii) all fees and charges, if any, contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by Lender in connection with the loans evidenced hereby which are treated as interest under applicable law (collectively, the \u201cCharges\u201d), computed over the full term of this Note, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest payable hereunder, together with all Charges, shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate; provided, however, that any subsequent reduction in the Applicable Rate shall not cause a reduction of the rate of interest payable hereunder below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest earned hereunder, together with all Charges, equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued at the Applicable Rate if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. Changes in the Applicable Rate resulting from a change in the Prime Rate shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph. In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Lender may adjust the spread component of the Applicable Rate and add a risk adjustment to Applicable The minimum risk adjustment shall be zero and shall not exceed 0.25 basis points. Any change in the Applicable Rate shall be effective on the first day of the month following such notice by Lender. PREPAYMENT . Borrower may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without being required to pay any penalty or premium for such privilege. In the event a prepayment is made, such payment shall be applied first against accrued but unpaid interest, then to the discharge of any expenses for which the holder of this Note may be entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note or under the terms of any other documents related thereto and lastly against the principal hereof. Any partial prepayment shall not postpone the due date or change the amount of any subsequent installment due hereunder. PAST DUE PAYMENTS. Lender may charge and collect a late fee of up to two percent (2.00%) of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment more than 15 days past due to the extent not prohibited by law. The annual interest rate on matured unpaid amounts shall be the Applicable Rate plus two percent (2.00%) (the \u201cDefault Rate\u201d). PAYMENT TERMS . This Note shall be due and payable as follows: Accrued interest on each loan hereunder shall be payable in arrears; provided that (i) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, and (ii) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitment. On _______, 20, all principal and interest then remaining unpaid, shall be then due and payable. THIS NOTE IS PAYABLE IN FULL AT MATURITY. BORROWER MUST REPAY THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE NOTE AND UNPAID INTEREST THEN DUE. THE LENDER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THIS NOTE AT THAT TIME. BORROWER WILL, THEREFORE, BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENT OUT OF OTHER ASSETS THAT BORROWER MAY OWN, OR BORROWER WILL HAVE TO FIND A LENDER, WHICH MAY BE THE LENDER, WILLING TO LEND BORROWER THE MONEY. IF BORROWER REFINANCES THIS NOTE AT MATURITY, BORROWER WILL HAVE TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF THE CLOSING COSTS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW LOAN EVEN IF BORROWER OBTAINS REFINANCING FROM THE LENDER. THIS LENDER WILL CONSIDER AN APPLICATION TO REFINANCE THE BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE TIME PAYMENT IS DUE, ON THE SAME BASIS AS ALL OTHER NEW LOAN APPLICATIONS. WAIVER. Except as otherwise expressly stated in any of the Loan Documents, Borrower waives notice, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand, presentment for payment, and protest and agrees that this Note and all liens securing its payment may be extended and re-extended and the time for payment extended and re-extended from time to time without notice and agrees that its liability on or with respect to this Note shall not be affected by any release or change in any security at any time existing or by any failure to perfect or maintain perfection of any security interest in such security. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. It is agreed that time is of the essence in the performance of this Note. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each Event of Default under the Loan Agreement constitutes an Event of Default under this Note: A default shall not be an Event of Default, if a monetary default is cured within 10 days and a non-monetary default is cured within 30 days following the delivery of or the mailing of written notice from Lender to Borrower\u2019s most current address as reflected in Lender\u2019s business records specifying the existence of any such default. If such default is not cured within the applicable period, the default shall be an Event of Default without need of any further notice or action by Lender. ACCELERATION AND WAIVER OF NOTICE. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the entire unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note to Lender shall, at the option of Lender, become and be due and payable forthwith without demand, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate, or the acceleration of the maturity hereof, notice of nonpayment, presentment, protest, or notice of dishonor, all of which are hereby expressly waived to the full extent not prohibited by law by Borrower and each other liable party. Failure to exercise this option upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise such option in the event of any subsequent Event of Default. COLLECTION COSTS. If the unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note is not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or suit is filed hereon, or proceedings are had in probate, bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, or other legal proceedings for collection hereof, Borrower agrees to pay Lender its reasonable collection costs, including a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees. LOAN CHARGES. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower and Lender at all times to comply with the applicable Delaware law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits the Borrower to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under Delaware law). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under any of the Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to such indebtedness, or if Borrower\u2019s exercise of the option herein contained to accelerate the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is Borrower\u2019s and Lender\u2019s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender be credited on the principal balance of this Note (or, if this Note has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect and applicable to such indebtedness evidenced hereby for so long as debt is outstanding. To the extent United States federal law permits Lender to contract for, charge or receive a greater amount of interest, Lender will rely on United States federal law instead of Delaware law, as amended, for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, Lender may, at its option and from time to time, implement any other method of computing the Highest Lawful Rate under any other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable law now or hereafter in effect. RIGHT OF SET OFF. Borrower grants to Lender a contractual possessory security interest in and hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges, and transfers to Lender, all Borrower\u2019s right, title and interest in and to Borrower\u2019s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings or some other account), including without limitation all accounts held jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future, excluding however all IRA, Keogh and trust accounts. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or set off all sums owing on this Note against any and all such amounts. ADDITIONAL SECURITY. This Note is secured by all security agreements, collateral assignments, assignments, guaranties, mortgages, deeds of trust, and lien instruments executed by Borrower in favor of Lender or any other holder of this Note, including those executed simultaneously herewith, those executed heretofore and those hereafter executed, and by all such agreements, assignments, guaranties, and security instruments securing the payment of all other indebtedness of Borrower to Lender. REMEDIES OF LENDER. Lender shall have all rights, remedies, and recourses granted in this Note, the Loan Documents and all other instruments securing the payment hereof and the payment of all indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, howsoever evidenced, and those which are available at law or equity, and same: (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent; (b) may be pursued separately, successively, or concurrently against Borrower or any other liable party or against any one or more of them at the sole discretion of Lender and in such order as Lender, in its sole discretion, shall determine; (c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefore shall arise, it being agreed by Borrower that the exercise or failure to exercise any of the same shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse; and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive. If any part of this Note cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of this Note. This loan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States federal law. NOTICES TO BORROWER AND OTHER PARTIES.

The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) \tThe Borrower shall, at its sole expense and effort, have the right, by giving at least fifteen (15) Business Days\u2019 prior written notice to the Lender, at any time when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to require Lender to assign all of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to one (1) or more banks, financial institutions or other entities selected by the Borrower and to execute all documents necessary to effect the assignment.

Changes in the Applicable Rate resulting from a change in the Prime Rate shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph.

On _______, 20, all principal and interest then remaining unpaid, shall be then due and payable. THIS NOTE IS PAYABLE IN FULL AT MATURITY. BORROWER MUST REPAY THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE NOTE AND UNPAID INTEREST THEN DUE. THE LENDER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THIS NOTE AT THAT TIME. BORROWER WILL, THEREFORE, BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENT OUT OF OTHER ASSETS THAT BORROWER MAY OWN, OR BORROWER WILL HAVE TO FIND A LENDER, WHICH MAY BE THE LENDER, WILLING TO LEND BORROWER THE MONEY. IF BORROWER REFINANCES THIS NOTE AT MATURITY, BORROWER WILL HAVE TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF THE CLOSING COSTS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW LOAN EVEN IF BORROWER OBTAINS REFINANCING FROM THE LENDER. THIS LENDER WILL CONSIDER AN APPLICATION TO REFINANCE THE BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE TIME PAYMENT IS DUE, ON THE SAME BASIS AS ALL OTHER NEW LOAN APPLICATIONS. WAIVER. Except as otherwise expressly stated in any of the Loan Documents, Borrower waives notice, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand, presentment for payment, and protest and agrees that this Note and all liens securing its payment may be extended and re-extended and the time for payment extended and re-extended from time to time without notice and agrees that its liability on or with respect to this Note shall not be affected by any release or change in any security at any time existing or by any failure to perfect or maintain perfection of any security interest in such security. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. It is agreed that time is of the essence in the performance of this Note. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each Event of Default under the Loan Agreement constitutes an Event of Default under this Note: A default shall not be an Event of Default, if a monetary default is cured within 10 days and a non-monetary default is cured within 30 days following the delivery of or the mailing of written notice from Lender to Borrower\u2019s most current address as reflected in Lender\u2019s business records specifying the existence of any such default. If such default is not cured within the applicable period, the default shall be an Event of Default without need of any further notice or action by Lender. ACCELERATION AND WAIVER OF NOTICE. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the entire unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note to Lender shall, at the option of Lender, become and be due and payable forthwith without demand, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate, or the acceleration of the maturity hereof, notice of nonpayment, presentment, protest, or notice of dishonor, all of which are hereby expressly waived to the full extent not prohibited by law by Borrower and each other liable party. Failure to exercise this option upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise such option in the event of any subsequent Event of Default. COLLECTION COSTS. If the unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note is not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or suit is filed hereon, or proceedings are had in probate, bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, or other legal proceedings for collection hereof, Borrower agrees to pay Lender its reasonable collection costs, including a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees. LOAN CHARGES. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower and Lender at all times to comply with the applicable Delaware law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits the Borrower to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under Delaware law). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under any of the Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to such indebtedness, or if Borrower\u2019s exercise of the option herein contained to accelerate the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is Borrower\u2019s and Lender\u2019s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender be credited on the principal balance of this Note (or, if this Note has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect and applicable to such indebtedness evidenced hereby for so long as debt is outstanding. To the extent United States federal law permits Lender to contract for, charge or receive a greater amount of interest, Lender will rely on United States federal law instead of Delaware law, as amended, for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, Lender may, at its option and from time to time, implement any other method of computing the Highest Lawful Rate under any other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable law now or hereafter in effect. RIGHT OF SET OFF. Borrower grants to Lender a contractual possessory security interest in and hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges, and transfers to Lender, all Borrower\u2019s right, title and interest in and to Borrower\u2019s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings or some other account), including without limitation all accounts held jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future, excluding however all IRA, Keogh and trust accounts. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or set off all sums owing on this Note against any and all such amounts. ADDITIONAL SECURITY. This Note is secured by all security agreements, collateral assignments, assignments, guaranties, mortgages, deeds of trust, and lien instruments executed by Borrower in favor of Lender or any other holder of this Note, including those executed simultaneously herewith, those executed heretofore and those hereafter executed, and by all such agreements, assignments, guaranties, and security instruments securing the payment of all other indebtedness of Borrower to Lender. REMEDIES OF LENDER. Lender shall have all rights, remedies, and recourses granted in this Note, the Loan Documents and all other instruments securing the payment hereof and the payment of all indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, howsoever evidenced, and those which are available at law or equity, and same: (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent; (b) may be pursued separately, successively, or concurrently against Borrower or any other liable party or against any one or more of them at the sole discretion of Lender and in such order as Lender, in its sole discretion, shall determine; (c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefore shall arise, it being agreed by Borrower that the exercise or failure to exercise any of the same shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse; and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive. If any part of this Note cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of this Note. This loan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable United States federal law. NOTICES TO BORROWER AND OTHER PARTIES.
