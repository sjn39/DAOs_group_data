With nothing in the backlog and this week\u2019s polls not requiring immediate action, we are not planning on having an executive to vote on this Friday. If an emergency situation arises, I will update the community. This will be announced on Thursday\u2019s G&R call this week as well. Thanks to the Protocol Engineering team for all the back-to-back spells (and an out of order one) since EthDenver! We appreciate your dedication and still fully support the principle of forgoing a weekly executive when it is not necessary.
