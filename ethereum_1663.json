Similarly in DeFI , from major projects like olympus DAO are issuing specific type of fixed rate bonds for LP tokens,  to more institution / Real World Finance Adoption like Societe Generale issuing bonds as guarantee for an loan to makerdao(here) ,  bonds are going to be the next prominent asset class to grow adoption of defi after swaps and staking .

                    "content": "Thanks for question . Regarding issuance of the bonds ,  it depends on the :  type of asset class you want to associate . what are the criteria for the creation of Bond  Classes and  Nonces for bond in the given class . and the metadata that defines the additional conditions of bonds (standards like green bonds) most importantly the  supplies (active , burned and redeemed supplies from the given market maker of the bonds or issuing entity) and  finally redemption time / conditions .  then we will need to understand the different counterparts  in the process of issuing the bonds . for our reference implementation we considered the following (which are explained in our whitepaper for v1 implementation here) :   Banks : these are the orchestrator for issuance and  redemption of bonds after maturity(and only this entity has the right to issue compliant bonds ).   Automated Pair Maker (APM) : this is the analogy of AMM but being single consolidated pools , where unlike the AMM , the bonds can be issued for single or multiple underlying collaterals   Secondary market maker(auction marketplace):  to provide  possiblity for P2P transfer and bidding of bonds .   Regarding the question of compliance : Indeed our standard provides the minimal interface for encoding the information needed for compliance across different institutions . but we need to insure that the issuer entity (either the Bank contract as explained above or any external entity ) needs to encode the necessary information and corresponding metadata in the bond data structure , so that the destination marketplace (like the secondary market / APM or other offchain entity for  certification / price oracles etc) can decode and validate the information . if you want an reference of the ease of our standard in handling this issue , checkout one of the latest issuance of bonds by an major french bank using modified version of ERC20 standard here , we see that the bonds issued  only defines the corresponding supply , standard and maturity date . thus it lacks the other parameters required to check the overall supply , redemption conditions and to  be sold on the secondary exchange , we will be needing the parent contract to fetch the details . so in traditional bonds systems , we indeed have the notion of bonds and class .  for example , the class information defines tghe category of the bond (name , category (based on redemption time , zero coupon , fixed rate and floating rate etc))and the nonce corresponds to the current state of the bonds (active , redeemed supply , interest rate , redemption time etc). The advantage of using our implementation of bond structure is its unifies the different categories of bonds , their issuance from the single contract type . ",

The \"class\" is the class nonce of bond, the first bond class created will be 0, and so on. The \"nonce\" is the nonce of the bond. This param is for distinctions of the issuing conditions of the bond.  if you consider the Nonce to be transaction   between  counterparties of an particular type , then the NonceInformation can be  define as  the reference information about the nature of transaction (as defined by the memos) , beyond that also as classInfos are also defined , this is  more helpful for transactions between the two different entities from different jurisdictions to get more information about the class of the transaction between the two different types of bond exchanges .

But what will happen if we want to store in the same time an address, an integer and str.  Yes you can indeed store that in an array given that you provide the  sequential metadata corresponding to each of the inputs so that the counterperties and their corresponding frontend logic can decode / encode the information (its defined by nonceInfoDescription)  How the smart contract can interpreter this, and how the front end can translate those value for the users. Do we have a key dictionary. It\u2019s this a part of EIP?  yes you can do that by setting the nonceInfoDescription(uint256 nonceInfo) external view returns (string[] memory nonceInfoDescription) PS: currently the nature of the nonceInfoDescription is defined as the string (rather than an array of strings) , so we will have to incorporate this correction now .  I think we will need more detailed documents on the structure of the metadata.  correct indeed , so we  will create an PR with the changes but if you could also explain some example of the metadata information needed to parse the store issuance and redemption information  , feel free to discuss .

                    "content": " Should we have an input for classId?  yes we can used classId for that  in most of the cases . but in some cases (specially when the classId is maintained onchain but some  metadata is maintained offchain) then its not necessary that metadata will be indexed in the same way as onchain information.  Also, how about event for regular approval for specific bonds?  that is also done in the current version by emit Transfer(msg.sender, from, to, transactions);  Overall it looks like a huge interface and I don\u2019t exactly understand what is the need of each function. I think detailed description of a use case would help. Like what is the purpose of each function/struct and why can\u2019t it work without it?  well maybe if you want to get more comprehensive introduction of the standard from the basis , there has been many resources added by us:   presentation.   @Vadim reply to the question on July 27th (had to edit the answer in the previous response  as my previous account is not able to log in and on this one there is the limit on replying max 3 times )  Structs naming is weird. Nonce usually means number only used once. In your presentation on page-12 you use same nonce multiple times. That\u2019s very confusing.  In our use case  nonces is used for issuing  only once for specific issuance of the bonds of the given class for the user. so even if he buys another time same class bond but with a different amount, the corresponding redemption time, interest & APY changes. but yeah that should not be the concern generally for now as there has been no collision with other terminology in the traditional finance where nonce is used, apart from the blockchain. so in the page 12 :  image668\u00d7530 24.3 KB  here it\u2019s perfectly normal to have similar nonce with different classes as they will not have collision whatsoever when doing the main operations (like issue, redeem, and others ) as they require both class and nonces as the identifier. consider as similar to the different blockchains but having similar nonces for the given block. so even if there has been a transaction or interaction between the blockchains , you need to require nonce along with the chainId of the sender and receiver chains.  Why storing these metadata onchain? It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s necessary for functional use.  well I don\u2019t think so and our presentation indeed shows the promise of the on-chain data. this necessitates the need of being independent of other external contracts/oracles to determine the conditions for redemption, interest calculation  or bonds. also, the need for Metadata is primarily for the frontend to interpret the bond details  in the correct way so that for international transfers with different jurisdictions and languages will be able to encode / decode easily.  All these burned/redeemed/active supply. Are they all necessary? Can\u2019t we just decrease totalSupply like in ERC20?  Yes indeed its necessary given that in bonds they can be invalidated but they still cant be counted as \u201cspend\u201d and will need to be considered for the full supply during lifetime of the bond .  unlike ERC20 where the tokens can be either minted  or spend . the bonds have possibilities to keep the supply separately in order to have more consistency .  It looks like you are trying to standardize some of your existing solutions\u2026  I don\u2019t understand clearly but if that means we are EIP3475 compatible , yes we are doing that .  Some of described functionality looks excess. It\u2019s not about if this EIP will be finalized. It\u2019s about if it will be used.  thanks for the critique but I don\u2019t agree .  if you see the scale of the bonds in the traditional finance and their logic , they indeed need extensive description of their metadata and corresponding  values , but on the very minimalistic stage , all the interface function and structure description  ideally will be  absolutely required by the given bond implementation in order to pass. i will be happy to discuss further implementation based on your use case, but I will also share the reference implementation of the CAST standard soon on this page in order to present people about the challenge in implementing real life bonds.

Nonce usually means number only used once. In your presentation on page 12 you use same nonce multiple times. That\u2019s very confusing. We use the term nonce because the idea about this eip is to create a structure for token with abstract storage. If we give a particular name, we will limit the use case of Nonce. Nonce is only created once when write nonce metadata inside. nonce is nothing but a index represent a sub category of token. We are very happy to hear some other name suggestions. Why storing these metadata onchain? It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s necessary for functional use. You are using a DeFi protocol, why we write the data about date of deposit and interest rate on chain with separated varibles and functions. EIP 3475 is doing the same but with more gas efficient way. If you could provide a real use case that erc 20 token is more gas efficient, we will study that exemple. In the case of AMM lp token use case, the gas fee is tasted. So to state otherwise, please provide data. All these burned/redeemed/active supply. Are they all necessary? Can\u2019t we just decrease totalSupply like in ERC20? please read an article about securities issuing to know why this is needed.  If decrees on total supply, there will be collateral that we can\u2019t identify with bond. bond data should remain the same no matter what happens. It looks like you are trying to standardize some of your existing solutions\u2026 we developed solutions first. if we did what you suggested, the standard dont need to be this abstract.

Our technical team has analyzed EIP-3475 and noted some security considerations that we\u2019d like to share with your team.   Hi Joey, Thanks for the article and feedback,  some of the recommendations are indeed valid and can be additional points wrt the considerations that we have provided to the EIP doc.  i) From an implementation point of view: We would check whether the bond\u2019s logic data is saved on-chain to ensure its data is sorted permanently on-chain.  Its indeed true, but we need to specify what you have considered by bond\u2019s logic data as its pretty broad: According to the minimalistic implementation, we just need to define the bond financial parameters and risk parameters in the class (ROI, redemption time, rating, \u2026) along with the parameters needed issuance of each instance by the user (time-Of-Issuance, amount,\u2026) are only needed  in order to make the token interoperable. other details (underlying collateral details)  can be from other off-chain sources (IPFS , oracle).  ii) From a technical point of view: We check whether the access control to the privileged functions is safely and securely managed and maintained.  That is indeed true, so based on the entity that will be issuing bonds (which is defined as bank in the specification) needs to have roles defined so that only they can execute the issue()   function after  it receives the underlying collateral as a debt instrument.  iii) From a tokenomics point of view: We would check whether the bond issuer has sufficient assets to ensure the application is financially secure.  Here I will disagree, there will be some category of bonds (called floating bonds as explained by the debond protocol for their v1 implementation here can not be having a fixed redemption date, and hence the bondholders will have to check the market liquidity in real-time in order to redeem, but at the same time they will be offered higher APY ). i do agree that for fixed rate bondholders we will need to have sufficient liquidity, but we will be ensuring this by incentivizing the users to buy the floating rate bonds, and then using the collateral received from them to redeem the fixed rate holders in priority.   so by default bond issuer might not have sufficient assets for the given type of class, but for sure it will need to consider sufficient reserves in order to avoid the black swan event. thanks again  for the feedback and article. happy to get in touch with the team.

                    "content": "Hello guys! You can help me with this sequence of questions that I think makes sense not only to answer my questions, but I believe it can help the community to use this protocol to apply real-world functionality! Without further ado, let\u2019s go to the example: Assuming that all (Meta)Data) used in this example follows regulatory standards here on Brazil! These are. www.anbima-com-br These, but not only, are the government entities that regulate the capital markets here in Brazil! According to anbima files, to create an investment fund you need 3 minimum characteristics. The Fund. (CNPJ + Various Registration Data) The Portfolio. (CNPJ + Various Registration Data) The asset. (CNPJ + ISIN + Various Registration Data) Each of these entities here in Brazil are considered commercial entities, that is, each of them must have a CPF and an individual to be able to open a commercial entity! Equivalent identification number BR/USA / Individual Entity (PF) (F) In Brazil Individual Taxpayer Registration (CPF) Numerical sequence - 804.214.624-85 / In the USA it is Social Security Number(SSN) 565-82-00741 With a valid CPF it is possible according to Brazilian law to open a CNPJ commercial entity Identification number equivalent to / BR/USA Commercial Entity (CNPJ) NATIONAL REGISTRY OF LEGAL PEOPLE (PJ) (J) In Brazil CNPJ Numerical sequence - 85.36.671/0001-83 / In the USA it is Employer Identification Contains all the data to legally create an investment fund. With the following features. 1 investment fund With 1 wallet, With 3 assets, being; 2 physical assets: 2 commercial buildings for rent for offices. I chose to use a HYBRID income model for the investor who buys the shares of the fund. It works like this; 12 Months from the date of signing the contract - For example from the date of the question 09/20/2022 to 09/20/2023 The investor receives 2 types of fixed income, which can be calculated based on the index (CDI) generally used for the calculation of fixed income investment products in brazil. Post fixed income that is variable and the IPCA index is generally used to calculate this variable income rate. Forgot to mention that! In this case! would probably use oracles to fetch this ofchain data\u2026 right?! This product usually has an expiration date (Maturity) of 12 months. By bringing such an asset to the blockchain, for example, it is possible to make the investor withdraw his investment whenever he wants. With blockchain the investor can obtain other forms of profit etc\u2026 The data below is fictitious! However, the fields are those required by regulatory bodies. and business etc. I also believe that using \u201creal\u201d data and a real world business model helps us when coding a real product. My question is, could you use the Metadata below and create a complete example?? Where and how would each of this information go? I ask this question because I\u2019m interested in using the protocol in real products, but of course before testing etc\u2026! But for that I need examples as close to reality as possible and in this case I live in the Brazilian market! And of course, if that answer requires a higher level of work, I\u2019m willing to hire your consulting service to help me create a product that could be marketed in the real world. But that it had the characteristics that I describe in this post. I am aware that the blockchain and its features can lower the total cost of an operation like this that involves CPF and CNPJ / Legal entities. The beautiful world is where we could use both: blockchain+structured data from regulators etc\u2026! Because the institutional investor, with a lot of $$$ will definitely opt for a system that uses blockchain but that essentially has solid regulatory foundations in the way it handles data and its financial operations! I\u2019m willing to help with whatever it takes to see this protocol evolve! Thank you and congratulations to everyone involved in this Wonderful IEP/ERC!
