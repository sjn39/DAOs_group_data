As others have mentioned, we have to make room for full time contributors to the protocol to really level up  Through this proposal, the Public Goods Funding workstream is requesting to formalize its efforts and requesting a governance reward budget of 45,000 GTC to be deployed over Q3 2021 to help further the mission of GitcoinDAO by executing on the following objectives:  Helping to manage the GitcoinDAO treasury and ensure we have sustainable funding for public goods well into the future (with help from the team at Llama)  Budget: 15k GTC Deliverable: Holistic treasury management strategy document + legal review Key Person(s): Shreyas, Ken, other substream members   Grassroots efforts for increased collaboration between community members and level up new participants and increased matching pool donations  Budget: 15k GTC Deliverable: 2-3 amazing community managers to help onboard new contributors and structure community events to promote public goods funding across Ethereum Key Person(s): Yalor, Toby, 2-3 full time community hires to work across the DAO   Moderating shared governance spaces and summarizing key results for stewards and others to review  Budget: 10k GTC Deliverable: A detailed moderation policy + consistent checks / balances on relevant DAO channels + continued weekly DAO summaries Key Person(s): Yalor, Simona, other grassroots community members   Getting community input and creating proposals around round sizes, themes, and parameters prior to vote (e.g. the Building Gitcoin side round)  Budget: 5k GTC Deliverable: Proposed round structures for GR11 including novel improvements on the \u201cBuilding Gitcoin\u201d trial round Key Person(s): James Waugh, Fire Eyes    Funds for the above will be managed by a public 3 of 5 multisig managed by the DAO stewards below. Let\u2019s start incentivizing participation and take GitcoinDAO to the next phase of its development. Please note: this is only an initial draft, and we welcome any and all feedback!

Ultimately the folks that have taken the time and energy to structure workstreams have some level of trust within the community (at least at this stage in the DAO) and can be held accountable for delivering on outcomes. Definitely down to explore OBDs too but to me it makes sense to have a structured quarterly process of some kind so that people feel like they can focus more on executing and less on planning. Allowing people in workstreams to get to know each other and build together the same way smaller DAOs do seems like a welcome addition to more ad-hoc OBD related payments. ",

Personally, my hidden assumption in my support of this budget is that for now, it will be relatively obvious to most stewards whether the results a workstream reports are meaningful, but this is a bit of a leap on my part.

Quarterly funding makes sense to start though - one month is far too much overhead, and anything longer than a quarter feels like it could lose relevance without reassessment. In the future, it might be possible to extend this to 6 month instalments. Additionally, would be good for future budgets to specify whether it will be liquidated for a stablecoin or paid out directly as GTC, in a lump sum, or as streamed. Thanks everyone for putting in effort on this! ",
