                    "content": " image996\u00d7634 68.4 KB   Introduction At the Decentralized Voter Committee last night (video below), I introduced the concept of the \u201cEndgame Party\u201d which is an attempt at further formalizing the role of Decentralized Voter Committees as tools for bringing aligned voters together and identify delegates that vote according to their interests. The Endgame Plan itself will have multiple stages of voting, including a preliminary Signal Request and the Endgame Plan Launch MIP - But those votes will not be possible to hold until the complete details of the Endgame Plan (which still include another 3 parts in addition to part 4 which will be presented at the DVC today and posted tomorrow), and some simplified material has been broadly released. Before we get to that point, there are multiple short term improvements MKR holders can help prioritize and focus on that are important regardless of the outcome of the Endgame Plan. This include the Focus Objectives that I have been presenting at the Decentralized Voter Committes. Particularly getting Decentralized Voter Committees up and running so that MKR voters become more active in expressing their opinions and interests is fundamental to get Maker Governance more healthy. Additionally it will be very helpful and stabilizing to be able to get a general sense of the level of overall support of the direction of the Endgame Plan, even if all the details have not been published to be iterated and agreed on yet. The Endgame Party helps serve that purpose, and the basic idea is simple. The DVC calls that I have been hosting so far will be renamed to Endgame Party DVCs. We will accumulate a large amount of MKR that delegates to specific Endgame Delegates that attend these calls, and vote according to the general direction that reaches consensus on the calls. These delegates will also help arrange the DVCs, and increasingly become responsible for the content as I start to be able to step back and let the Endgame Party take on a life of its own.  Direction of the Endgame Party The general direction of the Endgame Party is improvement and eventual implementation of the Endgame Plan. If it is rejected (or invalidated through failure of the first MetaDAO), The Endgame Party will instead pursue the implementation of a Rai+ model where Maker is significantly simplified and stripped down to its simple, powerful and highly efficient core as a USD pegged stablecoin that is collateralized by blue chip decentralized asset and d3m exposure, stablecoins and safe haven bonds. The Endgame Party is unique in that it is designed from the start, like the Endgame Plan, to be self-decentralizing by eventually splitting up into two separate parties: The Hawk Party and the Dove Party that have general opposing views on things like rates, budgets, growth vs profit etc, top down vs bottom up, etc. This split will ideally happen at the time of the Endgame Plan Launch, so users that delegate due to voting incentives will be presented with a simple but meaningful choice of how they want their votes to impact the protocol. It also means that even if no other major DVC Parties emerge, the Endgame Party will automatically ensure that there are checks and balances in Maker Governance as it starts ossifying and reach an immutable endgame state. If you want more context of the Endgame Party and Decentralized Voter Committees in general you can watch the recording from last night: Open Decentralized Voter Committee | June 15, 2022 - YouTube (warning: veeeeery long) Here\u2019s also a lot of debate for additional context: Decentralized voter committees: Wednesday and Thursday 9pm CEST - getting real edition  Endgame Delegate signup This post is also meant to be a place where delegates can \u201csign up\u201d to help run the Endgame Party by committing to it in replies to this thread. This is open to everyone, but you will be expected to attend as many Endgame Party Decentralized Voter Committees as possible, and vote in general accordance with their direction, as well as contribute with information, ideas and proposals. Exactly how membership of the Endgame Party is determined will be figured out as we start to see recurring attendance of the Decentralized Voter Committee calls, but my simple starting point for DVC parties is that the largest MKR holder determines membership, and all members have full veto rights but can be removed if they are not seeking consensus and compromise. The party can even split up in two if there is a broader schism. Rearrangements like this should be common and expected, and be smooth because of the decentralized and permissionless nature of DVCs and DVC parties. Eventually a requirement of any kind of DVC Party is that members prove their MKR holdings (exactly how will be determined in the future) so that it is possible to reason about the actual voting power of a particular DVC party. This will influence how the majority of my own delegation is distributed (although I will not exclusively delegate to Endgame delegates), and will provide a clear place for other voters to delegate if they support the Endgame Plan and want to see it come to life, even if they dont want to join the DVCs or otherwise get in the weeds. I\u2019m also expecting to be able to get some of the other large MKR holders to delegate to Endgame Delegates. To sign up as an Endgame Delegate, simply reply to this post and write a simple message with your intention to help be a part of the Endgame Party, and include details such as your view and input on the Endgame plan or how you can contribute to the Endgame Party DVC calls.

Like I wrote in the post, I still plan to delegate to certain delegates that are not aligned with the Endgame Party, because I think they bring value to the protocol regardless. But beyond that, it simply doesn\u2019t make any sense for me to delegate to someone that I don\u2019t agree with, and on the contrary I think there is a lot to gain from creating a real incentive for delegates to seek out voters to activate, as obviously it would be very beneficial to have more active voters, and as many governance parties as possible. Main caveat is that governance parties has to represent legitimate opinions of real MKR holders that are looking out for Maker and the value of MKR itself, not special interests that try to e.g. onboard their own collateral, which would of course be harmful. When I first started preparing for the Endgame Plan proposal I was mostly convinced that some kind of clear counter proposal would emerge that would promise to solve the same core issues but with a different approach and implementation. So far this has not happened, which is unfortunate, because while I really believe in the incredible power and potential of the Endgame Plan it would have benefitted greatly from actual critical and intellectual challenge and weighed properly as a tradeoff, and ultimately if some other proposal won through a proper decentralized governance process that would still be mission accomplished for me and would allow me to \u201cretire\u201d. At this point I think it is less likely there will be real voter organization that will try to push for an alternative to the Endgame Plan, since it has been telegraphed so far in advance to all the people I think would be most able to do something like that. but I have also not pre-lobbied whales or anything like that, and in general I dont spend much time tracking or interacting with other large MKR holders. So ultimately I don\u2019t know, it is even possible that some secret group of voters is planning some big reveal any day now. However, I do plan to now (after having presented most of it) begin the process try to get as many as possible on board with the Endgame Plan to maximize alignment in the ecosystem to make the transition as successful as possible.

Although I am very new to this community, I have thought this community is some kind of foundation in crypto, and discussion seeking of protocol direction becomes best practice for all crypto participants as a result. I would like to contribute with other members, so recently just have started to participate discussion and governance through reading forums and voting in polls. I would like to continue this participation in next Endgame epoch that you are going to establish,  so I applied in this post, although my participation will be independent untill I find my direction on Hawkish or Dovish. My participation is also limited to forum discussion and voting because I am unable to attend call due to my timezone(UTC+9). I have applied your offer to show up my will that agree with your plan, because I thought continuing my recent style of participation might contradict the Endgame plan. If I will be chosen, it would be great, if not, it still ok I will continue trying to participate as one of shrimp voters to community. Thanks. ",

Hold free elections, but if you don\u2019t vote the right way, then you disappear. There has absolutely got to be a better way than literally paying people to push the vote button you tell them to push. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. You\u2019re embarrassing the people forced to come groveling to the only source of voting MKR. You\u2019re embarrassing the protocol. You have kids. Is this how you would tell them to treat people? \u201cPretend you\u2019re choosing on your own, but if you choose wrong, you\u2019re out.\u201d As the pirate said,    Why don\u2019t you tell me the better way? Also the accusations here in general are getting completely ridiculous. I have been incredibly open and incorporated large amounts of feedback throughout this months long process. What exactly do you want from me, I have to simply vote the way you want me to vote? If you have some reasonable input I will absolutely incorporate that, and I am trying my best to accommodate views that are broadly held by small MKR holders even if I don\u2019t agree with them, such as restarting the burn. What\u2019s actually embarrassing is that nobody is voting, and nobody bothered to do anything about it as long as the project got to free ride from me single handedly carrying the voting and governance security of the entire protocol. You failed to fix the problem yourself, now I\u2019ll have to do my part to make sure it happens. And while I\u2019m at it you also get the most overpowered upgrade ever done to a defi protocol for free. ",

I think you\u2019re forgetting the part where I have literally tens of millions of dollars at stake. I am active in governance, I control how I delegate my MKR, and I control how I encourage others to delegate their MKR. That\u2019s it, and that\u2019s how responsible MKR holders should be acting. I have less than a tenth of the total circulating supply so it\u2019s just wrong to argue that it is not realistic for someone to oppose. If anyone wanted to oppose me it would be easy to gather less than 10% of the supply together to do so, and there\u2019s no way to know that this isn\u2019t going to happen, unless you believe there is broad agreement with the direction I\u2019m setting\u2026 in which case, what\u2019s the problem?

But mostly\u2026 this is just a wild ego trip, and the outcry from the community today shows it. @rune you\u2019re starting to sound as unbalanced as your cofounder. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re grinding everyone\u2019s nose into the carpet, but you\u2019ve gone from being the mysterious, wise founder in the distance to just being another guy who simultaneously wants to avoid responsibility but also make all the decisions. Your ideas can be debated, and I agree with maybe half of them. But you\u2019re doing some weird thing where you set up a political gladiatorial arena where people desperate for pay or recognition are told to come in here to sign up for your political party and then pick one of two teams to battle it out. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s immature. You talk in chat about dumping MKR tokens (\u201cI feel like scum for bottom selling here\u201d or whatever it was). So it\u2019s not like you demonstrate faith in the project. It has problems, but you\u2019re never talking about user experience, just crazy ponzinomics and weird ideological missions. Whether it\u2019s CUs or delegates or business partners, these are people, not chessmen you move around on a board. Here\u2019s my challenge to you: Set up an anonymous poll where people can safely vote their thoughts. Make it simple. Something you think you\u2019ll win like, \u201cIs Rune good for MakerDAO?\u201d Only let the folks on \u201ctrust level 2\u201d vote, just like in signal requests. See what you get.

B) Reject this offer, turning down the incentive, but still monitor & participate in the development of the \u201cEndgame Party\u201d, supporting it where it matches up with my platform & principles and opposing it where it does not. I do not want to put myself in a position where I may be incentivized to compromise on my principles. Option A requires a promise that I simply cannot make. I have to choose Option B. The Endgame Plan has some noble & desirable goals. But reaching those goals will require the DAO to travel down a perilous & somewhat experimental road. If there are only yes-people involved in these decisions, the Plan could easily fail and even bring the DAO down with it. Critical and adversarial thought will be required for any of these plans to safely develop, and it will be vital that we have delegates who are not incentivized to ignore fatal flaws and who won\u2019t hesitate to suggest hitting the \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cabort\u201d buttons if it becomes evident that these plans have gone off the rails. I respectfully refuse the offered incentive to vote with the crowd. I will enthusiastically & constructively participate in discussions about the future of this DAO and I\u2019ll support initiatives that match up with my principles. But I will also dissent without hesitation if things start moving in a dangerous direction. I\u2019m here because I believe that MakerDAO has the opportunity to become vital to the future of global finance and unstoppable in nature. I want to see it succeed and thrive for decades to come. Maybe the Endgame Plan will get us there! But maybe, at some point, it will become clear that it will not do what we need it to do. Or worse, it may become clear that the Endgame Plan will hurt the DAO. None of us can know for sure how this will turn out. We need to be ready to acknowledge any eventuality. I will do everything that I can as a delegate to contribute towards the goal of an unstoppable MakerDAO while staying true to the principles that brought me here and, most importantly, avoiding any incentive to \u201clook the other way\u201d on critical flaws.

Toxicity isn\u2019t going to get you the results you want.  you\u2019re never talking about user experience  This is the kind of coherent input I appreciate, even if its hidden in a drama sandwich and presented in the passive aggressive form  . I completely agree that a decentralized end user experience, and focus on end users ability to interact with properly decentralized DeFi services, needs to be a top priority, and they must never be downgraded from first class citizens alongside infrastructure, backend and institutional users. But you are wrong in your criticism because this is literally the core focus of the MetaDAOs, which the cornerstones of the entire endgame plan. They are built around a realistic way to provide user friendly, but fully decentralized, uncensorable and secure frontends both for vaults, dai/DSR and most importantly maker governance and voting. Additionally MetaDAOs are fundamentally about branding, community building, growth, metaverse presence and belonging. And last but not least none of these things matter if they can\u2019t be accomplished sustainably, meaning they need to be profitable, and they need to not infect maker governance with endlessly growing complexity. MetaDAOs deliver all of these things\u2026 and that\u2019s just getting started on their massive benefits. I wish the complainers here could learn from Chris and Maker Man and realize that the only thing you are in a position to demand from me is transparency, and that as long as you have that, the Maker Governance process provides you all the tools you need to have your fair share of influence. Once you realize that, maybe you can grow beyond complaining to either collaborate or compete. And if complaining really is the only thing you want to do, then put it to good use by focusing on those trying to influence governance from the shadows, because here it is beyond pointless, it is damaging when done with this level of toxicity. I mean you guys are literally hyping yourselves up to the point where you\u2019re bringing up my children in a damn governance forum.

It promises to do this in a structured and transparent way that eliminates conflict and confusion. To a truly concerned party, it makes sense to take this opportunity, join and steer the vision using the committees. This would be more effective than off handed forum posts or tagging VCs.

What actions I would take if an alternative proposal to the endgame plan was passed of course depends on its contents, but even if I became less active the idea is that as long as i can teach people the basic principles behind the design of the endgame plan and the critical importance of reaching a long term decentralized equilibrium, then the endgame party itself can stick around and push for the rai+ outcome of minimal bloat and scope creep regardless of the extent I am still personally around. I would likely rebalance a large amount of my MKR towards more diverse assets because of how massively overweight MKR exposure i am, but still keep several tens of thousands that I would delegate to those that i trust would focus on fighting unnecessary scope growth (as long as achieving that looks realistic which tbh is likely a lot harder than anyone here thinks) The endgame plan (or some hypothetical similarly strong alternative) is the only thing that makes the risk of being so massively exposed to MKR worth it for me. Ultimately I remain emotionally invested in this project because I think it can cause radical social change by rewriting the rules of global finance to favor sustainability and true strength, using not just the efficiency of blockchain but also tap into the powers of the metaverse, tokenomics, brand narrative and community spirit(spark). Obviously The endgame plan would require me to stick around much longer to help make its launch phase a reality and ensure that all the key pieces are fully in place to make it irreversible and make the direction and final outcome unambiguous. But I will be happy to volunteer all of my free time to do so because, as a cofounder, seeing maker actually living up to its potential is one of my biggest goals in life. I would probably always stay involved in the project to a lesser extent in the long run, as long as it kept up the purpose of using the power of DeFi for good. ",
