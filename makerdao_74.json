                    "content": " MIP39c2-SP23: Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 23 Author(s): Vamsi Alluri @Vamsi Contributors:  Tags: deco, core-unit, fixed-rate, cu-deco-001 Status: Accepted Date proposed: 2021-09-08 Date Ratified: 2021-11-22   Sentence Summary MIP39c2-SP23 establishes a Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit for the integration and maintenance of the Deco protocol facilitating Fixed Rate Vaults. For more information about the history of this MIP, which was originally posted on 5 August 2021, please see here.  Specification  Motivation This post presents a protocol designed to bring a new revenue generating and user retention feature to MakerDAO: Fixed Rate Vaults; the proposal also provides for a fully staffed core unit to support the protocol. The Deco Protocol operates to decouple Yield-Bearing Assets into Fixed Rate and Pure Yield instruments thus providing a hedge against rate volatility for all yield bearing assets. Using the Deco fixed rate protocol, Maker will be able to issue tokens that permit Vault owners to hedge the stability fee for a fixed duration and for a specific collateral type. The proposed Deco and Maker integration uses a market driven solution to make it possible for vault owners of all sizes to hedge stability fees for any desired duration. The integration of Deco will enhance rate stability, achieve a predictable and stable revenue flow for Maker, boost DAI supply, and enhance vault owner retention. The Deco protocol is ready for immediate integration. The Deco instance for Maker has been built and deployed so that it is controlled by MakerDAO governance, and thus removes the governance risk typically present in such external protocols. Upon completion of the integration of the Deco Protocol, the administrative, operational and maintenance obligations, including legal, will be assumed by a separate legal entity, DecoM, which will function in alignment with Maker policies and procedures.  Problem: Rate Volatility and MakerDAO Stability fee volatility means that vault owners are unable to accurately predict their exposure to future fees which in turn limits the MakerDAO\u2019s user base and in turn the DAI supply. Rate volatility constrains the market for Maker vaults by eliminating the participants who require stable rates. At the same time, stability fee variance means Maker is unable to accurately predict its own cashflow. In a bear market, the inability to predict revenue and control cash may prove problematic to the DAO. MakerDAO needs a vehicle to retain vault owners, expanding Dai supply, and provide a stable cash flow to support DAO operations. Deco is already developed and provides these features to Maker. The Deco protocol, in collaboration with MakerDAO, can offer fixed-rate vaults to Maker vault users. By using fixed rates, Maker may smooth out its revenue and achieve some predictability in its cash flow. This proposed integration brings the following immediate benefits to the MakerDAO ecosystem: \u2022\tBoost supply of DAI. \u2022\tDevelop an immediate and reliable revenue stream for MakerDAO. \u2022\tAttract MakerDAO prospective users who may be intolerant of rate volatility. \u2022\tProvide a novel product for the Growth Core Unit. \u2022\tEnhance vault owner capital and operational efficiency. \u2022\tImprove vault owner retention and discourage vault migration. \u2022\tIntroduce rate-predictability. \u2022\tAllow stability fees to be discovered by the market through auctions. \u2022\tMaker may now lock in vault owners and be able to reliably cover its fixed operating costs through the upfront sale of Fee tokens. This proposal is for the creation of the Deco Fixed Core Unit and the addition of a new product for MakerDAO by the integration of the Deco Protocol: Fixed Rate Vaults via Deco Protocol.  Core Unit ID DECO-001  Core Unit Name Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit.  Core Unit Mandate  Mission Integrate, manage, and maintain the Deco fixed rate protocol.  Deco Protocol The Deco protocol is a fixed rate protocol designed to be flexible and safe. Its design anticipated that its first and most effective initial application may be on Maker. The core protocol is outlined in the whitepaper and in the technical documentation. Codebase repo of the base protocol implementation can be found on Github. The Deco protocol, in collaboration with MakerDAO, can offer fixed-rate vaults to Maker vault users. The Deco user experience is simple: vault owner purchases a pure-yield token which earns a yield that offsets the entire stability fee on the vault. A vault need not migrate to an external protocol, either before or after the fixed rate expires, which makes it possible for the Maker protocol to retain its core business and not lose stability fees. Vault owners are not required to change any of their own vault management processes; users may continue to use the same UI or smart contract to manage the vault. The vault itself remains fully independent, and within the Maker Protocol. Fixed rate token issuance on Deco is controlled and maintained by Maker governance, allowing MakerDAO to control the fixed rates without relying on external governance.  Deco Protocol Retains Vaults and Captures Revenue for MakerDAO Deco protocol decouples a yield bearing asset into a pure-yield and zero-yield component. Through an integration with the Maker protocol, Deco makes it possible for MakerDAO to issue a token that tracks the stability fee for a certain collateral type over a fixed duration, a FEE-CLAIM token. For the user to get a fixed rate on their vault, all they need to do is buy the FEE-CLAIM token and hold it. The token will accrue yield to offset the fees accrued by the stability fee for the fixed duration. Deco optimizes the Maker protocol and vault owner user experience. Vaults need not migrate to an external protocol before or after the fixed rate expires. Vault owners are not required to change any of their own vault management processes. The UI or smart contract already used to manage a vault may continue to be used. Even after the expiration of the fixed term token, vaults are left \u201cas is.\u201d Since the rate fix is performed outside of the vault infrastructure and contracts, vaults are never touched. This design is secure and means that the Maker protocol retains its core business even after the expiration of the fixed rate term. The vault itself remains fully independent and within the Maker Protocol.  Deco is the Safest, Most Flexible Fixed Rate Protocol. Deco is designed to avoid typical protocol risks by reducing the number of assumptions to a minimal level. For example, Deco\u2019s core operations do not assume that yield protocols will always be solvent, or that redemptions will always succeed even when they are solvent. Deco is built on the premise that fixed-maturity asset lockups should quickly change when going through a phase of instability and may require yield token holders to redeem; Deco has a built-in mechanism to ensure that swift and early redemptions are possible. Deco works exactly to the specifications of the Maker protocol, and addresses edge cases in its design that may in time be forgotten at the institutional level. The Deco instance has been built and deployed so that it is controlled by MakerDAO governance, and thus removes the governance risk typically present in such external protocols. Deco is designed to use minimal smart contract infrastructure to issue a token that tracks the stability fee for a fixed term, and for a specific collateral type. It ensures that sensitive FEE tokens issued by MakerDAO are automatically removed from circulation at or by the maturity date, or in an emergency shutdown. Vault owners simply hold a token, enabling an offset of the stability fees. By keeping regular vaults virtually untouched throughout the process, we ensure a liquidation infrastructure, and assure that service providers do not have to update their systems to deal with a special fixed-rate vault type. Deco does not add complication to the liquidation process, and makes the yield from FEE tokens collectable on-demand. Deco ensures that the collateralization ratios are not affected by stability fee accrual. Vault owners do not lose the excess stability fees they have paid upfront. If their vault is liquidated, CLAIM-FEE tokens are held separately and can be sold on the market at any time to collect the residual value. The benefits of integration to vault owners and the MakerDAO, include:   Fixed Stability Fee: Once purchased, the token issued by Deco and MakerDAO will offset the stability fee with limit to any increase as there is no upper limit.  No Vault Management Changes: Vault owners do not have to make any changes to their vault ownership or management.  New Revenue Stream: This protocol provides a stable and predictable income stream in the form of fixed-rate risk premiums for MakerDAO and gives it the ability to upsell new products to the largest vault owners, and future RWA vaults which also tend to borrow at scale.  Vault Owner Retention: Vault owner stickiness is vastly improved, especially for the largest vaults, since the stability fees have been prepaid and locked into a fixed term.  Integration with Gnosis Auction Protocol V2: Discovery of rates permitting the performance of large sales competitively and transparently.  Compatible with Asymmetric Demand: There is no requirement to find buyers for Zeros or to be able to sell Claims.   High Level Integration Design The Deco protocol integration has been thoughtfully designed to work with Maker and allows the DAO complete control over its own fixed rate infrastructure, while mitigating any underlying risks which are inherent in other fixed rate protocols. Figure 1 below demonstrates how the integration functions.  deco-maker-final1920\u00d71440 134 KB  Figure 1. Fixed Rate Vaults: Deco on MakerDAO Technical documents and usage steps are available at technical docs for more details about the components in this integration proposal.  Deco Core Unit Responsibilities Fixed rates promise to be a significant product offering for MakerDAO. A fixed rate product lends itself to a self-supporting and independent core unit. The core unit will be staffed to support the Maker integration and work with the growth core unit and governance to achieve Maker\u2019s objectives, while providing for minimal burden to the protocol engineering and risk core units. The core unit is designed to be efficient and performance focused, with the principal objective to support MakerDAO and be a profit generating cost center for Maker. The core unit will manage the integration and serve MakerDAO and its various stakeholders in the required functions. The core unit will perform the following responsibilities:  Deploy new FEE token and Deco instances for collateral types as needed. Develop Spells necessary to issue and manage CLAIM-FEE token issuances and the ZERO-A collateral type. Incorporate timely fraction snapshot captures as part of weekly spells. Perform data analysis to discover optimum fixed-rate premiums for various collateral types, and help the DAO sell the issued CLAIM-FEE tokens. Assist Growth team in product development and ongoing Deco operations, including providing integration support and working with integration partners who wish to incorporate this feature seamlessly into their smart contracts or user interfaces. Assist the DAO in ZERO-FEE token sales if the need arises. Assist the DAO in setting the Dai Savings Rate if the need ever arises.   Future Directions Deco on Maker is a flexible toolset. Not only can Deco be applied to fixed rate vaults, but there are other avenues for potential exploration. The Deco protocol promises to add feature sets to Maker. With Deco, Maker can support surplus buffer health and help mitigate flop auctions and stop new MKR issuance by sourcing the needed Dai through fixed-rate future stability fee sales in the form of CLAIM-FEE tokens.

Similar to how PSM or Chai didn\u2019t have such revenue split mechanisms, I suggest to the Maker Governance to consider encouraging the Core Unit to remove the 15% revenue share. ",

I have read it: \u201cThis option would be available for activation at the three-year mark after initiation of the Deco Core Unit, November 1, 2024. The payment for the buyout would be a lump sum payment, and in the absence of agreement, determined by three mutually agreed upon independent appraisers from internationally recognized accounting and valuation organization. Until the option is exercised, the Deco Dai budget would renew on the same budget terms quarterly.\u201d This seems like a unnecessary extra burdensome process for the governance to coordinate around to claim. My point is simple. If the Maker governance is paying for the Core Unit to bootstrap and maintain, all the returns should go to the Maker governance. ",

It could be worse than that. If the Deco CU looks towards fixed rate fees as it\u2019s primary incentive then they may try to push sale volumes of fixed rate fees beyond what is prudent for MKR as a whole. Every other CU has MKR tokens as an incentive. The community should acknowledge the effort than Deco has put in prior to the MIP application. Maybe the best way to do that is to offer a somewhat more lucrative MKR incentive plan (relative to the Protocol Engineering CU). Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, but I just worry about CUs pulling in slightly different directions to raise their performance incentive pay. ",

Therefore, I prefer we look at this proposal objectively and try to find the best option for the Maker governance. That being said, Vamsi himself said \u201cThis is not an R&D project, nor is it a proposal for Maker to fund the development of a product. Instead, we are asking Maker to fund the integration and support the operational core unit until such time as it becomes sufficiently profitable to cover its core budget and generate a profit for Maker.\u201d However, how is paying for 5 people team+ their benefits+ even accounting for their tax not \u201cfunding the development of a product\u201d? The Maker governance is literally incubating Deco team while bearing the risk and the cost (for example, what happens if the development or the integration is delayed? the cost still comes out). Therefore, it\u2019s only fair that the Governance requests a better deal. In terms of question regarding incentive. Maybe it\u2019s a misunderstanding but I saw it they are likely to also request MKR incentive in the future as well. If the Deco team is not thinking of such, then maybe they can explicitly note that they will not ask for such in the future so that can be part of the Governance\u2019s decision reasoning. In addition, compared to Protocol Engineering CU, where the demand is clear (and it\u2019s continuity), this CU is literally a test and experiment. I disagree that the reward should be higher for CU team when the Maker Governance has to bear more risk for approving this CU. ",

Maybe it\u2019s a misunderstanding but I saw it they are likely to also request MKR incentive in the future as well.   They ask for MKR compensation => MIP40c3-SP36: Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit MKR Budget So they get DAI compensation, MKR compensation, 15% of revenues + buyout clause (the last two being a call option). It is my understanding that without MakerDAO they can\u2019t do anything. By reading the whitepaper, I understand that they are pivoting. All interest rate swaps protocols are capital inefficient and MakerDAO is the main stablecoin that can mint capital for collateral without any cost. This is the secret power of DAI (which I called balance sheet manipulations). I would suggest that MakerDAO submit an RFP for all interest rate swaps-related protocols and make a decision with all data. @niemerg submitted a MIP long ago where all the code is done. They would probably submit an offer as well. @Akiva proposed one as well (asking nothing from MakerDAO). I think it would be fair to let those people know we are willing to pay some millions for such a product and let them present what they would offer for that. ",

So we are giving them better SF and interest rate security. Yet they don\u2019t have to commit much as they can exit anytime (and the origination fee is not that much). To get fixed rates you usually pay more and have to commit. Make Nexo pay a bit more for the privilege of getting fixed rates and I\u2019m not sure they will be so happy to jump in. The problem of fixed rates is that most of the borrowers are targeting a spread. People borrow at MakerDAO to yield farm (Compound, Aave, Curve, \u2026)  or to lend at higher rates (Nexo charging more). They all borrow short term and lend short term. It doesn\u2019t make sense to borrow long term and lend short term. The other problem is that the collateral is volatile (ETH). DeFi lacks a stable collateral (like t-bonds or any high quality bond in the real world). Betting long term is risky.     psychonaut:  That is, MakerDAO itself should be the main seller of floating-to-fixed swaps.   It is my point that they all need MakerDAO (or any other stablecoin issuer) to scale due to the need of liquidity. I can be wrong, but that\u2019s not an unreasonable assessment. IRS (Interest Rate Swap) market notional value is bigger than the actual bond market. You need an insane amount of collateral to make it work trustless. Making a fixed rate term market in DeFi is a very tough problem. ",

Unlike many other fixed-rate protocols which seem to try to vampire attack Maker TVL into their own protocol, Deco is a bolt-on on top of the Maker Protocol which keeps all collateral under our control.   There is no \u2018governance token\u2019 which would put the Maker Protocol at risk (subject to an external authority).   In light of there being no token, the team can\u2019t get really get any upside out of this being successful, hence why they opted for the revenue share model. The buy-out clause serves as a way for the Maker Protocol to subsume the lion\u2019s share of future profits, while giving the team a \u2018liquidity event\u2019. I think it\u2019s fair for the community to discuss what the exact revenue share number should be, but I don\u2019t think this model of core unit should be discriminated against just because of the existence of the revenue share component. I think it\u2019s a unique method to align incentives, where the team is incentivized to grow this as quickly as they can before the 3 year mark. ",

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  Thank you Vamsi for presenting and also proposing this Core Unit. We worked together for many years at Maker so I, like many others, can definitely defend your excellent technical abilities and personality. So don\u2019t take it in wrong way but I am worried that the current proposal seems to be skewed. $1,712,500 annual budget is not light and the Core Unit taking 15% of the revenue seems to be excessive considering the Core Unit will likely also get MKR compensation in the long term. Similar to how PSM or Chai didn\u2019t have such revenue split mechanisms, I suggest to the Maker Governance to consider encouraging the Core Unit to remove the 15% revenue share.   Thanks for taking the time to review the budget. The proposed arrangement brings a feature to Maker which has already been developed and consequently significantly de-risked to Maker\u2019s economic benefit. This is not a speculative development or investigative project. The proposal includes the Core Deco Protocol and the Maker tokenized stability fee integration design. The product is in addition to offering to operate the Deco core unit technically, and to support the business line. This team and product will allow Maker to compete directly with other fixed-rate protocols in a competitive DeFi marketplace. We believe the deal as composed is fair. We did not ask Maker to take the inherent risk of development by funding a development or investigative proposal. We have not asked to be compensated up front for past work. We are simply asking Maker to cover this CU operating floor at standard rates. These operational costs come out of the Deco\u2019s profit share\u2014Deco is paying for the operation of the core unit out of its revenue share once the protocol is live and functional. Your concern about ongoing MKR payments is not applicable to the proposed arrangement. The MKR budget is arranged on a fixed term with no repricing and no renewal. Again, Deco is taking the MKR pricing risk. At the end of the three-year term, Maker may purchase the business line if it desires. At that time, our hope is that the product is so successful and that the revenue share is significant enough to obviate any need for MKR incentive. If not, Maker and Deco can revisit he arrangement at that time. Deco only benefits from the revenue share if it significantly exceeds the annual budget at which point Maker would be generating a significant profit.     PaperImperium:  In the current regulatory environment, I\u2019d like to get some clarity about whether the yield tokens represent securities. If so, I\u2019d like to know if they can be sold to anyone other than the vault owner without causing us problems. There may be an exemption that makes it commercial paper as long as the maturity is short term. That\u2019s still a security, but relieves the issuer (Maker Protocol?) from registration and reporting requirements. I\u2019m not sure how to quickly get clarity on that. But I also wouldn\u2019t want us to have to block American users somehow. Too much complexity and bad UX (see the recent dydx situation)   Upon approval of the proposal, we will of course move to formally address the relevant regulatory issues. This is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor which cannot be practically accomplished within the current time frame.     Doo_StableLab:  Thank you for sharing. I have read it: \u201cThis option would be available for activation at the three-year mark after initiation of the Deco Core Unit, November 1, 2024. The payment for the buyout would be a lump sum payment, and in the absence of agreement, determined by three mutually agreed upon independent appraisers from internationally recognized accounting and valuation organization. Until the option is exercised, the Deco Dai budget would renew on the same budget terms quarterly.\u201d This seems like a unnecessary extra burdensome process for the governance to coordinate around to claim. My point is simple. If the Maker governance is paying for the Core Unit to bootstrap and maintain, all the returns should go to the Maker governance.   It appears there may be some confusion around what work has been done to date and what each party is bringing to the table. Deco has borne all cost, risk, research, and development of a core fixed-rate protocol as well as a Maker-specific tokenized stability fee product design and integration. This work in developing the core Deco Protocol has resulted in a novel product which will make it possible to leverage Maker and its architecture to become a leader in the fixed-rate market. This proposal, which Deco has independently designed and developed, will bring fixed rates to MakerDAO, under the control of Maker Governance. This work, technology, and integration design is not a gift. In order to execute on the integration and grow and maintain the proposed business line for Maker, Maker promises an operational floor budget. All core unit work is done for the benefit of Maker. On the other side, the revenue share from Deco will cover the operational floor cost when live. Deco will be paying for the operation of the core unit, for the benefit of Maker, when it comes to scale from its own revenue share. The fee share was designed as a way for MakerDAO to compensate the protocol technology once it is successful and exceeds the threshold budget. Deco defers its compensation to only if, and when, the product is successful. DAOs appear to have a difficult time valuing and compensating past work, but have an easier time paying for prospective work, R&D, or investigative proposals.  In contrast, Deco is not asking for an upfront payment of incurred costs or back compensation for the utilization of its technology and prior work. Instead, it is proposed that before Deco receives any upside it must cover its own budget prior to receiving a modest 15% of the fee. This incentive only applies if the core unit is successful in generating a significant profit for Maker. Deco provides Maker with the advantage of having a product in the marketplace within months, a significant competitive advantage. Also, Deco is willing to bear responsibility for the execution, delivery, and ongoing support of the product. Performance based incentives are appropriate here. We are not asking or funds for research, design of a product, or support of a bootstrapping a project. Deco brings a functional protocol, has de-risked the technical R&D, and solved the hard technical challenges of creating a viable and safe fixed rate protocol compatible with Maker. Knowing the value of the Deco Protocol, we brought it to Maker first because we are MKR holders. This deal structure adequately incentivizes the work performed to date and maintains appropriate incentives going forward to assure its success. ",

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  As swakya mentioned, Deco is not capping profit share to operating cost. So they are getting all the benefits that many mentioned. The Maker governance has a lot more leverage in negotiating with Deco. Definite cost of $5-6 million is not small, and I am concerned that the Governance might be giving too much favourable treatment because they have Maker ties. Yes, it\u2019s time to innovate. But business is business. And you can see from their white paper that they pivoted as it\u2019s business for them as well. And that\u2019s ok. The governance should try to get the best deal possible. Many are making assumptions but I suggest Deco team should make them explict to help the Maker governance vote with more clarity.  How much reward / reward structure is Deco team proposing Deco team commits to not minting a seperate token / equity raising Deco team commits to only support Maker protocol not others (unless they are for integrating with Maker protocol)    We hope that it is apparent to you, and the other members of the community, that we are prepared to respond to all substantive technical and business issues regarding our proposal. This is appropriate since the community must decide whether the proposal is in fact an \u201cMaker Improvement Proposal\u201d which significantly benefits Maker; we believe it is. Of course, if the community does not vote to move forward with the proposal, we will pursue other alternatives. It is not terribly helpful to engage in speculation regarding anticipated \u201creward\u201d or \u201creward structure\u201d since the terms and formula are clearly spelled out. Speculation is unnecessary on this point. Also, it is unhelpful to look for a forward-looking commitment as to what may or may not happen regarding Maker and/or the potential involvement of other platforms. Since Deco would be on the Maker platform, Maker would control all the key financial elements including the volume of transactions which directly impacts the finances of the protocol. An important point that should be noted is that Maker would not be giving business away when using Deco. As to whether Maker wished to integrate other complementary protocols, that would be left to its judgment. Any such exhaustive discussion takes us to a highly speculative and uncertain realm, which at this point unnecessarily detracts from the substantive issue at hand, which is whether the proposal is fair and materially beneficial to Maker. Pivot? Please note that our whitepaper states: \u201cDeco is a general protocol and applies to a wide variety of yield tokens.\u201d We use the DSR and Chai as an initial example, and as you may know, this was one of the earliest development cases. What Deco has done is solve Maker\u2019s hard challenge of fixed-rates: the development of a novel wrapped token solution that mimics the classic yield token. Using this design, we have leveraged Maker and Deco producing a Maker native fixed rates vault product. Summary We are proposing to deploy as a new feature on Maker, a Deco instance, which enables fixed-rate vaults, all of which is to be exclusively controlled by Maker. There are no Governance Tokens involved in this feature integration, except for MKR and Maker Governance. The following are a few key points for clarity: Maker\u2019s Side   Operational Floor Budget. Maker agrees to provide a core unit quarterly operational budget floor, on a monthly streaming model. These funds will be used to operate a core unit for the benefit of Maker. This funding is on the continuous funding model, meaning Maker may cut the core unit at any point with 3 months\u2019 notice.   Once Live, Floor Budget Paid from Fee Share. The operational floor budget will be paid from the Deco protocol\u2019s fee share, once the protocol is live. The Deco protocol will only receive a performance incentive when it begins to generate revenue which exceeds the operational budget floor. This figure is projected to be at around 467M TVL, a substantial target. At this TVL, Maker will already be generating a significant profit from the feature, including profit it would not have otherwise collected from Fixed Rate Premiums. The upside is shared with Deco only when Maker has covered the integration and operational costs   Flat Fee MKR With No Repricing nor Guaranteed Renewal. Maker will provide a standard rate flat fee MKR budget for the 36-month period with a 12-month cliff and without repricing or a guaranteed renewal. This MKR will be used to hire and retain talent for services performed on behalf of Maker, and exclusively for the benefit of Maker. This is no different than other current CU structures. It is not and cannot be considered a Deco protocol performance incentive as previously been suggested.   15% Incentive After Reimbursement of Core Unit Floor Budget. Maker will share a modest 15% as an incentive bonus to grow the protocol and its business line. This fee share may be extinguished at Maker\u2019s option at the end of three years by a buyout of the share arrangement. This fee share produces an incentive bonus for Deco only after the operational floor is covered. This arrangement means that the incentive bonus is paid only when there is zero financial burden on Maker and Maker is making a profit.   Complete Control by Maker Governance and MKR Holders. Deco is bringing the technology it has independently designed and developed to deploy on Maker. The Deco instance will be under the complete control of Maker Governance and MKR holders, not Deco or any third party.   Deco\u2019s Side   Deco Integration. Deco is offering to apply its protocol to Maker and take responsibility for its integration, maintenance, and operation. Deco will integrate its independently researched and designed protocol enabling Maker to use native infrastructure to provide a novel fixed rate vault product.   Deco Solution Obviates Maker Using Third-Party Contracts. This design does not introduce additional governance risk, exposure to third party tokens, or give away business lines.   Technical Maintenance. Deco will perform technical maintenance, deploy CLAIM-FEE tokens, and enable fixed rate vaults across all collateral types which Maker desires to utilize, including RWA, et cetera.   Develop Spells. Deco will develop Spells necessary to issue and manage CLAIM-FEE token issuances and the ZERO-A collateral type.   Fraction Snapshots. Deco will incorporate timely fraction snapshot captures as part of weekly spells to ensure ongoing functionality of Deco.   Deco Integration with Products. Deco will integrate with other products as desired by Maker, e.g., Oasis, et cetera.   Sales Support. Deco will support sale and marketing of the fixed-rate product as desired, including the involvement of integration engineering and the forward deployment of engineer sales support.   Fixed Rate Data for Core Units. Deco will produce data reports and/or dashboards that enable and support other Core Units, and governance in achieving objectives.       Doo_StableLab:  Thank you for the response. I won\u2019t comment further as it will likely only create arguments. I believe the Maker governance can assess the rest of the discussion.   There is no need for you to withdraw from the conversation, presumably our interests are aligned, and we wish the continued stability and growth of Maker, and there are no conflicts of interest or competitive concerns. You may count on us to respond to all material questions touching on our proposal. To aid in the discussion, we have prepared a comparison of Deco with other fixed rate solutions which are currently being proposed to the Maker Community. Maker operating its own fixed rate product does not preclude Maker from using third-party solutions. As @niemerg has noted, the TLM has been voted in and it will deploy and be integrated regardless of the outcome, all to the benefit of Yield. Having a native product which Maker controls will permit it to benefit from multiple fixed rate protocols, enhancing its competitive advantage. Maker will always be able to use third party marketplaces like Yield or Pairwyse, especially since it provides liquidity for these solutions. We believe it makes more sense to have Maker principally using Deco as it is a native fixed-rate facility. Consider the following:   Deco Does Not Move Collateral/Business Lines to Other Platforms. As noted by @NikKunkel above, Deco does not \u201cvampire attack\u201d TVL from Maker. Instead, all collateral is retained within Maker. This means that Maker retains its core business and TVL. The TLM requires migration of vaults into the Yield protocol. It is doubtful that Maker would wish to migrate vaults to a third-party solution with the associated risk to the fyDai. With Deco all vaults and collateral remain within the Maker system.  This point is noted in the TLM post, a major risk of using the TLM is exposure to fyDai: \u201cThe price of a fyDai token in terms of Dai is determined by the interest rates in the market. If interest rates go up, the market value of fyDai goes down. Thus, fyDai purchased by Maker may lose value when marked to market in an environment with rising interest rates.\u201d   Deco provides revenue to Maker it would otherwise leave on the table. The fixed rate premium can be seen as an origination fee in the current Institutional Vault proposal by Nexo (which is large at 1%). By sending this business to other protocols, Maker stands to lose a significant portion of its upside, while still having to provide the liquidity to these third-party solutions. Some of these solutions pay a fee for the liquidity, but these fees are modest, and Maker would do much better keeping them in house. In some of these solutions, Maker may be the sole provider of liquidity, which begs the question of why Maker would want to use a third party: it requires giving up revenue and taking on third-party protocol risk., Maker also competes with other liquidity providers on these marketplaces. Deco provides revenue directly to Maker and will also pay for a staffed core unit to support the product from its fee share.   Deco Provides a Superior User Experience. Deco is a token-based user experience. This means it is simple for users. It may be integrated with existing Maker front ends (Oasis, Defi Saver, et cetera) and does not touch vaults or liquidations. This means vault owners may use the same vault management solution they currently use. This means there is no risk to damaging vault or liquidation processes. All vault owners need to do is purchase the appropriate quantity of tokens for the collateral type in their vault.   Deco is Safe and Compatible with Emergency Shutdown. Deco gives Maker the ability to close-down the fixed-rate system and product if necessary. This can be an intentional emergency shutdown at Maker\u2019s discretion, or an emergency shutdown triggered by an MKR holder. Deco does not lend the Dai supplied by Maker, and consequently there is no possibility of loss during the redemption process. Deco can supply all the Dai it uses back to Maker on-demand in a single transaction. In contrast to the simplicity of Deco, the TLM require that the Dai holder receive fyDai during the redemption process. This means holders must work with Yield to retrieve a portion of their Dai value. The process is subject to risk because it is dependent upon the ability of the Yield borrowers to paying back their debt. The process is not instantaneous, and holders are exposed to fyDai and interest rate fluctuation, potentially compounding losses. Borrowers may delay or not pay back their debt, leaving fyDai holders at risk if not temporarily, then permanently. Deco does not have this redemption risk.   These points and more were covered in discussion on the initial Deco post started on Aug. 5 here. ",

This will much more closely align the incentives of MKR holders and the Deco team. The buyout is a red herring to me - if Deco is extremely successful MKR would not able to buy it out due to it\u2019s lack of debt financing. Even if we could, we would be increasing leverage significantly, adding risks to the protocol. Not being able to do so, based on my estimates, would quadruple the current cost base and cash burn of the protocol in perpetuity. ",

Still waiting on a few key CUs to send me their expenses for September, but high level YTD revenue = $82.2M, expenses = $4.6M which is 5.6%.     juan:  I think Kodak used this argument to not produce digital cameras.    Kodak had to 4x their cost base to sell digital cameras when there were alternative options to not increase the cost base? Let\u2019s not forget that there are multiple fixed rate implementations being proposed, including proposals from @akiva and @niemerg. I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t do a RFP as @SebVentures proposes and pick the implementation with the best customer experience and economics. I know Maker Governance has no clear way to negotiate with MIP authors, but it\u2019s my view that every CU MIP that is passed should have incentives that are fully aligned with MKR holders. To be clear, I am not against providing Deco significant upside if the product is successful, I\u2019m arguing for capping MKR\u2019s downside. There is no reason to approve a compensation plan with incentives are not fully aligned with the best interests of MKR holders when we have the flexibility to implement something that fully aligns them. It is simply bad business to make any deal where we\u2019re giving away a call option or perpetual royalty. Doing so would set a disastrous precedent - should the RWF team revise their compensation plan to include a 15% revenue fee on all RWAs onboarded? Should PE take a 15% cut for every new product they create? Should Growth get a 15% revenue cut for every new IV client onboarded?

You\u2019re touching on a lot of exciting topics that are very relevant for DAO. @SES-Core-Unit is planning on researching and publishing more about these. More news to come soon. The comments below do not refer specifically to the Deco Proposal.  Product Development - Cannibalization I\u2019ve heard the Kodak example several times, but I haven\u2019t researched it in-depth. It was just an example (maybe not the best one) to illustrate that we should not stop product development with the cannibalization flag.  Keeping Costs on Check We are both aligned on this topic, as we have discussed this at length. We even addressed the possibility of spinning up a Core Unit to do this activity on an ongoing basis. This practice should not only be done before the proposal is approved but also continuously. What each Core Unit is spending and the value they bring to the Protocol should be investigated and brought up to the MKR holders (especially the delegates).  Request For Proposals I love this idea. I can see a working group or some Core Unit handling those in the future. I have personally participated in several RFPs, and they are not easy to prepare or manage (both from the client and the supplier perspective). The closest thing to an RFP that I\u2019ve seen was @Davidutro organizing a call and preparing a table comparing the different solutions. I haven\u2019t seen any other effort (sorry if I missed it) to organize and structure these initiatives.  Decentralization and Frameworks In a decentralized environment, the lack of a perfect framework does (and can) not stop the work from moving forward since there\u2019s no centralized power to do this. We have seen this happening with the MKR Compensation programs, not waiting for the different frameworks. Note that there\u2019s still no broad agreement on the MKR Compensation for a new Core Unit.  Incentives You raised excellent points about Core Units adopting a compensation plan to include a percentage of the revenue fee. Should they do it? The answer is probably anything between \u201cabsolutely\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d. We want Maker to scale, so this sounds like we would be aligning the incentives. The downside is almost evident: a team such as PE might focus more on new (profitable) products than security (and other important topics). Other groups (RWA or Growth) might end up scaling Maker extremely fast. ",

Adding layers upon layers of royalties with misaligned incentives is not scalable nor in the best interest of MKR holders - especially at such high levels. A better approach, which still aligns the incentives of new revenue stream CUs with that of MKR holders is to have additional MKR tokens unlock upon achievement of specific revenue milestones. Doing so provides fully aligned incentives where CU and MKR holders win together. In the current proposal, it is quite easy to envision multiple scenarios where Deco wins and MKR holders lose. ",

                    "content": "What we have seen thus far regarding Deco is a spirited discussion of the technical and economic aspects of onboarding it to the Maker Protocol. Deco supposedly will morph Maker into a \u201cfixed-rate lending protocol like Yield or Notional [.].\u201d Such an offering should excite (and worry) us as it represents another step in Maker\u2019s evolution, much the same as Rune\u2019s proposal for the Sagittarius Engine. Nonetheless, there are glaring omissions from the multiple forum strands related to Deco. I\u2019ll address my thoughts on those topics below. (1) What are the DECO tokens? In the white paper, Vamsi describes the Deco protocol as \u201c[making] it possible for users to create two tokens: one that offers a fixed rate of yield over a specific time\u201d and \u201canother [principal] token which the user [can] withdraw from his or her deposit at any time.\u201d (Deco White Paper, p. 1). Deco permits users to partition and trade these two assets freely where \u201cone token represents the original base asset deposit, and the other token represents an ongoing accrual of interest in the yield token.\u201d (Id.) That basic description sounds like a blockchain replica of US Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities, better known as STRIPS. The Treasury Direct website describes STRIPS, and contains the following notable bullets, which reminded me of the Deco tokens:  When a Treasury fixed-principal note or bond or a Treasury inflation-protected security (TIPS) is stripped through the commercial book-entry system each interest payment and the principal payment becomes a separate zero-coupon security. STRIPS are popular with investors who want to receive a known payment on a specific future date. STRIPS are called \u201czero-coupon\u201d securities. The only time an investor receives a payment from STRIPS is at maturity.  STRIPS are not issued or sold directly to investors. STRIPS can be purchased and held only through financial institutions and government securities brokers and dealers.  Presuming that the Deco tokens are the functional equivalent of STRIPS, they are by default likely to be securities in the US and any sophisticated securities regulator should easily connect Deco and the Deco tokens to the regulated, institutional STRIPS market. (I bolded, italicized and underlined some notable highlights above in case anyone is wondering\u2026) (2) What May it Mean for the Protocol? Per Vamsi\u2019s proposal, Maker will be the sole protocol authorized to issue Deco tokens and act as the \u201ccounterparty\u201d offering fixed rate and yield-bearing tokens to any vault user. Thus, Maker will play a similar role with Deco tokens as the US Department of the Treasury plays with STRIPS and do so without involving the regulated financial institutions or government securities brokers and dealers that deal in the STRIPS market. (3) What are Potential Regulatory Implications? Offering these unregistered securities (Deco tokens) when there exists a direct parallel to a similar product (STRIPS) in the real world is an interesting choice. Given that several delegates (like @flipflopflapdelegate) have already voted in favor of Deco, I want to highlight several ongoing US federal and state regulatory actions against other providers of high interest and fixed-rate products:   Celsius;  BlockFi (p. 4, \u00b6 14); and  Numerous other DeFi borrowing and lending protocols (\u2026the SEC\u2019s enforcement division recently sent letters to multiple startups seeking information about platforms \u2026that [permit users to] to make money by lending out their cryptocurrency holdings\u2026).  I don\u2019t think I need to spell it out but integrating Deco seems likely to raise the \u201crisk profile\u201d of the Maker Protocol at a time where US regulators are becoming increasingly focused on \u201cborrowing and lending\u201d protocols that offer fixed rate products. Please keep in mind, too, that there may be more issues than I\u2019ve spotted, though I will leave that for real professionals to uncover. And there may be other jurisdictions \u2013 the UK, Switzerland and Japan to name a few \u2013 that take umbrage with Deco tokens offered to vault users based in those countries. (4) Why Hasn\u2019t DECO Addressed these Regulatory Issues as Part of its MIP? In response to Paper Imperium\u2019s question about the regulatory implications of Deco, Vamsi said the following: Upon approval of the proposal, we will of course, move to formally address the relevant regulatory issues. This is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor which cannot be practically accomplished within the current time frame. I understand the time and expense of doing this additional work, but why should Deco push to onboard their product without providing any legal or regulatory due diligence on the potential implications for Maker? We need to understand what happens if the Maker Protocol is found to be issuing illegal \u201cDeco\u201d fixed rate securities. Do we claw back commissions paid to the Deco CU? Should the Deco CU be responsible for contributing Dai to a legal defense fund since they are trying to nest so much risk in the project? And why will Deco only agree to undergo legal/regulatory analysis after it\u2019s onboarded? Their strategy puts the cart before the horse. (5) Does What I\u2019m Saying Even Matter? Probably not. We are throwing caution to the wind as of late and moving away from the cautious MakerDAO norms that made this protocol \u201cboring\u201d but rock-solid compared to its peers. Perhaps when looked at in light of Rune\u2019s recent proposals and the fears of being out innovated by DeFi 2.0, it\u2019s easier to swallow Deco-related risk. But if integrated, Deco may make the Maker Protocol the issuer of illegal securities, which have a direct and easy-to-understand parallel in real-world finance. Moreover, the Deco CU receives a percentage fee for Deco\u2019s performance + CU salaries + MKR compensation. That seems like an imbalance between risk and reward for Maker, especially since there are so many other fixed-income protocols on the market that Dai and vault holders can access without having the Maker Protocol involved. Indeed, the Deco proposal foists on Maker and MKR holders the risks of issuing STRIPS-like securities. I only hope that the delegates pay close attention to the real risks their votes may introduce.

I certainly can\u2019t confirm the number, but can confirm that some specific projects I would not have expected got love letters. While I am currently voting in favor of Deco with the view of a much restricted used case, let me assure you and others that I will keep this evolving discussion on my radar. The safety and solvency of DAI is my first priority, with the protection of MKR holders a near second. I am also firmly of the mind that Maker\u2019s best strategy in these times is to carefully navigate the space of crypto finance that does not encumber it with KYC/AML requirements in the US market. Anything that brings DAI or Maker under the SEC will, of course, trigger that requirement unless we choose to abandon the US financial markets. ",

However, currently the onchain poll has a vast majority of ABSTAIN (34,603.60 MKR). The YES (7,986.77 MKR) and NO (1,636.83 MKR) are not sufficient to get to the required threshold of 10k MKR.

However, the more I look at Deco, the clearer the \u201cDAO issuing illegal securities\u201d angle becomes. Vamsi and the Deco team are passing the risk of their protocol to MakerDAO since unlike with other fixed-income projects, MakerDAO will be the \u201cissuer\u201d here. When push comes to shove, MakerDAO (and perhaps the named delegates voting \u201cYes\u201d) may be the target of any regulatory action. Given that there is no Foundation to shield us, is Deco the hill we want to die on, especially with all the competing fixed income protocols on the market and the much more ambitious things the DAO seems keen to explore (RWA? Saggitarius Engine?) If you\u2019re on the fence here, please vote \u201cNo\u201d. At the very least, the Deco team should provide the DAO with legal and regulatory analysis to assuage our concerns about the STRIPS/securities element (if not the potential question of the rate swap that occurs when one converts the variable-rate token to the fixed-rate token (maybe it\u2019s a derivative?)). If they do that, Deco can simply re-apply as many other projects and CUs have done. ",

And if it does, have you done any legal analysis PRIOR to onboarding that you can share with the Maker community stating that the Deco tokens are NOT securities and, accordingly, the Maker Protocol will not be an issuer of those securities if it onboards Deco? Because, as I highlighted multiple times above (for instance, here), you and your team have not engaged with the real concerns about Deco expressed by me and others (@PaperImperium) over the last weeks, and indeed, you hand waived them away (to paraphrase your team member on the Deco public call: \u201cwe\u2019ll get to legal analysis AFTER we\u2019re onboarded and AFTER we\u2019re getting paid\u201d). In sum, how can you differentiate Deco from STRIPS? I don\u2019t think you can but I\u2019d love to be proven wrong. Anyway, if we are going to be concerned about legal/regulatory risk with the Centrifuge model (@rune) why would we ignore a more easily ascertainable risk (Deco) staring us in the face?  I hope the delegates (@flipflopflapdelegate @PaperImperium @twblack88) who may be inclined to support Deco take heed of the risk it will introduce. I will vote against it with every MKR I have because integrating Deco into Maker will make the DAO a target for the enforcement actions currently roiling the industry (you can read my earlier post for more color). I have to counsel caution here; onboarding Deco is short-term, sugar-high thinking especially when other fixed income models are coming to market that DO NOT make the Maker Protocol an issuer of illegal securities.

In fact laying off rate differences DOES NOT solve the liquidity issues involved (ala Impossible Trinity).  Also my own personal analysis as well as my current lawyers are that any fixed rate instruments are going to be the first line of attack (at least in the US) where they will all be labeled as securities.   Is anyone paying attention to how Coinbase pretty much halted their own fixed rate plans because of brewing issues not just with legislators over this but with regulators? Seriously folks with proper planning there is a vision where Maker can manage fixed rates itself.  There are no changes to the protocol required.  We can use a bonding model on both sides to guranantee performance not just by borrowers but by the lenders (i.e. MakerDAO)   People (ala borrowers) have to realize that we have to manage monetary policy with DAI and even large borrowers are not going to get terms so easy from banks, and certainly not with such long terms with high risk.    We have to have \u2018some reasonable\u2019 flex in longer term rates.   I believe we can accommodate both the needs of large borrowers for \u2018some terms\u2019 on fixed rates with very simple changes to how governance handles them, and the contract terms. I have so many issues here with these fixed rate MIPs it isn\u2019t funny. My real problem here is that we have people doing work for something I don\u2019t see will do shit for the protocol in terms of the real liquidity problems that are going to pop up and the fact that I see people pushing for these players to be \u2018accomodated\u2019 while we figure out whether this is going to work or whether any of these \u2018solutions\u2019 will actually solve the problems long term fixed rates on large vaults is going to create in monetary policy.    Then we have the legislative and regulatory hurdles that appear to be unappreciated. Because I believe there are a number of key economic issues that won\u2019t be solved by adding any sort of mechanics to \u2018lay off\u2019 the rate risk, and what I personally see (and my own consultant lawyers see) as serious and significant legislative and regulatory hurdles I am planning to vote no to any of these fixed rate additions to protocol.

But that\u2019s not the case here. The Deco tokens (Interest Only and Principal Only) are securities modeled on a financial instrument traded and regulated since 1985.     wouter:  Deco is already bringing a lot to the table with all the code that has been written and open-sourced before the approval of their core unit. If I were in their shoes, I definitely wouldn\u2019t fund the legal research on top of that without the slightest guarantee of being reimbursed for it.   That\u2019s great that Deco is bringing somewhat of a ready-made solution to the table (though their representative seemed to contradict that position on an earlier call). If they were launching as a standalone product, like Yield or Element, that would be great, too, and I would cheer them from the rafters and use their product. Yet integrating with Maker such that the DAO and MKR holders issue the Deco \u201cInterest Only\u201d and \u201cPrincipal Only\u201d securities is unacceptable. Vamsi and Co. put nearly all the risk on us and get paid a healthy sum of Dai and MKR to do it, while the DAO has to deal with the inevitable US regulatory fallout. That\u2019s unfair. The Deco team is trying to execute a clever ploy here. They know the institutional inertia with Maker governance is such that if they are onboarded, the likelihood of them being offboarded is low. Moreover, even if we offboard them, Deco will still get paid for months until the offboarding process is complete. Why go through all of that trouble when Deco tokens are clearly securities and onboarding them places a target on our backs? It makes no sense. Also, you do not have to be a former SEC lawyer or securities expert to figure this out (I\u2019m certainly neither of those things). I googled \u201cinterest tokens,\" \"principal tokens\u201d and \u201czero-coupon bonds\u201d and stumbled upon STRIPS. A few hours of reading later and I came to the conclusions you see above. And lastly, hand-wavey \u201cof course there aren\u2019t legal/regulatory/structural issues\u201d answers are what got us into bed with a certain RWA provider who shall go unnamed in the first place (I wrote about them many moons ago).

One thing that I am very grateful for, is that on any given day any human soul can come to MakerDAO and make a difference. Therefore I ask that you step-up and encourage the 850,000++ MKR that\u2019s out there to Vote, \u201cNo\u201d-- please go out there and have the largest Voter turnout in Maker History support your views. In fact, I recommend you become a Delegate. After all, this is a DAO. And on any give day, ANY human in this world can make an impact on the future of MakerDAO. As you and I personally share an interest in OHM (you stated you like Zeus, I\u2019m just curious about innovative tech via DeFi 2.0), I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re opposed to a product that is controlled by Maker Governance, where MKR token owners control the parameters, USER BASE (Institutional Vaults via the Growth CU), DECO keeps vault collateral in the system, plays well in the sandbox with PECU, Risk, Growth, etc., and is composed of a homegrown team. So, I think about the Game Theory. Usually when folks are against the possibility of an innovative new world order: A. They don\u2019t understand the concept of the innovation/product. B. They oppose the confluence of sovereignty. C. Or, they\u2019re just talking their own book. (nothing wrong w/that)  Tribalist vs. Institutionalized Money You have some traditional finance folks surprisingly believing that one day institutions will dump Bonds for Bitcoin. True, or not\u2013I\u2019m here doing the best I can with limited resources, an opaque future, and with the lack of guidance. Since 2018 I\u2019ve been waiting for the guidance, playing a long-term game\u2013with long-term people. You and I can sit on our hands and wait-it out\u2013or we can make things happen. I choose the latter. Also, I could have chosen tribalism and joined the next Hot DeFi project. Instead I decided to join an old grassroots community, like MakerDAO.  Why? Because I believe together we can make a difference. This community has brilliant people who are full of passion and together I believe we can change the world, we can build cities, move mountains, and help humanity. Sounds cheese man\u2013but the truth is, only focusing on making money gets boring pretty quickly. Personally, I rather do something compelling with the gift of time, then just sleepwalk through life.  Fiduciary Duty As you stated above, MKR token owners who have delegated to Flip Flop Flap Delegate are 1000% welcome to un-delegate from our platform. I ask that if the performance of Flip Flop Flap Delegate is poor, please remove your MKR from our platform. Our fiduciary duty is to MakerDAO and MKR token owners. Again, @Tosh9.0 I ask that you get out there and push for your beliefs. Because one thing that you must know about me, I\u2019m not afraid of failure. I am resilient, and I know you are as well. Thanks again, and say hello to the OHMies for me :)) ",

While I share your sentiments about being \u201c[unafraid] of failure\u201d and \u201cdoing something compelling with [one\u2019s] life\u201d the only issue for me here is how Deco imposes immense regulatory risk on the Protocol at an inopportune time. Indeed, it\u2019s the control over Deco by Maker governance that is the entire problem. If they were independent, then it would be fine, as I stated above. Pointing out problems with projects that want to deeply integrate with Maker, like Deco, to supporters of those projects is a healthy part of governance and not something to be discouraged. And yes, I\u2019m protecting my \u201cbook\u201d \u2013 the MKR that I hold and vote, like anyone else here. ",

People can take that info in their voting calculus as they wish.   Regretfully, your superficial analysis demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between traditional finance STRIPS and the proposed Deco implementation. A STRIP bond is a debt obligation whose principal and coupon payments are removed (\u201cstripped\u201d) and sold separately to investors; an investor may also purchase the separated principal of the bond - the residue; both the strip and residue can be openly traded.  The distinction: a Deco Zero is always locked as collateral within the Maker system and is not openly traded; in the Deco fixed-rate vault, a Zero is never held by a user - only by the Maker system. A user never has access to Zeros and Zeros never leave the system. Zeros are simply used as accounting placeholders internally within the Maker protocol for Dai. We find your public post, suggesting that Maker and community members are moving to become involved in \u201cillegal securities\u201d trading by favorably viewing Deco, both inappropriate and irresponsible. We are MKR holders and prioritize the safety of the protocol in our design; we do not hold tokens in any other lending protocol, whether governance or LP, and so are committed. We are conscious of the regulatory environment and are sensitive to regulatory requirements. We will legally address all potential regulatory issues which may arise prior to deployment. Note the reply to your post and Wouter in Post 55. We find it necessary to respond to your post because it demonstrates a very superficial understanding of Deco and its relationship to \u201ctraditional finance\u201d. Your superficial commentary has now reached the level of misinformation which is damaging to both MakerDAO and MKR holders. ",

This proposal to onboard this Core Unit signals the intention to move towards building this feature. This can include (and we urge Deco to do it) legal research, and potentially the redesign of the system to accommodate risk mitigation (of any kind). There are several very important questions raised in this thread (and others) that will need to be answered before turning on the feature. There will be another vote to turn on any feature. We don\u2019t believe that we should stifle innovation based on armchair legal speculation. Did we not onboard the PE team because they could introduce bugs to the system? No, we make sure that each feature is vetted by several checks before going live. ",

                    "content": "Thanks, Vamsi, and I do appreciate your engagement here. I think it\u2019s indisputable that the yield asset (the IO) is a security and, if freely tradeable, would have detrimental effects on the Maker Protocol. But your answer brings up an excellent point: even if the yield asset is not transportable, the base asset (Dai) is, so it looks like a STRIP. From my (admittedly arm-chair, novice, and perhaps buffoon) perspective, that means that Deco is functionally equivalent to STRIPS and, perhaps more concerning, may affect the regulatory classification and fungibility of the base asset \u2013 DAI \u2013 generated by fixed-rate vaults. And since Deco     vamsi:  is controlled by MakerDAO governance,   it appears Deco\u2019s intended integration and deployment impose the risks of changing the classification of the base asset on MKR holders. Note that my concerns would wash away if Deco were an independent protocol, like Yield or Notional. I can\u2019t say for sure one way or another, though, in my opinion, an experienced securities attorney should look at Deco closely before it\u2019s onboarded and before the DAO commits a considerable sum of money to the Deco team. H/t to @omahalawyer. Please note that my persistence here is because I care for my MKR holdings and the Protocol\u2019s health (much the same as when I pushed on Centrifuge\u2019s structure \u2026). If I\u2019m wrong or there are answers to these regulatory questions that a majority of MKR holders are comfortable with, that\u2019s great. I\u2019d be happy to support you given that our ultimate goal \u2013 safely growing the Maker ecosystem \u2013 should be aligned. But it seems imprudent to onboard Deco and pay your team considerable funds before we have these answers, regardless of whether we have another vote to \u201cturn [Deco] on,\u201d as @flipflopflapdelegate  suggests. Moreover, I believe we should not onboard projects then pay them to obtain legal analysis. Teams seeking to onboard, and especially projects that place a novel burden on Maker, should come with a well-vetted legal and regulatory approach in hand as part of their MIP. (Matt and 6S are the golden example). And remember, we\u2019ve been burned when onboarding projects without properly analyzing their structure before voting them in\u2026 Now my final point: being critical and asking difficult questions is not \u201csuperficial\u201d or \u201cmisinformation\u201d seeking to \u201cdamage\u201d anything. It is good faith risk management intended to protect the immense value currently existing on the Protocol and in the broader Dai ecosystem. ",
