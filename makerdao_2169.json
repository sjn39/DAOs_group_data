Paragraph Summary This MIP proposes implementing a D3M-like strategy for gDAI via the Maker Governance Process. Gains Network has been a proven champion of DAI and a reliable source of revenue through their trading platform. If approved this MIP would instruct the DAO to deploy capital in gDAI tokens to take advantage of the Gains profits.  Component Summary MIP115c1: Proposed Allocation TBD MIP115c2: Legal and Risk Reviews TBD MIP115c3: Additional Stipulations TBD  Motivation Maker currently has 500M DAI out with Monetalis to seek return on idle capital. While this demonstrated MKR holder\u2019s desire for generating yield, it does not come without risks due to the concentration of funds in a single yield provider. In regaurds to MIP65 this proposal sees the following positive and negative aspects:  Pros  Nice guys Not stupid Qualified and experienced High integrity Maker earns an impressive yield on otherwise idle capital  1%? 2%? 5%? 10%? Who knows\u2026 it\u2019s better than zero!     Cons  Giga extreme concentration of finite capital reserves.  $500m is\u2026  650% of our treasury  The surplus buffer is currently $75m   15% of our USDC reserve     The Monetalis team is mortal  Regrettably, that fact carries a risk Generally, it\u2019s not a factor worth considering, but with such a large amount of capital, it\u2019s worth taking into account.   Despite their integrity to date:  The team could rug all funds (in blatant disregard of any legal consequences) Team may be forced by anyone with enough weapons to turn over capital. Team may get drunk or high and push the wrong buttons in exactly the wrong sequence to turn $500m into $0.     Sanity As much respect as I have for the guys, we had dinner together in Spain, in my opinion, allocating so much capital to a single entity or team is insane. When it\u2019s a personal financial decision, go ahead\u2026 lever up! But Maker has a duty to DAI holders to remain solvent. If there\u2019s a black swan and something happens to Montetalis\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll just mint some MKR in an infinite loop to make up the shortfall? We used to start off new debt ceilings with $5m, slowly raise to $10m or $15m\u2026 and go up from there. Look at the 6S debt ceiling\u2026 $15m. In my opinion the expected yield does not justify the concentration risk.  Proposed Solutions  Don\u2019t reduce allocation, but compensate for the high risk low return by allocating capital to high yield, higher risk investments.  Some call this the \u201cBarbell Strategy\u201d Allocate 1% to a something that earns at 10-20x the rate.  If the money vanishes\u2026 whelp, thats the risk a lender takes. If not, the protocol earns the same returns for just a fraction of the capital at risk.       Specification / Proposal Details MIP115c1: Proposed Allocation TBD MIP115c2: Legal and Risk Reviews TBD MIP115c3: Additional Stipulations TBD  Disclaimer: This post is not meant to denounce or discredit Monetalis in any way, shape, or form. Monetalis is purely named to illustrate Maker\u2019s current appetite for risk and yield. In keeping with that same spirit, this post introduces gDAI, a sensible addition to Maker\u2019s portfolio to satiate that appetite. ",
