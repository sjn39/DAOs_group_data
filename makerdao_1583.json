We\u2019ve talked before about how reposting of articles is best suited for the Discord instead of the forum. If you want to site an article in a forum post that\u2019s awesome! But people have twitter and news feeds and all sorts of other things for getting links to news articles. If you wanted to make this a successful forum post I would suggest adding some \u201cmeat.\u201d What could this mean for Maker devs? For any one working on the community? Are there legal protections for us in place, or are we just as vulnerable to this type of action? Writing a post like that takes effort and spurs discussion, reposting and quoting from a news article takes a few seconds and is likely to garner little attention as it\u2019s not bringing anything to discuss to the table.  Happy for the community to decide if this is the type of content they want in their forum feed. Based on my comments if it\u2019s flagged again in its current state I will accept the flag. Adding more detail or moving this information over to the Discord would be my recommended course of action. ",

So you either have to up the effort or up the potential for engagement for it to be relevant on the forums. This is where all our official announcements and governance proposals go to be seen and discussed. Having spam cluttering the feed makes people less willing to wade through and find the valuable threads for engaging. This is why I say reposts of articles make a much better fit in Discord. You\u2019re also much more likely to get some engagement there, so if you truly feel this is highly relevant but you shouldn\u2019t have to explain why, it makes a lot of sense to post it in Discord instead.

Anyone impacted by this should not rely on this forum only to get the pulse of the crypto world, which will broadly always impact Maker. Actually try to take this to its logical conclusion : if every news maybe impactful for Maker is reposted here in a feed-like fashion, people will start to need a new place that focuses only on governance discussions.
