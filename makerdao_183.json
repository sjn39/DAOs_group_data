Specification  Motivation I present myself as the candidate facilitator for the Immunefi Security Core Unit because I want to ensure that this first foray of extensive collaboration between decentralized organizations, namely the Maker ecosystem and Immunefi, is executed at the highest level of competence. I believe I am a suitable candidate for this role due to my current involvement in Immunefi, the largest bug bounty platform in crypto, as one of its Co-Founders. In the past, I have had extensive experience in cryptocurrency communities and projects in various capacities since 2016, when I began working in crypto full time. I have also had experience with open source organizations, such as the Open Source Initiative and the Linux Foundation, primarily with my contributions to Hyperledger.

The team structure is hierarchical with multiple 3rd parties contributing to the work performed by the core unit, including those provided by Immunefi itself. The Deputy Facilitator sits below the Facilitator but above these 3rd parties. The Facilitator, in turn, sits above the Deputy Facilitator. Roles and responsibilities of other team members and 3rd party contributors will be documented and shared as part of our Core Unit documentation and the Facilitator will oversee all modifications and adjustments for clear transparency. Whenever 3rd party contributors do work, work done is transparently communicated wherever possible and reasonable. Operational continuity will be assured through proper handover procedures created and implemented.   Goals As Facilitator, I will have the following goals that will allow for better tracking by governance as to whether I am doing my job correctly.  Roadmap targets are hit on the dates that they are due Bug bounty program MIP successfully passes and is implemented Successful incidence response (if one is needed) Content that is created is considered positively by the community via comments and interactions   Related Documents  Core Unit Mandate MIP Core Unit Budget MIP Core Unit MKR Budget MIP  ",

I haven\u2019t actually received any payment yet, but I have been assured that I can be paid once my legal stuff is set up. Q. Your mission is to get a security-team onboarded as a CU? A. I\u2019ve adopted that mission. It was SES\u2019s mission to onboard a security-team. Juan recruited me because he thought that I could be a good fit. ",
