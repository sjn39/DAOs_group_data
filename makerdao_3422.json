                    "content": "The Gini Coefficient is not a significant indicator of the viability of an asset as collateral. We should be more concerned with its utility and security. An asset being held today by mostly one person or a small cohort does not mean it is risky. For example, Uniswap liquidity tokens can be created at any time from their backing assets, so it is not a big deal that two accounts hold 82% of Compound DAI Uniswap Liquidity. Also, different accounts are not necessarily different people or organizations. By putting weight on the Gini Coefficient, we might be incentivizing would-be collateral tokens to airdrop their tokens, or temporarily spread them out by other means. ",

                    "content": "I think high Ginis can be an insight indicator, not a decision-making one. And as your example for UNI LPs shows not applicable as blanket rule across collateral types. But from a liquidity Risk and market risk standpoint, having a collateral in which the founding team treasury has a very high % of circulating supply and hence a very high Gini without any vesting period of tokens can give an insight of potential price manipulation and hence market risk for the protocol. But this should be looked at case by case. Anyhow, what is considered high gini in other asset classes is very different from crypto. ",
