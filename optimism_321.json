Well idea is to build on-chain identity, one address one soul, and this might be a start. I created this badge because you can mint it on a new address and still hold the \u201cverified\u201d tag, its free and fun. Only drawback is that sample size is quite small, just 18 delegates between 4 committees. So if you are part of any committee, you can mint a zk badge on Simso platform.

What other criteria could be included here ? Gitcoin passport is definitely making some move in right direction to build a digital identity in more decentralized way by connecting different pieces together. But either by KYC based SBTs or gitcoin approach your wallet is exposed to public, they all need a zk based layer. Take an example of Binance SBTs, once you authenticate on their platform, you get a SBT which proves that your address is verified. Binance or any app could possibly block your address by checking this SBT by its ID or with some meta-data,but here sample size is insane, in millions, and then if you build a zk base layer on top their SBT(similar to SISMO badge), you can still prove that you are a verified user by Binance and it will be impossible for anyone to target an individual user. Both approach has some drawback, Gitcoin approach is good from regulation side and nightmare from user privacy side. ",

You somehow connect this destination with the origin (it\u2019s a 1:18 relation - assuming everyone claims without using their origin, if there\u2019s 10 claims using the origin then it becomes a 1:8 relation). If the eligibility criteria is broad enough (let\u2019s say 10k wallets) you kind of preserve your privacy (assuming the claim is done using a different destination). Meanwhile from an Identity perspective, it\u2019s not a great idea to only use Soulbound NFTs because accounts can be compromised or lost. That\u2019s my point, I see badges more like achievements and less like an identity tool (they shouldn\u2019t be the only/main way but they can complement an identity). If you want to understand a bit more how Gitcoin Passport works, you should check this and this. ",

The identity issue is essential to prevent Sybil\u2019s attacks. And privacy is essential too for many people. Now that I\u2019m performing a new DAO experiment I am exploring new ways of preventing Sybil attacks without compromising the privacy of new members and I hope we all can learn about it.     Prometheus:  From an identity perspective the best so far is Gitcoin Passport   I didn\u2019t know about this. Thanks.     OPUser:  KYC based SBTs   What is this? Something like this project: https://coinpassport.net/ ? I like Community participation (linked to social accounts) as a fair enough approach in order to prevent a massive Sybil attack (I\u2019ll check if the gitcoin passport goes in that direction). I like Vitalik\u2019s idea of a new Id NFT standard that can be recovered by the community if your private key is lost or compromised (but not easy). I think at the end several secured sources may be used. ",
