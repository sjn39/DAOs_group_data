We started with a pretty conservative DC of 3 MM, I guess we can start increasing it now. This poll is about raising the DC to allow more DAI from UNI2DAI-ETH.  Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation   Cons:  of course we are raising our exposure to ETH-volatility here, but since the token is backed 50% by DAI, this is probably not a big deal   Ceiling Adjustment A few options with +50%, +100% + 200%, +300%     3 MM (no change) 4.5 MM (+ 50%) 6 MM (+ 100%) 9 MM (+ 200%) 12 MM (+300%) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Poll will run until January 14th and depending on the result will move on-chain assuming the outcome the poll deems it necessary and both Risk Domain Team and Oracle Domain Team support the increase.

LP-tokens are a very big source of income for us (almost guaranteed IMO), the Risk Team requested us to increase the DC only once we feel confident with the current oracle (and its risks), but how do we know when we\u2019ll feel confident?, I don\u2019t think we can define that, and if we measure that in time, that\u2019ll be 6 months, or 1 year. IMO, if we lack confidence here, we should invest in auditing the contract by 3rd parties (maybe 2 independent audits?). With the coming UNIV2USDCETH and ETHWBTC vaults we should be prioritizing this to don\u2019t limit all the new vaults to 3M (which will not help us that much)\u2026 plus if an issue is found in one of them, I guess that it probably exists in the others (which means that we should then really have 1M per each one, to keep the 3M which can be covered by the Surplus?).

                    "content": "Hi all. I\u2019m really happy to see the DAI-ETH LP getting some traction, especially given that:  BTC and ETH have been on a tear leading to an expected decrease in demand for being an LP No easy one-click leveraging solutions through Zapper / DeFi Saver / InstaDapp (yet  )  This proves our thesis that there is substantial demand for LP tokens and I suspect that LP tokens (not just from Uniswap, but SushiSwap, Curve, Balancer, 1inch, etc.) will contribute a significant amount of stability fees going forward. Now that we\u2019ve tested the waters, I think we should try to scale this as quickly as possible. That being said, there is still significant Oracle risk given the smart contracts have not been formally audited. So here\u2019s what I suggest. We get an audit on the contract ASAP. It would actually be great if we could fund this through the Surplus Buffer as it would showcase an end to end community led effort of how to onboard something into the Maker Protocol in a responsible manner and be a blueprint for future initiatives to follow. Audits will take time though as auditors are frequently scheduled months in advance. In the meantime, the Oracle Domain Teams confidence in the Oracle contracts has increased given we haven\u2019t seen a hack over the holiday break (knock on wood). Rather than increase our exposure by increasing the debt ceiling for DAI-ETH, I think it would better to onboard USDC-ETH and WBTC-ETH with 3,000,000 DAI debt ceilings (though I will defer to the Risk Domain Team if they have strong opinions on the matter). This positions us much better for the future given that debt ceilings can be raised in an instant but collateral onboarding is a process with significantly more friction. I would strongly recommend we do it this way instead of raising the DAI-ETH debt ceiling, though ultimately it is up to Maker Governance on how to proceed. EDIT: DappHub audited the Uniswap V2 code and has significant expertise with respect to the Multi-Collateral Dai contracts. If they\u2019re willing (and Governance agrees of course) I think they would be an ideal auditor. ",

The community already voted in USDC-ETH so all thats left is to put it in an Executive Vote. WBTC-ETH would still require a final Polling Vote. Notably these 2 pairs are also some of the highest liquidity Uniswap pairs which means they have the most demand. I think promoting DAI liquidity is an interesting secondary benefit of the DAI based pairs. However, I think we still have to prove whether we can create demand for non-liquid LP pairs just by virtue of us adding them as collateral or whether we\u2019re subservient to which pairs there is currently LP demand for. Until we confirm the former and can leverage it to bootstrap new DAI LP pairs, our resources are probably better spent taking the conservative approach and adopting LP pairs with existing demand. Looking at the list of MIP6s, I see we already have applications for DAI-WBTC and DAI-YFI. Looking at which pairs actually have liquidity on Uniswap instead, I see DAI-USDC at 20M and DAI-USDT at 5M. There\u2019s also some BAC and BAS based pairs with significant liquidity but those are highly risky to have exposure to. I think if someone submitted MIP6s for DAI-USDC and DAI-USDT those might be good pairs to target after WBTC-ETH and USDC-ETH. ",

Pricing LP tokens and recycling capital is more complicated for keepers.  It\u2019s likely that we need to ensure they are tooled up first.  I recommend reaching out to keepers in rocket chat.  Whatever approach we take, it should likely be a slow DC increase and other LP types as we get those audits and see how performant auctions are.  I would not personally feel comfortable with 12 million unless we could see a number of auction participants and have at least one audit. ",

They have a slick interface but that gives us the size of what we can expect. I\u2019m quite sure the market to be long ETH is bigger than the market to be neutral/short ETH. I like the idea to support DAI related pairs with low SF and make non-DAI related pairs more expensive (but still the best solution on the market). ",

While MIP14 was not designed to be used permanently for repeated expenses, one of the main drivers was that so we would have some process for funding things, even if it isn\u2019t optimal. It makes sense to use it for audits like this. If a community member wants something useful and awesome to do, someone might consider creating a MIP that is more specialized for organising and funding audits using protocol funds. Such a specialized MIP could implement processes like:  A lower RFC / Frozen Period Escrow audit payments to a mandated actor and/or multi-sig so that an audit firm does not need to perform work without the guaranteed of being paid. Audit specific record keeping. (What was code was audited, who wrote the code, who did the audit, what the outcome of the audit was, overall satisfaction with the audit from relevant mandated actors, etc.) Directly assigning a pool of funds pre-authorized for use in audits controlled by mandated actors (either in a multi-sig or funds that can go \u2018straight-to-executive.\u2019) Other things that I didn\u2019t think of (if you are interested in doing this, please think about how to make auditing and funding auditing a smooth process for all involved.)

Given the defined next steps and that the Oracle team does not support an increase, this signal will not proceed further at this time. Instead, the mandated actors will be onboarding ETH-USDC LP and WBTC-ETH LP (given the vote ends successfully) based on the outcomes from the recent votes. Until an audit can be completed or further time-without-incident increases confidence in the uniswap LP oracle implementation, the debt ceiling on these LP\u2019s will remain at 3M. Edit: I actually jumped the gun by a day here, apologies all. I don\u2019t think it makes a huge difference given @Oracles-Core-Unit input though. ",

The Oracle Domain Team\u2019s confidence in that code has grown since releasing the DAI-ETH LP Oracle before the holidays. Meaning there is room to gradually increase exposure to the Uniswap LP Oracle. However, until we have an audit we should refrain from making any massive debt ceiling increases. So I\u2019m proposing a compromise here. The community wants to see the debt ceiling for UNIV2DAIETH-A raised. Instead I think we should onboard UNIV2USDCETH-A and UNIV2WBTCETH-A with 3M debt ceilings. This gives us an increase in exposure that we\u2019re comfortable with, while better positioning us for the future when we can really crank the dial on LP debt ceilings. The Oracle Domain Team is currently in communication with auditors, we\u2019ll give the community an update once we have finalized the details. ",
