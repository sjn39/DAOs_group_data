I \u201cforked\u201d the mechanics of the classic board game of Acquire, and have added some new twists to bring it of the 60\u2019s and into the present. The aim of the game is to make a kind of daunting thing (Crypto) a little more approachable, but teaching players some of the terminology and general ideas about how crypto works. I reached out to @Davidutro for permission to use Maker in the game, and he suggested that I post my card design here to see if there was any appetite for a Crypto themed board game, and to see what you guys thought about the card design.  image618\u00d7855 199 KB  ",
