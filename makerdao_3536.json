In that sense we have defined the points that are most important to highlight throughout this quarter, which has been dedicated to the creation of information, content and ideas for it with thematic of DAI, MakerDAO, DEFI and related crypto move, as well as great alliances for the usability of DAI in Venezuela and large volumes of trade in our p2p markets. Alliances A great alliance was achieved with a company that is a cryptographic services switch, Glufco Investment, in which DAI was integrated as one of the accepted stable currencies to acquire its Account Unit token to access its services. This is an important step for DAI because a user can buy DAI in a p2p whether DAI ERC-20 or BEP-20, send it to Glufco and so their relative in Venezuela can exchange it for Dollars in cash, which is the most traded currency in Venezuela according to ecoanal\u00edtica a specialist firm on the subject. Conversations are under way to also be able to integrate xDAI, which in our p2p markets has had great mobility and demand from Venezuelan users. It is also expected to be able to integrate DAI from the Polygon chain.  1001\u00d7710 61.6 KB      Integration of DAI (ERC-20 and BEP-20) in the GLUFCO Service Switch Integrations       Integration of DAI (ERC-20 and BEP-20) in the GLUFCO Service Switch  From DAG Venezuela, we have just achieved a vital and important integration for DAI, because we all know how tedious the Ethereum gas fee is, from GLUFCO (I work there) we natively integrated the acceptance of DAI in BEP-2\u2019.     En @glufco nos dimos cuenta del creciente uso de #BSC por parte de muchos usuarios sea Latam o sea en Venezuela, por ende decidimos agregar $USDT $BUSD $USDC y $DAI en formato BEP-20. Esto para as\u00ed los \u2026     P2P Exchanges In our p2p group we have managed to exchange in the last quarter a total volume of 6744 xDAI spread over 125 transactions, using the xDAI sidechain. This network according to the majority of those who made p2p indicate that it is very economical and being DAI their native currency helps them to know how much they spend on trucks, we attach the wallets, and the Telegram group where they can verify. All this taking into account that although Venezuela is the spearhead in terms of the adoption of cryptocurrencies, for several years Venezuela has been going through a process of hyperinflation, for this reason every day people within the country find new ways to protect their savings, being xDai one of them. @Alefcripto He is the manager and owner of the wallets where the exchanges were made and the one who made all the exchanges. https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x92c8B19E17EF8e39E997A5e6F26DC5F5577d8f26/transactions https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x2c13ceF62A0e8Df8FA929ee4c9f3dd1320a97abe/transactions  1302\u00d7701 76 KB  Community Highlights In this last quarter as Dai Action Group in Venezuela we managed to find big stars in our community, managing to connect with more people and expand the knowledge and education about Dai and decentralized finance much more. Here we will give a review of the most outstanding points of our community:  Members talks A community member @luisruizvet who is an odontologist, made a meetup for his odontologist mates to talk about crypto, stablecoins and P2P markets, and how to use them to buy DAI and save from inflation.  538\u00d7668 174 KB   xDai on Vzla The first transaction in DAI Venezuela\u2019s P2P group with xDAI has been successful. The acceptance of the xDAI currency in the group has encouraged more trades in the group, since gas is one of the main reasons why DAI is inoperable from person to person. This is why everyone agrees to the inclusion of xDAI in the group.

The end of the road \u2026 The beginning of a new one ! During the 3 quarters being ambassadors of Venezuela we have learned much more about the crypto universe and about the needs of other people in our region, we have evolved with the community and embarked on a path that has been incredibly fun, full of pleasant experiences and very good friends, both within the community, within MakerDAO and even other crypto communities. On the part of the DAG of Venezuela we are infinitely grateful to the Maker Foundation, especially Mariano Di Pietrantonio and Nadia \u00c1lvarez, who have always accompanied us on this great path and extended a hand to us when we need it, in addition to thanking the entire team that is behind DAI, the best stablecoin of all. This last quarter represents our farewell as Dai Action Group for Venezuela, but it also means the beginning of our members as part of different Core Units within the DAO, we will continue to further promote Dai\u2019s growth, not only in Venezuela, but throughout Latin America, to continue building the community we long for. Thank you for everything, and we will continue to protect our community one DAI at a time! ",
