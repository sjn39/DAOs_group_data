Powered by the same highly reliable node operators that have helped enable over $6 trillion in transactional value in 2022 alone, Chainlink Automation offers novel features such as an advanced turn-taking algorithm for gas war prevention with high-frequency execution.  Background Chainlink Labs proposes that MakerDAO add Chainlink Automation to its third-party Keeper Network to bolster protocol security and improve uptime guarantees of essential jobs that secure the Maker protocol. In preparation for this proposal, we have been conducting a test run of a Chainlink Automation contract on Ethereum mainnet to perform jobs available in the Maker Keeper Network. The MakerDAO community can find the dashboard here to review Chainlink Automation\u2019s historical on-chain performance, operating costs, and other relevant specs during the test. Since August 3rd, our test has swiftly completed 35 automation jobs at a low cost and without issue. For the proposal, a new Automation contract has been deployed with the same parameters. The proposed budget parameters are the same as other Keeper network participants, and any excess DAI beyond the max should be returned to the surplus buffer. All software and services are provided in accordance with the MIT license and documentation here. We\u2019re thrilled about this opportunity to collaborate with the MakerDAO community and add Chainlink Automation to the Maker Keeper Network to improve the protocol\u2019s efficiency, security, and end-to-end decentralization at a low cost.

This subproposal aims to onboard Chainlink Automation as a keeper network. This is a new keeper network in addition to the existing TechOps, Gelato and Keep3r networks to perform non-incentivized but simple on-chain computations. Examples of simple but non-incentivized tasks are Oracle price updates, debt ceiling adjustments, D3M executions, etc. To look further into this proposal, you can consult their test network.
