This specific poll highlights it best: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmVMc78Z#vote-breakdown When it comes down to it, it will be the \u201cincreased budget\u201d option against the \u201cexisting budget\u201d option. It seems like \u201cincreased budget\u201d is 26K MKR behind, so those who might want to vote in favor of increasing budget can easily be discouraged by thinking their vote won\u2019t make a difference. 26K MKR is huge!! Realistically, if one counts manually down to the last two options, \u201cexisting budget\u201d has 54,420 MKR for it and \u201cincreased budget\u201d has 52,680 MKR for it, as of right now. The vote is actually pretty tight, but someone with the <2K MKR to make the difference might be discouraged from voting because it seems like the difference is 15X (FIFTEEN TIMES) what it is. This is like a page out of traditional politics that we see in manipulation of poll outcomes - make it seem like there is a clear winner to discourage people from voting for the other option. Except, in this case, I know it is unintentional. Obviously, I have a vested interest in this particular example as part of the strategic finance core unit. BUT, I think it perfectly highlights a general governance / polling problem in multi-choice voting. One that we simply MUST fix. I think the way transfer votes are displayed makes sense up until the final 2 choices. Transfers BETWEEN the final 2 choices should not count. This is what is happening here. Some people voted 1) \u201cincreased budget\u201d 2) \u201csame budget\u201d. And this is precisely what is being displayed poorly. Since those two will be the final remaining options, these votes should realistically show as counting for \u201cincreased budget\u201d. I hope this makes sense, and I hope you all can see why this is concerning! ",

The DUX voting portal biases toward the winning options, which is a legitimate design choice (we want people who use the voting portal to easily be telling what vote has won or is currently winning). In regards to this specific case, I think you are misunderstanding the transfer vote rationale for IRV. Under Ranked Choice (also called Instant Run-off Voting), a 50% majority is needed to win the poll. When no option achieves 50%, the bottom preforming option is dropped and the round of voting restarted, with ballots voting for their top remaining option. So while it is frustrating to see the vote appear so lob-sided on the final round, the reason the portal is doing this is because no option receives over 50% of the votes until the final round takes place, meaning the bottom option is dropped and a new round starts with just the votes left for approve existing budget. There might be a better way to display this, but it is worth noting that the first choice values are available on mouseover, and the Vote Breakdown lists all voters submissions. This is a rather extreme example, but the rationale for displaying the vote as it does is because the vote doesn\u2019t end until an option gathers more than 50% support in IRV, so showing only the ~50k amounts would be confusing and indicate that no option is being selected by the poll.

I do understand that the vote appears lob-sided on the final round. However, hiding the \u2018transfer\u2019 votes could also make the vote appear lob-sided for the other vote options (which might actually be close in MKR vote amount too). We\u2019ve discussed internally and decided to introduce a toggle to the vote breakdown visual of IRV poll details, which allows for switching between displaying \u2018first choice\u2019 MKR voting weight per vote option, and \u2018IRV results\u2019 per vote option (in other words: hiding/showing the MKR transfers). We believe this is a neutral way of making the design more useful & intuitive, and it also allows us to add a tooltip to further explain the workings of an IRV poll. We\u2019ll implement this somewhere over the following weeks. Thanks again for the feedback\u2014you\u2019ve essentially made this idea happen.  ",
