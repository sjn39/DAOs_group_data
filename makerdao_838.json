                    "content": "Maker Academy\u2019s Second Status Update!  960\u00d7540 85.9 KB  Maker Academy has finished an alpha version of their website that was released to select members of the community for demo. Maker Academy\u2019s alpha version of their website now supports:   Ability for users to write and submit educational content onto the site.   Ability for site administrators (Maker Academy team members for now) to moderate, approve, or reject user-submitted content.   Ability for users to write and submit edits to existing published educational content.   Ability for original authors to accept/reject edits to their content.   HOWEVER, Maker Academy has decided to suspend features in relation to content production and editing for a few more months. Maker Academy wants to ensure that a high standard of content is delivered before giving anyone the ability to create content. As a result, we have decided to move focus to content production, as opposed to platform development. Although our platform would have been ready with an extended feature set by the end of March, we would like to produce a lot of content before this. This has pushed back the release date of Maker Academy\u2019s platform. Ideally, we would like to have 3-4 courses on our site before we publish. For now, this set of courses will include: material from SES\u2019s incubation program, material from PECU\u2019s course on formal verification, history of makerdao course, a course on content production, and a use cases of DAI course. However, we might include a course on maker\u2019s liquidation system, emergency shutdown system, and a course on the history of the Maker protocol as well. ",
