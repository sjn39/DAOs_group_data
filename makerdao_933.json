I\u2019ve been working with Accountable to get a full breakdown of all my expenditures\u2026 dating back over a year. They have been extremely helpful. There are still some missing pieces that I want to get in there before submitting the full expense report. Also, my expenditures have been far greater than any budget I\u2019ve received. That said, I will not be asking the DAO for compensation on any other past expenses. I just want to have a complete picture to provide to the DAO as well as for tax purposes. ",

The original budget was more of just a token sum\u2026 regardless, I didn\u2019t do any budgeting, expense tracking, etc\u2026 but that\u2019s in the past. Now\u2026 I have AcccountAble working through composing a full complete picture of all my spending. Once it\u2019s ready, I\u2019ll submit it I suppose in several parts? Total expenditures, reimbursable/streamed expenditures from my budget, and a log of additional personal, non reimbursable expenditures (or just things I won\u2019t be requesting comp on). Something to that effect\u2026 still tracking down a few more invoices and such\u2026 will submit when ready  ",
