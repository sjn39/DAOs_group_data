Thank you for reaching out on DMs with comments and feedback.  It has helped me and my colleagues understand GTC and the opportunity behind it. [Hypothesis] Based off of the information I have gathered in the past several weeks; I have a hypothesis I want to share with you.  To be successful as a ProtocolDAO, Gitcoin needs to be more developer-led.  [Observations] This hypothesis is based on the following observations: 1 Gitcoin says it\u2019s a protocolDAO, and that it\u2019s protocols are launching soon. Developers will be the primary people building on the protocols  BUT  I don\u2019t see any evidence of developer engagement or developer leadership anywhere. 2 Gitcoin has a workstream called the Gitcoin Product Group ( [S15 Proposal] - Gitcoin Product Collective Workstream Proposal & Budget Request ) BUT the only people who engage from that workstream are the managers, not the individual contributors who are building the protocols. 3 If you look at successful API companies in web2 or successful developer communities in web3, they are almost always places where developers hang out and socialize.  There are almost never sales driven cultures in these organizations, they are always product or developer oriented cultures. [Proposal] Who are the developers who work on Gitcoin? I don\u2019t know!   These pictures are what Github shows.  I think that to be successful, Gitcoin needs to treat developers like rock stars.  190627sor-0153-16353769651920\u00d71279 286 KB  Like music, Software development is an art.  Gitcoin should valorize it\u2019s developers like they are rock stars.  And it should cheer them on as they ship code the way you\u2019d cheer for a rock ballad. To build a more developer oriented culture, Gitcoin should treat it\u2019s GPG developers like rock stars.  Invite them on stage to tell us about the protocols.  Ask them about the technology, ask them about the design choices, invite them to give demos.  Ask them what they are dreaming up next.  Build their leadership muscles. Trust them to lead. To build a more developer oriented culture, Gitcoin should treat it\u2019s ecosystem developers like rock stars.  Give them great tools and documentation to do their job.  Inspire them with whats possible now that they have Grants Stack.  Show up where they hang out & build relationships with them.  Have an amazing outbound developer engagement strategy with generous prizes at hackathons for the best builds.  Get hands on with them. Listen to their feedback and fix the problems that they point out.  EEA+sketch1372\u00d71184 74.5 KB   t6b2x3y2oe6v1o7eu0531078\u00d7600 424 KB  [Summary] To be successful as a ProtocolDAO, Gitcoin needs to be more developer-led. Building a more developer friendly culture is not to say that other skillsets are unimportant (all skills are welcomed).  Building a more developer friendly culture is a recognition that a strong developer culture is a key to success in web3.    This rising tide for developers will lift all boats at Gitcoin! I propose that Gitcoin:  create a Developer Relations workstream. shift it\u2019s culture to amplify the contributions of developers.  ",
