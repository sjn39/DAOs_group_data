                    "content": "@CJentzsch tweeted about this important issue, and several people commented.   twitter.com          Christoph Jentzsch (ChrJentzsch)     One of the strong safeguards of #Ethereum was/is one complete technical specification: The yellow paper. This virtue should be upheld and it should always be updated *first*. Every consensus relevant EIP should have a PR to the yellow paper including the full specification of it. https://t.co/e5EKkJLdAy  3:40 AM - 17 Oct 2018     55          9             Initially the discussion focused on barriers to participation due to lack of formal background required to work on the Yellow Paper. @Arachnid commented:   twitter.com          Nick 'no Nick' Johnson (nicksdjohnson)     @ChrJentzsch The difficulty makes it a significant restriction on EIP authorship; people who have the technical expertise but not the formal background are restricted from participating.  The YP is also far from enough to build a client from; it omits the wire protocol, for instance.  3:40 AM - 17 Oct 2018     5            At one point @cdetrio mentioned the Jello Paper., \u201cHuman Readable Semantics of EVM in K\u201d:   twitter.com          Casey Detrio (cdetrio)     @ChrJentzsch @nicksdjohnson The Jello paper is quite readable. Its generated from KEVM, which is an executable spec with comments. It can execute the consensus test suite, so just hit enter to cross-check for correctness. https://t.co/lS28XH20Fj  3:55 AM - 17 Oct 2018     13          4            Do I hear the sound of a a ring forming?   twitter.com          Greg Colvin (greg_colvin)     @bmann @ChrJentzsch @cdetrio @nicksdjohnson @expede The yellowpaper repo is up to 1345 commits from 53 contributors, the top four being @gavofyork, @JamesCRay01, @pirapira, and @ChrJentzsch, with many other active editors.  Seems like a feasible working group. @bmann and @nicksdjohnson can help organize.  4:24 AM - 17 Oct 2018     2            ",

This is not a quality issue, it\u2019s a communications issue. Parity is a 3rd party following technical specification from EF, we are less involved in writing it than Geth team is. The end result is that there might be hidden assumptions in the spec that not everyone outside of people involved in writing it are aware of. That\u2019s just the nature of things, writing complex software is hard, writing technical specification for complex software is hard. That\u2019s why we have a test net.     reddit    r/ethereum - Parity 2.0.8-stable (Critical Constantinople bug fix for Ropsten... 133 votes and 31 comments so far on Reddit      ",
