                    "content": "Hey all, If you read our recent MakerDAO FLIP Auctions report, you might have noticed that one UNI LP auction cleared with only 1 participant bidding and only a fraction of penalty fee collected, which raises concerns around our keeper ecosystem for UNI LP auctions. Before debt ceilings of UNI LP vault types get increased, we need to make sure we have more keepers participating in these auctions. To incentivize more keepers setting up their infrastructure to bid on UNI LP auctions, we might want to increase both \u2018beg\u2019 (auction bid increment in %) and \u2018chop\u2019 (penalty fee) values. Higher \u2018beg\u2019 should make keepers more comfortable bidding since the first bid carries some advantage. Higher \u2018chop\u2019 on the other hand should make vaults more cautious not to get liquidated. Current \u2018beg\u2019 is 3% and \u2018chop\u2019 13%. We are thinking of increasing both \u2018beg\u2019 and \u2018chop\u2019 by at least 2% (5% for \u2018beg\u2019 and 15% for \u2018chop\u2019). These parameter changes would apply for all UNI LP Vault types (both onboarded and pending).    What should be the new \u2018beg\u2019 (auction bid increment in %) value for UNI LP vault types?  3% - no change 5% 7% 9% Abstain     0 voters        What should be new \u2018chop\u2019 (penalty fee) value for UNI LP vault types?  13% - no change 15% 17% 19% Abstain     0 voters     This poll closes next Thursday 25th February. Winning votes will go into on-chain poll on Monday 1st March. ",

UNI LP tokens are less volatile than their underlying. The standard beg and chop actually results in a bigger volatility buffer for Keepers and MakerDAO compared to regular vaults. (Though there may be more gas involved for unwrapping UNI LP tokens.) Also a bit of low sample size (and a small debt size to boot). Our sample was one vault that had a debt of $3500 and only 1 bid. Though I\u2019d agree if you think beg should be raised for some of the other vaults too. ",

The current \u2018beg\u2019 should be already high enough to incentivize keepers to bid compared to other vault types where volatility is higher. Also I agree that sample size is small and this happened earlier at onboarding. But there are other issues as well that we heard of: for instance, keepers might not be properly equipped with how to price UNI LP tokens. UNI LP Vaults might have 100m+ exposure in the near future if we are to raise DC per each over 10m. We really want to make sure there is more than one keeper. Even when comparing ETH-A to other vault auctions you can see less keepers are bidding on other vaults. I imagine it is way worse for UNI LPs. ",

I also want to emphasize something I have mentioned in the past.   When one has an issue, and wants to address it what exactly is the measurement system you are going to use to measure success?   In this case you have 1 data point and are calling the keeper system bad and want to change system parameters.  You could put those parameters where ever you want and if you don\u2019t even attempt a measurement of keeper participation you will never know whether you changed anything for better or worse until you have a real market event that illustrates yet again the same issues.  network access problems capital cycling or availability issues lack of keeper participation for probably 5-10 different reasons. no ability to actually test the keeper system (I don\u2019t even know if anyone has put thought into how maker could construct such a system test btw) lack of a good liquidation dashboard and liquidation analytics (much less vault analytics to assess risk directly).  Some things are coming around but I still find it difficult to get even basic liquidation data  to understand what is happening in this regard with Maker.  How many keepers participate, how much capital and/or collateral do they have at their disposal, etc.  ",
