As you know, in v3, when creating liquidity positions, a * .dot image is generated that you can easily convert into an NFT. I understand that this image is unique and as such, you can enhance that process. Based on this idea, it occurs to me that this option could be a future liquidity position. Imagine that the previous images were limited within v3 and that a value was given to it, just as it has been done with the socks. How do you see it? ",
