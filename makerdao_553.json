Just auctioning this NFT off like the previous ones feels kinda boring, however. I\u2019m therefore interested to hear what the MakerDAO community thinks is a good way to decide who gets the treasure. Maybe a 10B DAI related meme competition where the winner is decided by forum vote? Maybe whoever manually burns the largest amount of their MKR tokens within some specific period of time gets the token? Maybe just a random pick? Personally, I like the meme competition  Please let me know your most fun suggestion! ",

Have it as a possible claim awarded to vault owners as of 10B mark since these people are the ones paying the DAI interest and backing the DAI with their hard earned collateral. I really think CUs, delegates and MKR holders should get a shot as well since this was accomplished based on many people. Alternatively if only so many will be minted perhaps all of these parties get a NFT lottery ticket and the available NFTs are lotteried off. ",

All the ones who wants the NFTs have to go to the Discord and follow XXX steps   To expand on this example, meme submissions would go through Discord to drive growth. Users must join and submit their entries to a temporary meme-submission channel. It could be voted by reactions, a panel of judges, or another way. Also, a supplemental idea to reward multiple users is to give out POAPs. These could be claimable for a limited time to Discord members. Alternatively, as @MakerMan suggested, we could specifically distribute to DAI minters using something like POAP Delivery that whitelists addresses. So POAPs for the whole community and an NFT grand prize for the best meme! ",
