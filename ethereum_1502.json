We should change the system so gas refunds for SSTORE and SELFDESTRUCT would only be applied to the base fee, not the priority fee. This can reduce the impact of gas refunds on miner revenues. Also, instead of being concerned about gastokens filling up the state with junk, we should launch a native gastoken by the use of precompiles that gives gas refunds when burned to increase gas price stability and put an end to the ethereum gastokens crisis.
