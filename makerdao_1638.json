                    "content": "Most governance structures are versions of on-chain democratic processes that we know are inherently centralizing, we are starting to see the same kind of centralization emerge in Daos, with significant decision-making powers being delegated to small groups of community-elected representatives or board members who again are put in place through voting with tokens, the people behind the VC firms are often the ones in these positions of power and we have seen them argue that this centralization is necessary because there are many cases where decisions need to be made quickly, e.g. in the case of a hack, the ideal governance structure should be similar to a monarchy within the blockchain, this is because this is how all cryptocurrency consensus mechanisms work more or less today regardless of whether they are PoW, PoS or otherwise, through some usually pseudo-random process based on staking or hash power, a single node is selected to produce a block and obtain a reward for it (this node is usually called \u201cleader\u201d) which is usually in power for a single block while it is produced, then why not modify this mechanism to make it suitable for governance, a leader is selected pseudo-randomly or even randomly from the community to govern the project for a short period of time in which he can submit proposals for community vote and decide how the money from the treasury is spent, for added security a council made up of developers and venture capitalists could have the power to betar any malicious proposal coming from the interim ruler of the project, the proof is in the cryptocurrency consensus mechanisms themselves, the best part is that this would create a huge incentive for users to participate in the governance, because by doing so they would have the opportunity to become the king of the system for a short period of time and maybe they could even be compensated. The sad reality is that we are a long way from this type of governance structure and so the ideal governance structure would be to have no governance structure at all, because as we have also seen with the governance structures of the world\u2019s governments, it is easy to influence politicians if you have enough capital and impossible to do so in the case of Bitcoin due to the absence of a governance structure.

The proposal involves selecting a leader randomly from the community to govern the project for a short period of time, with a council of developers and venture capitalists having the power to veto any malicious proposals. The author argues that current governance structures are centralizing and proposes this new structure as a solution. A 3rd party could give constructive criticism or audit the proposal.",
