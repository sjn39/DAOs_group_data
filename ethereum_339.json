There are a ton of teams working on exactly these problems, and I think most of us know that it won\u2019t last if it isn\u2019t usable by most people. We\u2019re all racing to get there. The major pain points I currently think of for MetaMask are these  The extension installation Seed phrase backup Gas/eth transaction fees & wait time Transaction comprehensibility [1] [2] Developer/Vendor experience Combatting constant phishing attacks  Currently only Eth/EVM blockchains.  We\u2019re actively chipping at every one of them, and I do believe that we are slowly approaching an adoption process that has as little friction as anything else, it just takes a lot of time and energy, and in the meanwhile, everyone\u2019s a critic, everyone\u2019s got a lot of great ideas, and some of them have skills too, and they\u2019re going to try to just do better than the current efforts. The future is bright, especially because we have so many people thinking so deeply about how we could best go about making \u201creimagining society\u201d an accessible concept. ",

I think the more fundamental problem with RSS and really all new technology seeking adoption is that it did not offer enough of an improvement over the current experience. In contrast, news aggregation sites like Slashdot and Reddit or even something like a chan board allow linking to arbitrary urls and discussion. By curating communities of people with similar interests you offer a more comprehensive experience that could not be replaced by simply visiting web pages on your own. ",

Seed phrase backup   I think you should be able to delegate storing this seed to an OAuth 2.0 provider for low/no value/dev accounts. If you don\u2019t have even minimal functionality within 5 seconds of clicking on the extension you are already losing user interest.   Gas/eth transaction fees & wait time   Users should not have to deal with handling maximum gas. One major pain point I had when I was a newb was nonce management. I had sent out a transaction that was one wei below the current minimum accepted gas price. It got stuck in the mempool but didn\u2019t get mined. This blocked all future transactions and it wasn\u2019t obvious to me at all why this was happening since my future transactions had much higher gas pricing. I eventually solved the problem using MyEtherWallet with its cancel transaction feature but before that I thought my account got bugged and I was going to have to create a new one. Maybe there should be some kind of simple queue visualizer for your transactions? Where it is in line compared to the rest of the mempool, for example.   Combatting constant phishing attacks   Maybe MetaMask should be a software agent with application privileges and not just a user extension? I\u2019m thinking of password managers. ",

Plugins are actually deprecated, WebExtensions are the new standard way to extend browser functionality. They do not have access to native code. This isn\u2019t our choice, this is a limitation imposed by the browsers.     dpyro:  think you should be able to delegate storing this seed to an OAuth 2.0 provider for low/no value/dev accounts. If you don\u2019t have even minimal functionality within 5 seconds of clicking on the extension you are already losing user interest.   I agree.     dpyro:  Maybe there should be some kind of simple queue visualizer for your transactions?   We actually have this already in development. It\u2019s been a long time coming. We believe improving the UX of the transaction queue is key to making it usable.     dpyro:  Maybe MetaMask should be a software agent with application privileges and not just a user extension? I\u2019m thinking of password managers.   That\u2019s the tip of an interesting iceberg. We definitely think long term there are big benefits to becoming a system extension, and there are a lot of different ways that empowers us, like operating on other networking protocols, etc. I\u2019m not completely sure how you\u2019re suggesting it would alleviate phishing attacks.

RSS suffered from the fact that the user aggregated a lot of content and would then have to personally curate (read: read) this content. Social sharing features supplanted this issue (your friends / celebrities curate!). Henceforth users would find more relevant information scrolling through a feed of people they were interested in in the first place. In a way it highlights how (traditional) news venues have a curatorial problem as they need to pander to a large audience and it\u2019s hard to personalise without better personal data. Similarly, Netflix recommendations. I\u2019m not sure if this is historically correct, but I assume Reddit delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce: socially curated RSS with subreddits being \u2018categories\u2019 that users can create at their whim.
