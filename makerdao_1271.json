Hello @sourcecred-trial-adm, Rahii is trying to be registered in SourceCred, but he/she did not got wallet address confirmation reply from you. Is it possible to provide guide for he/she proceeding the registration? Sorry for disturbing you while you are continuously contributing.     Rahii:  Could you please tell my after how many days of filling form you received DM for confirmation.   Umm, I am not sure because I applied without knowing even SourceCred is active or not currently. I did submit, then forgot completely until I have got DM and referred in post. If you are failed to get reply from somebody doing contribution to SourceCred, I guess submitting form again for double checking that your form had all information (e.g. forum handle for DMing), might change your current status.

We monitor all accounts that opt \u200b\u200bin to SourceCred on a regular basis and once they receive a like we activate them immediately.  So if you continue participating in the discussion you will be activated shortly.  Please let me know if you have any other questions. ",
