                    "content": "Original Draft: February 1, 2023 Updated Post: February 13, 2023  Integrated DAO Operations Budget Proposal S17 will be the last season that DAO Operations functions as a formal workstream. As such, the following post describes how we prepare the DAO to function without a core operations workstream in S18. In preparing this integrated proposal, we ran several scenarios that we ultimately decided were unrealistic based on 1) feedback from stewards and 2) how it would impact DAO contributors. So the following post will not discuss various scenarios. Instead, this post will focus on what we think is the most realistic alternative to our original S17 budget proposal. We believe this proposal is responsive to the expressed desire to see all teams reorganize this season, while minimizing disruption ahead of the launch event and next grants round. DAO Operations will wind down or hand off its initiatives over the next 10 weeks. During that time, we\u2019ll prioritize the following work:  Setting DAO leadership up for successful project-based governance initiatives Ensuring a soft landing for the Support squad as they transition to Product teams Facilitating the team retreat at the end of February Clean bookkeeping and tooling closeout or handoff.   Essential Intent Our revised S17 priorities are focused on the following intents:  Protocol Growth + Adoption Program Success DAO Organization   Amount DAO Operations is requesting nothing from the DAO treasury this season. Instead, we plan to use the reserves and underspent S16 budget available to us in our multisig to meet our S17 commitments. To facilitate this, we will convert most of our funds to stables. This assumes that the Foundation will pay for approximately $35,000 of the Team Retreat (February 24-27, 2023). It also assumes that:  CSDO may fund Steward Council remunerations through its multisig and Workstreams will fund approved professional development during S17*.  *Note: As of the date of this post, there is approximately $9,500 in professional development funding approved by workstream leadership. Any funds remaining at the end of the season will be reimbursed to the Foundation on or before April 30.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 16 Season 17     Season Budget $293,148 $348,260 $302,368   Season Reserves $188,585 $232,173 $320,000   Unspent Reserves % 100% 100% N/A   Treasury Request -$261,423 $391,847 $0     S16 Milestone Report Legend  Success  Incomplete, will hit goal or priority change  Incomplete, will not hit goal  Canceled - out of workstream\u2019s control     Initiative/Project Always-on[YES/NO] Key Results  Value Delivered      Cross-Stream OperationsContinue to improve how we work at CSDO level.  YES   Identify and implement streamlined budget process design Developed a proposal with recommendations. After consulting Stewards and CSDO members, DAO Ops decided to push off implementation until the community has a clearer strategy for how and when Gitcoin will reorganize.    Cross-Stream OperationsContinue to improve how we work at CSDO level.  YES   Document CSDO\u2019s charter and make it known to the rest of the DAO Ratified charter for CSDO, published the document on the CSDO Notion homepage and our forum.    Cross-Stream OperationsContinue to improve how we work at CSDO level.  YES   Launch a monthly CSDO digest to increase transparency Published weekly summaries on Discord and monthly digests to our forum.    Cross-Stream OperationsContinue to improve how we work at CSDO level.  YES   Deliver DAO-wide organizational map. Created an organizational map that is now maintained by People Operations.     Cross-Stream OperationsContinue to improve how we work at CSDO level.  YES   Plan team retreat. Secured accommodations and facilitators for a team retreat in Denver. This initiative will be taken over by People Ops in S17.    Cross-Stream Operations Provide ongoing facilitation and internal communication support to cross stream Program and Protocol pods.  NO   Develop an updated framework for the Workstream Weekly calls; reformat calls based on framework. Experimented with different prompts to facilitate cross stream collaboration through a pods model. Contributor feedback on the model was mixed, but we will refine the pods logic in Discord in S17.     Cross-Stream OperationsProvide ongoing facilitation and internal communication support to cross stream Program and Protocol pods.  NO   Support cross-stream pods through context sharing and facilitating check-ins. The pod runner role was distributed across pods.    Community Governance Increase Steward engagement with novel incentive structures; simplify key processes to streamline decision making for the largest GTC delegates.  YES   Deliver additional updates to DAOstewards.xyz  Re-platformed and improved daostewards.xyz. Extended daostewards.xyz reporting from 98 to 178 stewards.    Community Governance Increase Steward engagement with novel incentive structures; simplify key processes to streamline decision making for the largest GTC delegates.  YES   Build performance metrics (OKRs) between Council members and workstreams to enable rapid iterations and adjustments to the execution of the Steward Council v2.  Built performance metrics, which we used to measure a  91% positive score for Steward Circle engagement (RR:40%) in S16. There is no data available for Steward Council meetings yet, but performance will be tracked in S17.    Community Governance Increase Steward engagement with novel incentive structures; simplify key processes to streamline decision making for the largest GTC delegates.  YES   Develop a \u201cgovernance satisfaction score\u201d & survey to understand governance perceptions and needs from stewards, contributors, and token holders.  Launched Gitcoin\u2019s inaugural Community Health Survey, which includes governance questions. This survey was limited to contributors - we did not poll GTC holders or stewards, but will do so in S17.    People Ops Empower DAO contributors to grow and pivot to support our ImpactDAO and protocol development.  YES   Deliver Professional Development guidance to support contributor\u2019s continuing education.  Instead of documenting guidance, People Ops launched a weekly office hours series to allow contributors the chance to seek advice as they set their professional development goals.     People Operations Ensure contributors are in the right roles, and embrace a DAO-native hiring approach that further develops well supported contributors.  YES   Core and trusted contributors can participate in a quarterly peer review   Each workstream described a preference for a 6-month peer review cadence.      ToolingEngage in operational support, tooling, security and reconciliation to ensure an aligned and transparent software tooling approach meets the needs of the DAO.  YES   Facilitate response within 48 hours to all requests within the access control domain.  Responded to contributor requests within 24 hours of request.    ToolingEngage in operational support, tooling, security and reconciliation to ensure an aligned and transparent software tooling approach meets the needs of the DAO.  YES   Identify and document the community and Discord needs of each workstream.  Trained discord managers within each workstream to handle moderation tasks.  Created 5 best practices documents. Implemented & maintained bots to aid contributor security, increase productivity, and improve collaboration.      SupportProvide comprehensive support to GR16 grantees, donors, and Design Partners.  YES   Discord tickets are resolved within 13 hours, and email tickets are resolved within 20 hours throughout S16.  Average resolution time during the season was 27 hours and 35 minutes over email and under 18 hours over Discord. The team attributes higher than average resolution times to longer coordination times for Product Support over the holidays.    Support Provide comprehensive support to GR16 grantees, donors, and Design Partners.  YES   Current state of the Grants Program and protocol development is reflected on the Knowledge Base within 10 business days of changes.  Published or updated articles within a week of requested changes.     Preparing the DAO for Nimbler Operations We recognize that the teams that comprise Gitcoin have become more agile and self-sufficient. Ideally, removing centralized management of certain systems and processes will allow these teams to move faster and with  greater autonomy.  Those initiatives that are still managed by DAO Operations (e.g. professional development, steward engagement & management, OpSec, discord management, hiring, etc.) can be decentralized or decommissioned with a few months of runway. As described in the introduction above, we will refocus our efforts in S17 and make immediate changes to the team\u2019s composition to streamline handovers and closeouts. Five contributors will end their service to the DAO on February 28. Professional development, governance tooling, and future consulting funding are removed from this budget.  List of S17 Outcomes  Transition to Project-Based DAO Governance     Outcomes Essential Intent Likely Deliverables/Projects     Contributors and the wider community have the information they need keep up with core governance DAO Operations CSDO Monthly Digest CSDO Notion Decisions Database    Stewards have a redefined role in the context of a protocol-focused DAO.

We believe that when a core operations practice is working well, it functions in service of an organization\u2019s vision and business strategy. It\u2019s with gratitude that we close out our final season recognizing that everyone involved in operations showed a relentless commitment to staying nimble and solving problems. It\u2019s because of this hard work that the DAO can evolve its operating system.  For that, we can\u2019t thank them enough and we hope a number of our super talented contributors can find new roles during our last season. Finally, we want to thank DAO Stewards for their constructive feedback. Since we are no longer requesting funding in S17, we propose that this budget not go to Snapshot vote, unless Stewards feel strongly that components of our refined scope should be voted on.

Here is something to read which I found interesting: https://blog.aragon.org/ai-daos-the-future-of-daos-powered-by-artificial-intelligence/ TL;DR \u2026 The article describes  six use cases sit at the AI x DAOs intersection, and are ordered roughly from soonest (near future) to most distant (far in the future):  AI bots and assistants: boosting productivity and improving products/services AI at the edge of the DAO: acting as token holders AI in the center of the DAO: interacting with the core contracts AI connectors within or between DAOs: forming a kind of \u201cswarm intelligence\u201d DAOs govern AI as a public good: increasing AI safety AI becomes the DAO: the AI owns a treasury on-chain.

I guess this might serve stewards as well as contributors and the following of your S17 goals:  Achieve a net increase in efficiency through our infrastructure, tooling and processes.

One thing I\u2019d really like to see from DAO Ops this season is an AI-supported Support Team. I hypothesise that we could get less tickets this way AND it would enable a basic support function on Telegram (which is what we\u2019re all craving) that directs folks to Discord if they need to interact with a human. An AI-assisted steward onboarding process could also be experimented with @shawn16400 I think experimenting with these two pieces would be a pretty easy lift for the team given our documentation in these two areas is already really good!

Have we budgeted time to adjust reporting for the new and somewhat more opaque structure - at least initially - of the post s17 DAO?  In order to make sense of budgets vs. those that we\u2019ve all experienced in the past (imperfect analogies of course) it would help to see spending by type of activity, such as:  Engineering & product \u2192 parts of the two new product workstreams  broken out - QA / integration testing - in our world that\u2019s sort of FDD & whatever QA is being done in house   Sales & marketing \u2192 part of PGF and part or all of MMM plus some of the product work streams as they absorb I think product marketing? COGS \u2192 other parts of PGF plus the support part from DAO Ops? G&A \u2192 I think the rest of DAO Ops?  As I write that, the idea of allocating expenses into more typical buckets looks pretty daunting to me.  So a fair answer might be that given the inflight reorg we just have to live with less clarity on where the spending is going for now?  I\u2019m happy to spend a little time getting hands-on if ok from a privacy standpoint with whatever accounting we use for reporting to see if I can use it to get to more standard ratios and so forth. I was going to ask about the ROI of all the work on Steward engagement. However - I see that you are looking at doing a survey of stewards that might surface feedback that could then be acted upon. Lastly - yet another question - does DAO Ops have a role in recruiting and other transitions?  I believe DAO Ops helped in recent hiring in FDD for example.  If so, I wonder whether reporting on that activity level could be useful as a way to further highlight the activities of DAO Ops in \u201ctalent management\u201d (cringe phrase) and also to explain spending and ROI?  Or are activities such as recruiting and so forth also being distributed into one of the two product workstreams? TL;DR - looks good to me.  Mostly wondering again about how or whether we can get to more granularity of reporting and if the broader DAO finds Stewards to be valuable.  Also looking forward to learning from the other feedback and questions here. ",

What do all of these line items mean exactly? What are \u201cSeason Reserves\u201d and how is that calculated? I assume Season Budget is how much DAOOps is planning to spend, and I assume Treasury Request is how much DAOOps is asking from the Treasury. Is this correct? What is \u201cunspent reserves\u201d and how is that calculated? Also, are the prices from the previous season based on historical price of GTC? As in, was the Season 15 Budget $293,148 at the time the GTC was allocated? Or is that number the (GTC allocated * current price of GTC). Thank you! Edit with answer from @safder (from discord): \u201cReserves are a part of the budget that is to be kept aside for things like paying contributors in the event of a decrease in GTC price, \u201cbridge\u201d spending in case the following season\u2019s budgets are delayed (this almost always happens), or any other unexpected expenses. The expectation is that this reserve will be mostly carried over into next season.\u201d ",

But the power of stewards is in direct proportion to how much token is delegated to them. In my opinion, it does not matter too much if we have a group of really engaged stewards but the most engaged stewards are not delegated token. Also, I know it is best to have very measurable goals for budgets, but I also think it\u2019s worth it for DAOOps to take a step back and try to analyze whether the steward/delegation model is even working/optimal for Gitcoin, as opposed to just assuming the steward model is good and figuring out how to make it better. ^ These are rough opinions and I am open to hearing differing thoughts on this.

However, this is a budget that (given where we are in the DAO\u2019s maturity) should be thought about critically. To take a step back, we\u2019ve spent a few seasons focused on reducing salaries across the DAO and it is starting to feel like death by 1000 cuts. Instead of continuing to decrease salaries season over season and still not be satisfied, can we instead take a more holistic view on how we\u2019d like to reorg the DAO to deliver on our EIs (even if these change, I think getting to the current ones should still be a priority) and both internally know we\u2019re a winning team and externally have support from our stewards and community season over season. When we look at these two posts from @kyle around budgeting and ideas for our Future Strategy I\u2019d like all of us to be more intentional about taking this thinking and applying it to our teams. 7 months after Kyle\u2019s post, GPC is still only 40% of our budget and DAO Ops is 12% of our spend. In addition, when I account for time spent, I feel like I do not spend 60% or more speaking about product in big group meetings (Weekly Workstream Updates, CSDO, Gitcoin Gathering etc.). How can we reorient the DAO to spend majority of our focus building and supporting the protocols vs everything else? What are the critical DAO operational roles we need right now to support the product?  Support and the Knowledge Base Governance / Steward Management Tooling support (part-time)  Our most valuable resource is time and I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019re spending it well across the DAO. I appreciate everyone on this team but as a pre-revenue or token utility team I\u2019m not sure if we need this many people each with such specific roles and I urge the team to take the time to drill into a few key areas of focus that support protocol adoption. This isn\u2019t an easy conversation to have but I\u2019d like us to think critically about what is best for the DAO right now for long term sustainability. ",

                    "content": "To start, I want to clarify for the audience that I am reviewing this budget in the role of a steward who is assigned to review DAOops S17 budget. This feedback is intended for the \u201cDRAFT\u201d phase of the review process wherein feedback still has an opportunity to work its way into the proposal before it is posted as an \u201cINTEGRATED\u201d proposal and put up for vote on Snapshot. I am hesitating on supporting this budget as is. Here are a few key reasons:   The increase in in the seasonal budget amount for the last 2 budgets during a time when the CSDO agreement was to have \u201clighter\u201d seasonal check-ins because we are focusing on launching the protocol and committed to with the expectation that we keep our budgets flat.   There is a lot of \u201cextra\u201d in the likely projects/tasks and the most important work doesn\u2019t stick out.   I would like to see more concrete planning in terms of the DAOops plan to break into end to end accountable scopes of work.    Increase in season budget total Perhaps this increase is due to team retreat expenses? I can\u2019t tell from this document. I do know we hired a technical support lead. This specific call out would help me understand and justify an increase. Overall, I\u2019m not personally happy with breaking the commitment to keep flat budgets with the lighter check-in to the tune of almost 30% over two seasons! However, I do not know if the reason is legitimate due to the budget not taking space to call out the NEED for the increase.  Most important work doesn\u2019t stick out It feels like a group of individuals with individual accountabilities and not a team. This is a mistake I have made in the past and @tigress has been great at pushing FDD in the right direction. As I read this, it feels like it comes from the same place where our problems have - a need to justify the value of the individuals rather than the value of the team. I\u2019m not sure what part of our system does this, but it is very clear when you look at the budgets of the workstreams which have little fear of a poor outcome when the vote happens vs the workstreams which have much lower delegation or influence. This is a symptom level problem and can easily be fixed. However, understanding the root cause is MUCH deeper than a DAOops bugdet problem. My intention in calling out the root problem is to allow others to recognize a systemic issue while also HELPING this workstream to mitigate the problem.  No future planning for post protocol launch I\u2019d like to see a future plan for end to end accountable workstreams I do not expect you to change structure this season. Other budgets either have addressed the issue for this season or are painting a picture for the future. What might DAOops look like? It occurs to me that almost all the functions that DAOops is responsible are in support of key stakeholder groups:  Governance = Token Holders & Stewards People Ops & Tooling = Contributors Support = Users  Are we putting the right amount of effort to each of these constituencies? Does the DAOops cover over multiple distinct scopes of work provide positive sum results? DAOops could be more proactive in addressing upcoming issues Another item not mentioned here is that CSDO has an issue coming up that will likely benefit from a proactive response. As FDD dissolves, this means a change in the representation at CSDO. Which workstreams will have 2 representatives on CSDO? What if a workstream is only 2-3 people? As we approach having smaller workstreams, we have the opportunity to set expectations in advance rather than cause concern. Another example would be to address potential elephants in the room. With two of the top three token delegated stewards in the same workstream (GPC Passport), the move to push FDD to split up would have also consolidated CSDO power. I am stepping out of the role, so this is not an issue this time. I would like to see us learn from this potential problem and have DAOops proactively find solutions. Example 3 - It is clear to see that the stewards are asking for a lower burn rate. (Though we don\u2019t know if that is a few louder ones on the forum or a majority or an informed minority\u2026) A lower burn rate has to come from somewhere. The largest token delegates are currently incentivized to push the other workstreams to downsize. Clarification based on feedback: This is intended to point out a systemic conflict of interest that I would love to see addressed. I personally believe that our current top delegates have Gitcoin\u2019s best interest in mind. Even the ones who are paid by a workstream and have a direct conflict of interest. We are lucky to have missionaries, not mercenaries. However, I also do personally believe that this systemic problem could be addressed head on BEFORE it turns into something ugly. Mercenaries will find their way into a system that has systemic weaknesses like this. That is why I bring it up here as an OPPORTUNITY for DAOops to better understand the tradeoffs of the current system and identify opportunities to mitigate risk and stabilize intended outcomes. How do we ensure that the most important work is funded rather than highest delegation workstreams staying alive? For the record, PGF did quite a bit of downsizing last season and I wouldn\u2019t want to see GPC downsize at this time. (They need a few key hires right now!) The intention here is to have DAOops proactively address the potential mismatches between the incentives and the current policy. I\u2019d be happy to take time to discuss this with the team. ",

What @krrisis and I read were thoughtful and urgent calls for DAO Ops to describe how it might evolve in step with the rest of the DAO. DAO Ops is one of the key partners and drivers of the evolution of the DAO, and we recognize that continuing to reinvent our workstream is critical.  We\u2019re very committed to working openly on this, and the following is an attempt to respond to each of the themes raised in the comments above based on what we know now. Next to this, we of course welcome more discussion and questions from Stewards and the wider community, so please keep them coming!  Focus/Prioritization     J9leger:  I appreciate everyone on this team but as a pre-revenue or token utility team I\u2019m not sure if we need this many people each with such specific roles and I urge the team to take the time to drill into a few key areas of focus that support protocol adoption.       DisruptionJoe:  It feels like a group of individuals with individual accountabilities and not a team.   Historically, DAO Operations\u2019 mandate was broad out of necessity, and in many ways the S17 budget still reflects how we have worked  in the past (i.e, DAO Ops taking on many of the general administration costs of the DAO). As we collaborate more on a DAO-wide reorganization and updated Essential Intents this season, we\u2019ll clarify our mandate (more likely mandates) across thinner business units. Potential outcomes of this revised focus are that some of the initiatives we lead today will need to be re-organized into different business units,  collectively managed by all business units, or automated away entirely.  Preparing for the Future State of the DAO     tigress:  What if DAOops was a little less about ops and a tiny bit more about driving innovation and experimentation?       DisruptionJoe:  I\u2019d like to see a future plan for end to end accountable workstreams   In short, we would love to see all of these questions answered in the DAO.  Accountable workstreams is also one of the reasons we once again made recommendations for a revised budget process in S16. We\u2019ve heard contributors of the DAO agitate for more of this kind of work over the seasons and with thinner business units in S18, there is potential for us to to play a more forward-looking role in setting the standards for contributor and financial health-related work. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be working with MMM and other other teams to experiment within our Support function, testing out AI-enabled chatting to support donors and grantees from our website.  Budgeting     epowell101:  Have we budgeted time to adjust reporting for the new and somewhat more opaque structure - at least initially - of the post s17 DAO?   Agree that an overall P&L would be helpful for the DAO, and based on what we heard in the Steward Monthly Call today, it sounds like you and @kyle may be collaborating on what this may look like. We\u2019d also welcome your input on the financial dashboard we plan to launch by season\u2019s end.     DisruptionJoe:  The increase in in the seasonal budget amount for the last 2 budgets during a time when the CSDO agreement was to have \u201clighter\u201d seasonal check-ins because we are focusing on launching the protocol and committed to with the expectation that we keep our budgets flat.   Thanks for calling this out, as this is indeed an important point to clarify. Our budget for this season increased because we budgeted for:  The newest member of our team, a Technical Support Engineer who supports the DAOs transition to the protocol, allowing the Passport and Allo Engineering team focus on its future roadmap, and The Gitcoin team retreat, a DAO-wide contributor event, following a request from members of the DAO to work on team cohesion and create opportunity for in-person strategizing.  DAO Ops is facilitating this event through People Ops and is carrying the cost for the weekend in our budget.  Without these new and one-time costs, the DAO Ops budget would actually have decreased by 25.6%. Important to note that:  We have consistently underspent while trying to remain highly flexible. Since S14 our budget has decreased 44% (approximately $608K in S14 to $389K in S18).   Hiring     epowell101:  does DAO Ops have a role in recruiting and other transitions? I believe DAO Ops helped in recent hiring in FDD for example. If so, I wonder whether reporting on that activity level could be useful as a way to further highlight the activities of DAO Ops in \u201ctalent management\u201d (cringe phrase) and also to explain spending and ROI?   We do! @safder leads hiring coordination across the DAO and  also supported GPC and DAO Operations in hiring last season. I\u2019m sure he would be happy to chat with you about it. I think that covers what we\u2019ve heard so far but look forward to more discussion. ",

I don\u2019t think this DAO is operating at a high enough level, and a lot of it is because of legacy structural decisions that did not pan out. I\u2019m sad about it, because I love the people in this work stream, especially Kris, I LOVE @krrisis, he is one of the most capable and dedicated people that I have ever had the pleasure to work with. We have gone to war together against the elements at burning man! We started Commons Stack together. He literally fainted in my arms once, and I broke my leg in his house! But in the end, despite our friendship, this work stream has failed to create a decent DAO process and the only option we have to hold it accountable for this is to vote no. Despite my personal reservations. There was an opportunity to reorganize the DAO to make it more efficient this last season and for some reason this process failed, tho it was in progress. I consider that a huge failure for this work stream to prioritize its core function over other opportunities. My biggest problem with the DAO operations is that the voting process is this weird yes/no on each work stream which makes voting sort of pointless honestly\u2026 The real DAO work is very very time intensive for everyone involved because it is just a lot of drama on forums and it honestly isn\u2019t so productive\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be this way. The structure needs to change. The voting experience is basically,  Workstream leads spend countless hours putting together a budget and a plan. Lots of people talk about it on the forum, many complain about the cost, many hours are wasted by all involved. Workstream leads incorporate the feedback if they want and repropose. More time wasted on the forum with everyone\u2019s opinions. Proposal goes up on snapshot\u2026 its yes/no and no one knows what would happen if the vote ends up as a \u201cNo\u201d Every major workstream passes it\u2019s proposal and the process repeats 2 months later.  There is too much uncertainty to vote \u201cNo\u201d on a critical workstream, and there is no incentive for workstreams to get scrappy and cut costs\u2026 they just need to ask for as much as they can get away with. To counter this, this season I am asking every work stream this\u2026 \u201cWhat would happen if this proposal didn\u2019t pass?\u201d Because I honestly don\u2019t know\u2026 and neither does anyone else\u2026 which is an issue IMO that DAOops should have solved a long time ago. There was one quarter where FDD did a bunch of votes to determine their actual proposal. That was the only time i felt like the DAO had any real strategic oversight into a work stream, and that was not a function of this working group. They did this on the fly\u2026 why does it take so long for the reorg to happen. So\u2026 What will happen if this proposal doesn\u2019t pass? ",

I agree with the overall point that the DAO needs to be reviewing and renewing itself. I don\u2019t agree with the idea that we should just pull the pin and see what happens.  What we know about what will happen isn\u2019t good for the people involved or the work that they are doing.  That\u2019s assuming that Stewards voting no would actually result in a rework of the proposal that was directionally equal to limiting or even ending DAO Ops.  Maybe that\u2019s your question? Overall I continue to feel as I did in the \u201cOver our skis\u201d post from November - it would be useful to be focused on finding product market fit and to adjust accordingly. Today we have some signs that we are getting there - which is great.  And arguably the split of GPC into two smaller workstreams may help accelerate the feedback loop to get there. That said - we don\u2019t yet have proof or the related predictability that would give us all I think a little more confidence that we should continue to spend. I cannot point at a burn-down chart afaik from either product workstream for example - although DevRel and others\u2019 efforts are increasing that transparency.  Similarly, we don\u2019t see quite yet an end-to-end view of where users come from and how they drop off - although I believe there was some analysis of where users drop off in an internal meeting this week, which is progress. And the dashboard that DAO Ops says they will be working on this quarter - we should already have it, assuming \"it\u2019 is along the lines of what has been discussed elsewhere. And - maybe most importantly - when chatting w/ a workstream lead yesterday we discussed that we don\u2019t yet have GTC utility or revenues.  Again, it sounds like from comments by @kyle in this week\u2019s steward call we are getting there.  Without that, we don\u2019t have arguably the most important metric or at least a clear north star metric. In short - rather than YOLO voting no - I would suggest we engage with the workstreams to help them work towards product market fit and, importantly, proof of product-market fit where that should include GTC utility / revenues.  I actually think there are signs that we are getting there including the very successful recent Unicef round and much else.  While I am all for fiscal discipline, I\u2019d argue that we shouldn\u2019t just pull the pin. Lastly - I sort of don\u2019t grok the comment  there was an opportunity to reorganize the DAO to make it more efficient and this for some reason failed.  The DAO is splitting one of the 5 workstreams into 2 and transitioning another - FDD - out of existence.  And of course, Moonshot was recently integrated into GPC.  So by the end of this season, 3/6 of the workstreams from last Fall will have been reorganized - and at least DAO Ops (and I believe MMM as well) are each indicating they are preparing for an upcoming slimming down, the shifting of team members into product-focused workstreams, and so on.  In short - the reorg is happening, with FDD acting as asomewhat as a canary in the coal mine this season. Sorry for the length of the response - I ran out of time editing. ",

But I can sympathize pretty well with the fact that a central inefficiency seems baked into the budget process - and there is certainly a lack of clear consequence to no-votes\u2026 It feels to me a bit like Gitcoin is a start-up that is forced to fundraise every quarter - stealing resources and energy away from the core work of building-the-damn thing  In start-up world it\u2019s well known-- if you\u2019re always fundraising, you\u2019re never building, and so where funding in Series A is a huge indicator of having won trust and achieved impressive traction - Series D round is likely an indicator of the opposite. But Gitcoin\u2019s got the funding- we already won- but every quarter there\u2019s a reset and we\u2019re failing to absorb the strategic benefit which drives companies to seek runway to begin with. Gitcoin has long ago won their initial runway and while quarterly check-ins on strategy and course-correction fuel progress, making it tethered to the budget (and therefor heavy on PR, and a source of safety-disruption for the individuals involved) means we\u2019re not really getting the benefits of running full speed at the goalpost\u2026 In practice I suspect that this is what would happen if DAO Ops\u2019 Budget didn\u2019t pass:  The work of community management, support, and people-management would cease to get done, or likely be done very incompletely by the other workstreams    A toll would be absorbed by the wider Gitcoin community- Discord rooms, Telegram chats, going unanswered. Gitcoin\u2019s biggest asset: its reputation-- would be severely endangered.   Extra stressors would be added to every workstream lead, and likely delegated partially to a few others besides, making the other workstreams significantly less efficient than they could otherwise be.   Morale would be challenged; not improved. Brain drain would result- recruitment of top talent where it\u2019s needed would become nearly impossible.   If the team is meant to be lean at the expense of in person and virtual connections (retreat budget, community calls, solid hiring practices etc.) \u2013 there won\u2019t be a team before long. @epowell101 I think I tend to disagree on your point that the way forward: \u201cwe engage with the workstreams to help them work towards product market fit\u201d \u2013 There\u2019s no \u201cproduct\u201d in the nebulous connections of a highly functioning team.

I think overall there seems to be some (very valid) frustration with how the budget process is currently run. Like @griff is saying, there is no granularity. We either take everything as it is (with some edits as a result of forum discussion), or we vote no and bar the workstream from the entirety of its funding. Also, in general, I think it is strange that we place ultimate budget oversight in the hands of community members without determining whether they have the prerequisite knowledge (both technical and contextual) to make these decisions. I think it would be best for us to separate priority decisions (what we think we should focus on), from monetary decisions (how much we should spend on the work we\u2019re doing). Quite honestly, I\u2019m looking at these financial numbers with no clue as to whether or not they are reasonable or not. How much do comparable organizations spend on this kind of work? What even is a \u201ccomparable organization\u201d in this case? These are questions I do not have the background to really answer, yet are essential to giving a balanced analysis of this budget. Further, the week or two we get to analyze these budgets is hardly enough warning to, in the event we are disappointed, say \u201cno.\u201d Ideally, we would like the workstreams to have some idea well in advance if they are \u201con track\u201d or not, as opposed to receiving that feedback all at once every quarter. In the spirit of that, I will vote yes (probably), but with the following stipulations:  DAO Ops prioritizes fixing the budget process to maximize the usefulness of community input (I do not believe this is on the current list of initiatives/projects) If a new budget process is not in place (or at least ready to be implemented) by the end of the quarter, then I will vote no on DAO Ops next quarter.  ^ Open to feedback on these stipulations. To be fair, my vote is largely symbolic, as it is small enough to be insignificant (side note: why assign stewards to review certain budgets if their votes are often insignificant compared to unassigned stewards?). However, I hope the overall thinking behind it will be useful in some way. ",

                    "content": "Thanks so much to all for the lively discussion under our proposal - while reading these I was nodding yes so many times. There is indeed a lot to solve with regard to DAO governance. The fact that so many Stewards are actively engaging under this post shows how much they care about our mission, and in all sincerity I can only say that this warms my heart, because we do too. This engagement also shows we are making progress: you are asking the hard questions, this is what DAO governance is all about. Operating a DAO is tough, as DAOs are a new beast and we need to find answers to some of these questions collectively - this is not something just Gitcoin is struggling with, all DAOs are. As @owocki mentioned yesterday, \u2018solving\u2019 governance is probably as hard as sybil resistance. I\u2019d even argue it\u2019s much harder: it\u2019s a key reason for why web3 is here, and it\u2019s definitely why I am here. DAO Ops\u2019 Impact So, with this intro let\u2019s dive in further. Starting at the top with @griff\u2019s comment as Jodi already responded to most of what is above.     griff:  I don\u2019t think this DAO is operating at a high enough level, and a lot of it is because of legacy structural decisions that did not pan out.       griff:  There was an opportunity to reorganize the DAO to make it more efficient this last season and for some reason this process failed, tho it was in progress. I consider that a huge failure for this work stream to prioritize its core function over other opportunities.   I agree mostly with the above sentiment, and there\u2019s a few things that come to mind. First one I do want to highlight and I hope this does not come across as defensive: I disagree that we failed at reorganizing. I think we have made immense progress under very challenging circumstances, as our DAO has radically evolved over the past year, and so have we - all while being a driver of many of these changes throughout the DAO, as you can see above in our Milestone Report and previous ones, see at the top of the S16 and S15 requests. We have been at the service of the DAO, rolled with the punches, fired and hired, and we did this while constantly reducing our budget (as Jodi points out here) and taking on more responsibilities, with a smaller team than we started out with. This is of course not sustainable in the long run, and this is starting to show. On legacy structural decisions, agree - the workstreams setup and the key governance elements were set up before DAO Ops even existed. Now we have CSDO and an internal decision making process, but even getting to an official purpose for CSDO and getting this ratified internally took a few seasons. Same on our Purpose and Essential Intents and many other key decisions. We also lost some valuable time along the way by having to rehire and restructure countless times in many areas, but hey, that comes with the territory. On the past season: I agree we failed at passing a new budgeting process, and we should have prioritized this even more, as you point out Griff, and as Lunacat says here:     Lunacat:  But the fact that this quarterly budget process is still a thing is a massive failing of DAOops more broadly.   True. A lot of work was done here though, as you can revisit here, which included a solution to what you point out here @chaselb:     chaselb:  think it would be best for us to separate priority decisions (what we think we should focus on), from monetary decisions (how much we should spend on the work we\u2019re doing)   So this is to be continued in the upcoming season. A very important note on this: it was a CSDO-level decision to stick with the current budgeting process one more round, as we are about to reorganize in S18, which will automatically resolve some of these tensions as it will increase granularity and the ease to say yes/no (more on this further down). This joint decision is one of the key reasons for our \u2018failure\u2019, but not the only one. We ourselves also recognized pieces were missing in this complex puzzle. On that note, this is a crucial call out. In comparison to other workstreams, DAO Ops is very often the catherder, but not per se the final decision maker when it comes to achieving its own(ed) outcomes. On the level of Steward governance processes (very much interlinked), I share @DisruptionJoe\u2019s sentiment that with Shawn we have some hardcore talent onboard to improve these and we already have, this is a major win only which started to materialize over the past season (so much coming up!). All of this is however no excuse, we have to do better. As mentioned, we need more focus, as @J9leger and @DisruptionJoe pointed out as well - we are doing too many things, which results in unsatisfactory solutions, or lack of time to properly execute projects within a season. We are currently picking up speed to move in the direction of thinner workstreams, as hinted at by @kyle in this post. For S18 we are considering splitting up in two workstreams, one focusing solely on Governance, another one on Operations, which includes people operations, tooling and treasury management. This will most likely also come with some leadership changes, as we totally recognize our own shortcomings in managing these key DAO processes. None of this is set in stone, but already sharing our current thinking for transparency\u2019s sake. We will heavily involve the Steward Council in our thought process (for changes to our and other workstreams). It is a work in progress and cannot happen overnight - we need our upcoming season for this - a lot will be discussed in person during our in-person Denver retreat, which is by the way also covered with this budget. And a lot has already been happening here - again, with deep strategic involvement of DAO Ops along the way, as Evan points out:     epowell101:  The DAO is splitting one of the 5 workstreams into 2 and transitioning another - FDD - out of existence. And of course, Moonshot was recently integrated into GPC. So by the end of this season, 3/6 of the workstreams from last Fall will have been reorganized - and at least DAO Ops (and I believe MMM as well) are each indicating they are preparing for an upcoming slimming down, the shifting of team members into product-focused workstreams, and so on. In short - the reorg is happening, with FDD acting as somewhat as a canary in the coal mine this season.   On the voting process I can only nod here and agree - all of the below is fair and it\u2019s massively inefficient:     griff:  The voting experience is basically,   Workstream leads spend countless hours putting together a budget and a plan.   Lots of people talk about it on the forum, many complain about the cost, many hours are wasted by all involved.   Workstream leads incorporate the feedback if they want and repropose.   More time wasted on the forum with everyone\u2019s opinions.   Proposal goes up on snapshot\u2026 its yes/no and no one knows what would happen if the vote ends up as a \u201cNo\u201d   Every major workstream passes it\u2019s proposal and the process repeats 2 months later.         chaselb:  Like @griff is saying, there is no granularity. We either take everything as it is (with some edits as a result of forum discussion), or we vote no and bar the workstream from the entirety of its funding.   First point is what I mentioned above: we will be, and are rapidly evolving into thinner workstreams, which will make it easier to give more granular feedback, as you will have less to grok at one time. Next to this we are continuing to revisit and optimize all governance processes, both internally (CSDO) as well as on a Steward level and are heavily investing in Steward engagement (getting more of your expertise helps us - the Steward Council is just one step here). Reworking the budgeting process and ratifying this is a key outcome, as you can read above. I am very happy that CSDO decided not to pass the linked budget proposal, as it was doomed to fail. But I know we would be held accountable for this today, and this is okay, and fair. I know none of these answers are \u2018enough\u2019, but we can only point out that we have increased our budget for governance, and it is our number one focus for this upcoming season. The upcoming structural changes to the DAO and increased focus on governance in and by itself will hopefully help to satisfy some of the questions here. On what will happen if you vote no     griff:  Is it\u2026 I think there are reserves\u2026 And maybe some would get absorbed into other work streams\u2026   Because we are making key decisions in Denver you will get news very soon on our reorg. So just not getting any budget right now would be highly disruptive. Our reserves will not be able to cover 3 months. One month is already used to cover one month of salaries, because we have a legacy delay in payouts cross-dao of one month (and yes, we know this needs fixing). So we have one month left, which can probably cover part of the monthly salaries, the expenses of our retreat. Things like Steward compensation, professional development and many other things will be paused. On this:     griff:  I wish we had more options than battle it out in the forum and then yes/no.   As mentioned, thinner workstreams and an adapted budget flow will make yes/no\u2019s less heavy and disruptive. We need those no\u2019s, we need Stewards who are critical! And we need to discuss with Stewards on how to get there. This is why we have the Steward council, and more initiatives are coming. Related to this:     chaselb:  Ideally, we would like the workstreams to have some idea well in advance if they are \u201con track\u201d or not, as opposed to receiving that feedback all at once every quarter.   We now have (1) monthly steward calls where we update you on progress - and continue to ask for feedback on how we can make these more interactive, how we can make adjustments as you see fit, we have (2) a biweekly Steward Council plus ad-hoc check-ins with Stewards, and we welcome all feedback in between, we also have (3) monthly CSDO Digests in this forum and (4) we have our monthly DAO Digest, which we are - yet again - revamping in this upcoming season. All of these are meant to involve and engage you. It is however, as @ale.k also points out above important to keep this balance between defending our budgets and actually getting the work done. But we are listening. So tl;dr - right now a no vote would mean that   a -either we rework the budget and cut some minor initiatives the top voters deem unnecessary and we repropose. b - we put up our budget on snapshot per initiative and pass what can get passed, rework the no\u2019s.   we cut major initiatives and many things come to a screeching halt in the midst of a reorg, and we spend a few weeks to explain what the impact will be of these cuts, leading to increased inefficiency. We then re-propose and pass this budget.   or we decide to entirely stop DAO Ops - which means emergency mode for the entire DAO, for some of the reasons outlined by @ale.k and @epowell101 above, so I won\u2019t repeat those (this response is getting very long ).   So we do hope our budget will be passed, ideally with no changes or minor ones - if you can let us know what to drop for this season. To be honest, this is not for the psychological safety of our contributors - although we do care, however as Stewards this is not your role - but because we have a lot lined up. Even if it\u2019s not always visible, we are making massive progress, operational change on a decentralized level is hard. We\u2019ve got work to do and thank you for the reminder. Once again, all the criticism is valid, and welcomed.  Both @Jodi and myself will happily jump on a call with any of you - @griff you have an unopened dm waiting for you, and a call scheduled with @J9leger later today. ",

Professional development of the team, or organizing a retreat, or reviewing access, setting up a discord logic, creating norms and values, documenting procedures and increasing internal and external transparency, \u2026 all of this might seem superfluous from the outside (even from the inside), but it is not.

There are obviously important responsibilities that this workstream is doing that have to be done, the other work streams can hopefully band together to support these tasks and retain some of the talent that lies in DAOops. This all sucks, there is no good solution, but the best of the bad options we have in front of us IMO is to vote no on DAOops this season  ",

One alternative might be to have a commitment to fund DAO Ops in S17 with the expectation there is no DAO Ops in S18 (ie, the current path FDD is on). The critical functions can be moved to other workstreams, or they can be dropped. ie, our support function is immensely important during our alpha rounds, but it should likely live within each respective protocol team to ensure they are truly internalizing the feedback they receive.

I think Governance should likely be it\u2019s own \u201cthin\u201d workstream. Contributor support such as People Ops & Hiring might be a part of this if we frame it as \u201cStakeholder Relations\u201d serving contributors, stewards, & token holders.     kyle:  our support function is immensely important during our alpha rounds, but it should likely live within each respective protocol team to ensure they are truly internalizing the feedback they receive.   I\u2019m not sure how this would work considering the communication flow for user support deals with inbound requests. It would be a huge change to have support saying, \u201cI\u2019m the Passport support, let me get you the Program Manager support\u201d. Perhaps this could be mitigated by moving from real-time support to scheduled support with a chatbot submitting requests to the proper channels. There would likely need to be at least 1-2 full time people as a hub to the product team support spokes.  Conclusion I would like to see this budget pass so we can jointly align on a path forward in person at EthDenver. However, I do see that a No vote isn\u2019t a no to this workstream this season, but could also be a request to rework this budget to lower its cost, clarify deliverables, or commit to future structural change. For this reason, I\u2019d urge any stewards planning to vote no, to directly address what requirements you have for an acceptable update to this proposal. ",

Occasional ideas pop up on the forum, but none of them are executed The steward program currently in place remains in place, and since no one is officially in charge of managing it, the program deteriorates in effectiveness over time After some seasons, someone wields their token-power in an unpopular way, and now we try to put a big band-aid on a problem we should have thoughtfully considered seasons earlier After many seasons, Gitcoin slowly devolves into what is essentially a digital, stock corporation. Our primary concerns become about increasing the price of GTC, rather than fulfilling the mission  ",

Please let us know in the comments below.   Hey @Jodi_GitcoinDAO  thanks for all the time and energy you put into this proposal.  I am in this particular workstream so I am refraining from commenting on the proposal itself. Related to the ratification of this proposal and speaking from a governance perspective, I think we need to take this to a vote on snapshot. Why?  It allows for the dissonant votes to be cast - those who disagree. An official vote eliminates/reduces the risk of later noise related to \u201cunilateral decisions\u201d. The vote authorizes reserve spending on projects vs. compensating for GTC fluctuations (the original intent of reserves) A vote hardens spending proposals under the \u201cAmount\u201d section A vote keeps the decision process consistent - introducing this precedent allows for future cases to argue for circumventing the vote.  With no funds changing wallets, I do not see a need a Tally vote, just the snapshot. I might be shooting myself in the foot, but from a principled governance position, this is what I think should happen. ",

I fully understand and share the frustrations w/ the DAO\u2019s current Governance/budgeting process and agree it needs to be fixed. The issue is, these are huge problems and solving them isn\u2019t something that happens in 3-6 months. as kris states:     krrisis:  Operating a DAO is tough, as DAOs are a new beast and we need to find answers to some of these questions collectively - this is not something just Gitcoin is struggling with, all DAOs are. As owocki mentioned yesterday, \u2018solving\u2019 governance is probably as hard as sybil resistance. I\u2019d even argue it\u2019s much harder   Blaming DAO Ops for not solving these problems is unfair and cancelling the workstream seems like the wrong approach to solving the problems IMO. Especially when this is something they are actively working on. I think a more reasonable approach would be to get DAO Ops to commit to trying X number of new governance experiments next season etc until we start to find better governance \u201cproduct market fit.\u201d There are many things that DAO Ops is doing a great at and I don\u2019t think we are giving enough value to those tasks. I suspect many DAO contributors are going to feel the pain of not having the DAO Ops team when all of the sudden no one is owning these tasks. Good operations are like the air we breathe, easy to take for granted when they are working well, but when they aren\u2019t, we feel their absence acutely.  @krrisis @Jodi @sandy_gitcoinDAO Lolu @Rohan @shawn16400 @kylejensen @puncar @safder @daikai joshuadouglas juliet @writeprovidence  Thanks for all the hard work you all have done I appreciate all of you so much ",

I suspect it\u2019s because the decisions we\u2019re trying to make collectively are not directly and frequently aligned to overarching organizational goals and we lose sight on why and how structures can serve us or hinder us season over season. Questions like: How does our budgeting process serve or detract from what we\u2019re trying to achieve as an org? How is our org structure serving the needs of our business goals? What functions should be consistently funded vs. project-based? I have not seen questions like these surfaced by DAO Ops and I think we will find that these kind of unanswered questions will continue to remain pain points but now there will be no one accountable to solve them. This move feels risky to me but I\u2019m also willing to set us loose and see what happens. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that we can all rally together to make it work and am hoping that in Denver we can lay the foundations for a more thoughtful reorientation\u2026 ",

                    "content": "Hey Chase, Thank you for your feedback.     chaselb:  I need the picture of a well-functioning Gitcoin post-DAO-Ops to be much clearer before I can vote yes on this new proposal. How do we make sure important, DAO-wide operation functions are fulfilled in S18?   We do not have a guarantee they will be, but we\u2019ll do our utmost to find an owner for each and every project by the end of this season.     chaselb:  Who will be in charge of the CSDO digest? What about other org-wide operations requirements?   We will probably transition some of the ongoing (and often invisible) tasks into separate RFPs in S18. We use S17 to get us ready for this in S18. The CSDO Digest will continue to be sent by @kylejensen for this upcoming season, together with scribing the various meetings. We\u2019ll try to \u2018package\u2019 some of the fantastic work he does into a request for funding for the next season.     chaselb:  I definitely agree that our governance model should be revisited from a first principles perspective. However, even setting that up will take effort. Who will undergo that effort if we don\u2019t have a place for it?   I share your concerns and personally also worry about the scenario you describe. Our top priority for this season is to avoid going into S18 without a clear plan for Governance. @shawn16400 and myself will work on building a clear proposal here in the coming months, and bring this both to CSDO and the Stewards. Even with changes to the process, I imagine here as well for S18 an RFP, unless CSDO decides we drastically limit the role of Stewards in the upcoming seasons, and actually decide to function in a more centralized way for the time being. So, a lot to figure out, but we will come up with a plan, just give us a few days to find our balance again, as the decision to not fund DAO Ops is not a decision by DAO Ops, it is a decision by the Stewards who have the most tokens delegated to them.

I\u2019m going to vote no because I think DAO Ops is important and defunding it completely without a clear path forward seems wrong, but I also am confident that we will be able to build back better. Thank you for your timely and clear responses kris. If you and @shawn16400 need an extra pair of eyes or need a hand on governance work at all please let me know. Shawn knows but I am always looking to help in that department. Thank you. Also, was there an off-forum conversation that spurred on the new defunded DAO Ops budget proposal? I know there was a lot of dissonance in the forum, but I find it hard to believe that this alone convinced DAO Ops to propose a new, unfunded budget request. In the spirit of transparency, I think it\u2019d be beneficial for the community to know how we got from the old request to the updated one. ",

The following isn\u2019t a critique on this budget, but is important to mention just as a record of where the DAO is today: For transparency purposes, the top stewards (by voting power) are:   @kevin.olsen (core contributor)  @J9leger (core contributor)  @kyle (core contributor) Austin Griffith (doesn\u2019t really vote)  @linda (not really sure, but not in core. early investor?)  @griff (an advisor/community member)  The fact that it takes a handful of stewards to create such a large restructure in a budget proposal is a testament to where we are right now. I think it\u2019s important to be transparent that, as it stands right now, this process is not community driven on the decision nor execution layer (although there is a lot of community input through discussion and social layers). Perhaps this fact is good. These stewards are very mission-aligned and perhaps serve as good guardrails for us to progressively decentralize. But the evolution of this DAO Ops budget is an important snapshot of how power and influence (both social and voting) works to produce decision within Gitcoin. ",
