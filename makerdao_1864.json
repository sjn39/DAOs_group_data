                    "content": " Proposal Idea - Utilizing Hats Protocol Hello everybody! After an exciting and invigorating week at DevCon in Bogota, I\u2019m happy to be bringing back a proposal idea for utilizing Hats Protocol. You can check them out on Twitter and Github. I am bringing this forward because I think there is a broad range of practical uses for the DAO, both in its current state and in the future when we may be trying to keep track of various Metadaos on-chain.  Hats Overview The top-down overview is that Hats Protocol enables a permission tree for organizations to issue \u201cHats\u201d (ERC-1155 token NFTs) as they see fit. This has a broad range of applications from token-gated chats, to assigning internal roles and responsibilities, and a ton of neat concepts for the delegation of votes and responsibilities. There are two key components to each \u201clevel\u201d of permissions on the hats tree: toggle (mint/burn) and eligibility (allows for future automation of granting and revoking Hats). While this proposal idea will be limited to making use of the toggle, it\u2019s not hard to think of various ways we could use eligibility in the future. Things like identifying vault owners on-chain, adding a layer of usefulness to any POAPs issued by Maker, and MKR voter tags come to mind. What I found most exciting about this structure is the ability to delegate these permissions down the tree. Because each level of permission can be allowed to issue levels below it, once the initial distribution of Hats is made groups wishing to build on top of the infrastructure from their minted hat can do so freely. Even cooler, because these are ERC-1155\u2019s the identical token ID can be issued to multiple wallets, which would give co-equal permissions to multiple addresses. At its core, Hats allows Maker to take some of the off-chain structures we are building and represent them on-chain. I view this as an exciting governance \u201clego block\u201d that, thanks to the permission tree, would allow different groups to experiment as they see fit.  Implementation Detail To get Maker familiar with the codebase and potential applications, I am suggesting that we bring forward a simple MIP to apply Hats to our current CU structure. At the most basic level, this would be taking the work done by SES here and creating an on-chain representation of this data with (at least) 3 levels of permissions. This would start with the Pause Proxy retaining the highest level hat, and issuing a sublevel to Core Unit Wallets, and a third lower level to CU facilitators. We would take the Budget Flow that we have documented off-chain and bring it visible on-chain. The most obvious use for this is budget transparency (as you could easily query the Hat\u2019s holders at different levels on an explorer such as EtherScan). But could also be used for an on-chain HR support structure if CU Facilitators were willing to issue hats to their contributors.  Request for Feedback/Questions I think the natural point of expansion could be allowing the fourth level for contributors, expanding the second level to also include auditor\u2019s wallets and Recognized Delegates, and adding automation to track on-chain participants. However, I think there is wisdom in setting an achievable goal (in this case taking SES\u2019s budget flow work and bringing it on-chain) before worrying about all the ways different contributors can use the technology. So, what do you think? Is this idea MIP ready or would you like more details fleshed out? I intend to get this idea posted as a MIP to be eligible for the January Governance cycle assuming there is not a strong pushback against doing so. As part of the Collaboration with Hats, GovAlpha has offered to take care of the submission and MIP maintenance of this idea in exchange for the Maker-specific developer work that would be done by the Hats team. As always, feel free to drop your questions, comments, and/or concerns here or shoot me a DM if you aren\u2019t comfortable mentioning them in public! Edit: CCing @Recognized-Delegates and @Core-Facilitators if you have any feedback that would be good to know before/while drafting this proposal idea into a MIP  ",

Give it a look. If this seems interesting, we\u2019d be happy to line up a call and set up white-glove. This is a free tool and service and part of our commitment as delegates for MakerDAO. ",

                    "content": "Hi everybody, I\u2019m Spencer, one of the co-founders of Hats Protocol. We are excited about this proposal and conversation, and want to weigh in with some of our thoughts. One of the inspirations that led us to build Hats Protocol is the recognition that many DAOs today struggle to find the right balance of concentrated responsibility vs decentralized control. The former is necessary to do effective work, and the latter is crucial to all of the benefits of being a DAO in the first place. We believe that, with this proposal as a starting point, Hats can introduce a DAO-controlled role and permissioning structure into Maker operations, with the benefit of introducing greater Core Unit accountability to MKR holders and enabling clear designation of operational responsibility \u2013 all without sacrificing decentralized control. In particular, we believe that using Hats can help improve organizational development by:  increasing role clarity and visibility; both for core units (and/or meta DAOs) and individuals creating more flexibility in roles and permissions management within Maker operations reducing governance overhead by automating some of the above via on-chain logic, such as automatic role expiry or conditional revocation of roles/permissions helping Maker benefit from the productivity of individual responsibility without the risk of entrenched power  With respect to performance management, imagine a future state where Core Units\u2019 responsibilities and permissions are tied to clear KPIs for Core Units, and/or where eligibility for certain roles is tied to earned reputation within the Maker community. We really like @prose11\u2019s recommendation to start simple and then let additional structure emerge based on the needs of Core Unit facilitators. The structure of Hats as a tree is a really nice property here, since any Core Unit or facilitator with a hat can (if they wish) create additional hats below it to further delegate responsibilities, allowing a governance structure to emerge organically as and where needed, rather than any single entity pre-designing it from the top down (or requiring DAO-wide consensus on the same). We\u2019re excited to work with Core Unit Facilitators \u2013 including @prose11 and @nadia \u2013 as well as the Delegates and broader community to help Maker as best we can. We\u2019re here to answer any questions you may have. < tips cap > ",
