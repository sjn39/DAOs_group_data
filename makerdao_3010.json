BTC/USD ETH/USD LINK/USD YFI/USD DOT/USD SNX/USD FIL/USD ZEC/USD UNI/USD COMP/USD AAVE/USD CRV/USD NXM/USD XRP/USD SOL/USD AVAX/USD XTZ/USD  What will this Oracle be used for? These oracles will be used as the reference oracle by dYdX\u2019s Layer 2 perpetual protocol built on top of Starkware. General comments by proposer dYdX and Starkware have already started working with the Maker Oracle Team on implementing an oracle solution using Stark Signatures. This proposal represents an overview of the initial markets dYdX aims to launch with. Importantly, dYdX and Starkware do not require a new Ethereum contract to be created for each new price pair. Only the feeds must be updated to check and sign these new pairs. In addition, since there is no contract, no whitelisting is necessary. Customer(s)  dYdX Starkware [email\u00a0protected]  Whitelist  TBD. We are not requesting any address to be whitelisted for this implementation at this time, nor do we expect to ask for any address to be whitelisted in the future as it relates to this MIP.  Requirements For each address to be whitelisted: - Is contract source code verified on etherscan? TBD Is Oracle data used in a permissioned manner that would prevent parasitic behavior? TBD Is Oracle data written to storage? TBD If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? TBD If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? TBD ",
