                    "content": "I feel like I may have explained this to you before Bit, but on the off-chance I\u2019m misremembering here goes. Leaving a large gap between the current debt and the debt ceiling presents a risk if the price of ETH drops significantly in a short amount of time due to the delay on the oracle price updates. Specifically, (due to the 150% ratio,) the price would need to drop by more than 33% between oracle price updates. In this case, users can exit to Dai using the higher OSM price and abandon their collateral, which the system then has to liquidate at a loss. The upper bound for this risk is the difference between the current debt and the debt ceiling. Because of that, it\u2019s beneficial to keep them as tight as possible given market conditions.     bit:  Please put a poll or raise the limit further to 400M+.   I know you\u2019ve done signal requests previously, that would be the avenue to make something like this happen outside of the Risk team recommending the change. The risk team recommending action is the fallback if unexpected market changes crop up faster than governance is able to react through the non-emergency processes, that said, the emergency actions aren\u2019t meant to be a replacement for governance managing the ETH-A ceiling themselves. If governance want to see a larger buffer maintained, then that would be something to signal for. ",

I think those moments where the DC is hit during an ETH rally is the kind of situation where a lot of new users might be lost since there isn\u2019t enough DC to service them, which is a shame and might add up in terms of lost adoption if we keep doing it every week.
