I don\u2019t want to miss something important, but currently reading tons of EIPs that look like a DesignPattern, but not a Standard change or proposal. A Standard  requires a community\u2019s formal acceptance and release, but DesignPattern do not. I think we are missing a tag signalling what the EIP\u2019s Author is looking for. Is he looking for discussion? Is he looking for formal acceptance or consensus? I am open for better ideas, but I would definitely play down the number of EIPs we have - many of them are not EIPs at all. ",

I had an idea once that might help to mitigate the problem a bit: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/896 - it got some positive words - but never real traction. Also I am not sure how to roll this out. Perhaps a second attempt is needed as the pain is now even bigger? Ideas very welcome - I am still a big fan of the idea of splitting it. Not only for better structure - also because this EIP<>ERC thing really sucks in my eyes - sometimes you read ERC- - sometimes EIP-55 - clear naming and structure would be so nice also for this. ",

There are proposals, that will fall in many different categories at the same time. This shouldn\u2019t reflected by name, it should be reflected by tag (multiple tags). The EIP naming has only two goals:  to refer the proposal to signal, that this proposal SHOULD be reviewed by whole community.  IMHO, everything that should not be discussed by whole community, should not be an EIP (but can be other xIP). hmm\u2026 what about influencing groups and the \u201cstrange loop\u201d? this could be a way to structure the EIP discussion\u2026 ",
