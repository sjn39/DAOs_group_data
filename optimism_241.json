Yes. We are CC0. I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee?  Yes Project description: A 10K PFP project encouraging Health & Wellness in Web3 and beyond. 50% of mint / royalties donated to public goods funding! (Over 6E so far!) Project links: https://linktr.ee/optichads Additional team member info: Our dev, Distractionboy, is the cofounder of Optimistic Bunnies and is well known within the OP NFT community. Relevant usage metrics: 1,738 Unique Holders 4,994 Trades 20E Trading Volume 6E+ Donated to Public Goods Smart Contract:   Optimistic Ethereum L2 Explorer    Contract Address 0x9B9F542456ad12796cCB8EB6644f29E3314e68e1 | Optimism The Contract Address 0x9B9F542456ad12796cCB8EB6644f29E3314e68e1 page allows users to view the source code, transactions, balances, and analytics for the contract address. Users can also interact and make transactions to the contract directly on...      Optimism native? Yes. Date of deployment: August 2, 2022 Ecosystem Value Proposition: Our focus is improving Health & Wellness in Web3 through our art. We have a very active and passionate community of Chads focused on self improvement in and out of the gym. Through community efforts such as giveaways and fitness challenges, we have grown to be one of the top NFT projects on Optimism by trading volume. As we scale we plan to introduce more and more benefits to our holders such as fitness and wellness/mental health counseling, discounts on protein products, etc.The art was hand drawn by myself with attention to detail in mind - with the goal of bringing more normal users, as well as degenerates into Optimism. As far as street cred is concerned, Vitalik has liked some of our posts regarding our donations to RPGF, and we are the only project on Optimism followed by Opensea. At our core we are a community of like minded fitness lovers and are working to bring more users into Optimism with our existing relationships and by building new ones. Optimism cannot succeed without a vibrant NFT community. NFTs bring new entrants into the ecosystem, hype, and stickiness. These are things we need to develop and foster together!  99141200\u00d71200 149 KB  Proposal for token distribution: We\u2019ve partnered with https://quest3.xyz/ a Web3 Quest and event platform, and will use their service to do a series of fitness related contests where we can reward our NFT holders OP provided they completed the tasks. The Quest3 incentives would be the first of their kind, essentially the NFT community\u2019s equivalent to DeFi\u2019s incentivized liquidity mining as I see it. For verification we are able to review submissions manually through the platform before rewards are dispersed.We plan to use some of the funds to set a reward of 1 OP for users who follow our social media channels.This direct marketing approach is a more effective and efficient use of capital by leveraging Web3. The result should be exponential growth and awareness, and a positive network effect. We would like to have a series of weekly quests over a period of 2 months, beginning with a contest that rewards holders who have done a certain amount of steps, followed by a pushup challenge the next week, etc. We would allocate 100% of our OP allocation to these quests. We will be using our own NFTs and Eth from royalties after the incentives are complete to continue these challenges and keep our community swole.We already have a strong following and track record of Discord and Twitter challenges. So we hope to use the funds strategically, as we\u2019ve done before to drive volume to Optimism. NFT projects such as OptiChads in turn benefit Public Goods funding and the ecosystem as a whole. co-incentives: 50 NFTs to the top addresses with the best completion rate ",

We could airdrop OP to our users as many DeFi protocols have done, but with what we are asking for (50,000 OP) we can only airdrop 31 OP between all of our holders before quickly depleting the funds. Getting this proposal passed would be huge for the OP NFT Community like you said, so we wanted to be precise and realistic with what we were asking for and how it would be given out. I am curious what other people think about this, but it\u2019s not possible to do a meaningfull airdrop with only 50,000 tokens and I am fine with that number for challenges and to get the ball rolling for the NFT community. As far as \u201cthe team holding all the funds\u201d we kind of have to in order to disperse them to the community with the Quests. With the donations we have already made to RPGF we have established a lot of credibility in the Optimism community already, and we aren\u2019t exactly asking for a Lambo so the incentive is high for us to keep building.

Although, I\u2019m a bit curious on how to manually check to verify the participants to see who are eligible for the rewards. I\u2019m not sure if all those health applications can be tricked to count false steps without actually walk such as using a fake gps app. So, it would be great if you can clarify on the verification process. Also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to reward $OP for random users who just follow your social media channels. People can create multiple social accounts to follow to receive $OP. It\u2019s just a way to increase followers who may not care about the community and will probably unfollow after they receive $OP. Perhaps, giving $OP to verified NFT holders might be a bit better, however, I don\u2019t see the benefit to the community in the long run by just giving $OP like this, even to the NFT holders. ",

                    "content": "Hi thanks for the feedback. We will try to tailor the rewards to avoid sybil. We can require video submission for some tasks. Things like steps can be faked but the rewards are going to be per holder that meet a threshold not per step and will be extremely conservative with distribution. With our current holders we can do 4 OP per week initially and increase rewards depending on the percentage of active users. We only planned on allocating a small number of the tokens (500 - 1,000) to direct marketing. I think if we set multiple assignments (follow us on Twitter, Discord, retweet this post etc while requiring a unique address it it will prevent sybil, or at least make it extremely time consuming since the reward is so small) Again this is an experimental form of marketing but I do think it is more effective than most other forms (like paid shills) given the amount of capital we are allocating to it. I would add that to even claim the OP they would need to have bridged Eth to Optimism for the gas and signed up to the platform so it should attract more real users than fake ones. It\u2019s a very minute and experimental concept that we added to the proposal but it is ceartinly not the focus, and we can remove it without affecting our core idea which is fitness based rewards. I would be curious what other people think about it since it can also have huge benefits as well.  It really depends on what kind of people follow us and whether or not 1,000 more followers would cause a network effect down the line. ",

Oh well, maybe it\u2019s time for me to consider exercise regulary TvT. Also, I think providing $OP for people who follow social media channels is ok if you consider that they must do other quests like bridging ETH to Optimism that you mentioned as well as joining OptiChads guild or something like that. Providing $OP to a person who retweet post or creating Chads meme with the most likes may be one of the ideas.     ",

Grant Proposal Template   OP received through the Governance Fund should not be sold by the grant recipient. This \u201cno sale\u201d rule:   Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates and any other related persons. These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.  Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly or privately. Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.  Does not include using OP to incentivize usage. Providing OP as liquidity mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.    Is it possible for OptiChads to continue paying its fixed cost and exclude it from this proposal? ",

It is a unique application of DeFi on-chain incentives but in this case applied to an Optimism native NFT project which is in my opinion much stickier than DeFi as these projects are community oriented in nature and so I would expect to see higher user retention rates. I would also be interested in the possibility of calculating a new user acquisition cost as I see that being quite low as well. The only concern I have is that certain users will try to game the system and collect a majority of the rewards. Maybe there is a way to tie the maximum amount of rewards to the number of Opti-Chads owned per wallet to facilitate a more even distribution? No need to come up with a solution just food for thought. I am happy to support this proposal, as personally it sores quite high for me on the grading criteria we have laid out as the NFT and Gaming Governance Committee:  The ROI potential of funding each proposal (we want to use our $OP as efficiently as possible. The winner of the L2 wars will be decided ultimately by how efficiently the network can allocate capital) Is the proposal prescriptive enough to prevent mis-use of $OP token funding and does it drive sustainable ecosystem growth? Amount of OP requested (with ROI taken into account) Whether or not the project has launched on Optimism (and if OP native)  ",

Please dont forget to summarize the feedback and changes your have got so far. I see that this giveaway is native NFT gated. What do you think about letting users without NFT participate in this campaign too,  rank them on the basis of their activity and reward top 50 or 100 by giving a Optichad NFT. You can also consider this as a co-incentives.  Here is an example:-     Dicaso:  they completed the task   I assume these task are health related activities, so,  NFT holder :- they just need to complete that specific task Other users:- their ranking will increase proportional to number of time they are doing that specific task in that defined period.  This of course will increase your manual work but impact could be significantly higher. ",

On the other hand, I like the proposal, made some quick research and it sounds logical that 1.8k holders and 50k OP has been requested. We shouldn\u2019t decide on our feeling here.should keep a reasonable ratio between risk/return to the ecosystem. My vote is FOR ",
