Harming the network should be avoided at all costs. Raising block times has led to decreased overall network activity (total # of transactions decrease) while loyal customers are forced to pay higher gas costs. L2\u2019s and others who are required to use the network should be encouraged to not punished. Its actions like these that push users to competing networks. The #1 goal of all Ethereum developers should be to benefit all Ethereum users and stakeholders. This whole difficulty bomb thing where some developers try to use harming the network as a threat to blackmail other developers to work faster is childish. It was meant as a thing to keep people talking/involved not to beat them over the head with a stick. Bad publicity due to delaying the bomb should be a tiny factor compared to harming Ethereum\u2019s users. The bomb does nothing to make the merge come faster developers are not children. They are working as fast as they can and understand the importance of Ethereum development. The threat itself is also stupid as companies rushing their developers has generally led to tragedy in history. Cyberpunk 2077 being a prime example along with the DAO and Fallout New Vegas. I have heard people claim that developers are not being \u201crushed\u201d but if thats so then why are we trying to time a bomb that will greatly harm Ethereum users and the merge to be weeks apart? The Merge will happen when its ready and has been fully tested. The bomb will not influence it. The linked article is a great reference Why rushed code and projects doesn\u2019t save time ",

If anyone here could point me to an already-existing formula to do this, that\u2019d be much appreciated. @timbeiko mentioned Wednesday in the blog post which makes me think a script for this already exists.

You can use https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/15050000 to see a rough estimate, but it will change according to the current block time. If all else was equal, block times would not change so quickly, as the difficulty added by the bomb only increases every 100k blocks. The issue seems to be that if hashrate decreases, the effect of the bomb is more pronounced, and increases block times even if the 100k blocks have not gone by yet. ",

Perhaps another approach would be to ignore difficulty altogether. I have data on inter-block times from Arrow Glacier and Muir Glacier. Do you think if I get the exponential function of both of these curves and extrapolate them onto Grey Glacier it would reflect the time bomb\u2019s impact on block time? In other words, I would just model out the exponential increase in block times using inter-block times from previous hard forks. This approach might be more accurate as it accounts for hashrate volatility, which also impacts inter-block time  ",
