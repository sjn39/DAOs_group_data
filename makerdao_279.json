                    "content": "At @SES-Core-Unit  we believe that for the crypto industry to truly reach its potential, we must be able to scale up and onboard significantly more developers and technical talent - in a sustainable, repeatable and systematic way, regardless of crypto market cycles. MakerDAO contributors are at the heart of a healthy ecosystem and an important moat that we seek to actively grow and retain. Our research project X-Ray focuses exactly on that - looking for the best practices in developer relations and coming up with the solutions that can help us address detected bottlenecks. We\u2019re excited to share with you our first major report on benchmarking. This is a result of research work including expert interviews, team surveys, desk research & data benchmarks with valuable contributions from across the industry. Let\u2019s highlight some of the key findings that the research has resurfaced & the next steps we see for MakerDAO specifically: In the first status update, we collected the awareness, onboarding & retention challenges and metrics as viewed by experts: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QTUxlH-pWcWmtx4sZlGvVMWzO1nIahQ9?usp=sharing Following that, we surveyed 42 crypto projects across 9 different sectors. Teams from projects such as the Ethereum Foundation, Aave, Uniswap, Balancer, Yearn, Curve, Zerion, Gitcoin, Tally, Graph, Opyn, Status. Every team respondent has been involved in the developer onboarding process and helped us identify the most useful strategies & tactics across the funnel and why they work. When it comes to developer awareness efforts, hackathons, grants, and meetups were mentioned as the most useful methods. At the other end of the spectrum, sponsoring events was considered as the least useful method.  Documentation, tutorials, and grants are ranked as the most useful in onboarding new developers in an ecosystem. Other useful methods included mentorship and dev support chat.  Crypto teams do not have solid dev retention strategies, which opens up for an opportunity in itself. We collected the teams\u2019 understanding of why developers leave or continue contributing to the project: Top retention reasons expressed were centered around: growth, culture, and compensation.  In contrast, developers\u2019 churn rates are mostly ascribed to a lack of contribution clarity, lack of project\u2019s real-life traction, multitude of opportunities outside the project, and reasons related to mental health.  We\u2019ve done additional desk research & collected data from best-in-class crypto ecosystems experiencing high growth, as well as adjacent ecosystems like FOSS & Fintech, and checked for biases with anti-pattern ecosystems. View the benchmarks (or make suggestions for the project or metrics you think we\u2019re missing): https://ses.makerdao.network/xray/benchmarks In the synthesis, we were looking for which of the shared strategies & tactics are reinforcing and thus sustainable. We have listed a collection of the sustainable developer awareness, onboarding and retention strategies together with the talent pool channels that fuel them. View specific strategies and examples here:   Pitch    Can crypto cross the chasm?: sustainable ways to attract, onboard and retain... Easily build and share beautiful presentations with Pitch.      Based on the insights gathered, we identified 10 strategic opportunities for MakerDAO to welcome more developers into the ecosystem and cement its position as the most attractive project to contribute in.  These opportunities are described in more granular detail and are available for anyone to explore more closely: https://ses.makerdao.network/xray/strategic-opportunities. Feel free to get in touch with us regarding any of these opportunities. Our research began with answering questions and to progress in the right direction, we will be guided by the following:  This concludes our large benchmarking study, which you can find in its entire length here: Pitch Next steps for X-Ray While we set the direction for MakerDAO how it can best attract, onboard and retain developer talent, we need to provide the community with more tools to do so. Our next objective is to prototype a data dashboard that will map the contributor journey and provide insights into how we are doing as an ecosystem over time. Our immediate next step to get there will be conducting a survey to map the journey from the developer angle - targeting developers inside crypto ecosystems, churned crypto devs, and also non-crypto developers interested in this industry.

Lastly, we want to give thanks to every single research participant that has contributed to these findings. Differences aside, witnessing the alignment around this big effort across the projects and ecosystems fuels us with energy and motivation.

                    "content": "Thanks a lot for your interest, Long. Let us elaborate on the points mentioned to add more context: This is the survey finding and the ranking of the different themes that came up from the frequency of the responses we collected from 42 teams: Pitch  Community culture in this context is meant as fostering a culture, where community members are interacting with each other at a high rate, especially between core units. For example one of the survey respondents shared with us: \u201cCare, intention, meaning, purpose. In a word: culture. Importantly, it is a culture we live, rather than talk about.\u201d There is another aspect to the culture relevant for many projects, including Maker - DAO culture:\tPitch When it comes to compensation, our assumption is that the compensation is a clear reason, yet survey participants chose to share with us more about other aspects they ascribed more power to retain the devs. Connecting it back to the expert interviews, compensation was the thing that attracted them in but the community culture (its strength & engagement) is that glue that kept them around. Here\u2019s a snapshot of  pros & cons of the high compensation as viewed by the experts we interviewed: Pitch  Regarding lack of project & individual clarity as a reason for churn: On the individual level, it is often connected with not knowing what to do and how to make an impact on the project. Issues of becoming a valuable contributor at the beginning, understanding the needs of the project is very much in line what Piper from EF shared with us in the expert interview:  Pitch On the project level, we mean issues of communicating the long-term vision (intrinsic & mission-oriented aspects of the project) that can lead to the lack of clarity for the contributors Pitch We think that the proposal for Dai reimagined as clean money and Maker turning towards mission-oriented DAO could really help to provide the community with the clarity and long term vision that aligns with one of the key findings from our research. Of course, there needs to be alignment across the DAO community in whether and how to adopt this proposal including sentiment polling & discussions like this one:  [Informal Polls] Clean Money - Exploratory Sentiment Polling ",
