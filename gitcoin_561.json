                    "content": "Recently, I suggested banning GTC airdrops from the Gitcoin governance process. Airdrops have the potential to incentivize bad behaviors (such as contributing to a grant in the hopes of receiving an airdrop in the future), and it may be better to remove said incentives outright. However, when I started trying to type up a formal proposal for this ban on airdrops, I realize that such a ban would not be \u201cenforceable\u201d\u2026assuming that all proposals are passed by a simple majority. Today\u2019s proposals cannot (and probably should not) bind the future community. So any future proposal to create an airdrop could simply include additional text to repeal all existing bans on airdrops. A ban on airdrops would therefore be toothless, and thus not worth the time of the community to vote on. What could be done instead is to create a proposal that mandates that any proposal to create an airdrop must receive a supermajority of votes (like, say, 2/3rd majority), rather than a simple majority. If the future community does feel that an airdrop is necessary, the future community must prove it by getting enough votes to reach that supermajority threshold. This should prevent the ban on airdrops being repealed by a simple majority\u2026but it does seem unfair to have a simple-majority proposal require a supermajority of votes to overturn. Would I therefore need to subject my own \u201cban\u201d proposal to that same criteria (must receive the same supermajority of votes to be enacted)? Or are there any other way to ban or restrict GTC airdrops that I am not thinking of? ",

Although you could use something like Tornado Cash or Umbra to mask this. All contributions to the round are visible, these are not at easily masked. Allocations within a round are secret. What does that mean in practice? Let\u2019s say I contribute $30 to project A and $10 to project B. An outside observer can see that I contributed $40 to the round, but cannot know which projects I contributed the funds to and with what ratio.

                    "content": "The negative incentive had been detailed before by @owocki here.  Specifically, I want to avert the following scenario: \u201cPerson X contributes to get formal compensation (tokens, access to service, etc.) from the project\u201d. This is considered bad behavior (likely because that person\u2019s contribution will be expensive and would probably be of lower-quality than contributions based on more altruistic motivations). There\u2019s a lot of commentary about trying to discourage this behavior. However, the commentary in question (changing the code of conduct, internet memes, etc.) only regulates the discourse - what is said publicly. It doesn\u2019t actually stop the incentivizing behavior itself. If someone is motivated to contribute in return for compensation, they will do so whether they post in a Discord channel or not. As long as said formal compensation is still theoretically possible, there will be an incentive for people to contribute simply to receive compensation in the future, even if it is unclear when or if it will come. It may even lead into certain people who desire compensation instinctively backing any proposal that promises them compensation, regardless of its merits. Only a limitation on compensation itself could address the underlying issue. If it is made clear that no compensation is possible, then this bad behavior will not exist. At this point though, I don\u2019t know how one would be able to make that guarantee.  When you talk about rewards/airdrops, are you imagining a specific token or entity?  When I first posted this thread, I was thinking about Gitcoin Governance giving out GTC to certain parties as a reward for their previous contributions. This could have been generalized to any organization giving out any sort of reward to people based on what they did in the past. ",

This is identical to what happens in the real world when, for example, a rich donor doubles every donation given by the general public. This type of \u2018reward\u2019 has no negative effect on the outcome of the QF mechanism. In this case, I consider GitCoin itself to be a matching donor. I think it\u2019s fine for GitCoin to incentivize donations by airdropping GTC. The type of rewards we need to address are rewards given by grant recipients to their donors. These type of rewards have a negative effect on the QF, and are, in essence, bribes.   The second point I want to make is that if the solution we come up with destroys the most important aspect of QF (its openness), we will have created the wrong solution. If, by fixing the \u201cwe should ban airdrops\u201d problem, we destroy the \u201coutside observers can verify the mechanism without permission\u201d we will have killed the baby in its cradle. Any of these \u201cwe the people all working together\u201d  mechanisms  (which QF is), must always support \u201c\u2026and we believe it works as designed because we can see how it behaves without asking permission.\u201d   ",
