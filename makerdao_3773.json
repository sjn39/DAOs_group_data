Paragraph Summary This budget proposal covers a total of 3 months (August, September, and October of 2021). During these three months, our focus will be on:  We have 93 opportunities at the last stages of the Growth Process cycle. We will drive these opportunities to the next step by launching adoption campaigns with our partners. Institutional vaults: we will find the proper implementation with the Maker community and larger vault users. Dai in other Networks: Increase Dai usage in other networks like Polygon and Solana.  Growth CU is asking for a total of 937,950 DAI over three months. 437,950 DAI will cover operations, and 500,000 DAI will cover the work we\u2019ll do with our partners in the latest stages of the Growth Cycle (adoption campaigns, educational content, etc.).  Motivation We are proposing this Core Unit Budget modification because GrowthCU requires an operating budget to fulfill its mandate.  Core Unit Name Growth (GRO-001)  Quarterly Focus - August, September, October  Progressing our pipeline. The general outline of our traditional cycle consists of the following phases: Outreach \u2192 Initial conversations \u2192 Project formalization and commitment \u2192 Integrations support \u2192 Pre-launch growth \u2192 The partner Launch \u2192 Maintenance and growth. We want to focus on the 93 opportunities in the latest stages of the Growth Process cycle during this quarter (pre-launch, partner launch, and maintenance) which requires the \u201cintegrations and marketing\u201d budget to execute the growth plans we created with our partners.   image1186\u00d7722 15.5 KB    Developing an Institutional Vaults strategy. With the feedback from Maker\u2019s largest vault users, we want to coordinate the efforts of the DAO to find the right solution for this need and pitch to all crypto-native companies this solution.   Dai in other networks. We are having conversations with Polygon, Solana, XDai, and Ronin about the strategy to increase Dai usage. We plan to continue doing this with other networks that are relevant to the protocol.    Team Membership The Growth team will consist of at least the following members during this quarter: \u2013 Facilitator \u2013 @Nadia  -Full Time- \u2013 Contributors \u2013 @Jenn , for North America and strategic partnerships -Full Time- @Matthew_Cooper , for North America -Full Time- @Lozadaluis12 , for LatAm -Full Time- @joce_chang , for Asia -Full Time- @Doo_StableLab  for Asia -Part Time- @Gustav_Arentoft , for Europe -Part Time- @MarianoDP , Growth strategy  -Full Time- @nanexcool , DeFi advisor TBD, for Europe -Full Time- TBD, integrations -Full Time- (as the Foundation\u2019s integrations team decided to be part of the SES CU and change their role, we need to find one resource who could help us with any technical question/advice our partners could have regarding the protocol. This person will also create technical documentation oriented to our prospect partners to interact with the protocol or Dai in other networks)  Quarterly Budget - August, September, October  Budget Breakdown  image928\u00d7710 46.9 KB   Remarks  Team remuneration The Business Development contributors should feel persuaded toward behaviors that will support the Maker Protocol strategy. That\u2019s why besides a base pay, each one of our BD persons will be under a compensation structure, a proactive process that forms goals around the account planning process and accounts for past performance/growth. The compensation structure follows these rules:  Two-quarters of goal achievement constitutes a 10% rise in base pay. Not meeting goals results in base pay stagnation. Less than 50% of goal number achieved results in 0 bonus for the quarter. Bonus pay is determined as a percentage of base pay and it\u2019s relative to the goal number\u2019s achievement. Bonus is capped at 100% of base pay.  Operations. To cover associated costs to legal advice and the enablement of all support applications. Travel and partner relationships. we need to have a presence in major events to develop our network, speak in conferences, maintain the ecosystem updated on what\u2019s happening in the DAO, and attract more companies and projects to the protocol. Opportunities. To support any contingency or opportunity that could appear, like a tier-one partner looking to execute a strategic action. Integrations and Marketing. When we are working with future partners, part of our job is to create a way to help that partner give more visibility to the new solution supported by the Maker Protocol. Sometimes the execution of that idea requires a budget for different purposes:  Educational purposes: When a partner wants to explain to their user/customer base about the new product, usually this is for creating content in a particular language oriented to a defined audience. Marketing purposes: Budget for executing a marketing campaign to help our partner expose the usage of the new solution. Technical purposes: Some partners that are not part of the crypto ecosystem need specialized help to integrate the Maker protocol with their systems.  After presenting the quarterly PnL, unspent funds will be returned, (including also the funds for the current quarter, May-June-July).  Budget Implementation Growth CU has a multi-signature wallet to administer the funds allocated to fulfilling the mandate. The details of this multi-sig wallet are as follows: Multi-sig Address: 0x7800C137A645c07132886539217ce192b9F0528e Budget implementation: Manual Payment Frequency: Transfers should be included in the first executive of the month. In the event of the first executive of the month failing to pass successfully, transfers should be included in the next available executive vote. Payout Dates: August - 637,900 DAI September - 137,900 DAI October - 162,150 DAI ",

We can\u2019t use our past experience within the Foundation because, during the last year, we weren\u2019t actively executing campaigns with our partners due to the Foundation\u2019s restrictions. We are also re-creating the Growth team because when we were part of the Foundation, we counted with the support of complementary business units like legal, design, marketing, and integrations. As a CU, we have to decide if we hire someone or wait until a CU is created. As for the differences between quarters:  image1430\u00d7214 14.7 KB   Base salary: We are hiring two FT contributors, one to cover Europe and another one to help us with the technical aspect of any integration. We are also hiring one PT contributor as a community manager. Integrations and Marketing: the first-quarter budget was to support campaigns for up to two tier-2 partners and up to seven tier-3 partners. Analyzing our pipeline, we know we have 93 opportunities in the last stages of our process, and we decided to support campaigns for up to two tier-1, seven tier-2, and ten tier-3.  We also added a budget for travel because the events are back. And we kept the same funding for operations because we will need it for legal expenses around future contracts with partners. ",

Let me try this based on what you have above.  image974\u00d7197 9.73 KB  Colors arbitrary, also probably could just go with full conversion to FTE based on 2080hrs/work year. My point with this is to illustrate what I would want to see from quarterly reports (encourage people to actually look at some company quarterlies btw to see what reporting regulations expect from public companies mostly to get a handle on what is reported how). Things I want to see are basically break downs of costs and Q over Q increases.   In the end I want to see how these changes are affecting not just the quarterly numbers but what they are doing to yearly numbers. I understand things are still being hammered out in terms of transition but understanding what is going on with the overall numbers from all CU\u2019s I am going to be asking same questions:   What is the average cost per FT position and if this can be broken down into PT and FT fine.   I also like to see it as a hourly as this gives me some perspective.   Please include any MKR compensation as a line item in compensation (as well as any other things - medical, retirement, bonuses, whatever)   The other specific expenses - break them down into line items and if they have numbers give a number.  In the above case I have no clue what a T1 integration/marketing campaign costs.   At least break these out so we can see what T1, T2, T3 integrations are costing and how this is changing.   I can only guess why I&M went from 75-500K/Q but this is a large jump I want to understand and get a handle on what T1 integrations cost and get a run on these.   Beyond this I just want to see the Quarterly full totals also extended to the year, and then the % increase Q/Q on each. Beyond that I am good.  I don\u2019t like seeing these numbers growing at 100% Q/Q so would like to have some comments regarding whether these numbers are expected to keep climbing as dramatically next Q or whether they are anticipated to settle. Thank you for endeavoring to satisfy my inquiry.    I look forward to seeing all these CU financial and activity/sales/expense reports come together into a quarterly that reads like a company quarterly report. ",

Growth is pretty good about giving us an update each week on newly completed milestones. My philosophy is that if the overall unit is performing, then only the total expenditure number really matters to the DAO. This unit in particular seems like a bargain for what we pay. If they stop delivering, we can take a closer look at the specific line items. But a $4 million annual burn rate seems in line with what they\u2019re bringing home to Maker.

I have no clue whether we are actually capturing greater or less of available marketshare (say wBTC for example) since we don\u2019t collect snapshot metrics of total wBTC available and how much of it is in our vaults.

Let me know if you find a magic lamp and get three wishes you\u2019ll share with the DAO.   Yeah a long time ago I was willing to put up the DAI Maker paid me (piddly 4K DAI at the time) for the Black Thursday report to get some matching funds for some solid analytics on auction performance, vault liquidation stats, keeper/bid data (stuff like in my BT report) as well as some user analytics. Makerburn doing a great job but there is still a lot of stuff missing. I was and am also for targeting vault users with surveys if they completed could get DAI back (in terms of removing fees - though this was a technical detail).  This way we could target specific vaults types, sizes of borrowers, usage whatever.   Try to get some basic feed back information from our vault users.

Right!   I mean we could just run without any changes to anything and save all this DAI\u2026 /s>  I mean just set the surplus to like 25% with a 25-50% burn along the way, change and everything will be fine in a few years. Given growth I think Maker is working too hard on stuff honestly.   I would have preferred some sort of MCD vN whatever specs document done, then bring the system up to that spec and freeze the implementation and go work on a Maker vN+1 so we can take what we learned and Make the next Maker version better vs. trying to change everything on the fly as we go along. Makes me think about a guy trying to work on his engine while in the Indy 500. ",

Since the proposal specifies payout, but does not precisely state the number of persons this covers (as they have yet to sign on), I think the proposal need to state that \u201cunspent funds will be returned\u201d. Same with the 500k for Integrations and marketing. And the 50k travel budget. Also - the proposal operates with incentives for performance - but Maker as an organization is not bottlenecked by the lack of business opportunities, it is bottlenecked by a lack of developers and even more by the need to audit every piece of code. So I assume the Incentives post is an internal thing? My apologies if my remarks are duplicates of what other people have been stating already. ",

Naturally, one tends to want to categorize things clearly, but the roles of both teams are intertwined. Marketing can help close deals by using their resources in different regions and connections built through conferences and outreach programs, while BD can work with partners on marketing campaigns to promote. One big difference here, though, is their focus. Marketing\u2019s work involves coming up with different campaign ideas, PR, messaging, brand building, communications, promotion, and other outreach programs, while BD\u2019s responsibility is deal-focused partnerships.

Typically in crypto that involves coordinated announcements on blogs both sides and media outlets, followed by a coordinated push on socials of both sides. It can sometimes go further with co-appearances on other channels such as Podcasts.   BD can get leads from Marketing as we get to connect with a many individuals and entities who may be interested in the service we provide. In this case, it could be professionals working in TradFi or FinTech firms who may be interested in opening vaults.

During the last stages (Integrations support, Pre-launch growth, and partner Launch), and with strategic partners, we co-create and execute an action plan and use the \u201cIntegrations/marketing\u201d budget on that execution. We break down our relationships with partners in tiers. The average quarter is intended to be 80% Tier3, 16% Tier2, and 4% Tier1 (reflecting a Pareto distribution). A Tier1 partner is the one that exposes Maker to more than 1m users (like Binance). A Tier2  exposes Maker to more than 100k users or opens vaults for about 100M Dai (like Ripio), a Tier3 would be almost all DeFi project at the beginning. Closing (when the partner integrates Maker) and executing a Tier1 action plan could take more than two years. This is because opening a DAI/fiat market in centralized exchanges (or companies) takes a lot of effort and coordination. First, we have to pass through a due diligence process and explain and convince different teams about why Maker is relevant. Then we have to solve various challenges the partner could have, like liquidity, education of their users, sometimes technical help for the integration, and then plan Dai\u2019s launching in that market. An example of a Tier1 action is the coinbase earn and learn program (now it looks like old news, and everyone does it, but when it launched was amazing!). An example of Tier2 is imToken integrating Maker Vaults and having 12000 users opening CDPs at that time. An example of Tier3 is what we did with Axie last year (play Axie, earn Dai)\u2026 which reminds me of the gaming initiative we -the BD team when we were at the Foundation-launched last year!!! We decided to call our team \u201cGrowth\u201d because we are not the regular BD team. Instead, we work together with our partners to integrate Maker in their solution, and we also help them executing the strategy to grow that product/service. How much cost the execution of a T1 plan? It depends on what we want to do with our partners. For the next quarter and based on our forecast, we estimate to spend about 60% on T1, 35% on T2, and 5% on T3. The action plan is not limited to a one-time campaign. Actually, the action plan comprehends every action where we actively have to support our partners to get traction of their solution integrating Maker (this actions could end in a month -for a T3- or will be executed during a year or longer -for a T1-), which means the current \u201cIntegrations/Marketing\u201d budget supports the planned actions with our partners for the quarter. We will present a P&L every month, but as we pay in arrears, the first P&L to post would be during the first week of July.     MakerMan:  As to growth. I honestly have no clue what is actually driving growth since we don\u2019t have any vault owner metrics other than how much DAI is minted by what vault. Honestly everyone looks at DAI - how about TVL locked from a Token or market perspective. ETH locked I don\u2019t believe has grown very much in the past year, while the value of that ETH has. These kinds of metrics are sorely lacking.   Our primary metric is the number of partners per tier that integrated Maker during a quarter, that\u2019s how we measure the success of our work. We plan to share with the community the results once we end the present quarter. We think that one way to integrate with the Maker protocol is opening a vault (like Nexo) other way is to serve as a distribution channel of Dai and generate demand for it (like the organic demand of Dai in emergent markets that doesn\u2019t depend on the DeFi summer).     MakerMan:  I was and am also for targeting vault users with surveys if they completed could get DAI back (in terms of removing fees - though this was a technical detail). This way we could target specific vaults types, sizes of borrowers, usage whatever. Try to get some basic feed back information from our vault users.   Can I contact you on RC to talk about this? I think it\u2019s super important to get feedback. Actually, the Institutional Vaults idea bornt on the feedback of our users.     Planet_X:  Since the proposal specifies payout, but does not precisely state the number of persons this covers (as they have yet to sign on), I think the proposal need to state that \u201cunspent funds will be returned\u201d. Same with the 500k for Integrations and marketing. And the 50k travel budget.   The payout covers 8FT and 4PT contributors. And a great suggestion, I will add it to the proposal.     Planet_X:  Also - the proposal operates with incentives for performance - but Maker as an organization is not bottlenecked by the lack of business opportunities, it is bottlenecked by a lack of developers and even more by the need to audit every piece of code. So I assume the Incentives post is an internal thing?   Yes, it\u2019s an internal decision. Besides the base salary, we pay a bonus proportional to the tier\u2019s distribution curve to incentivize growth. In case the aggregate achievement is skewing away from these ratios, what qualifies for each tier can be adjusted by the Maker Governance to bring it back in line. Btw, every Wednesday, I\u2019m in the Growth Office hours at 1 pm EST, happy to see you in there. ",
