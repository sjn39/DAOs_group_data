I see that a large part of the conversation seems to have happened here on the Magicians Discourse, especially @boris @expede @AdamDossa. I\u2019m having trouble figuring out where to jump in, and where things are holding, though. ERC-1400 (/ERC-1410 and ERC-1411) seem to have the most \u2018attention\u2019 from what I see, and I see that they\u2019re merged for review, but how volatile is that standard? I see a number of other offerings, and some uncertainties about how to best codify certain regulatory issues. I\u2019m playing catch-up with the threads here and in GitHub, but if there\u2019s anything else I should be doing, I\u2019d love the tip. ",
