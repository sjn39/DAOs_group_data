I am Retro from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU. Today, we are hosting a collateral double feature. I am joined by Renuka, and Walker, from Oasis Pro Markets to discuss their two MIP6s applications involving the onboarding of RWA. According to the collateral status index, both applications are currently in the application stage, and their green light polls are scheduled to go live on May 2nd. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

What are reasonable comparable transactions, and how were they structured and priced? 20:32 - Teej: Regarding the ATDC deal, the collateral is both the receivables from the services agreement and an interest in a USD account that pulls up to 60% of energy cost savings? 22:34 - Eric Rapp: What are the details on the servicing contract and energy savings mechanism backing this transaction? How are these cashflows being allocated? 23:53 - Kianga Daverington: What form of guarantee is being provided by the individual? Is it given in his/her natural name or an entity? What is the governing law for this guarantee? 24:56 - Christian Petersen: Has India Power had any preliminary discussions with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on USD access for debt repayment? 27:07 - Kianga Daverington: Will someone at MakerDAO be able to verify the guarantor\u2019s assets? What kind of diligence can we perform here? 29:56 - Teej: Is there any reason to think that a market rate should not be equivalent to the outstanding rate as long as the credit rating of IPCL has not changed? 33:15 - Teej: These are emerging market and energy assets; esoteric assets. A methodology would be helpful and required for token holders to take these risks. 37:39 - Eric Rapp: The community would like to know where the market is and what is reasonable. It is easier to think about how and where the community would want to bid versus where the market is. 39:50 - ElPro: I read about risk-sharing agreements in project financing between parties, such as a power purchase agreement (PPA). Is that possible with any of these two MIPs? I also heard about an EHCC subsidiary known as an ETCC that uses a build-own-operate. Is this the case with ADT? 42:49 - Retro: What is the best way to get a hold of you?  Closing Comment   Retro 46:18  Thank you to Oasis Pro Markets for the work on the MIPs and for making yourselves available today. We look forward to seeing how the green light poll goes.
