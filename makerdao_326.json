Layer 2\u2019s are currently a hot topic in DeFi, and the PE team has created a way to transfer and mint Dai on L2s as well as other L1 blockchains. Users can currently transfer Dai between Arbitrum, Optimism, and the Ethereum mainnet. In the coming months, new L2s will be added and minting will become available on networks that have deployed multi-collateral Dai. Can\u2019t make the call? No problem! Keep your eyes out for the recording here:  Youtube  Leave your questions below and we\u2019ll see you on the call! @Protocol-Engineering @Recognized-Delegates ",
