                    "content": "Many of you may know about our Cross-Stream DAO Operations, or CSDO, powerhouse team. If you don\u2019t, CSDO is a group of workstream & initiative leads that come together to ensure alignment, transparency, and integrity across the DAO. These troopers do everything from starting important conversations to ratifying organization-changing proposals, each one aligned with our essential intents & purpose and aiming to make Gitcoin a better place to work. With all the world-regenerating we\u2019re doing - from questioning the foundations of our knowledge to building scalable infrastructures for public good - it\u2019s easy for things to get lost. That\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing this monthly CSDO Digest! We\u2019ll be breaking down all the most important CSDO outcomes from every month, so let\u2019s dive into October!  DAO-Wide Updates  Team Retreat DAO Ops\u2019 Jodi began the discussion around a team retreat around the same time as ethDenver and Schelling Point (March 2023). The consensus was generally positive, with members from PGF and MMM joining in to help with planning. More updates to come!  Branding Redesign MMM\u2019s CoachJ expressed concern about meeting the current launch timeline for the brand redesign due to the workstream experiencing many roadblocks. Moving forward, MMM will own this initiative while using a participatory design approach, soliciting feedback from different workstreams when necessary. The hope here is to get the initiative back on track and reduce the expected completion timeline from 1+ years to 6-8 weeks.  Proposals  Planning Cadence The planning cadence proposal from September didn\u2019t pass, but it did lead to two further proposals by GPC\u2019s Lindsey and PGF\u2019s Scott. Lindsey voiced concerns the current planning cadence and budgeting process, and proposed additional allocations for budgeting that would allow workstreams to receive 1-2 months of runway while CSDO continued addressing the operational inefficiencies. She suggested workstreams put forth an OKR update and a request for continued funding at their current burn rates, giving each workstream autonomy while CSDO focuses on solving the process problems. Scott furthered this idea by proposing that S16 be an \u201coff\u201d season to simplify the budgeting process. Workstreams would propose the same budget for S16 along with updates toward milestones. This allows the DAO to focus on mission-critical initiatives, like planning for the protocol launch. You can read the full passed proposal here.  In-Person Leadership Retreat FDD\u2019s Joe proposed an in-person leadership retreat for November. The proposal was tabled due to coordination & timing difficulties, and it was decided to link this to the upcoming full team retreat, happening in February \u201823. You can read the full failed proposal here. Pods During ethBogota, discussions were had surrounding the efficiency of cross-workstream collaboration. These discussions led to the introduction of a new type of working group that we\u2019ll be experimenting with within the DAO: Pods! Pods are temporary working groups for cross-workstream contributors where they can collaborate together on shared initiatives. The aim here is to shift perspective surrounding the DAO\u2019s approach to cross-workstream collaboration, and not meant to introduce a new organizational structure. You can learn more about Pods and their initial proposed structures here. You can read the full proposal written by DAO Ops\u2019 Saf here.  Key Discussions & Thoughts  Planning Cadence FDD\u2019s Joe organized a team workshop to tie up loose ends and put forth additional documentation surrounding the next steps for the DAO Operating System and budgeting processes in response to the proposal for \u201clight seasons\u201d passing. Moving into S16, the focus will be on improving budgeting processes and re-evaluating workstream transparency & collaboration. You can read the additional thoughts here.  DAO OS DAO Ops\u2019 Jodi suggested using the 11/4 strategy call to begin the conversation surrounding workshopping the DAO\u2019s operating system. Scott chimed in wondering if now is the right time to focus on this effort when each workstream is aligned on their immediate S16 goals, focused on the launch of the protocol. The DAO OS is a large and ongoing conversation that is reprioritized in S16, spearheaded by DAO Ops.  Code of Conduct Policy Committee PGF\u2019s Janine started a discussion surrounding the creation of a committee to help enforce + decide the DAO\u2019s Code of Conduct policy. The focus would be less on changing the structure and instead on effectively communicating the current structure. DAO Ops volunteered to assist in the development of this committee & related policies. For more information on how these discussions went, you can check out all of the CSDO Meeting Notes to read more, or the Gitcoin Transparency YouTube Channel to watch recordings of CSDO calls! And that\u2019s it for this month! Keep checking back monthly for future editions of the CSDO Digest! ",

DAO-Wide Updates  The Merge: Gitcoin Product Collective <> Moonshot Collective Kicking things off with a big update is the merging of two workstreams, Gitcoin Product Collective (GPC) and Moonshot Collective (MC) on October 20th, 2022. Composed of engineers, MC was the workstream focusing on experimentation and innovation in the context of GTC Utility, governance, identity and our grants protocol. The Moonshot Collective workstream was absorbed into GPC, and GPC will manage & oversee all products and product development for the DAO.  Gitcoin August 2022 Financial Report Interested in learning more about the financial state of the DAO (as of August 2022)? You can head on over to the Gitcoin Forum to get more information on our financial health, but I\u2019ll break it down here:  Total $ value of contributor rewards is down 19% MoM, which is a direct result of timing differences in payment made to contributors from differing workstreams, coupled with a depreciation of GTC token price at month end. We anticipate a slight increase in contributor spend with the inclusion of the new workstream: Gitcoin Product Collective   955\u00d7538 84.4 KB   Total Gitcoin treasury balance has decreased from July, as a result of GTC token price depreciation. However the stablecoin treasury holding has increased as a result of diversification efforts.   955\u00d7538 33.6 KB   The consolidated income statement shows total contributor rewards YTD of $5.4m   955\u00d7391 67.6 KB   Proposals  Emails For Trusted Contributors MMM\u2019s Laura Banks proposed clearer guidelines surrounding the qualifications for trusted contributors wishing to obtain their own gitcoin email account. Trusted Contributors (in addition to Core/FT contributors) should receive emails if they align with one or more of the following:  The contributor is new but has a clearly-written time-staked agreement with their workstream (e.g., someone working in a function who is working on a clearly-outlined, high-context, cross-stream project - example: community engagement strategy). Upon offboarding, that contributor\u2019s email will be sunsetted and no-longer functional  OR  The contributor has shown commitment to the DAO, has been an active and integral part of the workstream for at least one season and has clearly-identified roles and responsibilities within the workstream. In a traditional working environment, this person might be considered a \u201cpart-time\u201d employee (see MMM\u2019s Understanding Contributor Tiers)  You can read the full passed proposal here.  Governor Contract Upgrade Former MC/current GPC contributor Chase Dragan proposed the key details around the current governor contract related to our governance process summarized in the v3 Governance Post. You can read the full passed proposal here.  Peer Reviews DAO Ops\u2019 Jodi proposed amending the peer review process to include:  The ability for trusted contributors to opt in More objective metrics to evaluate contributor performance. A notice to workstream leads and/or talent coordinators for each contributor in the workstream participating in the process. Clear guidance to contributors about selecting peer reviewers and providing constructive feedback Time for 1:1 meetings between the workstream lead(s) (or delegate) and the reviewee.  You can read the full passed proposal here.  Planning Cadence for Gitcoin Seasons DAO Ops\u2019 Kris proposed an alternative budgeting process involving 6-month \u2018strategic\u2019 or \u2018visionary\u2019 cycles that allow each workstream (WS) to set their \u2018always on goals\u2019 and long-term strategic plans for the following 6-months. In the middle of each 6-month period there will be a 3-month check-in. At this point WS\u2019s have the opportunity to reflect and share their progress to date. At this point the second half of the initial six month budget is \u201creleased\u201d to the WS. You can read the full proposal here.This proposal did not pass, but led to a proposal by Scott, which was based on this, in October that did pass. More on this in our next update.  Key Discussions & Thoughts One of the things CSDO does best is create conversations surrounding important issues affecting the DAO and its contributors. Here are some of the key discussions that went down over the month:  MMM kicked off their positioning and branding initiative, with GPC contributing to the product side S16 dates were announced, starting with a retro on 10/01 and budgets landing in the multisigs on 12/01: MMM outlined the suggested priority stakeholders as they relate to community engagement initiatives Improving organizational culture, specifically as it pertains to creating a culture of coaching and mentorship Gitcoin Operating System Alignment Sustainability of quarterly grants rounds Offboarding process Community Engagement Paying contributors in stables Grant based sanctions for contributor fraud Decision Making in CSDO Project Management at Gitcoin  For more information on how these discussions went, you can check out all of the CSDO Meeting Notes to read more, or the Gitcoin Transparency YouTube Channel to watch recordings of CSDO calls!
