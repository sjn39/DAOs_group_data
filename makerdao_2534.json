Context Given that MIP17 was initially rejected from the Governance Cycle this month and that there has been a lot recent of discussion on how to improve/modify the proposal to meet Maker\u2019s needs, I think holding a community call to discuss our options going forward is a great idea in order to prepare it for resubmission. Agenda  I will summarize all the comments/points in the forum thread + some other options to consider and present it on the call for all to catch up Open discussion Next steps for proposal editing Determine if we need another call Finalize proposal The final sentiment gauging before resubmission via a forum poll (optional) Once it\u2019s reached a level of rough consensus, the Author(s) will propose it for resubmission to the next available Governance Cycle  Call Details  Zoom Link Password: 167045  ",
