DAI Digits   DAI Peg: 7d Low / 7d High\t$0.020 / $123.04   DAI Statistics   Governance Dashboard    Governance Polls and Executive Votes  Proposal for Collateral On-boarding of POGS   Allows users to open vaults with POGS.

Plastic Wrap the toilet bowl and lower the seat. Want to play a joke on her that will scare her and make stories to tell forever?  The little fire work snaps that you throw at the ground and go \u201cpop pop pop\u201d (they look like white tadpoles).  Place a couple at every point the toilet seat makes contact with the bowl and gently lower the seat.  Wait until you hear tons of popping and a storm of cuss words.  Then you will know your job is done.  When Social Distancing Ends - Here\u2019s How You Put The Bathroom Snoop On Blast When you throw a social gathering at your home, we all know that there is at least one person in the group that snoops through the medicine cabinet, out of curiosity, while using the restroom.
