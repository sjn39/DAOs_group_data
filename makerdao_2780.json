                    "content": "TL;DR: community have proposed a very legit plan for compensation Black-Thursday Vault Victims, it has been passed but, we did not prepare ourselves against not supportive MKR whales. There\u2019s a way to counteract this power, we just need to do an extra effort. Let\u2019s create the incentives to make a new poll pass by the creation of a Vault Compensation Support DAO. @monet-supply has made a very compelling post-mortem analysis twitter threat that might worth to read in case you are not familiar with what happened. Background  12th march --> 8 million were lost in Vaults due to 0-bid actions attacks during network congestion  6-13th April --> MakerDAO Governances agrees on Compensating the victims\u2019s loss 62,483.37 MKR (65.14%) against 33,441.10 MKR (34.86%) that voted no. 13-16th July --> First Compensation Plan  was rejected by 25,803.43 MKR (59.05%) of token holders against 17,897.49 MKR (40.95%) who where in favor. A new Plan is needed. 8-22nd September --> Second Compensation Plan which pivoted to proposed to compensate victims by minting new MKR was rejected by 57,589.05 MKR (65.52% of que poll quorum of 87,899.67 MKR).  A Governance Issue Having diverse stakeholders (MKR holders, engaged community, vault victims) with different interests and incentives brings natural entropy, confusion, and conflicts in the collective entity. No one said Decentralization would be easy, but it\u2019s necessary for the wealth of not only MakerDAO but the entire crypto space. Executing governance polls that don\u2019t overcome the 10% forum is a classic form of centralization due to disengagement of the token holder communities, the many reasons for this lack of engagement within MakerDAO token holders have been explored here. I, as a vault victim, and as an MKR holder, particularly identify with reason #4. Whales outweigh most other voters, making voting feel like a waste of gas. As a matter of fact, I have voted in neither of the 3 above polls, even if I\u2019d obtain particular benefits out of a particular outcome. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t vote as I didn\u2019t spend that gas and my short MKR balance wouldn\u2019t have made any difference at all in the outcome. At the same time, I\u2019m super sad we (referring to the >90% of MKR holders) did not vote. I do believe the aggregated of the Crypto community (including MAkerDAO of) prioritize ethics and fairness before the selfishness and personal profit. It becomes clear the cost of voting (in terms of transactions cost as well as cognitive costs) becomes an entry barrier for the vast majority of voters allowing individuals (mostly MKR whales) to decide on behalf on their own interest despite what the rest of the community care about but was not able to manifest. There\u2019s still some hope in the numbers though, so far, among the 3 related polls, the most supported one was that one in which MKR decided to compensate Vault victims, just that we had no plans back then. A Skin in the Game Issue I\u2019m not complaining about whales looking to care about their own interest, it\u2019s natural the way, they would be the most impacted out of an MKR inflation action, even if we are talking about <2% of its supply (minting ~18k MKR against ~1M of supply) this would mean significant costs for them assuming the demand of the MKR does not suffer any variation. My thoughts are on the regular MKR holders (including myself of course), especially the vault victims, that besides supporting and defining two different, complex, and hard-working compensation plans, did nothing to assure enough incentives to attract more voting weight to come into the poll and/or assuring a counterparty incentive that would overshadow an assumed lost due to MKR inflation. Realigning the incentives by Community Coordination In the realm of the Open Source, community cohesion shall be a priority, otherwise, you will be forked and the community will migrate towards the tribe that better aligns with their values. We got the best example one week ago after Uniswap distributed their tokens just after suffering from a Liquidity Vampire attack. If you want your protocol to be sufficiently adopted to stay in a leadership position,  you want your users to be happy and wealthy. It\u2019s my personal opinion that the outcome we had the last 22nd of september, and the fact that there\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit against the Foundation, is making and will make the community felt apart, which is not good to the Maker mid-long term. Community and user engagement is the competitive advantage of web3, we can\u2019t just despise it when we make decisions. Yes, individuals will take care of their own self-interest, but guys, this is a DAO (or at least it\u2019s what the name tells me, otherwise MakerDAO would be a lie\u2026 don\u2019t you think?), there are collective interests we need to care for as well, and if they are not in line, we have now the tools and the ways to re-align them\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 Vault Victims and compensation supporters have coordinated to present not one but two refund proposals to the Governance body (special thanks to @psychonaut @LongForWisdom @MakerMan @monet-supply @Vault2288 @befitsandpiper and others I might be missing), but unfortunately it was not enough. Assuming that Vault Victims do not currently represent a significant governance weight in MKR decision-taking, the next thing to do is to place a mechanism in which we do ensure this to happen. Yes, I\u2019m talking about buying MKR decentralized coordination while assuring that voting power will go in favor of compensation. And we need to do it together. A Vault Compensation Support DAO to counteract MKR whales within MakerDAO We need to define and strength the collaboration of compensation supporters in a more tangible way, to propose a structure and place the proper mechanism of incentivizing this group to work together and fulfill the purpose on getting together enough voting power that will assure us increase voting participation to influence in a better way the outcome of the poll. Voting delegation is not there already, but there are ways in coming together and fill a common pool of MKR, sum voting power, while being able to cashback your MKR whenever you want (better if after voting :-). The first coming to my mind is the Dandellion Aragon DAO that allows an onboarding process with a governance token allocation according to the tokens (MKR) you add to the common pool (while allowing you to redeem accordingly to cash out) and program the interaction with the MakerDAO voting contract via the Aragon Agent. But why don\u2019t we just commit to buy MKR and vote independently of a new DAO Again, it\u2019s about the skin in the game and making it visible to us all and assure people we are getting our shit together and taking care of our money. If we want our money back, we need to fight for it, and at this point is very clear we can only do this together. The collective effort of reaching a proper amount of MKR tokens could also improve the MKR performance in the market and counteract implicit losses in the targeted MKR inflation. Make the community stronger while assuring wealth yo token holders. There are also other things that this DAO could resolve, for example (and this is ofc up for discussion) in the last couple of plans, the need for some development emerged as it was clear its need for distributing back the funds address by address. With the Vault Compensation Support DAO (VCS DAO from now on) we could make the new claim of the compensation to be addressed to this DAO and then we redistribute it all according to the value we had lost AND the skin each of us is putting on this new game. VCS DAO Launching Scheme First of all, we need to assure the VCS DAO members are inline with the purpose of fairly compensating Vault victims. There are many variables to consider here. Now it\u2019s not only about the amount of debt and collateral lost but also about the skin in the game placed in the VCS DAO. This opens the possibility first to Vault victims to opt-in the VCS DAO with a capital capacity corresponding to their capital loss. For Example vault 3789 has a net loss of ~5k USD (~ 9.87 MKR price on Sept 27th). This would allow the individual owner of the address corresponding to that vault to participate in the DAO with a max of 9.87 VCS DAO share token corresponding to a maximum tribute of 9.87 MKR (1 tribute MKR = 1 VCS DAO share). Once the first onboarding of only Vault Victims is done, this seed community will decide then on who they want to accept (e.g. with members sponsoring candidates) as well as the price in MKRs to set to the VCS DAO new-comers. Once the amount in MKR is acceptable for going to a new poll, the onboarding process ends and the MakerDAO Governance poll is triggered.   Outcome A: MakerDAO approves the Compensation MakerDAO will deposit the total amount of compensation into the DAO vault. VCS DAO has fulfilled its purpose and now it\u2019s ready to disappear by the redemption of the funds (unless they want to find a new purpose to this DAO with its funds, which would be perfectly valid). Vault Victims and Sponsored Investors will be able to redeem back their MKRs with their DAO share tokens which will be of course   Outcome B: MakerDAO rejects the Compensation DAO Members will find themself with a wealthy Organization with no purpose to follow, but with a wealthy fund. People will have the choice of remaining in the DAO and look for usage to give to the money, or just opt-out; in this case, it\u2019s important to realize that MKR supporters that entered in a later phase (no Vault Victims) will receive a lower amount of MKR than what they invested in the first place, this due to the difference in share prices offered to them.   Challenges and Drawbacks  Economical Challenges: as you can see, I haven\u2019t made the maths around the MKR markets dinamics. We are facing >10k MKR gap that we need to gather in voting power. I think this is super important, but it\u2019s actually not my thing. Hopefully someone here will help us out in this matter. According to @monet-supply we are talking now about ~2.5 M we might be tackling to recover. So this might not worth the effort (in a profit sense), although if we succeed, we would be sending a right message against MKR whales, and who knows, maybe this create a precedent for the future of Decentralized Organizations. Technological Challenge: Aragon is super cool (we could use also MolochDAO), but it might not fulfill entirely our needs and some customization/development might be needed. For example, it would be cool to whitelist the seed DAO membership to addresses belonging to Vault Victims in a first phase, and then allowing new members sponsors. Again, I\u2019m sure we can gather some dev help as well. Community Challenge: we need to assure a way to reach all Vault Victims and invite them to participate in this, clarify the benefits but also the risks. We need to prioritize absolute collaboration among us, this is the only way to counteract such a whale power that prevent us to have our compensation one week ago. Legal Challenge: well\u2026 I\u2019m not the right person to make any comment here, I\u2019d personally like us to resolve our conflicts on-chain without the arbitration of legacy jurisdictional systems. But this seems like an opportunity to dismiss the lawsuit against the Foundation that a group of people legitimately decided to enable.  Follow-up The above expose the motivations and plan for moving forward with the Black Thursday crash Vault Compensation Governance Proposal, and presents a draft plan to move forward. I\u2019m aware there are still some other considerations to take and flaws to discover, which I expect would be discussed and considered properly in this forum. ",

As much as I sympathize with those that faced losses, the price decline in March was due to an overall sell off across financial assets, not just crypto. While there does seem to have been some malicious actors on the auction side of the bad collateral, a guaranteed excess of collateral was never guaranteed by the system. IMO nothing was owed to vault owners, but the community made a good faith effort to restore some losses due to the auction exploit. The holders of MKR however could not be convinced to devalue their holdings as as such no compensation measure was passed. ",

What we do know is that 36% of all makerdao vaults were affected that night and suffered losses and we also know that now a mere 5.8% of the maker community voted on this issue and therefore it took only 3.7% of the maker community to kill the existing plan to compensate them. Lets not forget that the original vote with 10% participation had already agreed for compensation 6 months earlier. This was not a decision by consensus but the exact opposite. This issue needs to be brought up again with proper leadership. Vitalik didn\u2019t sit on the sidelines when the DAO got hacked in 2016, it wasn\u2019t his contract that failed yet he indicated his support for compensation as a leader and therefore it retained attention and 14% of Ether users eventually were able to get their money back. MakerDao also lost 4 million dollars on black Thursday, it is beyond clear that the contract had a flaw and different parties were affected. If the community found it necessary to repay the bad debt and losses of MakerDao then it is also logical to pay the losses of all the remaining parties affected by the same event. The clock is ticking, as Ether prices rise there are more incentives to find a resolution. A mere 10K loss on Black Thursday wasn\u2019t worth getting a lawyer for but today that would be 90K + damages.  Right now you only have one court case in arbitration here in SF, keep waiting sitting on the sidelines and that will soon change very quickly. It would be best for all to reach a resolution here not to mention the right thing to do. ",

Yet it has only bothered to post a single one announcing the compensation plan for its users on April 6th which did pass with 10% participation. When its about their own debt they remind everyone to participate, when its about its users they haven\u2019t mentioned anything in 8 months. I don\u2019t expect the Foundation to override anything. I expect them to bring them same attention and spotlight to us as they put into repaying their own debts. I expect them to bring the issue up for voting again and announce to everyone to participate 12 times like they did for their own debt. ",

When the 2016 DAO hack/exploit happened within days Vitalik announced the soft-fork solution and it was implemented in less than a month with miner support of 65%-85%. All 14% of Ethereum users got their money back including me. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision and some people argued against it stating that the \u201ccode is law\u201d and then created ETC out of the old Ethereum blockchain. Look now after 5 years at what happened to the chain that stood by its users and look at what happened to the one who thought they should loose their funds. ETH is today $1085 and ETC is $7 Never abandon your users, 36% of vaults were affected. The Maker Foundation needs to take a more active role and bring attention to the community to address this issue. For the sake of fairness I want to correct my previous claim that MakerDao had only posted one single tweet announcing the vault compensation polls. They tweeted it 3 times. One in April, one in July and one in September. ",

If the lawsuit was never filed, perhaps there would have been enough votes for compensation in the last September vote, possibly preventing a \u201cbite the hand that feeds you\u201d situation. That would likely have been a much preferable route for everone in the end as it would probably have been a quicker process and more cost effective than paying legal fees.  It seems to be it would have been better to wait for a successful compensation vote and completed compensation distribution to the black Thursday vault holders, and only then start to consider moving forward with legal action if no compensation materialized after about a year. At todays prices, I lost what would now be seven figures in USD on black Thursday and am curious if there may be a new compensation vote before or after the current legal issues are settled. ",

The MKR market cap is currently about $4.66 billion. So total compensation would be about 1% of the MKR market cap assuming the most generous 24.67% compensation percentage.  To me this seems like it would not be a big deal for the Maker community to come up with this amount in some way to finally put the Black Thursday issue to bed. @AstronautThis Agreed, MKR holders have previously signaled a generous intent by voting to compensate and it would be indeed generous to follow though with the act of compensation. Last compensation vote failed with only 38 unique wallets voting with most votes from only a handful of MKR whales.  If there is ever another future compensation vote, perhaps times will be different and compensation action will be passed by a margin of one or two bighearted MKR whales. ",

I 100% fully agree with this.  MakerDAO lost money and had to mint new MKR tokens to compensate the losses. MKR holders lost money because their MKR dropped in value from 650usd to 250usd. Vault holders lost money because they were liquidated 100%.  So all of you and all of \u2018us\u2019 lost money. And this is what (might) happens when you experiment with new protocols, potentially containing bugs and exposed to systemic risk.

Then all we need to know is the price of Dai.  Dai was expensive at the time, and would have been more so if all vault sourced Dai to self-liquidate (price was already spiking over $1.10 without it).  Let\u2019s say everyone pays $1.20 for Dai.  Example:  Vault with 100 DAI debt, holding 1 ETH. ETH price gets to $150, self-liquidate (100 DAI + 13 DAI penalty)*1.03, so owes 116.39 DAI which cost $1\u2026     It\u2019s important to include the fact that the price of Dai spiked at the time.

If this is true, then all UIs were misleading as they just stated a 13% haircut on the remaining collateral.   Totally agree, a big majority of users came from MakerDAO ads on Coinbase at this time. MakerDAO was advertised as a final product, with 13% fees in case of liquidation. The UI was not advertising a \u201cbetween 13% and 100% fee\u201d, who would put his money into a tool that can empty everything in seconds? @MakerMan will probably tell us that the code is public, but it\u2019s not for every user to perform stress tests before using the product. And oddly enough, these bugs were fixed in the days that followed. I think we need to get a clear direction going forwards, because otherwise everyone knows that it\u2019s going to keep dragging on (as told us @LongForWisdom last August here https://youtu.be/ZzEbuwyaZRQ?t=2668).     MakerMan:  There was nothing special about the 0-bid other than indicating auction efficiency was hampered. Would anyone have complained if those auctions fetched 50%?

MakerDAO Governance agreed for a compensation. So now is the time to compromise and finish what has been started, once and for all. The higher the price of ETH goes, the more judicious it becomes for victims to actively participate and win this battle. Also, let\u2019s not forget that the lost money is currently in the pockets of 1 or 2 people. A priori, these people are registered on this forum and were very familiar with the auctions system. This is why I also find it important to settle this story. Is there someone here that could help us with this new proposal ? ",

I as a user of the vault system understood the basics of the debt bidding but never even thought about being part of the bidding auction process as it was just not transparent enough. ",

Also, let\u2019s not forget that the lost money is currently in the pockets of 1 or 2 people. A priori, these people are registered on this forum and were very familiar with the auctions system. This is why I also find it important to settle this story. Is there someone here that could help us with this new proposal ?   I totally agree on this\u2026 what I wonder now is what proposal we want to put together\u2026 I mean, MakerDAO governance DID AGREE on compensate us victims, but is not accepting HOW to compensate us. I liked very much the last proposal and I think we could repeat that as long as we do have a MKR couple of whales willing to signal at least that they would support it. If not, I think we will be allowed to \u201cspam\u201d the MakerDAO governance with different proposals till the approve one of these.     ultraschuppi:  Nobody was forced to get liquidated and code is law   not sure what you mean, but first, the network congestioncombined wuth the 0 bid auctions  DID FORCE many vaults to be liquidated. And second, code is not law, \u201ccode is law\u201d was just a The DAO claim that then was unvalidated by the Ethereum fork actions\u2026     ultraschuppi:  this is one of the reasons so far a compensation plan did not pass onchain   BS, the compensation plan did not pass because MKR holders (actually just a couple of MKR whales) did act in pure self-interest with no consideration of what would be the best for MakerDAO community. In any case, 0-bid auction o black thursday was a Black Swam event with million in losses, so we need to find a way to make MKR holders to take responsability on this, or at least, making it profitable for them. The last proposals included no benefits for MKR holders, just benefits for the victims\u2026 How could we incentivize MKR holders to support Black Thursday victims?? ",

Also with regards to:     fullname:  Totally agree, a big majority of users came from MakerDAO ads on Coinbase at this time. MakerDAO was advertised as a final product, with 13% fees in case of liquidation. The UI was not advertising a \u201cbetween 13% and 100% fee\u201d, who would put his money into a tool that can empty everything in seconds?   As has been stated repeatedly MakerDAO does not control all the UIs to the interface.   All you had to do is read the documentation regarding liquidations to come to understand two basic facts.  Liquidation prices can vary dramatically. Due to (1) IF your vault comes under the liquidation gun you will not get any collateral back if the liquidation price on vaults with LR 150% is below 79% of your borrow.  If you stick your money in a protocol without at least a cursory reading of details of what happens the responsibility is on you, not the protocol.     mkrGoxxed:  If this is true, then all UIs were misleading as they just stated a 13% haircut on the remaining collateral. The entire project gained trust (and people\u2019s deposits) to make huge CDPs possible based on false information.   Show me one single example of where this was stated in this way.  I saw that the 13% liquidation fee is on the entire collateral - NOT the \u2018remaining\u2019.    Take your issue to the UI designers for \u2018misleading\u2019 you not the protocol that documented these details quite well.    Sure you had to fish around \u2018just a bit\u2019 because there are a lot of docs but anyone using this protocol better know details of liquidations as well as how fees are calculated and paid.

The higher the price of ETH goes, the more judicious it becomes for victims to actively participate and win this battle.   MakerDAO agreed to form a working group to create a compensation package.   Once the proposal \u2018to compensate\u2019 was put forward by the working group it was rejected by governance. The working group achieved the primary goal(s):  To create a compensation package that was as fair as possible to everyone affected. To give governance a full range of choices to not compensate, or to compensate at different levels.  Which would bring me to agreeing with @Tosh9.0     Tosh9.0:  If you believe you have some potential proposal or solution going forward, please propose it.   ",

This is an important point that I believe is sometimes missed. If a 150% vault liquidation goes perfect the liquidated collateral would net 13% to the DAO, 66.6% to pay off the loan, and 20.3% back to the vault owner. The vault owner also has the benefit of not having to repay their debt anymore so presumably they receive an effective 87% of collateral. In the Black Thursday scenario vault owners still received 66.6% of their collateral by virtue of not having to repay the debt. So the discussion here is really about that extra 20.3% of collateral max that they could have received if auctions were perfect, not 100%. ",

Despite high gas fees which clearly favor MKR whales in casting their votes, CDP owners should be issued some voting power proportional to their borrowed collateral and time (risk). This could be a variant of staked MKR with a vesting schedule (maybe like CRV) that can be used only for voting. It should be unlocked for selling after a long time-period or burned as you repay debt or maybe force CDP owners to mint this staked MKR when they borrow DAI to ensure they have voting power. For lack of voting engagement, there needs to be some proxy voting mechanism to delegate CDP-owner voting power to chosen representatives. Currently, It\u2019s easier to inform and have a few big MKR whales vote than many small CDP owners. There\u2019s not even a way to communicate with them en mass. If all this would be in place, we could mint and auction MKR to rightfully repay Black Thursday victims. It\u2019s pretty clear that the current voting is broken and biased. ",

Why not convince them that your position is the right one?  The only way you do that is by kicking off a MIP.  It just seems silly to me to even entertain these threads anymore if all they produce are bombastic flim flam and drive by vapid comments. Why not try something?  What do you have to lose?  A few hours writing a MIP? Anyway, that\u2019s my two DAI. Won\u2019t be commenting more in this thread. You can lead a horse to water\u2026 ",
