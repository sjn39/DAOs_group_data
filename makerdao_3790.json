We can see the other protocols like AAVE, Compound and recent competitors like Liquity positioning themselves as sponsors of different community events, grants and tools. Recently:   defi.ethglobal.co    HackMoney - Virtual DeFi Hackathon HackMoney is a virtual 30 day hackathon for hackers building decentralized finance applications.        ethcc.io    EthCC 4 \u2014 July 20-22, 2021 Ethereum Community Conferences & Workshops: 20-21-22 July2021 in Paris      Even MakerDAO has already a brand built, we need to keep positioning ourselves not only to show support and create awareness, but to attract talent and create new ideas and initiatives that benefit the ecosystem. I have seen some of the proposals for marketing, but I think we have to keep in mind that we need to attract not only normies and corporations but also developers and degens. Talent is starting to flow from web2 to web3 , AAVE and others are there with arms open, let\u2019s be there too. It will be nice to have a roadmap of future events and how Maker is going to propose challenges, collaborations and so on. Just some thoughts, ",
