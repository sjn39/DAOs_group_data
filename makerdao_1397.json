Paragraph Summary MIP39c3-SP2 offboards the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001).  Specification  Motivation The functions of SH-001 do not require a Core Unit. The budget is a significant outlier given the high cost and niche function. If swag is desired, it should be integrated into another CU or the service contracted to Core Units as needed. The Core Unit is an unnecessary expense and currently represents 64k in monthly costs. It is a substantial ongoing cost with unclear returns. The approval of this budget, which tripled during the last approval cycle, was contentious before the significant decline in protocol revenue and overall crypto market. With the current budget and protocol revenue, the protocol does not receive enough value to justify the expense. Additionally, tracking, management and reporting of SH-001 spending and progress on initiatives has been poor, which is especially concerning in a time when Core Units are under pressure to cut costs and justify expenditures. This Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.  Summary of Reason for Offboarding  Large budget that does not justify the narrow purpose of this Core Unit. Large deficit in Maker\u2019s budget. Poor management of accounting and expense tracking. Swag does not require an entire Core Unit.   Explicit Deliverables and Responsibilities  Delivery of swag through various initiatives. Integration of AccountAble for account & expense tracking. Partnerships and collaborations across DeFi.   Implicit Deliverables and Responsibilities  Proper accounting and management of funds.   Examples of Unfulfilled Deliverables and Responsibilities  Ongoing account and expense tracking issues. This Core Unit has struggled with mixing of personal and business accounts, adding significant costs to untangle. Lack of notable partnerships or collaborations.   Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Work N/A. No work needed.  Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Funds Severance of 45K will be granted. This represents over a six-months salary for the Facilitator.  Possible Remedy to Avoid Offboarding N/A. If the work is desired, it should be contracted through another Core Unit or performed underneath another Core Unit. Swag can be worthwhile to the DAO, but not through its current structure.  Core Unit ID SH-001 ",

As stated here, for anyone even outside the DAO is something weird to see, now practically everyone will be looking at MakerDAO like some place where they will NEVER feel comfortable working, how is possible that just few months ago people voted for you to work, and in few weeks you\u2019re being kicked out, doesn\u2019t make any sense. Tbh, I also feel that yeah, SH should not be as expensive as it is, there are way lot more services that can provide Burban\u2019s job with less money, but this is not the way. Maybe when budgets are approved should be some term/condition that the CU work will be under vigilance for 3-6 months, and if after that time seems that their mandate is not being achieve, then the community can proceed to an offboarding of the CU.

But the value is there, or at least it can be there, even more on bear markets with all this stress sentiments going around. On the other hand I agree with other members in the fact that this CU\u2019s budget was approved very recently and offboarding it just because the market shifted doesn\u2019t hit me as the right way to go. I think that core Units and PEOPLE working in them, need to have a little more stability in their working enviroments. If the DAO onboards and offboards Core Units so easily it gives the impression of inestabilty and will cost human resources to the DAO in the long run. Even a DAO needs to have some predictability I dont know, it\u2019s just a thought. ",

I ask because our CU relies on the work and budget allocation of SH-001.  Swag is a big staple to the DAIvinity events.  It is great for promotion.  Assuming this offboarding is submitted for September voting that means in the case it passes the funds this CU uses to produce swag will be cut off at the end of Sept.  We have an event in Bogota on Oct 13 and we would expect this CU to produce swag.  Why is there no winddown budget to cover this since it is so close to offboarding?  Also, I am surprised there is no fund allocation to wind down for accounting or other outstanding liabilities which may be involved     CodeKnight:  If swag is desired, it should be integrated into another CU or the service contracted to Core Units as needed.   From our CUs side swag is a very important promotional tool and we do desire it.  If this CU ceases to exist we would have to look at allocating a portion of our budget to cover swag at our events.

Regrettably, in the overall uncertainty, I have not been able to form a deal to merge under the Growth CU at this time. Nevertheless, I will be going forward with accepting an offboarding. I would propose a few things that I believe the community will find reasonable.   @CodeKnight\u2019s severance offer for $45k is acceptable, but as I live in NY, I request that it be a post-tax sum, as It will make a difference in helping me meet living obligations going forward. This totals to $63.5k pre-tax.   I request that the existence of my CU be prolonged through the end of October so that I can fulfill some of my current commitments, which include our event in Bogota.   As a precedent regarding pro-rating vests has already been set, an equivalent treatment in my case would be appreciated.   Anyway, I wish everyone many thanks for granting me the opportunity to have been a facilitator. Thanks, Andrew Burban  One thing not covered above, if down the road there are legal fees or prison terms associated w/ having been a facilitator of a CU, I\u2019d request some assistance from the DAO at that time.

DAI is more than a stablecoin and the Maker Protocol is more than a lending pool. MKR has outsized effects on the financial and political landscape of our future not because the math is sound or the governance is inclusive, but because it is a cleaver that severs the unholy union between money and state, Mammon and Moloch! It is no coincidence that the names of the tokens of our protocol are pronounced \u201cMaker\u201d and \u201cDie\u201d. It may have never been explicitly stated in the documentation, but anyone with a functioning soul can decipher the symbolism. This is a holy, non-religious organization, made in the image of The Dude who Generates, Organizes, and Destroys. It should be obvious why MakerDAO should retain its \u201cChief Happiness Officer\u201d and continue observation of DAIvinity. But if it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll explain. A DAO is not a business, it\u2019s a tribe. Tribes do business internally and externally, but they are more than mere businesses. If a tribe myopically focuses on business concerns, the tribe will disintegrate. Technically, using the \u201c8 Forms of Capital\u201d model, a business maximizes financial capital; whereas, a tribe maximizes all forms of capital. And, with the exception of genocide events, tribes always outlive businesses. So, to the tribe of MakerDAO, I say this: retain your shaman in the role of \u201cChief Happiness Officer\u201d and keep the regular observance of DAIvinity. For if you don\u2019t, someone, likely a \u201cpublic-private partnership preaching\u201d fascist will come into our house and flip our tables. ",

So the fact that you don\u2019t know and didn\u2019t bother to find out is a good reason to off-board? Maybe if you take some time to educate yourself on the work @aburban90 has done for Maker you might be able to form an educated opinion instead of blindly supporting something because you don\u2019t understand it.

Beyond the importance of swag distribution mechanisms and acquisition metrics, there is an invisible churn of both known and unknown participants throughout any community. @aburban90 has done everything in his power to bolster the community for both new and old members. Framing his role within the bounds of simple swag delivery is a gross misjudgment of the unquantifiable but very real network effects that his efforts have created over these last few years.
