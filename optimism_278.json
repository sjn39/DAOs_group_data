I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes L2 recipient address: 0x489863b61C625a15C74FB4C21486baCb4A3937AB Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1 **Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee?:**DeFi committee Project description (please explain how your project works): Overtime Markets is a novel and unique Sports Markets AMM product that is built on top of the Thales core architecture powered by Chainlink Sports Feeds, and is currently exclusive to the Optimism network. It provides a world\u2019s first successful attempt of permissionless, liquid and fully on-chain Sports Markets, where users can trade on tokenized outcomes of world\u2019s most popular sports leagues without any limitations. It utilizes the Thales Protocol core architecture to offer on-demand liquidity to markets revolving around sports events with mutually exclusive outcomes in the likes of HOME WIN, AWAY WIN or DRAW. Each outcome is represented by ERC20 tokens which are available for purchase from the Sports AMM that prices these tokens based on Chainlink provided pre-game odds. Only one type of these positional tokens is able to redeem the sUSD collateral in 1:1 ratio from the contract representing the individual game, based on the post-game results that are also fed by the Chainlink oracle directly to the smart contract.  1600\u00d7836 281 KB  Launched exclusively to Optimism close to the beginning of August 2022, Overtime Markets supported MLS Soccer League events and MLB Baseball League events \u201coff the bat\u201d from the Chainlink oracle provider. Summer being an off-season for most major global sports events and leagues, it came as beneficial to Overtime to do initial public beta testing during these times of limited markets until the second half of August, when all the popular sports leagues started. Subsequently to successful launch and the positioning working flawlessly as intended, the offering on Overtime increased to all major European Soccer leagues and UFC fighting events. During this same time period, limited and experimental short term OP+THALES token subsidies were put in place, provided from the Thales Treasury (Phase 0 allocation), towards Overtime traders. Current emissions are around 4,000 of each tokens per week and, even though they are low in comparison, they are already quite effective towards garnering new attention towards Overtime and significantly increasing the growth metrics. In approximately two month\u2019s time since launch to date, Overtime markets drove ~$1.05M sUSD of trade volume and ~2.1M sUSD of notional volume on limited off-season sports offerings. It accomplished this with 943 unique users that executed a total of 8,609 trades. Currently, there are on average ~60 unique daily traders and the current average daily txn count on Overtime is around ~200. Upcoming Major Milestones:   On-chain Parlay AMM - Parlays are a common betting framework that allows for cumulative series of positions in which potential winnings accruing from each chained position are used as a stake for further positions, effectively offering leveraged trading on Overtime. If only one position from the chain is a loss, the entire chain collapses as a loss. Overtime On-chain Parlays execution plan is already in the codebase building stage by using the already deployed blueprint found in the TIP-72:Parlay AMM Governance Proposal Draft. Since it allows for leveraged positions on Overtime, Parlays have a massive potential to exponentially increase daily volume and bring in more users that are willing to participate in higher risk but also higher reward positions.   Aggregated Sports Data Feeds - Current Chainlink provided on-chain Sports Data required for Overtime operation are reliant on a single sports data provider called The Rundown. Since The Rundown is in-itself a API aggregator, it still represents a single point of failure on-chain. To avoid the centralization risk of using a single on-chain data provider, Chainlink and Overtime are working together towards providing a solution that involves a framework of Sports Data Aggregation that will have multiple sources of aggregated Sports Data on-chain providing a much more robust and decentralized solution that will provide a good bedrock for future scalability efforts.   Expanded Sports Offerings - With new on-chain sports data feeds emerging constantly, Overtime offering will also grow with it in tandem. One of the most popular requests are NBA games, which will be supported on Overtime as soon as the league starts. It is also communicated from our on-chain data providers that they are also planning to push for feeds relevant for Player Props offerings across major sports, which are also one of the most popular requests. Overtime is also well under way of feasibility testing the Racing Sports offerings from a Chainlink node provider specialized for those types of positions. The first addition of this type is most likely to be Formula 1 Grand Prix H2H Matchups. Additionally, major Esports events are also one of the most requested features which Overtime is actively working on with the on-chain data providers.

Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes, Overtime Markets are Open-Sourced and can be found in this repository. Optimism native?: Yes. Overtime Markets are exclusive to the Optimism Network only. Ecosystem Value Proposition:  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? Demand for a product with a clear market fit outside of a Defi niche, huge worldwide addressable market, with massive potential for onboarding people into Optimism and web3. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Overtime Markets represent a world\u2019s first successful attempt of permissionless, liquid and fully on-chain Sports Markets, where users can trade on tokenized outcomes of world\u2019s most popular sports leagues without any limitations. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Overtime Markets have the potential to be the catalyst that draws in a much wider audience directly to the Optimism network, that are not necessarily crypto native users. Sports Positioning is a huge global market and Overtime is a clear market fit because of the limitless and borderless nature of the Ethereum network that is also inherited into the Optimism network. Every \u201cmoving part\u201d of Overtime Markets is run by smart contracts and Chainlink data feeds without any manual inputs, and anyone with an Ethereum wallet can freely participate in positioning on any popular sports events via this product.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No, Overtime did not apply for an exclusive grant. Number of OP tokens requested: 300,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): Project with match co-incentives with THALES tokens to a certain degree that will be determined by the governance structure.   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 70% as incentives in form of Fee Rebates to create an inviting environment to help with the Overtime growth and user increase. 30% as targeted events to help user growth of new league and sport integrations. The FIFA world cup would be the first recipient of the sports targeted distribution and we are planning 20k to 50k OP for the FIFA tournament. We are wanting to promote this tournament with markets that would be incentivized based on expected user growth.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Approximate planned distribution is to last for 6 months.  Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. The main KPI with Fee Rebates is to bootstrap unique user acquisition, exposure and thus an increase in organic trading activity. Fee rebates introduction should see an increase in daily new users, as well as an increase in total trades. We are expecting a 20 to 40% increase in these numbers with fee rebates activated. KPI on the targeted incentives will be measurable through Dune Analytic where incentivised leagues and matches would expect to see a 30 to 50% increase in volume after implementation. We are hoping to reach a total volume of $3,000,000 by the end of incentives.  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? The key to Overtime Markets success relies on getting sufficient attention and making it accessible to new users. The initial bootstrap of Fee Rebates has a goal of drawing attention to the product and we are certain that users will remain when it becomes evident that Overtime provides the worlds best odds in Sports Positioning exactly because of the lack of middleman fees inherited from the nature of the Ethereum Network. Overtime Markets presents a solution to global permissionless accessibility towards Sports Markets and can be a floodgate of real life adoption and growth of the entire Optimism network.

Overtime, a part of Thales, will be one of the major catalysts to not only brings users to Optimism, but to onboard the next generation to web3. The Thales team has been Optimism supporters from day 1, and one of the earliest protocols on the chain. Now with the development of a Sports AMM, they are able to attract an entirely new and massive set of potential new users. The sports positioning market is absolutely massive and rapidly growing. Platforms like DraftKings bring in over $1B of revenue annually, and they don\u2019t have the advantages of being on-chain like Overtime. Sports positioners search high and low for the best odds and Overtime Markets has already proven to be a leader in this area, as predicted\u2026 Being an on-chain Sports AMM allows for relatively low overhead cost by relying on smart contracts and much less overhead than a traditional web2 book. This allows for some of the most competitive odds out there. The best odds bring bring in massive amounts of volume. As the technical and educational barriers to entry to web3 become less of a hurdle, I expect Overtime alone to be a HUGE source of new users to DeFi and to Optimism. Over the past weeks and months Thales has proven that they can effectively use $OP rewards to bring awareness to their products and grow the eco. It\u2019s been a great success so far and with Overtime in a state of continual growth, now is a great time to leverage $OP incentives to further ignite the future of sports positioning, Overtime! -DC ",

First,  Overtime Markets has one of the largest TAMs of all protocols live on Optimism, the potential to onboard new users to L2 is immense, and this is a crucial differentiator in why I see so much potential here for both Optimism and Thales.  Second,  you can see that Thales is already, but relatively quietly, absolutely thriving in terms of L2 metrics compiled by Orbiter Finance: it has the 3rd most active users of all dApps on Optimism only behind Uniswap and Hop! Pretty remarkable.  image1147\u00d7418 63.9 KB   Third,  I know the team personally and can vouch for their integrity, committment to the right vision and values that Optimism wants to be aligned with, and also their technical prowess in Web3.

The foundation market contracts used for Thales marketplace and the ThalesAMM contract were found to be a perfect fit to develop an instance of the contracts to revolve around Sports markets. With amazing relationship with Chainlink and their willingness to leverage Overtime to showcase their sports data capabilities, this is how Overtime was born. It is a separate product built using the Thales core infrastructure. Overtime was not included into Thales OP token allocation distribution from Phase 0 because the product did not exist at that time. Phase 0 allocation was mostly designated towards THALES/WETH liquidity and thalesmarket.io product usage. We are considering the OP token incentives to be highly successful in what they were designated towards. Down below you can see some relevant metrics of Thales Marketplace growth since the start of OP incentives.  Monthly Trading Volume increased from ~$350k per month to ~$2.5M trading volume per month Daily Unique Traders increased from ~10 to ~50 Daily Trades Executed increased from ~30 to ~200 Discord Members increased from ~2,000 to ~5,500 THALES token on-chain liquidity increased 5x and remained stable at around $2m of effective liquidity on the incentivized pool at around a stable ~100% APY.  There are already clear positive results around the effects of the OP token towards growth, marketing and exposure, even though most of Thales Phase 0 allocation still has ~3 months of distribution period that will remain true to the original Phase 0 proposal. @OPUser shared his findings around Thales Phase 0 distribution results here: Goverance Fund Accountability - An overview Regarding the question around Builders on Thales. The 90,000 OP tokens allocated towards community builders on top of Thales remain unallocated in the Thales treasury since there was not much initiatives yet. These will remain reserved as future incentives for community builders willing to work on structured products for Thales and/or alternate front-ends and similar initiatives. Even though Overtime product was not included in Phase 0, we subsequently took around 15,000 OP tokens from the Protocol Usage bucket of Thales and distributed them as various incentives towards Overtime product users for the past 2 months.

By offering Fee Rebates to users, the user/trader would feel more comfortable trading on Overtime knowing that he will get OP+THALES rewards proportional to the amount of fees they generated. This is especially beneficial for growth of the project and for UX for end traders as it will create a lucrative environment for Sports Positioning compared to centralized competitors, especially as Overtime already offers the best rates in the industry.

Consequently, the Fifa Worldcup could be a great occassion to bring in additional users to OT & OP. It seems you never had unincentivized usage.  Do you think the fee rebates are essential? How did you come up with the expectation of 20 to 40% increase in user numbers based on fee rebates? If pricing & fees are already better than on centralized platforms and aren\u2019t holding back adoption, 100% focus on user experience and marketing towards user acquisition would be better usage of funds, right? (currently happy users might not need a fee rebate aka unnecesary cost for the Optimism ecosystem and it could be spent on growth instead)  For new products, we\u2019d prefer to see unincentivized, organic usage for some time. Otherwise, it\u2019s really hard to tell whether pricing is (un)attractive to users or if there are other issues to adoption. Generally, our experience with prediction markets and providing capital in such pools has been that liquidity is a major barrier and it\u2019s tough to find (opposite) parties for certain markets (especially with little trading fees in early stage). Is this an area that holds you back or is it a non-issue for Overtime/Thales? (Hence, there is no focus on this matter in the proposal) We see that Overtime and Thales are different products & proposals target different areas.

Obviously, this also depends on the demand side and we don\u2019t want to encourage a rapid spending of tokens for uncertain initiatives\u2026 but potentially Overtime could use more of these Thales OP tokens to grow adoption\u2026 and Thales + Overtime can request more tokens in the future.     padzank:  Regarding the question around Builders on Thales.

We determined that the fee rebates seem to be the most effective low-cost growth tool. They are low emissions compared to straight volume incentives and are more inviting towards organic usage, instead of drawing in farmers only. As sports positioning industry is a constant competition around who will provide the best odds, giving a fee rebate rewards to users gives Overtime an edge using tokenization against limited centralized solutions. This brings more eyes to Overtime and provides a solid stream of new organic growth since farmers cannot take advantage of a fee rebate system without taking on positioning risk.   If pricing & fees are already better than on centralized platforms and aren\u2019t holding back adoption, 100% focus on user experience and marketing towards user acquisition would be better usage of funds, right? (currently happy users might not need a fee rebate aka unnecesary cost for the Optimism ecosystem and it could be spent on growth instead)   Overtime does provide highly competitive sports positioning terms compared to centralized solutions and is constantly working on iteratively improving UX and constant new exposure campaigns. Having 70% of this OP grant proposal planned towards long-term fee rebate program fits into UX and marketing tool at the same time.  It solidifies Overtimes edge in the industry regarding user experience, and it gives further incentives for non-crypto people to make an effort towards learning about onboarding the Optimism network, using EVM compatible wallet and educating themselves around Web3 for a clear benefit. These are not trivial efforts for non-crypto people but are necessary for increase in adoption of Optimism and Overtime with it. We would not call fee rebates unnecessary cost as it represents one of the most effective and non-toxic growth incentives.  Generally, our experience with prediction markets and providing capital in such pools has been that liquidity is a major barrier and it\u2019s tough to find (opposite) parties for certain markets (especially with little trading fees in early stage). Is this an area that holds you back or is it a non-issue for Overtime/Thales? (Hence, there is no focus on this matter in the proposal)  We are using an elegant novel AMM contract that seeds liquidity to sports markets based on Chainlink provided pre-game odds. Every created game market is a separate contract that is seeded with on-demand liquidity by a global SportsAMM contract and we think this liquidity model is a worlds first working model for these type of markets. Liquidity of games is not an issue requiring incentives as it is currently 100% seeded from the treasury that takes on the risk until we develop a external LP system with revenue share. Keep in mind the novel AMM is super capital efficient and it does not require massive collateral for high demand. To learn more about it, visit this link: Sports AMM - Overtime Documentation  We see that Overtime and Thales are different products & proposals target different areas. Nonetheless, in our opinion it would be best for the Op ecosystem to issue grants for specific goals within the next 6 months (incl. builder initiatives) and have ecosystem teams \u201cspend these tokens\u201d on sustainable growth initiatives (or give them back?) instead of \u201csitting on tokens\u201d for future usage.  Fee Rebates incentives would be committed until they are depleted and are not possible to have a fixed timed emissions. Fee Rebate emissions are proportional the usage of Overtime. Bucket of 30% towards targeted campaigns are also impossible to time right now since it requires to be highly adaptable to upcoming major events in the world of Sports. ",

Launched 2 months ago and achieved some traction already - partially due to incentives from Thales incl. OP. The proposal can help Overtime & Optimism gain users. Traction Until now, Overtime Market has been performing well in attracting early power users & almost 1K total users. Metrics achieved in 65 days since launch on Optimism:  943 unique traders 8,609 total trades above 200 txns per day 15 supported sports leagues and rising $1,041,389 Settled Volume $2.1M Notional Volume above 60 Unique Daily Users on average incl. daily new users  Amount The requested amount is 300K $OP tokens, which is a reasonable figure. But given that the Overtime team is partly the same Thales team that already received a grant of 900k $OP tokens in phase 0, the requested amount is high. Thales Phase 0: https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-thales/1078\" OP Distribution Distribution of up to 50K for World Cup incentives, rest of targeted events & fee rebates depends on market demand (might last longer than aspired 6 months)  70% as incentives in form of Fee Rebates to create an inviting environment to help with the Overtime growth and user increase. 30% as targeted events to help user growth of new league and sport integrations.  Co-incentives The co-incentives will be determined by governance, which is the same as Thales\u2019 governance ( https://docs.overtimemarkets.xyz/decentralized-sports-markets/governance). And if implemented, it will be with the Thales token. Alignment As an Optimism native platform. there is no doubt that the Thales team is aligned with the Optimism ecosystem, Recommendation NO Overtime Market is a good product that is getting decent early traction - with OP/Thales incentives. Looking at the analytics & current fee rebates, the fee rebates would largely accrue to current top users and would likely last a lot longer than 6 months. At the same time, the Thales team still has almost 100% of funds for ecosystem projects, and we believe this would justify reducing the fee rebate program & total grant amount at least 1/3. This recommendation should not hinder on-boarding during the world cup as max 50K of OP were suggested and we\u2019d recommend re-submission for the next cycle Our past recommendation is available on committee recommendation thread.

At the moment, Overtime odds competes with major centralized bookies, although it doesn\u2019t always have the edge. Fee rebates, allows us to not only compete, but take the lead on offering the best odds in the industry. This is a major point to attract users from web2 to web3. Without a solid offering there\u2019s not many reasons for them to make the move. This is why offering the best odds is of importance. The table below compares the odds of 2 major centralized bookies and Overtime with rebates and different sizes.  image802\u00d7854 46.5 KB  As incentives rolls out we are working on new solutions to bring the price impact of buyers down. The first solution which will be implemented in the next few days starts with offering a price impact discount to position where the AMM is heavily involved. You can further ready about the TIP here : Thales: Permissionless Parimutuel markets. The second solution is to increase the AMM liquidity. Overtime is currently a new product and opening the AMM to the public would be reckless. As we move out of \u201cBeta\u201d and further work on the kinks of the AMM to be as efficient as possible we will make the move. At the moment we are working on this for the CryptoAMM. Opening the AMM for deposits will allow to increase the liquidity per market hence decreasing the price impact of big volume buys. As you can see we have plans to bring the best prices to our users, and we are grateful for the opportunity to obtain 300,000 $OP tokens to help us incentivizes this growth plan. Truth is that without these incentives we would lose our immediate edge and therefore wouldn\u2019t be as attractive as one can be. This means less users for Overtime and Optimism. ",

We think there is an information gap that Overtime could meet by reporting more of their expected go-to-market strategy, but now is the time to give them an opportunity to jump ahead of the pack. ",

Its actually the only distribution mechanism that is impossible to be sybiled or drained by whales.  they would likely last a lot longer than 6 months  I guess this assumption is made by taking into account the historical volume for a protocol that is released two months ago and was in beta with relatively low liquidity caps. We have huge plans for the next month, including releasing Parlays and opening up the Sports AMM to anyone to provide liquidity on the sports they choose, which is likely to 10x the volume and also increase the TVL on Optimism. We hoped these plans would be backed by this grant for max impact.  the Thales team still has almost 100% of funds for ecosystem projects  Idk what this is trying to say, but if its about the Phase0 grant, well Thales distributed almost 50% of it, and in that process it achieved an amazing increase in volume and unique users for the Crypto AMM product, while ensuring the rewards go to the hands of organic users (not sybilers, farmers, etc). I fully believe that Thales is one of the firsts, if not the first protocol that has actually used the majority of Phase0 grant for what it was actually intended, while keeping Optimism\u2019s best interest in mind, instead of hording the tokens in treasury, self-delegating those in governance, paying grants to its developers, or whatever other governance mockery we\u2019ve seen other projects pull to date. Also, to reiterate a fact said many times: Overtime did not exist during Phase0 allocation. In general, I do feel like pointing out that this recommendation goes against the sentiment of the Optimism\u2019s community, which was demonstrated both here and in discord\u2019s temp check. And it does so for some wrong assumptions, which makes me wonder if the said DeFi committee has tried the product, watched it grow, or understands the potential of the 50 billion dollars industry we are tapping into here. Ultimately, if this committe does not see the value in supporting Overtime as an Optimism native project, well thats a clear signal by itself. ",

                    "content": "We at ScaleWeb3 would like to share a bit more insight to our (personal) reasoning: Unfortunately, there was little time for feedback and discussion of this proposal as our committee took it over on a short notice. That said, I, Julian, personally looked into this proposal probably longer than into any other on this forum as we saw great value but were keen to understand the details. First of, all committee members shared that they appreciate the Thales team\u2018s contributions,  and have acknowledged the value proposition of Overtime and value-add of the current proposal on multiple occasions. (In fact, a committee member is satisfied enough to vote Yes. Prob you\u2018ll hear that reasoning as well soon.) Let\u2018s dive in to the content and why we\u2018d recommend a slight adjustment of the proposal before resubmission in the next cycle in 2 weeks:   Fee rebates: We see why they are needed, that they are hard to game and yet we are a bit worried that they may largely accrue to the current powerusers. Consequently, we are supportive of fee rebates but want to see their impact and how well they do in ONBOARDING NEW USERS FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD as that is the suggested KPI that would add tremendous value to Optimism (See first rewards on Overtime)  Co-incentives: This was not detailed enough in our opinion as it completely depends on your governance. From a young project, we don\u2018t expect huge monetary co-incentives but certainty on incentives, potentially a pre-approval from your community to match x% (or not), would help the evaluation of the proposal.  Go-to-market & Onboarding of users from Web 2: The comparison to centralized platforms is great, onboarding of Web 2 users is needed for real, sustainable growth but also a long shot at this early stage. In a comment above you mention web 2 users will learn about web 3 & EVM compatible wallets due to fee rebates (-> better rates on Overtime). If these users are indeed your target audience, you have to do a lot of education, wallet onboarding sessions and much more (also good use of grant money) - we lack a bit of fantasy to see the impact on non-existing crypto user onboarding. Besides that, we initially thought the event focus would include all kinds of online marketing campaigns (also good use of grant funding) but we ultimately came to understand that you want to rather focus on some monetary incentives for markets & competitions. Overall, each of these initiatives is good use of grant funding (and we don\u2019t want to judge the merits of the different initiatives) but there was some detail missing to get a clear picture for the use of funds & onboarding.  Traction & Amount Asked: 60 active daily users & almost 950+ unique users are a great achievement for a new Op native project. It\u2018s important to note though that this behavior has been incentivized with OP and THALES tokens with a loss coverage program & fee rebate program. 300K Op is a significant amount for a project that\u2019s less than 2 months live (!), especially with somewhat unclear co-incentives, distribution, runway.  Distribution: We strongly believe in running short incentive programs (up to 6 months) to learn, improve, potentially create another co-growth proposal. (We mentioned that Thales still has unspent tokens for ecosystem projects as we expect them to be spent & to help other delegates understand the full picture, that there are additional funds that could be utilised before offering a second grant - Yes, we know those are different grants, products & it\u2019s totally fair to ask for a new grant!) besides that, Overtime mentioned some incentives would be committed until they are depleted and it was not possible to have a fixed timed emissions. (Totally true for gas tanks & fee reductions based on usage - potentially should be refillable IF campaign is successful?!) Hence, we looked at your current emission schedule or bi-weekly 8000 OP incentives \u2192 100.000+ OP would allow you to run this experiment for 6 months - which is plenty of time to make learnings and draw conclusions to propose even better co-growth initiatives.  @danthales @Red thanks for your response and for the additional data. I can only repeat that we all are supportive of Overtime, genuinely liked the proposal and this was a close call where we were also torn between YES & NO. We understand all delegates who are already satisfied and vote YES. However, we recommend NO as we believe reducing the remaining uncertainties, getting buy-in from your community, and slightly adjusting the Ask will make the proposal better, help with future accountability (+ avoid setting a bad precedent), and resubmitting in 2 weeks (!) is the best way to go. Good luck with the vote!  ",

You are correct, we looked into data and saw that rebates are aligned toward power users and consensus was that we should also focus on on-boarding new users. On ecosystem fund, I think you are talking about something else because as per author\u2019s comment, 90K $OP allocated for ecosystem project is sitting in the treasury.     padzank:  Regarding the question around Builders on Thales. The 90,000 OP tokens allocated towards community builders on top of Thales remain unallocated in the Thales treasury since there was not much initiatives yet. These will remain reserved as future incentives for community builders willing to work on structured products for Thales and/or alternate front-ends and similar initiatives.   We obviously dont want to spend the token furiously but our goal was to understand why its not being used to give a jump start to a new solution developed by the team. This was asked twice but we did not get an answer. I understand that Overtime did not exist during Phase 0 and when reviewing this proposal we considered Overtime as an independent solution and that is why we are not talking about complete Phase 0 proposal. This is how I see it, an innovative protocol build by team with dedicated fund set aside for ecosystem growth. Third point was co-incentives. Co-incentives are proposal and protocol specific and I tried to get my doubt clarified, twice.     OPUser:  when can we expect more info on this ?   After not getting a clear answer on the forum, I reached out to the author via DM to collect more information so that we can make an informed decision.  image1747\u00d71763 297 KB  removing text as team might not want to make the detail public. summary is that information was provided on 30% allocation but co-incentives were still not clear  image1425\u00d7726 71.7 KB  I see some people think I am against the protocol and attacking me. What I would like to insist is that, we are mixing the credibility of protocol with the recommendation of this proposal, we spent significant time reviewing this proposal and looked at it from all angle, one reason for publishing recommendation at the last was because I was waiting for additional information to my DM. I believe that all proposal should get a fair review and chance to participate in this gov and we should welcome them to Optimism ecosystem through this governance funding. Apart from spending significant amount of time on the forum, usually I reach out to proposal\u2019s author via DM and on discord to understand their side and to collect more information with a goal that final decision is not made in a hurry or on the basis on half-knowledge. Help me understand, what else I should have done from my side. Like Julian from @ScaleWeb3 has mentioned, we are all supportive of Overtime and believe that its goals are aligned with Optimism and echo his view on resubmitting proposal in 2 weeks than rushing things and setting bad precedence.

The other point of DM is reassuring that any OP token emissions are matched with THALES tokens, but that it is better to not throw numbers before it\u2019s time, because it is impossible to find a perfect balance of co-matching before it\u2019s time to deploy the programs. Co-incentive numbers we say now may not be in balance when the time comes to deploy the said programs, and this claim is in benefit to the guidelines of co-matching and should not be seen as uncertainty. I am kind off confused how you folks managed to see it under that lens. The 90k OP allocation is reserved as grants for third party builders on top of Thales Protocol, and that is how it is cemented ever since Phase 0 allocation. We take our commitments to Optimism Governance seriously and would feel like doing bad by the community of builders and evading Phase 0 promises by using these 90,000 OP tokens towards a product that is not built by Third Party Community builders but by the core team. Again, confuses me that this also is taken as a flaw in our commitments instead of a positive precedent. Hope this gives more context to both @OPUser and @ScaleWeb3 messages above. ",

We strongly believe in Overtime and you better believe we will try our earnest to make it a huge success story for both Thales and Optimism.  300k OP tokens ask was made with the aim to avoid contention for smth that is clearly a promising product. I am not making a case that 300k is a trivial amount, but so many projects with much less to show in both traction and aligned interests have been endorsed, and you are throwing a fight against allies here. Many chains are eager to  have Overtime and have reached out, but I speak at least for myself in saying that I want to maintain it Optimism native for the foreseeable future. However, we have a governance in place that is watching this proposal very closely, so I feel some committee members should zoom out a bit from their typical poorly written NPC AI questions and consider the community\u2019s sentiment, PR and the bussiness side of their recommendations.

                    "content": "I think Scaleweb3\u2019s last explanation is directionally correct in emphasizing experimentation and validation but makes a few key errors that I think lead to an opportunity to make suggestions on how committees can go about their work. I\u2019ll take this opportunity to show where I think this review is lacking context or due consideration. All quotes from Scaleweb3\u2019s explanation of his committee\u2019s conclusions. Fee rebates.  we are a bit worried that they may largely accrue to the current power users\u2026want to see their impact and how well they do in onboarding new users  If I understand this correctly, the fear is that Overtime will not deliver on getting new users to the door and thus that rewards are recycled by current players. Here\u2019s the thing: you can\u2019t evaluate this grant the way you would liquidity mining. To explain why, I\u2019ll start by highlighting a fundamental misunderstanding of the protocol:  If pricing & fees are already better than on centralized platforms and aren\u2019t holding back adoption  This is incorrect and is the first presumption that should have been validated in the course of assessing the grant. Overtime have demonstrated that fee rewards are required to make the protocol economically competitive at both the small and large bet level with the objectives of bootstrapping 1) volume growth and 2) user growth. The question isn\u2019t whether organic user growth is achievable without rewards; user growth demonstrably requires fee rewards due to the need to compete with centralized book spreads before a threshold of userbase and volume is met. Determining this threshold isn\u2019t straightforward but even getting a rough idea is essential for understanding what\u2019s at stake. When asked, the Overtime team said that they can be economically competitive at $1mm weekly trade volume, which translates to an achievable but not easy 4x increase in use (this would also roughly get to 240 daily traders). In other words, what Overtime are asking for is a textbook example of a catalytic grant. The subsidy ensures competitiveness until enough scale is reached for the protocol\u2019s economics to independently continue to attract users. It is unlike, for instance, liquidity mining, where what was initially uncompetitive in most cases becomes uncompetitive/undifferentiated again and the target users go somewhere else. The position that you\u2019re not sure about the strength of Overtime\u2019s adoption because they\u2019ve used some incentives so far is like saying \u201cyes, the plane looks well-built\u2026let\u2019s see it fly without the wings.\u201d The fact that the World Cup is happening next month, as is the capability to let LPs feed into the AMMs, means that withholding a grant for three weeks is setting Overtime up to fail because they simply can\u2019t get the competitiveness they need themselves. More thorough DD would also have encouraged Overtime to reveal the source of this competitiveness, which the Shadow Committee did (and resulted in that table being generated), or determine what sort of balance between scale and volume would have to be reached to get to that independent competitiveness (answer: you need lifers and about $1mm weekly volume). Go-to-market and Onboarding  If these users are indeed your target audience, you have to do a lot of education, wallet onboarding sessions and much more (also good use of grant money) - we lack a bit of fantasy to see the impact on non-existing crypto user onboarding.  A cursory look reveals an interesting fact about sports bettors (and gamblers in general): they are among the most crypto-savvy populations out there. Centralized gambling sites have been taking crypto from wallets for at least twice as long as the ScaleWeb3 Twitter account has existed. As far as new onboarders to crypto-based betting go, they\u2019re some of the lowest-hanging (and most valuable!) fruit you can get. They also are a very unique kind of userbase, which requires a vertical-specific GTM \u2013 i.e., you need to follow the expertise of people who know what matters to these players, and a lot of it in this case has to do with pricing in an arguably commoditized product. You also want to go to where the majority are and solicit participation from some of the largest players. An experienced sports bettor himself, Spreek, who works closely with Overtime, will tell you this. Even though Scaleweb3 hasn\u2019t intuited this fact despite his experience with prediction markets (which have also been taking crypto for years), it\u2019s still important to be able to substantiate your claim with a question or two to the proposing team. Co-incentives  This was not detailed enough in our opinion as it completely depends on your governance. From a young project, we don\u2018t expect huge monetary co-incentives but certainty on incentives, potentially a pre-approval from your community to match x% (or not), would help the evaluation of the proposal.  I\u2019ve been on this for weeks so I won\u2019t belabor the point, but I continue to question the need for too much definition up front when there is inherent uncertainty in Thales\u2019 need to build up their own resources and ensure an appropriate backstop for their operations. I\u2019d go so far as to say that it\u2019s on committees to have proposal-specific explanations for why they want to see co-incentives if they\u2019re going to vote one way or another on them. A final point, because I think we ought to hold ourselves to a higher standard when assessing these proposals (after all, these are enormous grants) \u2013  Overall, each of these initiatives is good use of grant funding (and we don\u2019t want to judge the merits of the different initiatives) but there was some detail missing to get a clear picture for the use of funds & onboarding.   Unfortunately, there was little time for feedback and discussion of this proposal as our committee took it over on a short notice. That said, I, Julian, personally looked into this proposal probably longer than into any other on this forum as we saw great value but were keen to understand the details.  Scaleweb3 says that he conducted exhaustive due diligence but also didn\u2019t have time for basic details to be surfaced. You can\u2019t have it both ways. Get enough information to make a review or punt on the recommendation. Overtime posted their review at the very start of this voting cycle, and they were the only proposal initially assigned to Scaleweb\u2019s committee. If they find that they didn\u2019t have enough time to manage even this proposal, that\u2019s a problem. A final note: this is not an attack on Scaleweb or Committee B. I am (and have been) trying to demonstrate the kind of work and understanding I believe ought to go into these recommendations. The stakes are high. ",

The quote you shared re pricing/fee competitiveness to centralized platforms was one of our questions during review before we made the recommendation. Hence, exactly what you ask us to do  Re World Cup: 50K Op was reserved. This is likely a great invest for OT and Op as mentioned. We made sure that our recommendation would not jeopardise onboarding. Re adoption: we shared our belief that prediction markets and especially sports betting are likely one of the early killer apps. Early traction is good. 60 unique active users aka addresses is still a small amount - especially with active incentives. That said, good proposal, happy to see the co-incentives got clarified after our recommendation (100% matching ) and looking forward to see great adoption in the coming months. Edit: In our opinion, a small difference in assessments led to different recommendations. Our committee C was looking for a bit more specifics/details on some parts of the proposal and generally more inclined to support grants with a clear scope for <= 6 months to evaluate and potentially lead to follow-up grants whereas Jack & his committee prefer to give teams a bit more slack. We wouldn\u2019t say approach 1 or 2 is necessarily better for the growth of the Optimism ecosystem but the former helps with accountability. ",
