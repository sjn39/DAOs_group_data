If it\u2019s extraneous or doesn\u2019t belong, well\u2026 this will be the sole edition. Baked in rarity. While Dai-lights covers the movement of DAI throughout the expanding cryptoverse, this series aims to follow the news. Some may only tangentially relate to MakerDAO, but crypto news travels in waves. So, let\u2019s dive in.  LIDO shows why Governance matters  Lido DAO rejected a $14M deal with Dragonfly Capital, but it didn\u2019t come easy. LIDO is Ethereum\u2019s largest \u201cliquid-staking\u201d protocol. Through it, users deposit ETH to receive stETH, a liquid derivative that can be actively traded, swapped, or pooled. As Ethereum storms closer to the \u2018Merge\u2019, attention\u2019s shifted to the future. With the transition to PoS, the burden of network security falls on these delegate protocols. Something that\u2019s already being tested.  10/ A summary of the proposal:\u2022 20M LDO (2% of supply) to be sold by the DAO treasury at a purchase price equal to $29,043,051.43 in $DAI stable coin.\u2022 DragonFly Capital to acquire 1%, or 10M LDO.\u2022 Other partners to acquire the remaining 1%, or 10M LDO tokens.\u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) July 26, 2022  The tokens were to be offered at a significant discount from their current price point ($1.45/ea) and with no lock-up or vesting schedule. The proposal offered three options:  No \u2013 the proposal needs work; For \u2013 Keep as listed, 1 yr lockup; For \u2013 Keep as listed, no lock-up  Despite overwhelming opposition on the LIDO Governance Forum, and \u201cNo \u2013 the proposal needs work\u201d dominating the early voting; an anonymous whale still dropped a mammoth $15M LDO vote for \u201cFor \u2013 Keep as listed, no lockup\u201d. Per Alex Svanevik of Nansen.ai, the wallet was initially funded by Alameda Research. SBF sure has been busy\u2026  Fortunately, the vote was trumped by a larger whale (blue whale?), and the proposal ended with a 66% \u201cNo\u201d vote. So, crisis averted \u2013 but it\u2019s a vivid reminder of the importance of a vigilant community and robust system of governance. Sidenote: The LDO was set to be sold OTC for DAI.  zkEVM\u2019s are the new cool  It was only two weeks ago that I made my report on ZK Rollups, but a lot can change in 14 days. ZK protocols are locked in a pseudo \u201cCold War\u201d brought on by zkSync\u2019s announcement of a zkEVM testnet (a ZK capable of running smart contracts). Soon after, Scroll and Polygon joined the fray, and the race was on. These were not expected announcements. Many felt EVM compatibility was still years away - but here we are.  \u2b9b TLDR, we now have three zkEVMs vying for market dominance.    zkSync - poised for a Q4 2022 \u201cfair launch\u201d  Polygon-Hermez - launch expected in Q1 of 2023  Scroll - launch TBD following an \u201copen alpha\u201d phase   \u2b9b Why\u2019s this important?  Zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups are faster, cheaper, and more secure than their optimistic counterparts, but they traditionally came attached with a rather large caveat. They couldn\u2019t run smart contracts. To this point, ZKs have only been applied to a handful of simple use cases like token swaps, transfers, and NFT trading. zkEVMs, on the other hand, aim for full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This would allow for a rollup that looks, feels, and behaves like Ethereum mainnet.  \u2b9b How do they differ?  With the new era of ETH scalability now in sight, let\u2019s take a look at how these networks plan to operate. To start, a rollup can be EVM-equivalent or EVM-compatible. Optimistic rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum boast EVM-equivalency, meaning the network behaves in near parity with Ethereum layer-1. For devs, this leads to far less overhead when porting a project to layer 2, and for users, familiar tools like MetaMask have no issues operating as designed. EVM-compatibility is a much looser term. Compatibility doesn\u2019t guarantee devs access to the same tools and frameworks available on layer-1. In some cases, contracts need to be rewritten entirely to launch on an EVM-compatible chain (and, potentially, in a different programming language). Per Luozhu Zhang of the Scroll team, EVM compatibility comes in three flavors: bytecode level, language level, and consensus level.   zkSync\u2019s EVM allows for developers to write contracts in Solidity, but the contract is then compiled into Yul (zkSync\u2019s native programming language). Because the code is compiled into Yul, the network is EVM-compatible at the language level, but not fully equivalent.  Polygon\u2019s zkEVM falls into the bytecode level category. This approach yoinks the compiler, allowing for contracts to be ported in native Solidity.  Scroll\u2019s also utilizes bytecode level compatibility, but is closer than Polygon to EVM-equivalency.  And that\u2019s where much of the confusion stems from. Bytecode level compatibility can be further boiled down. Explained in a Messari report:  \u201cPart of the [\u2018true\u2019 EVM] debate follows whether the EVM bytecode is being executed directly or interpreted first and then executed. In other words, if a solution does not mirror official EVM specs, it cannot be considered a true zkEVM. Within this definition, Scroll might be considered a \u2018true zkEVM\u2019 vs. the others.\u201d  Polygon has a massive leg up on circulating DAI, but with staggered roadmaps, it\u2019s tough to tell how that landscape will shift. For now, just sit back, relax, and watch the scalability unfold.  Disclaimer: None of the above should be taken as financial advice. I\u2019m just a guy who likes to read and write \u2013 maybe too much. Thanks for reading, skimming, or anything in between! ",

Teams feel a lot of pressure to exaggerate claims and timelines.   Fully agree. Strong chance the first won\u2019t be the best, and it could still be a while until they\u2019re \u201cready\u201d for traffic. It took Optimistics a full cycle to catch on and from a dev perspective, they\u2019re far cheaper and easier to launch on. Either way, good to see some strong bear market building. Also worth noting that EIP-4844 (and Proto-danksharding) should significantly decrease the average cost of calldata, making L2s absurdly attractive for both devs and users. Protocols might be trying to stay ahead of that potential surge. ",
