                    "content": " MIP40c3-SP16: The Strategic Happiness Core Unit Budget, SH-001  Preamble MIP40c3-SP#: 16 Author(s): Andrew Burban (@Saint.Burban) Contributors: @juanjuan, @TomDeMichele, @Nadia, @prose11 tags: sh-001-mipset Status: Formal Submission Date Applied: <2021-08-11> Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Sentence Summary MIP40c3-SP16 adds the budget for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001.  Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP16 adds the budget for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001. It includes the budget breakdown for Dai and MKR.  Specification  Motivation To fulfill the mandate of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit.  Due to foreseeable circumstances, I have largely blown up my personal trading account. I would like to avoid selling my precious MKR, so it is unlikely I can continue to fund everything from my personal funds. Still, I would love and be honored to continue shipping out the Happiness Airdrops uninterrupted. As such, I am making minor amendments to my budget proposal.  I am proposing a budget that will allow the freedom and flexibility to grow operations. I know everyone got a good laugh out of the budget I initially proposed  However, I quickly started noticing just how much interest everyone had in seeing me scale. After bouncing ideas off of others, examining my expenses, and considering my love for Maker, I realized that I would be much more effective with an appropriately sized ongoing budget.  Until recently, I only loosely tracked my expenses and airdrop recipients. As interest grew over time, I\u2019ve scaled my efforts. Going forward, I will need to invest in a system to help me stay organized and track my operations. I don\u2019t anticipate depleting the entire balance in the first quarter, but I would like to leave a buffer to scale.   Core Unit Name | ID  Name: The Strategic Happiness Core Unit ID: SH-001   Team Membership The Strategic Happiness Core Unit team will include:   @Saint.Burban: Random-Time, Shitpost Facilitator, Chief Happiness Officer   Quarterly Budget Implementation Based on actual expenses, I will propose a more comprehensive budget for the next quarter.     Item Amount     Dai Compensation    Facilitator 0 DAI   Shitposting 0 DAI   Swag 15,000 DAI   Shipping 10,000 DAI   Ongoing Operations 25,000 DAI   Travel 8,000 DAI       Total 58,000 DAI     Facilitator The Strategic Happiness team should be incentivized toward behaviors that support raising the morale of the MakerDAO Community. In addition to base pay, each SHCU member will operate under a strict compensation structure, a proactive process that aligns incentives with those of MakerDAO. The compensation structure follows these rules:  Base pay will be 0 DAI. Two-quarters of goal achievement constitutes a 0% rise in base pay. Not meeting goals results in base pay stagnation. Bonus pay is determined by MakerDAO Governance.   As might be clear by now, I\u2019m not requesting a salary at this time. I\u2019m only looking to have my expenses covered and the creative liberty to try out fun new things. Although I am not seeking a salary, I would be honored to be vested in MKR. I will leave this decision to the DAO. Note: If members of the community and the DAO insist that I accept a salary in the future, I would be open to it. For now, I\u2019m more than happy to spend my time working on this. I\u2019m just glad to be part of the reason the Maker community thrives    Shitposting  Free.99   As part of the SHCU mandate, I will continue shitposting uninterrupted and free of charge. I will revise accordingly if I expand this CU in the future and hire people to help me.   Swag & Shipping Bespoke Happiness Airdrops will typically contain:  Greeting Cards Random Gifts Custom Surprises Official MakerDAO Swag Unofficial Custom MakerDAO Swag   Cost Breakdown | A Typical Airdrop Based on experience, these are my expenses for a typical Airdrop:     Item Domestic International     Swag 50-350 DAI 50-350 DAI   Shipping 25-150 DAI 50-300 DAI   Customs 0 DAI  \u200d   Delivery 2-14 Days 1-16 weeks   Total 75-500 DAI 100-650+ DAI    After accounting for all expenses:  A typical Airdrop will usually cost several hundred dollars. Some run much higher, especially when shipping internationally.  Every additional ounce counts!    I can expect to reach about 30-50 people through Airdrops per quarter.  Ongoing Operations  CRM Software Bookkeeping Accounting Legal Travel Miscellaneous Costs   Travel I am requesting a quarterly budget of 8,000 Dai for travel.  This will allow me to attend Maker, ETH, and other worldwide crypto events. The budget will cover flights, lodging, food, etc. There should be enough funds to cover one to two events per quarter. Unused funds will be credited towards the next quarter\u2019s budget.   Clarifications  Unused Funds  Unused funds will be credited towards the next quarter\u2019s budget.   Future Growth If the SHCU continues to be successful, I may seek to expand my team in the future, and I will propose an adjusted budget to the DAO.  Swag Quality  To date, my airdrops have been relatively inexpensive, but in the future, if the DAO approves, I would like to send higher-quality airdrops.  Manufacturing and shipping costs for these may be much higher.   For the first quarter, I will work out of my existing budget.   Common Issues  Lost Packages When you\u2019re sending dozens of packages, the unfortunate reality is that some are bound to get lost or stolen, especially in these post-pandemic times.   Domestic: Very few, if any, packages go missing.  International: The rate is low but notably higher.   Shipping Insurance Shipping insurance is not expensive, but it often causes issues at customs if the declared amount exceeds some arbitrary value. Also, insurance claims tend to be more expensive (in terms of mental bandwidth) than whatever value I may recoup. The real loss is the TLC that went into putting the package together in the first place.  Customs Some countries with questionable customs standards have confiscated my shipments without notice or explanation (Venezuela). Others have demanded extortionary customs fees, sometimes into the thousands, before releasing a package to the recipient (South Africa). Other times, packages go missing with no explanation (France).  Remedies I\u2019m open to suggestions from anyone with experience in this field. For now, I\u2019ve just accepted that some will get lost, and I just eat the loss and send it again. It\u2019s unfortunate when I don\u2019t know whether or not my package even arrives since not everyone reaches out to me to confirm that they got it.  MKR Vesting The Strategic Happiness Core Unit proposes to vest its members with MKR to further align incentives. The MKR will be vested over a four-year vesting period, with a one-year cliff, subject to review based on performance. Vesting is proposed as follows: I hope that the Community will help me establish a fair amount during the RFC phase of this sub-proposal.  Budget Request Up-Front On day one, I am requesting funding up-front, as follows:     Description Amount     Quarterly Budget 58,000 DAI   Past Expenditures * 27,000 DAI   Other Expenditures ** 16,500 DAI   Projected Expenditures *** 5,000 DAI   Total 106,500 DAI         * The 27,000 DAI covers my past expenditures since the dissolution of Comm-Dev. ** The 16,500 DAI covers a swag order placed towards the end of August. *** The 5,000 DAI should cover expenditures until the next monthly Core Unit Cycle.   Transfers  Core Unit Wallet Address   Address:  0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550  Keyholder: @aburban90    Initial Transfer   Amount: 106,500 DAI  Description: Up-front payment for the first quarter\u2019s budget and reimbursement for past expenses.   Quarterly Transfers   Amount: 58,000 DAI  Description: Ongoing Core Unit expenses  Streaming: 58,000 per quarter  Dates: October 1st, 2021 through December 31st, 2021.  Note: Based on community interest and actual expenses, I will revise this budget going forward.   The Show Must Go On!  Whether or not this proposal is ratified, the Happiness Airdrops will continue!  I\u2019ve been with Maker since 2015, and I\u2019m grateful to be part of this community. All I want is to see us thrive!   Still, as this CU scales, compensation from the DAO would be appreciated.  Otherwise, Airdrops might only go out when number only go up!

Your proposed CU is good fun, but not really critical, somewhat similar to Shop CU. Shop CU understood their position and proposed a model with extremely low cognitive overhead, I suggest you think about doing the same. Your present proposal includes 0 base pay, some references to non-stated goals, bonus pay determined by governance and a nice-to-have MKR vesting. Would you consider scrapping all this and moving to something simpler like: Strategic Happiness CU proposes a budget of XXX Dai per month, 50%(?) of which is pay for employees? Remaining budget is spent on shitposting, memes, airdrops, competitions, shipping and whatever else you feel like doing. Much easier for all involved. Also I think you should state if this is a full-time job or sidegig or hobby or whatever it is. Right now nobody knows how much effort goes into this. Are you US-based? Maybe think about onboarding some people in the future based in Europe or Asia for round-the-clock shitposting. Your position will be rather similar to that of a court jester. Court jesters always got food, but never any land. I would seriously consider scrapping the MKR vesting proposal for this CU.  ",

Ripley\u2019s: Court Fools & Jesters  Shakespeare wrote many \u201cfools\u201d into his plays, most of whom were treated respectfully\u2026 Distinctions must be made within the category of fools, however: clowns, who turn farce into a precise science (think \u201cpie in the face); dunces, who turn their lack of intelligence into a medium for humor; and finally the princes of fooling, the court jesters, who turn fooling into a respectable profession. The court jester, ridiculous as they may look and act, was a crucial and respected member of the court. In fact, they were sometimes given the role of advisor to their King or Queen, relaying information that others dare not.  \u2026and yes, they were given land  TodayIFoundOut: What was it actually like to be a court jester?  King Henry II awarded 30 acres of land to a jester by the name of Roland le Pettour upon his leaving the court, with one stipulation as a part of the deal - that Pettour must once a year return to the court and \u201cleap, whistle and fart.\u201d   In the coming weeks, let\u2019s find some time to link up? Help me flesh out some revisions?  ",

Court jesters were the only ones permitted to say whatever they wanted to the King and so were quite valuable. Your Happiness CU could fulfill much of the same purpose, dampening the oh-so-serious discussions at times. A laugh makes everyone more relaxed.  I see the value in this. ",
