I think most people are skeptical and get scared away when they hear regulators might be coming. But as this continues to unfold and as people analyze what has happened to their investment, I suspect more people will be pro-regulation. Not over regulation but the bare minimum necessary to protect the public. And this actually speaks to a bigger issue. Whether we like it or not, in the US, regulations are coming and there is really nothing that can stop that. And this recent bloodbath has given regulators and lawmakers more incentive to get something on the books.  Crypto in general will need to adapt. ",
