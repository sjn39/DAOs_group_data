MUX\u2019s goal is to become the all-in-one platform for on-chain leveraged trading Key components in the MUX Protocol Suite:  MUX Leveraged Trading Protocol - A decentralized leveraged trading protocol that offers zero price impact trading, up to 100x leverage, no counterparty risks for traders and an optimized on-chain trading experience. Traders will trade against the MUX native pool (MUXLP pool) on the Leveraged Trading Protocol. MUX Leveraged Trading Aggregator - A sub-protocol in the MUX protocol suite that automatically selects the most suitable liquidity route and minimizes the composite cost for traders while meeting the needs of opening positions.

Yes  Optimism native?: No  Expected deployment on Optimism: Feb 2023  Ecosystem Value Proposition  What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? In DeFi space, on-chain leverage trading has always been a popular track with tons of players, especially now. However, as the protocols proliferate at a rapid pace, obstacles start to appear along the way: 1. The liquidity is scattered on different protocols, leading to liquidity underutilization. 2. While the liquidity is fragmented on different chains, there isn\u2019t a native approach to utilize the cross-chain liquidity. 3. The differences between pricing mechanisms and margin parameters on each protocol are vast; traders can\u2019t easily access the optimal pricing and trading experiences. In the Optimistic ecosystem, there is a lack of seamless user experiences of leveraged trading and enough liquidity for leveraged traders.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? MUX protocol has just launched the first ever leveraged trading aggregator, which acts as the all-in-one entrance for leveraged trading with best-in-class trading experiences. Currently, MUX has integrated with GMX and has a MUX native pool. Traders can save the hassle of figuring out which protocol to choose, which chains to move assets to by using MUX one stop access for leveraged trading. MUX aggregator provides the smart liquidity routes to the protocol with optimized trading cost. Besides, MUX also enables leverage booster with which, for example, traders can trade on GMX and other upcoming protocols with up to 100x leverage.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? With these solutions of on-chain leveraged trading, MUX will attract a constant flow of traders towards Optimism. Leveraged trading can generate huge trading volume as well as users adoption since it\u2019s one of the most widely adopted ways of trading. With both of the smooth trading experiences and the unified liquidity, MUX protocol will be able to grow to be one the key players in the DeFi leveraged trading space. Moving forward, we are integrating with more protocols to diversify markets and liquidity sources. So traders can stay in the Optimism ecosystem to enjoy liquidity and markets among all chains MUX integrated.  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No.  Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000  Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No  How much will your project match in co-incentives?: Not applicable.  Proposal for token distribution:  How will the OP tokens be distributed? We propose that the distribution of OP token is for trading incentive. Currently, the trading fee on MUX protocol is 0.08% and no leverage booster fee is charged. The fee model is very competitive in the DEFI space. The OP will be used as trading incentives and the mechanism in which we will distribute the rewards can be found below: Traders will receive 20% of their trading fee as rebate. The rebate will be calculated based on the trading fee that users paid. The distribution time will depend on the trading volume as well as price of OP. But we are targeting around 6 months. For example, If the average daily trading volume of the first month is $15M, the daily trading fee in total will be $12,000, then the first month consumption of OP will be 24,000 (assuming the price of OP is at $2.0). The trading incentive will be a strong factor to increase and maximize the number of traders on Optimism since MUX protocol on Optimism will be the cheapest among all chains and traders are very cost-sensitive.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals. MUX aggregator has only been live for no more than two months and has achieved $10M of daily trading volume. On optimism network, we are setting these targets which we believe are very achievable with our current traction: 1st month: $5M / day 2 - 3 month: $10M / day 4-9 month: $20M / day The incentive will last till all of token is consumed based on the rules.  Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Combined the two distribution plan, the launch of MUX protocol on Optimism will form the model below:  1600\u00d7971 120 KB  Trading volume: 1st month: $5M / day 2 - 3 month: $10M / day 4 - 9month: $20M / day  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? The incentive program is designed in a sustainable way. The trading incentive is to motivate traders to move to the OP ecosystem. As long as traders get used to the MUX smooth UX, low fee and unified liquidity, they will tend to stay. And without the incentive, MUX protocol still provides competitive trading fees. The overall user experiences will keep the retention rate.

(not required but recommended, when applicable): Not applicable How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): We propose that the distribution of OP token is divided into two segments: 1) as liquidity funds, 2) as a trading incentive.Liquidity Funds We propose that 30 (150k OP tokens) will be added in the MUX Pool as Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL). Instead of using funds as traditional liquidity incentive, we will directly put these OP token into our MUXLP pool on Optimism, which brings several positive effects:These OP funds will significantly improve the initial liquidity of MUXLP pool, which further improves the trading experiences on Optimism.With our universal liquidity and MUX aggregator, traders will enjoy deep liquidity and smooth trading experiences. The volume generated by users will further improve the MUXLP revenue, raise LP APY and attract more users to provide liquidity on MUX LP pool.This positive loop is more sustainable than purely liquidity mining incentive. The OP token will not be paper handed, which decrease the inflation pressure of OP.  2. Trading Incentive The other 70% (350k OP tokens) will be used as trading incentives. Currently, the trading fee on MUX protocol is 0.08% and no leverage booster fee is charged. The fee model is very competitive in the DEFI space.

Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism.

Token distribution will be as following: We propose that the distribution of OP token is for trading incentive. Currently, the trading fee on MUX protocol is 0.08% and no leverage booster fee is charged. The fee model is very competitive in the DEFI space. The OP will be used as trading incentives and the mechanism in which we will distribute the rewards can be found below: Traders will receive 20% of their trading fee as rebate. The rebate will be calculated based on the trading fee that users paid. The distribution time will depend on the trading volume as well as price of OP. But we are targeting around 6 months. For example, If the average daily trading volume of the first month is $15M, the daily trading fee in total will be $12,000, then the first month consumption of OP will be 24,000 (assuming the price of OP is at $2.0). The trading incentive will be a strong factor to increase and maximize the number of traders on Optimism since MUX protocol on Optimism will be the cheapest among all chains and traders are very cost-sensitive.

Instead of using funds as traditional liquidity incentive, we will directly put these OP token into our MUXLP pool on Optimism, which brings several positive effects:   Can you clarify whether these tokens would be owned by (and eventually returned to) Optimism governance, or is this a direct grant of property to MUX? If this protocol-owned liquidity is to be owned by MUX, what is the reasoning for it to be a grant rather than a loan, as is sometimes used with traditional market makers? Thank you. ",

There will be no POL $OP so no need to discuss if there will be a refund i got it but i think it would be more effective to add some LP on MuxLP to incentive more volume. But that\u2019s up to Optimism. Dividing compensation as 3 milestones seems more reasonable too. Those are my thoughts about the proposal but i want to mention more about how it would help to Optimism on below.   Perp trading is in hands of Arbitrum rn. I love to trade on Arbitrum however i don\u2019t like to see the chain all itself might became a monopoly on perp trading. I believe even those volumes should be distrubuted amongs other chains. What makes Arbitrum as perp hub is just the GMX hype around and i believe Optimism could take some volume from Arbitrum easily.   There are few perp protocols on Optimism such as Kwenta, Perp Protocol, Pika and OPX. 3 of them has competin on another type of perp protocol with their unique design and OPX is a fork of GMX. Mux\u2019s perp aggregator might be a great fit on here to aggregate all those protocols and might attract more traders to Optimism Network.   Optimism as a network needs more diversified dapps imo. The network mostly built on top of Synthetix Protocol and has less diversified dapps. Adding Mux into the Optimism incentive program might help to get more dapps to expand here aswell.   MuxLP is also a good way to attract more TVL from other chains. It would help Optimism to gather more TVL and there is an opportunity to built vaults on top of MuxLP which also brings more TVL form other chains. GMX and Arbitrum gets lots of TVL via those \u201chedged\u201d vaults (which is arguably hedged btw).   Mux Protocol is also launched on 4 different chains too. It might help Optimism to get direct exposure from other chains traders. It\u2019s really easy to switch between chains and Optimsm can show how easy to trade on it\u2019s network to those traders. I would rather to use protocol on Optimsm actually rather than Polygon or BNB network because of low fees + better security assumption + faster transaction and for the god sake no reorgs (yet). This is a gud way to show how Optimism is running smoothly to other users in a one multichain dapp.   Those all are my opinions and wanna talk more about them if u want to ask anything or you find something odd. Pls respond it. ",
