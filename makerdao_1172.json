This collaboration resulted in the creation of the report \u201cShould Maker Manage Sustainability? What Topics Will Be Most Relevant to Future-Proof the DAO\u201d which includes the results of an ESG Survey filled out by MakerDAO community members, delegates and CU facilitators. In this post we discuss:  The background and context that inspired the collaboration Address sustainably discussions in the MakerDAO community, such as: MakerDAO\u2019s credibility in pursuing sustainability and climate change practices. Share key takeaways from the ESG survey that Julian conducted as part of his report:  The identification of the most relevant sustainability topics for Maker. Top rated sustainability topics for Maker by rank. Highest rated next steps in terms of Strategy & Processes for Maker.   Share links to Dr. Frede\u2019s full report \u201cFuture-proofing Maker by managing sustainability\u201d     Context Cryptocurrencies and Maker are confronted with a rapidly changing world: The economy is shifting towards low-carbon production, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a significant increase in funding as well professionalization and governments & regulators are increasingly putting the crypto market into focus. Many of these changes are clustered under topics related to sustainability. Sustainability is about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This requires checking and managing risks and opportunities in the three dimensions of sustainability: society, environment, and economy. It\u2019s time for MakerDAO to analyze the risks and opportunities regarding ESG factors to secure the DAO\u2019s long-term resilience.  Sustainability Discussions on the MakerDAO Forum to Date In October 2021, an ambitious and visionary proposal was introduced to the MakerDAO community, \u201cThe case for Clean Money\u201d which received much engagement and thoughtful debate both for and against the merits of MakerDAO\u2019s ability to tackle climate change, as a core piece of its vision, strategy and business objectives. Above all else, one point of agreement within the MakerDAO community is that DAI supply should be growing over the long term, whilst preserving the integrity of the protocol. With this overarching goal in mind, MakerDAO SES recognized a few key points of discussion as it relates to the potential pursuit of MakerDAO strategic initiatives related to sustainability and climate change, that we believe need to be addressed. Namely,  MakerDAO\u2019s credibility in pursuing sustainability and climate change practices The relevance of MakerDAO\u2019s core business to Climate Change and ESG MakerDAO Community appetite for pursuing Climate Change and ESG related initiatives.   Getting a Grip on the Relevance of Sustainability Topics for MakerDAO It is apparent that the MakerDAO Community requires clarification around the specificities of how to get a grip on sustainability and what topics could be relevant to future-proof the DAO. In this context, the following key questions have been identified:  image1412\u00d7790 95.5 KB  In an effort to address these key questions related to MakerDAO and sustainability, MakerDAO SES is collaborating with Dr. Julian Frede, a sustainability and impact management expert to assess key ESG risks related to Maker\u2019s objectives and stakeholders. As an initial first step, Dr. Frede conducted an ESG survey within the MakerDAO community and published the results and final summary of the most relevant sustainability topics to future-proof the DAO. He also presented the insights of the conducted survey in the MakerDAO SES Biweekly Status Update that took place Friday, May 13th 2022. This report discusses the material, or most relevant, sustainability topics for Maker.      Through his research and analysis Dr.Frede has built the basis for an informed discussion at Maker about integrating sustainability into its business management by identifying:  Where and how sustainability topics are relevant to boost and secure its business activities, and where and how Maker activities have relevant positive or negative effects on society and the environment.  Mapping Makers\u2019 stakeholders to identify the scope of the analysis Discussing the context for relevant sustainability topics Identifying relevant sustainability topics Identify existing elements of responses to sustainability issues.   Focus of the Initial Research Step  image1590\u00d7890 231 KB  A key step in Dr.Frede\u2019s research was mapping Maker Stakeholders  Summary of the Findings of the Sustainability Report Within the report, Dr.Frede illuminates answers to key discussion points that have been taking place in the community with sections such as:   Mapping topics on Maker: Where are risks and opportunities in the sector? Identification of categories of sustainability topics that are related to Maker:   CO2 footprint \u2013 Managing the major KPI on climate change  Cyber ecosystem risks and developments \u2013 keeping the combination of first-mover and best practice (Day 1 idea of Jeff Bezos). Digital trust is a key element of this category.  Financial inclusion \u2013 Understanding and growing the benefits of this customer base as it is part of Maker\u2019s DNA to create an inclusive platform for economic empowerment for everyone. Talent & People \u2013 Staying the employer of choice  Regulation \u2013 Understanding the reasons for regulation and engaging with governments and regulators  Strategy and processes \u2013 Using scientific governance and data-driven management to identify and manage material sustainability topics  Community \u2013 Maker\u2019s engagement for the global community    As a core aspect of the report, Dr. Frede also shares the results of the ESG Survey that was conducted with the MakerDAO community. The purpose of this survey was to determine the relevance of sustainability related to Maker via a process Dr. Frede describes as Materiality Mapping.  image1920\u00d71072 68.6 KB  Dr. Frede explaining the process of Materiality Mapping during his MakerDAO SES Status Update One of the first takeaways from the ESG survey portion of the Materiality Mapping process was identifying the most relevant sustainability topics for Maker, from the perspective of the Maker Community.  image1592\u00d7904 134 KB  Dr.Frede Explaining these findings. Digging deeper into the identification of the Maker communities perception of the most relevant sustainability topics for Maker, Dr. Frede ranked the relevant sustainability topics by perceived importance.  image1590\u00d7896 90.8 KB  Another interesting takeaway from the Materiality Mapping process was the finding that there is significant overlap between what the Maker ESG survey determined as important and what experts from the outside world find important.  image1590\u00d7896 67.9 KB  The Maker ESG survey also identified key areas where the Maker community sees potential next steps, which is of high importance for broad based stakeholder buy-in to future initiatives.  image1600\u00d7898 101 KB   Next Steps Towards a Sustainable, Future-Proof Maker Perhaps most importantly, Julian provides a path forward in the report for the MakerDAO community to make substantive progress in the future by clarifying next steps, such as:  image1600\u00d7898 84.1 KB   Access the Full Report and Survey Results To read the report in full and discover which sustainability topics are relevant for Maker, as well as see the results of the ESG Survey, you can access them here.

I was part of this journey. A quick intro: I am the co-founder and managing director of a small consultancy, leading in facilitating sustainability and impact management: evolutiq impact advisory. I accompany various stakeholders such as banks, insurance companies, fund managers, corporations, and Development Finance Institutions in approaching the topic of sustainability or impact. Thank you @Haiku and @SES-Core-Unit (@juan, @wouter) for the many discussions and support on this report. Looking forward to the discussion within Maker - feel free to comment here in the forum or reach out via [email\u00a0protected]. ",
