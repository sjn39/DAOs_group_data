It is simply due to increased slippage at liquidations when having higher debt exposure. Luckily LINK has very high liquidity so there is still some buffer left before reacting.     lix:  total: 55736363.55   This is interesting @lix . So Aave stablecoin rates are currently a 2-3% higher but you can also borrow 8% more due to higher LINK LTV limit at Aave. I am curious to see how many of them might migrate to Maker when DC is increased. I am not sure about LINK-B at this stage, maybe it is better to wait and meet demand for LINK-A first? To me it seems that people need some time before they realize about Maker\u2019s new product offerings. ",

Adding one of these Vault types is still about 60% of the work of a new Vault type.  We typically don\u2019t need new oracle infrastructure to handle it, but the smart contract team work is the same.  This means that, if we add another Vault type, it\u2019s coming at the cost of something else.  Fairly certain this is a similar amount of work for UIs, databases, and keepers. What\u2019s more, we need to think about liquidations for these types.  Keeper infrastructure is extremely expensive, and in order to keep keepers as efficient as possible, we should think carefully about what additional collateral types we add.  This statement holds true for capital efficiency too.  Each new collateral type carries certain baseline capital constraints. This isn\u2019t to say we shouldn\u2019t do this without good reason, but I don\u2019t want governance to think of all these other concerns as an externality.  These choices impact Maker on many levels, and we would be best off to fit as much as we can into existing collateral types. ",

As a TL;DR the governance contract migration means that we may not have a regular executive on either the 27th November and the 4th December. I\u2019m hoping @SebVentures doesn\u2019t object, but I think we should consider this poll to end on Sunday 15th November, such that it can go on-chain on Monday and potentially be included in next weeks executive. Debt ceiling increases don\u2019t tend to be too controversial, and given that so far of 36 voters none have voted against, I don\u2019t think there is serious risk to the governance process by expediting this.  I would also like to point out that this will be the only change we can make to the YFI debt ceiling for 2-3 weeks, so a larger increase may be more advisable in this instance if governance wants to ensure that we don\u2019t hit the ceiling before we have a chance to modify it once again.

I get where you are headed with this, but fundamentally I do not agree. In general, the Risk Premium should be viewed from the lens of insurance. That is to say what should the insurance premium be to offset the risk of \u201cdefault\u201d or loss based a rapid drop in the price. The DAI that is then minted (or maintained outstanding) with that risk premium is \u201cin-effect\u201d riskless DAI  (and the reason why the DSR can be used to offset it, as it too is a riskless reward). Once that risk premium is determined, the only time to change it is when the underlying risk of the collateral changes. The core difference here is monetary policy vs. risk policy. We really should avoid mixing them where possible. ",

                    "content": "A lot of recent demand came from people refinancing from Aave. Looking at loan book at Aave I think between 20-30m seems to be some organic demand threshold, for now. So maybe 20m DC might be \u201chigh\u201d enough not to hit it again too soon, but hard to say as there might be some users who originally weren\u2019t borrowing at Aave\u2026 As for risk, YFI is one of most liquid tokens out there, also having high on-chain liquidity which decreases auction risks. Definitely risk premium rises with increased debt exposure, but I personally think that token such as YFI with 175% LR can have much higher DC as 20m. So the question is if we really want to increase rate by 1% at this early stage, because more than that probably isn\u2019t needed from risk perspective. The downside are high volatility metrics of YFI, but that is mostly related to initial pump and dump cycle that I hope is behind us, so volatility should decrease going forward. The question is if community wants to raise the rate above RP just because there is a clear signal of demand at 4%. I personally don\u2019t think we should be reacting so quickly as we might just become unreliable and damage new user adoption. ",

Except if there is strong disagreement from the community, I will stay with the current 20M DC (assuming nothing changes until Sunday). Maybe I should have added more debt ceiling and a combination with stability fees. Making a new poll would be messy and it\u2019s already a x3 of DC in less than few days. Messing with SF in a rush is not Maker culture neither I think. The matter will be discussed in the rates group anyway I expect. I also think it is best to not push too far and avoid the proposal to be refused by MKR holders with would be the worst possible outcome. ",

Based on that IDK how to feel about the idea of the DC going to $20MM. If you look in that sheet his simulations put the VaR for YFI at about 20% ~ 25% of the debt ceiling with the current LR. I don\u2019t have access to his model he used to run the simulation, but at $20MM I think the VaR would a bit higher than the stability buffer which is a slightly worrisome situation. If we want to go this high with the debt ceiling would we also consider raising the liquidation ratio to offset the extra risk there? Update: I updated some of my numbers. I had thought the Liquidation ratio was set to 150% but overall concern still stands for the 175% LR. Situation is not quite as bad though. My napkin math puts the VaR to be approximately a few hundred thousand over the stability buffer. Going to start a separate thread to discuss. ",

There has been strong demand for minting DAI from WBTC, maybe even stronger demand than from ETH. This is important to help stabilize the peg, and add DAI liquidity in this 0% rate environment. WBTC is in a unique position being the only active Bitcoin collateral on MCD. There has been some discussion in the community regarding raising the WBTC debt ceiling. Members discussing the risk profile of WBTC, and also an increased risk premium that should come with a Debt Ceiling increase to balance the increased risk exposure. WBTC Collateral Discussion - It should be noted that WBTC has some custodial and counterparty risk. Increasing the WBTC Debt Ceiling Increasing the WBTC Debt Ceiling would allow more DAI to be minted from WBTC. MKR Holders will be exposed to more risk. Particularly WBTC custodial risk and WBTC liquidation risk.     10M - No Change 15M 20M 25M Abstain     0 voters     How to increase the WBTC Debt Ceiling There has been discussion on how a WBTC Debt Ceiling increase should be implemented. We may want to keep WBTC Debt Ceiling room available for retail users. There are also some additional risks if the debt ceiling is being used by one vault. The winning option will be included in the poll with the WBTC Debt Ceiling increase. And if the poll passes, the debt ceiling increases will be included in the weekly executives.     All at Once 500k per week 1M per week 2M per week 5M per week Abstain     0 voters     Increase the WBTC Risk Premium There has been support for increasing the WBTC Risk Premium with a WBTC Debt Ceiling increase. Though, there may be some mixed opinions on how much to increase the WBTC Risk Premium. Some factors:  WBTC custodial Risk Comparison with ETH-A Risk Premium DAI liquidity Rate shocks  To keep it simple, you should assume a 0% ETH Risk Premium for this poll. If that changes before next week, that\u2019d be added to this poll result. If the Debt Ceiling Increase gets spliced up, the Risk Premium increase will also get spliced up. Note: Stability Fee = Base Rate + Risk Premium     1% - No Change 2% 3% 4% 5% Abstain I think the risk team should decide     0 voters     Polls will run until Sunday June 21 at 7pm UTC to be included with the weekly governance polls.

Simply because it has hit the cap does not justify increasing it (then what\u2019s the point of a cap anyways?). Right now we\u2019re still suffering from (slight) peg strength issues (see yesterday\u2019s discussion in #governance-and-risk). No collateral asset is charging a risk premium right now. If we need to artificially incentivize Dai supply to fix the peg, then it should (IMO) be only from ETH, additionall trustless collateral, or USDC-A, as they are the safest options. W-BTC contains risk that we don\u2019t fully understand. The only relevant question here is \u201chow much debt ceiling exposure do we want towards centralized assets.\u201d Additionally, we don\u2019t know if the W-BTC debt ceiling has hit the cap because of organic demand or because of massive rate arbitrage (likely the latter IMO). So once rates start to normalize (whatever that may be. If we want to discuss W-BTC or pure BTC risk premiums separately, let\u2019s do that), and then we can see what organic W-BTC demand is, and then we can maybe try to balance risk vs adoption / user demand. Otherwise, we\u2019re just incurring needless risk and printing Dai for no real benefit to the community. ",

I would argue that DAI issuance against ETH is a similar \u201crate arbitrage\u201d, and probably even more of an arbitrage since the ETH stability fee is 1% below that of WBTC while market rates for ETH have been consistently well above that of BTC since mid-late May (as evidenced by the futures curves, for example: all of the ETH curves have been in steeper contango than BTC by a few % ). So all in all I\u2019m not sure why we would class the 0% ETH CDPs as \u201corganic\u201d while the WBTC ones \u201carbitrage\u201d. This isn\u2019t only addressing your point above but I also saw people making this distinction a few times in the past. I of course do agree about setting the debt ceiling based on our view of the risk of WBTC (and in particular the custodian/redemption risk), to avoid concentration of risk in the collateral portfolio. I think that is what should almost always be the only reason for setting a debt ceiling. n.b. I am not suggesting that we ignore the fact that 90%+ of the DAI issued against WBTC was issued from one CDP. I voted for 10mm or 15mm debt ceiling, with adjustment made at 500k or 1mm per week, since I think we should be gradual with the increase and try to observe more data from future liquidations before building up exposure. I think a risk premium of 1 or 2% is fine since it is really only meant to represent a custodian risk spread (as BTC in general is more liquid and less volatile than ETH which is currently serving as our de facto \u201cbaseline\u201d with it\u2019s 0% rate).

It seems fine to me to raise the ebtc debt ceiling as long as there\u2019s some feasible process for keepers to rapidly liquidate wbtc during a crisis. Unlike other erc20 tokens, this liquidation process for wbtc will not likely be done on ethereum and so will fully rely on centralized exchanges, and mostly the single exchange coinlist at that.

Even just coinlist having temporary downtime due to high traffic could prevent the wbtc liquidation process from functioning properly. ",

So I would encourage people to consider compromise options and  keep in mind the mantra of voting for everything you would accept compared to the status-quo.

There is a general issue here related to risk clumping that I would like to hear @cyrus speak up to a bit.   Normally in good loan portfolios one has lots of smaller (or similarly sized loans) bundled.   This may have market risk but at least it spreads the default risk over many borrowers. I voted to up the DC but thinking again on the lack of spread in default risk and fact that the way the auction system works now 90% this collateral hits keepers at the same time I think there is a real valid concern all that upping the DC here will do is allow this single CDP to further borrow more increasing this risk. I honestly don\u2019t have a good answer to whale LR collateral pricing risk that is simple and easy to implement as a whale can just open 10-50 vaults of 200K to 1M and just set the LR to the same value in each as the system stands now.   This would not be true of 10-50 different people borrowing generally. If we up the DC here we bloody better be thinking about upping the SF.   I have a real concern that this 90% single vault player could just up their exposure and keepers literally have to have 2-3x the DAI TAB to have multiple bidders for it.  Otherwise we just have a revisit of BT on wBTC all over again without any way to control spreading this Liquidation Risk into other collateral pricing levels. If this 10M of borrowing was spread over 100 vaults with a median size of like 100K and a real spread of liquidation points I would be somewhat less concerned.    I do share others concerns over a general centralization risk and really would like to see an analysis regarding general centralization risk.  Meaning lets say US government decided to issue some new legislation (pick the scenario) how much of our centralized assets could be frozen and what would this mean for the system and DAI holders in particular.

The unique nature of WBTC and the extra steps to convert it to BTC and access the massive liquidity in those markets, means that buying a bit of extra time and taking a more hands on approach by governance could have huge impact on the outcome, until the WBTC markets and conversion options become more mature. It would require the community to keep a watchful eye on the price and the liquidation price of the vaults, but as long as the crash isn\u2019t completely instant I believe it should be possible to trigger the liquidation freeze in time, even without the planned decentralized liquidation freeze module that would make the required MKR significantly less (right now it requires a full executive vote, but bypasses the GSM).

Something like some reasonable % of all outstanding DAI/hr generally.     A Liquidation System Redesign: A Pre-MIP Discussion Proposal Ideas       Introduction This forum post aims to serve as a \u201cpre-MIP\u201d discussion, where the Maker Community and the Smart Contracts Domain Team can discuss and provide input on the proposed solution for a redesign of the liquidation system of the Maker Protocol.  The main goal of this \u201cpre-MIP\u201d forum post is to introduce a proposed solution for a liquidation system redesign and gather feedback in preparation for the creation of a formal Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP), which will contain more implementati\u2026     I really don\u2019t like to have as a system fall back on governance since it is slow to act.   If I remember right the auction halts don\u2019t need to wait for the system 12hr delay though so once governance DOES act halting them should be quick. I think a real issue within the system that I don\u2019t have any idea on how to deal with except to throttle liquidation volume is this liquidation point risk clumping.   It would be an interesting idea to offer a modified SF based on the liquidation ratio the vault is setting in.    So lets say the SF is N% give a vaults with > 500% CR on inception a SF rate discount , under 200% as SF rate premium of some kind. Use the SF itself as a behavior modification mechanism to reward people with higher CRs and punish people with lower CRs to drive liquidation points to lower values.   I would prefer to do this as a kind of fixed modifier derived based on what the SF actually is rather than as a % of the SF. Examples: LR>500% govSF              New effective vault rate. 0           0 2           1% 4           2% 8           4% LR<200% SFgov   New effective rate. 0    2% 2    4% 4    8% 8    12-16% etc\u2026   I think the smart contract vault interest calculation mechanics of this would be terrible if not impossible to do though and would prefer a simpler idea.    The above might create more clumping at high LRs vs. giving a nice gaussian type distribution or better a more linear one\u2026 ",

We may want to increase the BAT debt ceiling, as it is becoming one of our higher demand collateral types.

Personally, I feel we are a ways away from this maximum, although others may disagree. Pros:  More DAI can be generated from BAT, helping the peg  Cons:  We have more BAT locked in the protocol, and have to accept any risks that come with that  Increasing the BAT Debt Ceiling     5 million (current value) 7.5 million 10 million 12.5 million 15 million Abstain     0 voters     Polls will run for 2 weeks from Sep 1 to Sep 15.

Even if you used the 650K DAI per hour rate that only gives us about 52 hours until we hit the ceiling.  Passing Friday\u2019s executive and getting it live on chain will take a minimum of 60 hours and likely closer to 70. I\u2019m afraid this poll is already outdated and will not have the desired effect if waiting for Friday\u2019s executive.  It is very likely that if an executive doesn\u2019t get put up today the ceiling will be hit.  I recommend changing the poll deadline to be completed as soon as quorum is reached with a >50% actionable proposal, with intent of putting up an executive vote as soon as possible. I don\u2019t think hitting the ceiling will effect the peg and Maker will survive either way.  However, I do think Maker will take a reputation hit if people excited about yETH can\u2019t participate (personally I would like to show the ecosystem that we can scale in governance as well as a protocol).  I will also note that DAI does get turned into yCRV in this process, which directly helps restore the peg (about +200 million until parity). Fun fact: one million DAI was minted from yETH in the time it took to write this post. ",

We need >50% voting for a specific actionable proposal to be implemented as an emergency action with a quorum of 40.   The way I look at it, each poll is a continuum where you define the ceiling you agree on. If we focus on the last poll that solve all issue, there is 2 against and 7 for up to different ceiling. Assuming, the domain team is okay to go high, the poll result is 77% in favor of 1B ceiling. I would ask a quorum of 40 counting only those in favor (If not those that abstain or are against can make a proposal pass even if they are against). It\u2019s complicated because I wanted to leave all opportunities to the community. I didn\u2019t want to spend a day getting a no because people wanted X instead of Y. For instance, I don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t want to let the domain team decide. So a direct vote wouldn\u2019t work and we would have lost a day. I have pushed the ball that should have been pushed a week ago. @LongForWisdom feel free to manage it as you see fit, you heard the call from the community.

BAT does seem like it has similar risk profile to ZRX and KNC, but on the other hand we don\u2019t want to disincentivize BAT borrowing demand too much when DAI is above peg. I think it might be good to raise the risk premium 1-2% to start and then see if demand is still strong. On another note, is there interest in raising the liquidation ratio for BAT-A vault type as well? From the governance call yesterday it looks like the majority of DAI from BAT is above 300% collateralization, so it might be a good time to raise the LR towards 175%. ",

The \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d won the Governance Poll quite significantly, and so there will be no change, and no Executive Vote required.

PAXUSD recently maxed out at 30M and unless we increase will probably stay there for a while. Therefore I wanted to request a signal from the community on whether we would like to increase this debt ceiling further. I believe it was initially voted on to increase to 100M here but I missed why it was changed to 30M. I also heard in rocketchat that some believe PAXUSD may just get abandoned as its hard to unwind. Perhaps @cyrus can speak to this. Please vote for all options you agree with. Should we increase the PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling?     No Yes - Increase to 60 Million Yes - Increase to 80 Million Yes - Increase to 100 Million Yes - Increase to 120 Million Abstain     0 voters     Polling will run until 2020-09-23T04:00:00Z or a clear winner is determined with 40 participants or if @risk determines to increase the DC themselves.
