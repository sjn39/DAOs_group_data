The biggest suggested change that has come up is renaming MetaDAOs to Maker SubDAOs. The main reason is to avoid having to explain what a SubDAO is, since the term is more well known and more self-explanatory. Technically, a MetaDAO simply means a Maker SubDAO so the two are synonymous. The main downside is that SubDAO is not a very appealing brand, and is more of a technical term, however I think this can be solved by emphasizing the class names of the SubDAOs instead: Creator SubDAOs, Protector SubDAOs and Governor SubDAOs Other suggestions have been calling them \u201cMiniDAOs\u201d. It would be best to get clarity on this naming as soon as possible, and the deadline where a final decision will be required is when we vote in the language of the first Scope Frameworks and the Endgame Constitution at the end of Q1. The Recognized Launch MetaDAO Cluster MIP will also need edits, as well as any other MIPs that already exist that reference MetaDAOs. This will not be the only term to be changed, and in general the goal is to streamline terms away from \u201cEndgame terms\u201d towards more easily accessible words. All ideas for simplifications and better or catchier terms are welcome ",

Part of the appeal of MetaDAOs is that they are arms length from Maker: Maker Core isn\u2019t beholden to any particular MetaDAO. The terminology \u2018SubDAO\u2019 might hint at a system of CU-like structures, rather than the more autonomous structure envisaged by the Endgame Plan. Just a thought! In general, big fan of reducing some of the complexity around the Endgame and glad to see more distillable and explainable language on the way. ",

Refer to this essay on Bankless which tries to break down the concept of a subDAO\u2014in my opinion it aligns well with the idea of MetaDAOs in the Endgame context (eg. economic alignment with Maker Core, autonomy) ",
