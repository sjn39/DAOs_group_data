If it is serious some things you need to consider/define:  What makes someone an \u201cEnd Game Party Delegate?\u201d Does this apply to the full compensation for each delegate, or are they entitled to keep compensation they earn as a result of MKR delegated to them from other MKR delegators? Is this intended as a reoccurring/long term proposal? If yes, then it needs to be a MIP/MIP61 amendment. Our recommended signal time is two weeks, no urgent need has been presented to only run this signal for one week.  ",
