I know there were some debates and after 2 votes, proposition for UNI distribution to proxy users weren\u2019t accepted. I also don\u2019t get  any UNI token from airdrop, despite I thouhgt I was because of older CDP I\u2019d clase from Maker contract. But this distribution maked me opportunity to discover lots of interesting things about Uniswap and how to use it, and I\u2019ll be now regular user  Indeed we missed one of better opportunity of the whole Ethereum history, but I\u2019m sure there was not the last  ",
