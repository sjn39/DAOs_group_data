We have been assured that the Delegate Platform will remain the same, with more support from the Llama team and a name change rather than a diversion from the previously posted platform. Consequently, GovAlpha felt it appropriate to allow a name change in this instance rather than requesting a new platform be created - we feel this is consistent with similar previous decisions. If anyone has any questions feel free to reach out to me or @prose11. Also @Artem_Gordon Puncar has asked if this can be included in any forthcoming announcements so people are aware of the new name.
