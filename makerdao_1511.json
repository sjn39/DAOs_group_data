                    "content": " MIP40c3-SP78: RWF-0x Budget Proposal through 2022  Preamble MIP40c3-SP#: 78 Author: @christiancdpetersen Contributors: @teej and @eumenes Tags: core-unit, RWF-0x, budget Status: Withdrawn Date Proposed: 2022-08-03 Date Approved: <yyyy-mm-dd> Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip40c3-sp-rwf-0x-budget-proposal-through-2022/16968   Sentence Summary MIP40c3-SP78 represents a budget for a new Core Unit \u2014RWF-0x\u2014 through December 31, 2022. The budget for RWF-0x is derived from the split of RWF-001 into two independent Core Units (RWF-0x and RWF-001) and replaces MIP40c3-SP61.  Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP78 represents a budget for a new Core Unit \u2014RWF-0x\u2014 through December 31, 2022. The budget for RWF-0x is derived from the split of RWF-001 into two independent Core Units (RWF-0x and RWF-001) and, in part, amends MIP40c3-SP61. RWF-0x will submit a full calendar year 2023 budget no later than October 12, 2022 for the November 2022 governance cycle. The RWF-0x 2023 budget will be developed separately from RWF-001, set forth assumptions only applicable to RWF-0x, and be subject to a separate vote by the Maker token holders.  Specification  Motivation This subproposal should be reviewed in conjunction with the concurrently submitted MIP39c2-SP34: Creating RWF-0x from a Split of RWF-001 and MIP41c4-SP39: RWF-0x Core Unit Facilitator. There is a requirement for a new budget for RWF-0x and a reduction to the budget for RWF-001 for the remainder of 2022 (according to the split in personnel).  Core Unit ID RFW-0x  Budget Implementation RWF-0X budget implementation will use the DssVest. This can be changed if needed to any method achieving similar objectives. The interim budget will be in place from the date of RWF-0x\u2019s approval to December 31, 2022. RWF-0x will submit a full calendar year 2023 budget no later than October 12, 2022 for the November 2022 governance cycle. There will be two-of-three signers for the RWF-0x multi-sig operational wallet: [Operational Wallet Forthcoming]. The three signers for the RWF-0x multisig operational wallet will be:  @christiancdpetersen @aes @teej  A maximum of 2,188,750 DAI will be streamed to the RWF-0x multisig operational wallet from the date of RWF-0x\u2019s approval and ending December 31, 2022 (subject to the post-approval budget adjustment described above) at a rate of 437,750 DAI per month.  Budget Breakdown For the remainder of 2022, RWF-0x will have three dedicated contributors:   @christiancdpetersen (Core Unit Facilitator) @teej @eumenes  The pro forma budget below represents seventy-five percent (75%) of the existing RWF-001 budget. In the spirit of tightening the DAOs finances, RWF-0x will reduce the estimated monthly external legal fees by 75,000 DAI per month, for a cumulative savings of 375,000. As Core Unit Facilitator and having been responsible for the legal spend to support RWAs to date, @christiancdpetersen views this adjustment as reasonable. Below is a pro forma RWF-0x budget prepared on the basis of August 1 to December 31, 2022. To account for the time difference between August 1 and the date of approval, and with the assumption that @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes, and @teej will continue to support RWF-001 during the interim period on transactions allocated consistent with the proposal set forth in MIP39c2-SP34, RWF-0x and RWF-001 will make any necessary budget adjustments at the time of actual split to account for any expenditure deviations in excess of or below the pro forma budget. The adjustments will be prorated on the basis of a 30-day calendar month.  920\u00d7588 158 KB  The RWF-0x pro forma budget contemplates (without further budget appropriation) direct support for Monetalis (Project Clydesdale) MIP65 and other liquidity opportunities brought to the Maker token holders by the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) during the remainder of the 2022 calendar year. For the calendar year 2023, RWF-0x will prepare an updated staffing plan and assumptions for Professional Services. @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes, and @teej will maintain their current compensation arrangements through the end of the calendar year 2022.  MKR Compensation For the remainder of 2022, the MKR compensation proposed in the ratified MIP40c3-SP38 will remain in place for the remainder of 2022 and to cover MKR vested in 2022. This will apply to @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes, and @teej. RWF-0x will propose a new MKR compensation schedule as part of the 2023 budget cycle.

The budget proposal would replace the current RWF-001 Core Unit\u2019s budget. If this onboarding passes, 75% of the budget that is currently being allocated to RWF-001 CU, will be transferred from RWF-001 CU to RWF-0x CU. The budget proposal has a breakdown for the RWF-0x CU\u2019s part (75%). RWF-0x commits to submit a budget for 2023 no later than October 12, 2022. There is no breakdown for RWF-001 CU\u2019s portion (25%). This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  ",

However, what is even worse is that GovAlpha may deem it possible for an onboarding proposal of one core unit, RWF-0x, to split the budget for another core unit, RWF-001. If this is allowed then both core units fall under a shadow of uncertainty until the RWF-0x MIP is decided in two months. I would much rather see RWF-0x funded independently from RWF-001. If the funding were independent, at least RWF-001 could attempt to re-hire staff and focus on business continuity without more than the usual scrutiny from governance. As it is now, the vote on RWF-0x is severely confounded by the effect of this proposal on RWF-001.  I urge @christiancdpetersen to unhand RWF-001 and ask separately for RWF-0x budget. Make these CUs independent. ",

Can you clarify how much you care about splitting or not splitting the RWF-001 budget? This matter was discussed on the G&R call today. At least @juan, @CodeKnight, and @rspa seemed to appreciate my point of view and agree that the budget for RWF-001 should not be split. However, it is not clear to the community how much you care. It sounded like @christiancdpetersen might be open to funding RWF-0x independently of RWF-001, but it also sounded like he would need another nudge in that direction to make any changes before this proposal is frozen. If you don\u2019t care too much then I withdraw my reservations about splitting the RWF-001 budget to fund RWF-0x.  ",

                    "content": "@psychonaut Indeed, I think it is an important consideration point. This is not specific to RWF-0x in any way. It is important that budgets under the CU framework are created and maintained independent. The entire CU framework was founded on the notion that teams, if so they wished, could in theory operate in an almost perfect autarchy, by being fully independent from other teams. In practice, there are still operational dependencies for functions where teams may not perform as well as other teams e.g. engineering etc. But even in those cases, there is no precedent for a team to link its own operational budget to another team\u2019s budget. This is unprecedented. So, the fact that a team wants to split itself operationally from a previous team and create another operational team is not the point. The CU framework fully allows that to happen. It\u2019s also fully up to MKR tokenholders to decide on the outcome of the new team\u2019s proposal. However linking up an existing team\u2019s budget to an old team budget is the equivalent of forcing a joint venture on another party, where the other party does not wish to be a signer to the joint venture agreement. It\u2019s unprecedented under the CU framework. And I would say further, not only it is unprecedented, it puts the whole notion of independence and autarchy of CU to test. One final point, once you start going down the slippery slope of linking budgets you also go down the road of operational linkage. In RWAs more specifically, operation means risks and liabilities. Should we expect then that operational liabilities flow across core units that don\u2019t wish to work together? That\u2019s a risky prospect for any team. ",

I think the more appropriate analogy is a split-up, carve-out or forced divestment. Entities will often split up, carve-out, or divest business units/assets to create more stakeholder value. RWF-0x is intended to create more stakeholder value than RWF-001 alone. RWF-0x did not link its budget to the RWF-001 budget. Instead, to be abundantly clear, the RWF-001 budget would be reduced by 3/4ths. There is no sharing or connection \u2026 that is the whole point.     williamr:  It\u2019s unprecedented under the CU framework. And I would say further, not only it is unprecedented, it puts the whole notion of independence and autarchy of CU to test.   Maker is a DAO and DAI is a respected stablecoin \u2026 \u201cunprecedented\u201d is the point. None of the Core Units or Contributors should view their positions as life-long, tenured, granted because of connections, or the like.     williamr:  So, the fact that a team wants to split itself operationally from a previous team and create another operational team is not the point.

Should we expect then that operational liabilities flow across core units that don\u2019t wish to work together? That\u2019s a risky prospect for any team.   What operational liabilities? You have some core units that are legal entities, some that are not, some contributors that are employees and some are independent contractors, and we all engage, despite this free flow of arrangements, as needed to conduct business. Are you suggesting there is a risk sharing arrangement among the CUs? And given your concern about risk, is there an umbrella insurance policy for all the Core Units and Contributors to which each is a beneficiary? And your view of a single, monolithic core unit for one activity . . . how does this jibe with multiple meta-DAOs? Do you have the same concerns \u2026 should there only be one MetaDAO? ",

SF wrote its own independent budget and followed a normal process. As all the other 25 CU did to date. What is so special about RWF-0x that it does not follow processes followed by everyone else? Imagine if I wanted to have some sc engineers in my team. Should the DAO expect me to write a MIP targeting the budget of another engineering team like CES or PE CU? Of course not. I\u2019d have to follow a process, instead of meddling myself into another CU\u2019s business.
