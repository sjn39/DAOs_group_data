One thing I like in particular is the decentralized governance structu https://nox.tips/ re by MKR token holders. As far as I\u2019ve been able to understand, MKR token holders will get to decide on CDP interest rates, asset classes, collateral %, oracles and other stuff. As I\u2019ve recently bought some MKR, I\u2019m wondering if the dapp platform that allows for making these governance decisions is currently still in development or has it been released already and I can already cast my votes there? If it\u2019s still in development, maybe you can tell me what to expect as I\u2019ve never participated in a DAO before. Thanks, you guys are an inspiration to me and I wish you all the best. ",
