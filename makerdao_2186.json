A lot of discussion has occurred on the trade-offs between a short and long delay, so I\u2019ll just do a quick summary below. A shorter delay allows for governance votes to cast faster. However, it also allows a shorter timeframe to defend against governance attacks. The 4 hour delay was helpful during the market collapse when the ETH price was fluctuating wildly. A longer delay helps protect the protocol against governance attacks. There is simply more time allotted to respond to adverse governance actions. During the market collapse, the 24 hour delay presented a risk as the mitigating changes we used to stabilize the protocol could not be applied with urgency. This signal is requested to gauge an appropriate GSM delay based on recent experiences. Should you favor a longer delay than listed, please select other and provide your rationale in the discussion.  Things to consider (not exhaustive!) as we search for the right balance:  Are we stabilized or should we expect more volatile market activity prompting another GSM decrease? If we keep the delay low, what kind of governance attacks are we subject to? If we set the delay high, how will we respond if we enter another volatile period?

The two options that received the highest vote percentages:  24 hours (previous GSM) at 47% 12 hours at 36%  Discussion in the thread was limited, and those that commented appeared to agree that 12 hours was the minimum that should be considered as that is a realistic timeframe to respond to a governance attack. *Discussion in the Rocketchat #governance-and-risk channel revolved around 24 hours being a realistic time period as it provided sufficient time for MKR holders to muster the 50k MKR vote threshold to trigger Emergency Shutdown (ES) in the event of a governance attack. A few contributors suggested GSM delays beyond 24 hours in the forum thread although there appeared to be consensus that moving to a delay of that length should occur in the medium to long-term. *Discussion begins at the linked comment in the #governance-and-risk channel and continues thereafter. On-chain Vote Summary Winning proposal is 12 Hours with 98.15% of the vote (23,613.85 MKR)  12 Hours 23,613.85 MKR (98.15%) 445.54 MKR (1.85%)  The change was reflected in this linked spell. ",
