ImpactDAOs are a building block for how Regenerative Cryptoeconomics grows into a Pluralistic Civilizational Scale Infrastructure for Humanity.  460\u00d7568 1.73 KB  These positive externalities are not just financial externalities. They can be across many vectors They can be any of the 8 forms of capital.  780\u00d7488 107 KB  There are many different examples of successful ImpactDAOs in the world today on a diverse set of vectors:     DAO Positive Externality Scale Type of Capital     Proof Of Humanity Sybil Resistance 14k users Social, Experiential   BrightID Sybil Resistance 55k users Social, Experiential   KlimaDAO Positive Price Pressure on Carbon Credits ? Living, Financial   GitcoinDAO Public Goods Funding $51m Material, Financial   BanklessDAO Education ? Cultural, Intellectual   Kleros Dispute Resolution 1.2k disputes Social, Cultural    Of course, the above list is just a start. If we want to avoid being seen as All Theory and No Action, it would behoove us to articulate the depth & breadth of the ImpactDAO stack is as legitimate of a way as possible. Emperically,  I\u2019ve already experienced this.  In the recent Epicenter Podcast episode I recorded about Regenerative CryptoEconomics, I was asked several times for tangible examples of ImpactDAOs and their impact. When Gitcoin launched in 2017, very few dApps had any adoption. We built $52.3m in Results | Gitcoin to articulate Gitcoin\u2019s impact & stand out from the crowd.  As more & more ImpactDAOs appear, I predict there will be an increasingly important job to be done of DAO cartography. Cartography is of course \u201cthe science or practice of drawing maps.\u201d, and we seek to create a map of different ImpactDAOS. By cataloging these ImpactDAOs + articulating their impact to the world, we enable the world to see the power of Regenerative CryptoEconomics, and we can route talent to the places where they can do the most good for the world. This post is a call for proposals from DAO Cartographers across the space to add value. If you have an idea for how we can document ImpactDAOS in a way that:  Has high legitimacy (highly accepted per the criteria laid forth here). Has depth (accurate & relevant stats about each ImpactDAO). Has breadth (has opined about most ImpactDAOs in the ecosystem) Reflects the pluralism of this stack by articulating an ethos that celebrates the pluralism of mechanisms in ImpactDAOs.  \u2026 I would like to talk to you. Please (1) join this telegram (2) post a proposal below in 500 words or less that articulates how you would attack this problem and what would have to be true for it to happen (hint: please ask for funding, I want to fund good proposals!). I have budget to fund as many promising proposals as I receive, and will decide how to spend that budget on a case by case basis. ",

A couple months ago I created an initial map of organizations doing work in this space. This was based on information from the ReFiDAO list. As this map was released there was a Kumu that was created around the same time from someone else. As Kumu is more visually appealing then mindmeister, the first step would be to translate the material compiled from the MindMeister to the Kumu map. From there we will start expanding how ReFi connects with other ImpactDAOs (such as Decentralized Science and Gitcoin supported projects). At the same time we will start tying in real life action to these maps through collaborative mapping techniques (such as from creating a My Maps by Google Maps).  The idea for this mapping is to make all materials created dynamic and editable by the community. When an edit is made the DAO can vote on if the edit is acceptable or not.
