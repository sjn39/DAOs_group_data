                    "content": "Project Name: Byte Masons Product Suite (Granary.finance, Lrn.fi, Reaper.farm, and Reliquary) Author Name: @Crypto_A_S - Byte Masons Business Development Number of OP tokens requested: 490,000 to be matched 1:1 (dollar for dollar) with $OATH emissions L2 Recipient Address: 0x4Cf7D024c8EAbDE0DFC5aCb4e627Fe5d4393c859 Intentions: We plan on using $OP incentives over the next 9 months to match dollar for dollar with $OATH (additional $GRAIN emissions to boost yields once it goes live) & drive sustained adoption of Optimism using strong horizontal integrations, which we will describe further below. Product Summary and Relevant Usage Metrics: Our team specializes in security, accessibility, and design for consumer-facing financial applications, with 35 team members including 20 experienced web3 engineers. We offer four products that will rapidly kickstart a DeFi ecosystem: Granary.finance is a user-focused money market that supports multi-token reward emissions. Our data-driven approach to risk and incentive distribution enables Granary to deliver better LTV ratios and yield to users. Granary is currently the only lending protocol to have a market for $OP \u2013 meaning you can lend, borrow, and use $OP as collateral. Our upcoming $GRAIN token launch will drive significant usership to the network and facilitate the adoption of Optimism. Usage Metrics:  Live on Optimism, Fantom, Avalanche, ETH, and Harmony With no token, we\u2019ve been able to attract 1300 users and over $10,000,000 TVL  Reaper.farm is a security framework designed to automate DeFi investment strategies. We currently boast industry-leading technology in the form of custom multi-strategy vaults and advanced optimization bots which analyze the health, yield, and security of our systems. Reaper is live on Fantom and Optimism, currently supports BeethovenX and multistrategy crypts, with more to follow (Velodrome and Tarot). Our team is also hard at work developing convex-style functionality to $VELO. Usage Metrics:  Total Unique Users: 66,728 Current TVL: $16,697,813  Reliquary is a novel fNFT-powered incentive management system designed to mitigate the effects of mercenary liquidity and deliver maximum capital efficiency to users, developers, and ecosystems. This is accomplished by distributing rewards across several maturity tranches, which prevents the dilution of long-time depositors. With our unique NFT assets, users are also able to leverage their farming positions and trade them on any market to capture their maturity premium. Reliquary will also set a new standard for UI/UX in DeFi and deliver industry-leading yields in a single click with its simple, gamified front-end. We are excited to bring its strong network-boosting effects to Optimism.  Reliquary is currently undergoing its 3rd audit with Certik and has been extensively tested by Byte Masons\u2019 own senior security engineers. It is currently being production tested and we expect to launch on Optimism in the near future.  Lrn.Fi: A next-generation educational platform. Lrn leverages the collective knowledge of DeFi communities by tapping directly into a diverse range of DeFi scholars from all walks of life, in order to create the most comprehensive, unique body of knowledge in all of crypto. Whether you\u2019re a DeFi novice or an experienced degen, you\u2019ll always be able to learn something new on Lrn.fi. \u00b7 Total Unique Users: 8,500 \u00b7 Total Articles Produced to date: 61 \u00b7 Total Contributors: 20+ Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): The ethos of Optimism, to provide a technological backbone that enables sustainable & scalable public goods, aligns strongly with our mission to improve access to cutting-edge financial tools for the people. We seek to set standards for safety, security, transparency, and ethics in the DeFi industry and believe Optimism is the best place to engage with this work. We believe that the technological innovations of the Optimism Foundation will be an important catalyst in driving the widespread adoption of open financial software due to the high scalability and low transaction costs. DeFi benefits enormously from this technology and drives serious value to networks. Our DeFi suite will supplement the existing ecosystem and position Optimism to quickly and ethically capture this value. For these reasons, we see Optimism as the optimal place to build our highly-secure, highly-accessible, and high-yielding DeFi software. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? 95% (465,000) of the $OP tokens will be distributed to users via Granary Finance and the Reliquary, with a majority through Reliquary alongside $OATH and $GRAIN (launch TBD). 5% (25,000) of the allocated $OP will be used to compensate $OP educators who contribute writing and/or other content to the lrn.fi platform. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Our focus will be on delivering yields high enough that they offset the effort, liability, and technical risks associated with bridging assets to Optimism.  Granary will create opportunities for $OP holders to borrow stablecoins at phenomenal rates and deliver excellent single-sided yield through Reaper. We plan on using $OP tokens to attract stablecoin liquidity to the network and incentivize single-sided staking of $OP tokens. Reliquary will be our primary means of incentive distribution, driving liquidity through both Reaper and Granary to deliver $3 of TVL per dollar deposited. This will enable us to efficiently bootstrap Optimism\u2019s DeFi ecosystem and give liquidity providers excellent sources of single-sided yield.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Our incentivization research is focused totally on sustainability, with long timescales and a focus on generating real revenue and growth. Our products are designed to deliver industry-leading yields in their own right, so with just a small amount of token emissions, we can make Optimism a highly desirable place for yield seekers. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The distribution of incentives is to take place over the next 9 months and will be regulated based on TVL flow and competing interest rates. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Byte Masons pledge to match the dollar value of $OP incentives 1:1 with $OATH and eventually $GRAIN at the time of emission. Any tokens moved into an incentives controller will be accounted for as a debt to the Optimism community, to be matched within 6 months by native token emissions. In the next 2-5 years, we will likely emit native tokens that far exceed the 1:1 matching depending on Optimism\u2019s adoption. ",

Our goal is to drive liquidity where it\u2019s needed without over-emitting tokens. We have a lengthy research paper coming out in the next month or so on the subject, but in the meantime you can check out this Learn column and the spreadsheet at the bottom to get a good idea of how we think about incentive distribution: Incentives Article Lrn.Fi If you\u2019re interested in our technical emission strategy, read further. Don\u2019t mean to be pedantic, just thorough  Emissions through Granary are designed to ensure the market stays efficient, and will be distributed on the borrow side for key assets such as OP and USDC/DAI. Interest rates rise for borrowers as they utilize a greater % of the assets supplied to the market, so we will emit tokens in an attempt to drive utilization toward an optimal rate of ~70%, which will ensure lenders are able to receive real APR in the range of 6-12%. This means lenders are getting competitive interest rates without the need for emissions and borrowers have a much better experience. Because we\u2019re earning real revenue, the cost of emissions is subsidized and we can do it for longer. Emissions through Reliquary are designed to incentivize Reaper crypts, which are automated investment strategies. Its purpose is to give long term liquidity providers the best deal possible compared to their mercenary counterparts and be the \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d for yield seekers, with a ton of unique features and zappers. The nice thing about Reaper is that it behaves optimally in all conditions, so it allows our markets to be much more predictable, which is extremely valuable when trying to model incentive strategies (hence why we prefer to emit through Reliquary). Reliquary, Reaper, and Granary yield will all layer together, so incentives on one of them is, to a certain extent, incentives for all 3. I hope this was useful and thank you for the question. ",

I\u2019ve been working with the Byte Masons on this and gave them a few rounds of feedback before they ultimately landed at what I think is a solid proposal (and I fully support it). Balancer & BeethovenX plan to work closely with the Byte Masons to roll out Granary & Reaper boosted pools (liquidity pools where most of the tokens are deposited elsewhere to earn a yield, in addition to swap fees). Aave can be a bit slow to add new tokens - meanwhile Granary already supports OP and they can move quickly to add other tokens like MAI that we can then leverage on the LP side. Reaper also recently rolled out multi-strategy single asset crypts which can be used in a similar way. The expertise the Byte Masons bring to the table cannot be overstated. The brain power Optimism stands to gain here is massive and when you combine that with Balancer\u2019s technology it\u2019s going to unlock a ton of cool integrations. ",

Here is a quick rundown of the status of the Product Suite:   The Reliquary is in production testing on Optimism. Everything looks good and our Security team is comparing performance against expectations + reviewing our new deployment process. I\u2019m really excited to show everyone it\u2019s gamified front end once it\u2019s approved to release to the public. It\u2019s really cool, shouldn\u2019t be much longer before it\u2019s ready to go.   Right now Reaper.Farm is live on Optimism, if you hover over our TVL metric in the top left hand corner it shows ~$400k Optimism TVL. We just released a batch of 15 Velodrome crypts yesterday, still working on incorporating all their yield offerings and gaining market share. Also excited to see the power of the multistrategies continue to grow as we incorporate more Optimism projects. There\u2019s a lot to be said about having no deposit or withdrawal fees on those.   Granary.Finance is also live on Optimism with about $800k TVL, the majority being the $OP token. We take pride in being the first place you can lend / borrow the $OP token. We\u2019ve been networking with other teams in the Optimism ecosystem, should hopefully have some more integrations soon.   Lrn.fi has all kinds of in-depth Optimism content on the docket to get released about the $OP ecosystem. Looking forward to spreading the word about Optimism and helping onboarding new users.   The Byte Mason team decided to reduce the token emission timeline due to feedback we received stating that emitting over 18 months was too long and that other delegates would rather see us reduce our $OP ask + emit over a shorter timeframe + potentially come back with a second proposal once we can show product adoption by Optimism users. I hope that answers your questions. The team is very excited to continue to build and grow on Optimism! Looking forward to seeing where we will be in the next 9 months ",

I have a few builder friends whom I trust a lot and who used to be in the Fantom ecosystem and what they told me aligns very much with the comment by @FantomFunhouse above which is for some reason hidden? Why hide a contrarian view? Link here: [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Byte Mason Product Suite - #33 by FantomFunhouse Posting a screenshot also to make it easier to see what I reference:  2022-07-26_17-10837\u00d7576 70.6 KB  My friends basically told me that the way your team behaved in fantom was that of a value extractor who tried to exploit everything for financial gain. could not be trusted and in the end contributed to the fall of that ecosystem. I don\u2019t want the same to happen to Optimism and I don\u2019t condone this kind of behaviour so I will be voting against. ",

Andre was a rugger who exit scammed billion dollars worth of funds on every holder who held FTM/Kp3r/Yearn, Man was basically a serial rugger and escaped to live in Dubai to avoid any laws. He still holds almost 400m FTM and will probably wait for some narrative to be spun up to dump on all of his holders. It\u2019s crazy he\u2019s upset at the byte masons after dumping every Ecosystem token in opera Here\u2019s his wallet address : 0x431e81e5dfb5a24541b5ff8762bdef3f32f96354 U can see that he farm dumped Solid by himself, and also dumped every single eco system token and basically killed the eco system Man was working with Daniele who was the rugger behind Time And ICE which were directly affiliated with The Italian Mob. Personally I think Solidly was one of the worst \"Experiments (which is what Andre called any project he half assed that made people lose money) To ever touch Defi He is also responsible for Cream which was exploited for almost 500m, Pickle finance and Geist finance which exit scammed on all of their users. Personally I am happy Andre is gone from DeFI, maybe now people will be losing less funds to his terrible work ethics. Edit: Here\u2019s also another fact people didnt know about Andre during the whole Solidly thing, He used his Curve/Anyswap and various other tokens that were allocated to him as a developer to Farm Solid, he pretended that he didnt get an allocation and the protocol had no \u201cDev allocation\u201d But he used all of his free tokens to farm Dump it using Retail as exit liquidity.

                    "content": "Hey guys, Thank you for your feedback. We\u2019re aware of the original comment from FantomFunhouse, but chose not to respond as it seems that it was posted by an account created for the sole purpose of leaving a disparaging comment about us. We did not make the decision to hide the comment \u2013 this is not within the powers of a thread author on here. I urge you to hear our side of the story as well, and give us the chance to tell you about who we are and what we do and whom all we do it for \u2013 and our vision for the future of DeFi. We addressed this situation back when it happened: https://twitter.com/ByteMasons/status/1498071841986031629 Some further context on the Solidly situation: Point 1: Prior to its launch, our team reviewed the Solidly codebase, where we found multiple critical issues/bugs. We sought to notify Andre about our findings, however our feedback was not well-received. Andre eventually resolved to disable issues on the Solidly GitHub after several other Fantom teams notified him of the same issues in the codebase. These unaddressed bugs resulted in major losses of user funds & ended up being the downfall of the Solidly protocol. Some excerpts from page 1:  1293\u00d780 9.39 KB  1314\u00d7279 32.4 KB  1306\u00d7143 13.1 KB  1179\u00d7113 13.9 KB  Point 2: Regarding PIT/AT: while we were in the middle of the $OATH token launch, Solidly was launched with no forewarning. Since the Byte Masons were the only veNFT recipient without a token to farm emissions with, we spun up a liquidity pool with two placeholder tokens (PIT/AT), with the intention of using the $SOLID emissions to reward our token holders & community. Unfortunately, this has led to several baseless rumors being spread about the Byte Masons and our intentions behind our usage of Solidly \u2013 primarily that we were farming the $SOLID solely for our own treasury. We received 476506 Solid tokens on March 4th (price: $2.68) that we could have claimed at the peak. We gave out 26000 tokens 5 days later as a bribe for Beethoven voting for Oath. After we became aware of Andre\u2019s feelings towards us, we immediately ceased all farming of $SOLID & didn\u2019t touch any tokens until roughly 3 weeks later on March 23rd, when we sold 212959 SOLID at a price of roughly ~$1.10. After this sale, we decided not to touch anything related to Solidly again, leaving us with 237000 Solidly tokens as well as our veNFT (which most other recipients sold). ALL of our Solid transactions can be seen here:    Fantom (FTM) Blockchain Explorer    Solidly (SOLID) Token Tracker | FtmScan Solidly (SOLID) Token Tracker on FtmScan shows the price of the Token $0.0000, total supply 100,000,000, number of holders 10,282 and updated information of the token. The token tracker page also shows the analytics and historical data.      Every protocol was incentivizing their own token, and as the only veNFT holder without a token on the market, we had to do something to benefit our soon-to-be holders. We could have waited and forgone all Solid emissions during the critical first week, we could have voted for another protocol\u2019s token, but we decided to farm the weeks worth of emissions and then figure out an optimal way to distribute them to Oath holders in the future. If the voting period was not one week we would have switched to incentivizing Oath liquidity even sooner than we did, but we were forced to make a difficult decision that no other veNFT holder had to make. Point 3: With regard to Andre \u2013 as soon as we found out about his frustration, we reached out to try to resolve the situation. Andre was not interested in working with us, nor did he respond to our many attempts to reach out. We even offered to return our veNFT (valued at 7 figures at the time) to him, but our efforts were clearly in vain, as his attacks on us have persisted to this day. Point 4: We find the characterization of us being \u201cvalue extractors\u201d to be flagrantly untrue. As far as the Solidly situation goes, we ended up voluntarily leaving millions of dollars worth of assets (hundreds of thousands of $SOLID and a veNFT) on the table as a sign of goodwill \u2013 even though we were simply utilizing the protocol as designed with the intention of creating value for both Solidly users and Oath holders. Beyond that (and back to the actual content of our proposal), our protocols are designed specifically to provide users as much benefit as possible. A simple fee structure comparison should be enough to prove this. Furthermore, we\u2019ve spent an outsized amount of time performing free work in order to ensure the security & proper functionality of numerous protocols on the Fantom network and beyond. We\u2019ve also established a community-focused educational platform in order to freely increase access to knowledge. We\u2019ve tirelessly dedicated ourselves to the Fantom community, and it hurts to be so baselessly accused of being the reason for its supposed downfall. We will continue our efforts to set safety, security, and service standards in the DeFi industry and seek excellence in everything we do for the betterment of our community and ecosystem. I\u2019m happy to answer any further questions or concerns you might have. We have an open door policy in our Discord, and are looking to set a new DeFi transparency standard. ",

                    "content": "Andre Cronje built a protocol called Solidly that was intended to be a ultra-low fee liquidity platform for Fantom protocols to use. He launched it by distributing 100% of Solidly ownership to the top 25 protocols (measured by total value locked) on Fantom. He gave the protocol away as a public good for Fantom. Reaper Farm (Bebis) received approximately 4% of the protocol\u2019s ownership. This allowed them to direct 4% of the protocol\u2019s weekly emissions to a liquidity pool(s) of their choosing. They can vote for whatever they want. You can think of Solidly as similar to Curve. Every protocol chose to direct emissions toward productive pools for the ecosystem like FTM/WETH, WFTM/USDC, BOO/WFTM, etc. Reaper Farm chose to mint two worthless tokens into their treasury (named Pain in The and Ass Tax) and create a pool on Solidly with these tokens.On Solidly, emissions go to the liquidity providers. Reaper Farm then voted with their 4% ownership to direct 4% of Solidly\u2019s weekly emissions into a liquidity pool that only they could enter. This liquidity pool had no purpose other than funneling protocol emissions directly into their treasury. They effectively used a gift meant to kickstart a public good to funnel as much money into their treasury as possible before forcing other protocols to use their own Solidly ownership to downvote their malicious pool ",

Personal beef happens in crypto, and it looks like the action they took pissed off others in the Solidly camp. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing play out now, as those parties are trying to spoil Byte Mason\u2019s success moving forward. I\u2019ve had some interactions with the Byte Mason team through our work at Layer2DAO. In accordance with our mission to grow the L2 ecosystem and incentivize more developers to move to L2s, we are partnering with them to help them roll out their product suite on Optimism and help grow the TVL on Optimism. My interactions with the Byte Mason team have been top notch, and they seem extremely capable. I do believe the Optimism ecosystem will be better off for welcoming and supporting the growth the Byte Mason product suite. It\u2019s clear that personal agendas are playing out here in the Optimism governance forum, so I would encourage everyone without first hand knowledge of what happened on Fantom to abstain from the vote if it\u2019s solely based on the accusations wielded here against Byte Mason\u2019s actions with Solidly (cc// @linda and @MinimalGravitas).

Particularly with the narrative shifting from Alt-L1 to ETH L2s, I believe there\u2019s an opportunity to pull users to Optimism (especially from Fantom). In my opinion this is a great use of OP token incentives: Byte Mason has an existing audience on Fantom (and other chains) that is likely more than willing to come try Optimism if we provide their team with the OP incentives to lure those users over.

Accusations were also made in the thread suggesting that you were acting in bad faith ([READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Saddle Finance - #41 by jackanorak) so I would hope that you see the necessity for some objective reasoning as to why you think @FantomFunhouse is a bad faith account? \u2014 EDIT \u2014     lefterisjp:  I don\u2019t understand why you would call an account that is making a particular claim fake.   Snap  In the original post of this thread they made the claim that the discussion is \u201cheavily astroturfed\u201d, which is clearly accurate. In the first 25 comments, more than half are by users who\u2019ve never posted before (kiwikish, mate_phi, Miso, veJoe, Andros, Ikpeamarom, 0xFreshPots, CryptoDandy, b1rdmania, naly, jonsteps, GuiLamas, IlijasDev). As for the key issue at play here, I think @exosphere makes a very good point about those of us who lack first hand knowledge. I unfortunately have zero experience with the Fantom ecosystem and so it is very difficult to assess the veracity of both sides claims. My friend is not a developer and so although he has an opinion, from the lack of specifics that he can remember (or at least that he\u2019s shared) I\u2019m trying hard not to take it as equivalent to insider knowledge of the situation. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure that abstaining is the correct course of action. If the option is to give out tokens or not then personally I think voting to not give them as the default until the matter in question is resolved. Of the claims here to be addressed, perhaps this one is specific enough that it can be established true or false:     FantomFunhouse:  Reaper Farm (Bebis) received approximately 4% of the protocol\u2019s ownership. This allowed them to direct 4% of the protocol\u2019s weekly emissions to a liquidity pool(s) of their choosing. They can vote for whatever they want. You can think of Solidly as similar to Curve. \u2026 Reaper Farm then voted with their 4% ownership to direct 4% of Solidly\u2019s weekly emissions into a liquidity pool that only they could enter. This liquidity pool had no purpose other than funneling protocol emissions directly into their treasury.   Can anyone prove whether this specific point is accurate or not? ",

We gave out 26000 tokens 5 days later as a bribe for Beethoven voting for Oath. After we became aware of Andre\u2019s feelings towards us, we immediately ceased all farming of $SOLID & didn\u2019t touch any tokens until roughly 3 weeks later on March 23rd, when we sold 212959 SOLID at a price of roughly ~$1.10.

ALL of our Solid transactions can be seen here: Solidly (SOLID) Token Tracker | FtmScan   While we could continue to debate the past, the Byte Masons as a team would like to move the conversations happening in this thread back to the original purpose of this proposal, the products and use cases we bring to Optimism. We believe that we offer a strong product portfolio to the Optimism ecosystem and want to focus on providing secure, low-fee yield opportunities to OP users. The team listened to both public / private feedback and reduced our original $OP ask + emission timeline to bring our proposal in line with other successful proposals from past voting cycles. We hope this, along with our offer to match incentives $ for $ and our OP educational content from our Lrn.Fi platform demonstrates our strong commitment to building and working to further the Optimism ecosystem.

                    "content": "I work as a developer at Byte Masons. This is my first post here\u2013well, technically second since my first one from yesterday has been hidden for some reason\u2013but you can verify me through:  Github (username \u201ctess3rac7\u201d) The Byte Masons discord (search posts from \u201ctess3rac7\u201d) Twitter (username \u201ctess3rac7\u201d)  I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to post here, but looking at the lazy and abysmal \u201cgovernance\u201d that\u2019s going on here I can\u2019t help but say something. Here are some factual statements to put an end to the hearsay and fud. Yes, the Byte Masons created a dummy pool token to absorb SOLID emissions. Why?  Because every other protocol was using their SOLID emissions to incentivize their own token Because the Byte Masons\u2019 token (OATH) wasn\u2019t live yet Because, as it turns out, it\u2019s possible to claim tokens that are time-sensitive and leave them in the multisig for a few weeks, and use them later to incentivize your token holders. Just like it\u2019s possible to buy and store winter tires for a car that you will take delivery of next week. Because incentivizing our token with those emissions is exactly what we did afterwards. And the remainder of those tokens were liquidated only after the Solidly team quit.  Was it public knowledge that this could be done? Yes. Were we the only ones who did it? No. Did anyone care that we did it? No. Well, except for one man: Andre Cronje himself. Here are screenshots of DMs Andre sent to us the day of:  Screenshot from 2022-07-27 12-21-591167\u00d7753 212 KB  What you see above is someone who cannot take a joke; who is so hurt that a pair of tokens was given a particular name that he:  Takes it as a personal attack Threatens to vote us out (he tried to create a grand drama on Twitter that fell flat) Threatens to remove us from all future incentives (what you are seeing happen in this proposal; open your eyes please)  This happened 6 months ago, in February. It was a simple joke gone wrong. Sometimes you think your heroes have a certain temperament that will connect with your temperament. Sometimes you\u2019re wrong\u2013completely wrong. Both Justin and Crypto A S apologized profusely to Andre at that time but it all fell on deaf ears. When it became clear that we couldn\u2019t console the man, we decided to move on and keep building. And in the last 6 months, we\u2019ve built and survived the bear market and grown and leveled up our tech and taken on new projects and so much more. We have become stronger partners with other top teams on Fantom, and as those teams have gone cross-chain, we have supported them and built on top of them. Andre Cronje has since \u201cleft crypto for good.\u201d lefterisjp\u2019s only source is their mysterious friend who wishes to \u201cremain anonymous as they have left crypto for good.\u201d FantomFunhouse, also anonymous, who seems to resonate so much with how Andre feels about us, is calling Justin and the rest of our team \u201cclowns.\u201d Come on guys, let\u2019s not pretend to be stupid. Are we discussing a serious governance proposal here based on merits and pros and cons? Or is this some joke gossip-circle where we are going to entertain name calling and obey one resentful man (with different pseudonyms) who wishes to remain anonymous and is essentially trying to psyop all of you into kicking a talented team of 20+ dedicated engineers to the curb? I\u2019m just one of the developers at Byte Masons. In the last three days, I have: implemented depth first search on balancer pools so we can build zappers for beethoven; launched 15+ velodrome autocompounding vaults on reaper.farm; made significant improvements to our serverless infrastructure\u2013all whilst collaborating with two dozen other talented and dedicated engineers each of whom are tackling equally complex challenges every day to take DeFi to new heights. As delegates and individuals with voting power, here is what I implore you all to do to verify our credibility:  Browse, and ask us about, our currently deployed projects Go to defillama and look at the top projects on Fantom (Spookyswap, BeethovenX, Tarot etc.). Then go to their discords and search \u201creaper\u201d and you will see all their users who respect us and love our products. We will put you in touch with their leads and founders as well so you can hear directly from them. Tell us what we can do to successfully bring our full suite of DeFi products\u2013a yield optimizer + a lending market + a liquidity provision solution + an education portal\u2013to Optimism together with our existing Fantom usership.  Please, treat us with some level of respect. Value our collective more than one seemingly powerful individual who couldn\u2019t take a joke, and is simply trying to manifest his promised revenge in the most \u201cbelow-the-belt\u201d way imaginable. We have done absolutely nothing to deserve this dogpiling treatment from our peers in this industry. ",

Please see the full context here:     Crypto_A_S:  Point 2: Regarding PIT/AT: while we were in the middle of the $OATH token launch, Solidly was launched with no forewarning. Since the Byte Masons were the only veNFT recipient without a token to farm emissions with, we spun up a liquidity pool with two placeholder tokens (PIT/AT), with the intention of using the $SOLID emissions to reward our token holders & community.

Solidly deployed by Andre Cronje in a decentralized, trustless, immutable contract/protocol. The NFT\u2019s were given not based on merit but based on TVL. The Byte Masons used the NFT they were given within the bounds of how the protocol was meant to work. Andre chose to release the protocol as in an \u201cexperimental\u201d state against concerns from other Fantom developers. The dilution protection for veNFT holders did not function as intended among other features which doomed the Solidly to failure. Any actions from the Byte Masons had zero to do with why it failed to say otherwise exposes a lack of understanding of the protocol and what actually happened. Andre\u2019s trust, abused or not, and what other feeling you or he may have should have nothing to do with Decentralized Finance. Nothing was stolen it\u2019s all on chain if anyone cares to think for themselves. The idea that the Byte Masons are responsible for Andre \u201crage-quitting\u201d is preposterous and also irrelevant. Andre is a grown man and a billionaire. He is responsible for his own actions which include causing harm to the multiple protocols in the manor he announced he was leaving de-fi. FantomFunhouse clearly has an agenda to derail this proposal driven by a personal vendetta which is embarrassingly misdirected. And it is very concerning for OP governance on the whole if one person can spam accusations while the merits of the proposal are lost in the posturing. ",
