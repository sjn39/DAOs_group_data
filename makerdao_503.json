Maker Relay Updates As you may have noticed, the Maker Relay has now become the Weekly Relay, which contains some changes and improvements:  New title no longer contains an issue number. All Weekly Relays will now be determined by the dates covered for that week. Team Updates are no longer part of the Weekly Relay. There is now an individual monthly review of all Core Unit updates posted on the forum. State of Dai is no longer part of the Weekly Relay. It has been separated into its own issue, giving it potential growth and new ideas. Issue title images have been updated to support these changes!    Have Feedback? We value your input! Take our survey to let us know what we might be missing or how to do better. Disclaimer: This update is assembled by a group of contributing members in the MakerDAO community. This does not serve as financial advice or an inducement to vote in any specific way. This update is purely for information and communication purposes only. ",
