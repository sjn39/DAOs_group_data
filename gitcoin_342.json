We propose 5 days for discussion and review followed by a 5-day snapshot vote to ratify, before processing final payouts. Background First, we\u2019d like to thank the community and the grantees for all of the patience everyone has shown as we fine-tune our \u201ccanon\u201d QF implementation for the Allo protocol, passport scoring, and end-of-round analysis. We understand the results (and subsequent payouts) for this round have taken longer than usual and we look forward to accelerating this process in future rounds. Additionally, thanks to @AlexK @nategosselin @umarkhaneth @koday @kyle @M0nkeyFl0wer @zen @baoki and many other amazing contributors in the Gitcoin DAO for all the work that went into making this round successful and getting us to these final results. The first Gitcoin Program Alpha QF rounds on Allo Protocol ran from January 17th to January 31st and included a subset of established grantees from past rounds. $1 million in matching was available between 3 distinct rounds (and correspondingly 3 smart contracts), with 333,333 DAI pools for the following categories:  Web3 Open Source Software [Explorer | Contract] Ethereum Infrastructure [Explorer | Contract] Climate Solutions [Explorer | Contract]  You can learn more about how these rounds were planned and structured here:    [Discussion & Feedback Request] Grants Protocol Alpha Round Eligibility \ud83c\udf31 Grants       Firstly, I want to say a big thank you to @j9leger and @M0nkeyFl0wer for co-authoring the below, @koday @umarkhaneth for helping with all the analysis, and @nategosselin for helping with all the analysis, and @nategosselin & the GPC team for helping bring these alpha rounds to life.  TL;DR   Governance has approved the decision to sunset cGrants and transition to the Grants Protocol GR16 will not happen in December and instead we\u2019ll run an Alpha Round on the protocol in January with the goal of \u2026         Gitcoin Program Alpha Round Grantee Invite Lists & Eligibility Criteria \ud83c\udf31 Grants       ***Note: If you think your grant might be eligible for one of these rounds, reference the Open Source Software & ETH Infra invited grant list or the climate grant list and look for your grant. Please check the inbox of your email associated with the grant for your invite with links and info on how to apply. Please verify you meet all eligibility criteria for your round or your application may not be accepted. If you no longer have access to that email, please reach out to me @kierano on Telegram\u2026        go.gitcoin.co    Announcing: The Gitcoin Program Alpha Round In 2023 we're transitioning to a blockchain-based grants protocol that allows anyone to launch a Quadratic Funding grants program.      Results & Ratification The full list of final results & payout amounts can be found here. Below we\u2019ll cover how these results were calculated and what decisions were made (given this is the first round integrating Gitcoin Passport and the first large-scale round on Allo, it was a new process and one we\u2019d like to get community feedback and iterate on). We ask our Community Stewards to ratify the Alpha Round payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding by community norms, including the implementation of Passport scoring as well as judgments and sanctions made by the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream. If stewards and the community approve after this discussion, we would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to run from Monday, March 20th to Friday, March 25th, in advance of payouts being processed the last week of March. Options to vote on: 1. Ratify the round results You ratify the results as reported by the Public Goods Funding & Fraud Detection & Defense workstreams and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the Alpha Round final payout amounts. 2. Request further deliberation You do not ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice. Round and Results Calculation Details To summarize:  The Gitcoin Program Alpha Round was conducted on the new protocol from January 17-31, 2023 It consisted of 3 curated rounds with their own matching pool: Web3 Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate Solutions There were 159 returning grants split between the rounds invited based on funding criteria from GR14 and GR15 A total of $667k was donated from 30,893 unique wallets   1366\u00d7772 193 KB  Matching Calculation Approach The final results shared here stray from the \u201cpure QF\u201d calculations after treatment for supporter eligibility. Our eligibility controls were:  Sufficient passport score Non-arbitrary donation minimum Removal of sybil-attackers Support amounts totaling to matching cap limit in place per round  Passport scores: Gitcoin Passport ran into some issues that we\u2019re glad to have ironed out - some donors were unable to verify their unique identity for most of the round due to infrastructure instability, and some passport stamps were reset at times. As a result, donors were given 2 extra weeks after the round concluded to reverify their passports and stamps. Given the 2-week grace period, we are happy with the final outcome of verified passports:  1558\u00d7306 29 KB  Only ~10% of attempted passports failed, and ~10% of donors did not have any passport at all. Only donors with a passport and sufficient score were counted for matching calculations. You can find more about Passport\u2019s round issues, lessons learned, and future mitigation plans in Erich\u2019s post. Donation minimum: In past cGrants rounds the donation minimum was $1. For the Alpha Rounds, we instead went with a cutoff of a certain bottom percentile of donations, which all ended up at about $.50, but varied between 30% and 60% of total donations depending on the round:  1372\u00d7762 202 KB  These lower boundary limits were selected based on examining statistical anomalies across projects in aggregate for each round, along with time-series analysis to identify botted behavior. Whether a cohort of airdrop farmers was found to act as a group of isolated, unique individuals, or as a sybil-network, this limit neutralized the impact of such speculation on the disbursement of matching funds and we found that Passport did a good job of limiting the prevalence of unsophisticated sybil network in our alpha rounds. Advanced sybil attackers: As with most QF Rounds, we saw some more sophisticated Sybil Attack patterns which were not stopped by Passport (yet!), as well as donations from addresses which were known to be attackers of prior rounds. After on-chain data analysis and a manual sampling process, donations from addresses that were associated with these types of behaviors were excluded for the purposes of matching calculations. Moving forward, more of this analysis process will be automated and executed in near real-time with the help of on-chain data called within Passport. Matching caps: Matching caps were introduced many rounds ago on cGrants, where there is a maximum percent of the total matching pool any one grant can capture. Once they hit this cap, they will not earn more, and any excess is redistributed to all other grants. Alpha Round caps were:  5% for OSS 10% for Climate 10% for Eth Infra  These amounts were selected based on the number of grants invited/expected to be in each round. Please note: in an effort to create a transparent minimum viable product of QF formula, simple quadratic voting has been deployed here. In the future, we will offer pairwise matching as an option for possible customizations that will be set and published on-chain at the time of grant program creation. Prior Estimated Results & Takeaways Multiple DAO contributors have already shared detailed analyses, statistics, and takeaways from the Alpha Rounds. You can find those governance posts here:     Gitcoin Program Alpha Rounds Data Findings \ud83c\udf31 Grants   Gitcoin Alpha Rounds Analysis The latest alpha program rounds are the first Gitcoin program rounds on the new protocol. They are the closest thing we had to a full GR in S16. All of the grants in these three rounds participated in GR15. The rounds are Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate Solutions.  Special thanks to @koday for his detailed thoughts on this post. Be sure to check out his post-op write up on the alpha rounds.   Round Results (preliminary): This data is stil\u2026         Gitcoin Program Alpha Round Post-Op Writeup \ud83c\udf31 Grants       TL;DR   The Gitcoin Program Alpha Round was conducted on the new protocol from January 17-31, 2023. It consisted of 3 curated rounds with their own matching pool: Web3 Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate Solutions. There were 159 returning grants split between the rounds; invited based on funding criteria from GR14 and GR15. A total of $667k was donated from more than 29k unique wallets, and more detailed results can be seen in this Dune Dashboard. Operating this round all\u2026         Lessons Learned: A Look at Gitcoin Allo Alpha Rounds and the Path Forward with Gitcoin Passport \ud83c\udf31 Grants       The purpose of this post-mortem is to document the experience with Gitcoin Passport during Gitcoin Allo Alpha Rounds. The goal is to understand what went well, wrong, and what can be improved to prevent similar issues from happening in the future.   Summary of the Experience During the Gitcoin Allo Alpha Rounds, donors were unable to verify their unique identity for most of the program due to infrastructure instability with Gitcoin Passport. This resulted in a significant number of donors being \u2026     Again, we thank everyone for your patience and participation in the Alpha Rounds. We\u2019re excited for the Beta Program launch the last week of April (details coming soon) as we reignite the Gitcoin Program on the Allo protocol and support many other organizations to host their own programs and rounds.

But I do have some very serious comments to take into account for future iterations.   We need smaller caps, as we had introduced into the old grants. We see the currently most popular pojects hoarding biggest % of the votes. Exactly the reason the caps were introduced before. Imo the point of these rounds is to make as much impact as help as much as possible across a wide array of projects. Not the most popular one.   We should limit projects per entity, especially if they are applying across multiple categories. I like the lammas and use their stuff, but I don\u2019t find it okay to see them apply in both OSS and infra categories with separate projects, ran by the same team. Especially with chainlist being just a list of rpcs, forked by another project. It feels like a way to participate in both rounds, and utilize their fans to max out matching funds in both rounds. I believe this should be discouraged, otherwise other projects will follow suit in order to game the system if some rules are not set.   ",

Considering many other alpha stage products perform way below the output we have here, I am in favor of \u2019 Ratify the round results\u2019     connor:  Only ~10% of attempted passports failed, and ~10% of donors did not have any passport at all.   Are there any conversation on having a fail-safe backup for passport incase the service doesn\u2019t work? If i understand the text below accurately, 20% donors were never factored into the calculation which seems like a high number?     connor:  Advanced sybil attackers:   Do we know what % of address/donors fall in this category? Is it possible that advanced sybils maybe able to learn and route around automations, which means that we\u2019d need to perpetually fund creation of new filters?     connor:  pairwise matching as an option for possible customizations that will be set and published on-chain at the time of grant program creation.   +1 ",
