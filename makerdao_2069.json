Prevent the requirement for a token vote in the event we run into this same issue in the future.   Amended MIPs and Components  MIP62c2 (Modified) MIP62c3 (Modified) MIP62c5 (Added)   Patch Notes  Replaced references to GovComms with references to a \u2018Communication Coordinator\u2019 defined in new component MIP62c5. MIP62c5 defines GovAlpha as the new Communication Coordinator. MIP62c5 allows MIP Editors to modify MIP62c5 without a governance vote to refer to a new Communication Coordinator if:  The previous coordinator is unwilling or unable to fulfill the responsibility. A new coordinator is willing to take on the communication role.   MIP62c5 requires public communication of any modifications by MIP Editors. Fixed some minor formatting stuff in the MIP component summary.
