Analytics This monthly analytics report details the DAO\u2019s community growth both in isolation and when compared with competing protocols. In isolation, the DAO has seen a net increase on every channel and medium. The most notable increases came through the Forum and Substack, which totaled a net increase of 75.5% over the last 90 days. Overall, we saw a net 197.39% increase across all channels. When compared to other top protocols, the Maker Community is growing at rates only rivaled by up-and-coming projects. This is shown in the \u2018Posts/user by project\u2019 chart, or (total posts)/(total users). Maker\u2019s average of 11.47 posts per user is the highest amongst the measured platforms, and over 36% greater than BitDAO\u2019s second-place figure of 7.22 posts per user. Note: All analytics have been gathered by hand as we still do not have access to the APIs required to automate the process.  report1943\u00d7601 38.1 KB   report 2944\u00d7733 42.5 KB   report 3943\u00d7123 10.4 KB   Sentiment https://graphs.santiment.net/makerdao-pro#social_stats Santiment uses Twitter mentions to measure positive v. negative sentiment against the price of MKR.
