Have you looked at Harrison First Harrison First price, FIRST chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko? He is offering he has his own coin that distributes to his community and I think is a very interested idea to play with. He currently he has a description like plan that if you have 1000 coins you can access all his content and with that coin you can get nfts and other discounts. Also you can provide liquidity and the other defi cool stuff. Ialso would like to explore the idea what should be the role of a DAO of artists. For example what the theme of the songs should be? Is that songs carry a message to the fans and to the words? How artists should behave on a DAO? ",
