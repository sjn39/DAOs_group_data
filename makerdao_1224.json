TL;DR In line with Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU\u2019s mandate, The Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard helps reduce the barriers between DAO\u2019s workforce, work, and capital. Furthermore, it:  reduces informational costs; increases transparency around the people, finances and work performed; structures data that currently exists in many different formats and locations; offers a wide spectrum of detail, from abstracted insights to granular views; is embedded with the values of transparency and automation.  We\u2019re providing the MakerDAO community with another progress update, featuring:  ensuring finance data collection & availability through the API; demo of the CU Budget Reporting Tool; the data provider user journey walkthrough; and the context of the data in the dashboard UI.   Introduction The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) Core Unit\u2019s mission is to sustainably grow the Maker Protocol\u2019s moats by removing barriers between decentralized workforce, capital, and work.  Screenshot 2022-06-09 at 17.00.471062\u00d7546 106 KB  One major barrier for an effective MakerDAO workforce and capital allocation is the challenge of creating full budget transparency towards all stakeholders. This is why SES has been working on a number of technical solutions to enable seamless transparency reporting with minimal overhead for the Core Units and their facilitators. One Dashboard to View Them All We believe that, in the future, it will be critical to have a single place for MakerDAO stakeholders to easily find key information about MakerDAO\u2019s workforce, capital and work. The first tool SES has been working on, is the Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard to accomplish this. The MakerDAO Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard aims to:  increase transparency & accountability across the DAO; drastically reduce information costs; support sustainable & successful scaling of the DAO.  Make sure to read our original post on the topic if you want to know more:   Extensive user research was conducted to define the data model with the help of key MakerDAO stakeholders.   Thanks to the API-first approach, any ecosystem participant will be able to integrate the data into their projects, and the collection of the data can be optimally automated.   On top of the API, the SES team is developing the dashboard user interface with a third-party provider with extensive prior Maker experience.    The Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool The Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool has been custom-built by the SES team (shoutout to @liberuum )  to optimally support the finance data reporting and insights that are so specific to MakerDAO and its Core Units. The tool ensures that the API can easily be supplied with all the necessary financial data required by a truly open and transparent organization like MakerDAO.  Screenshot 2022-06-09 at 14.4  2.031312\u00d7741 126 KB  The new Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool makes it easy for Facilitators to submit their monthly budget statements to the Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard. Core Unit facilitators can easily connect to their Core Unit Budget Spreadsheet and push the monthly financial summary (aka budget statements) to the API with just a few clicks.  Screenshot 2022-06-09 at 14.59.491310\u00d7741 102 KB    Core Unit facilitators are first authenticated, after which they are authorized to push financial data relevant to their specific Core Unit.   The Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool can be downloaded as a standalone application that runs on the facilitator\u2019s device. Only the financial summary is sent to the API, and all the detailed accounting information remains private.   The budget tool also supports the viewing and downloading of the financial summaries in multiple formats (SES GitHub, SF CU table, JSON, markdown raw data)   In the next version, the facilitator will be able to add comments to the budget information in the API to clarify the numbers for the Core Unit\u2019s auditor.   Walkthrough Demo Watch the video below for a walkthrough of the tool by @liberuum     Demonstration of the budget tool for example CU financial data pushed to the API.  Sneak Peek of the Dashboard UI In parallel with the development of the Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool, we have also been busy working on the Performance Dashboard User Interface. Below are some of our WIP wireframes to give the reader a better idea of what the dashboard will look like in practice. *Note that this is an incomplete overview with only the first pages we are currently working on. The content is only for illustrative purposes. Additional pages will be added with roadmaps and aggregate information on the level of MakerDAO instead of the Core Unit level. Core Units Overview Table  CU_Overview_Table_wireframe Forum1920\u00d71848 145 KB  Core Units Overview Table In this table, all the essential MakerDAO Core Units information is compiled in one simple overview. Use a search filter to view CUs by category or status, or simply click on the Core Unit section of interest and you will be redirected to a more detailed Core Unit view. Core Unit Profile Page  CU_Profile_page_wireframe_copy1920\u00d72897 499 KB  Core Unit Profile Page Every Core Unit will have a dedicated profile page that offers the user quick insights into what the CU is about: Core Unit code, name, status, categories, important links, short description, the team member full-time equivalents (FTEs), important contact information, and related Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs). For the users who want to dig deeper, the page also gives access to the Core Units\u2019 Initiatives and Finances. Core Unit Finances Overview  Screen Shot 2022-06-09 at 11.23.00 AM1224\u00d71752 297 KB   Screen Shot 2022-06-09 at 11.23.27 AM1238\u00d71752 251 KB  CU Finance page wireframe - Overview for the SES CU finances Detailed Core Unit Transparency Reporting  CU_Finances_page_-Transparency_Reporting_wireframe_copy1920\u00d72359 323 KB  Detailed Core Unit Transparency Reporting Several Core Units have been publishing detailed Monthly Budget Statements since 2021 H1. However, this information is currently posted to their corresponding transparency reporting repositories on Github, which may be difficult to find and doesn\u2019t allow for ease of comparison. The financial Core Unit data uploaded via the budget tool will make this information directly available on the dashboard. As an example, in this wireframe, you can see how the May 2022 budget statement may look like for the SES Permanent Team.  Roadmap towards the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard launch We first introduced The Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard Objective as part of our CU Strategy for 2022. In Q1, we have focused heavily on the preparations: groundwork included user research, data modeling, API tech exploration, scoping of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and securing external collaborators. In the second quarter, we managed to create the data model, build the API, deploy it in a test environment, formulate research-backed product specifications, secure a partner for the UI implementation and start the collaboration. Our focus has now shifted to building the MVP with the goal of launching a user-friendly MVP of the API & dashboard. To get there, we are working towards the following key results:   Finance data collection & availability through the API << In Progress  Finance data availability in the dashboard (both CU & DAO level) << In Progress Initiative & Roadmap data availability in the dashboard (both CU & DAO level) People data availability in the dashboard (both CU & DAO level) Enable better integration of the 5 major MakerDAO governance platforms (in collaboration with other core units)  Voting Portal MIPs Portal MakerDAO Discourse Forum Ecosystem Performance Dashboard makerburn.com    With today\u2019s update, we\u2019ve presented the progress on the key result number 1: Finance data collection & availability through the API, and how the Maker CU Budget Reporting Tool plays a crucial role in this.  Connection with the Resilience Improvement Initiative The work on the Budget Reporting Tool and the Ecosystem Performance API and Dashboard has, so far, been focused on making (1) the financial and (2) the Core Unit / people information available that is critical for MakerDAO stakeholders. In parallel, we have launched the Resilience Improvement Initiative which is working with Core Units, delegates and MKR holders to better define the third element (3): decentralized work. We hope to create an easy-to-understand, transparent view of planning and delivery of work at MakerDAO, that will rival the financial transparency reporting. This information too will be made available through the Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard:   Focus objectives from Decentralized Voter Committees Delegates\u2019 vision and strategy   Key Performance Indicators and other metrics Challenges, opportunities and high-level solutions Strategic and Cross-Core Unit initiatives  Internal Core Unit initiatives with their roadmaps.   As we are working on this, we are paying special attention to the problems of decentralized coordination and consensus-forming around these work elements.  Thank you for your interest. We are excited to work on this high priority transparency product and the value it will deliver to the DAO.   If you are interested in using our new Budget Reporting Tool, please reach out to @Lenkla   Make sure to join our upcoming Status Update call this Friday, June 10th at 4:30pm CEST.   As always, we welcome your feedback and look forward to the discussion. Best, Your Dashboard team  @Haiku @liberuum @teep @wouter & @Lenkla (post updated to fix demo video embed & UI wireframe screenshots) ",

Glad to see that it\u2019s the impression you\u2019re getting.     makercaesar:  goes in the direction of performance of the individual CU without building up pressure.   Yes, that is definitely part of the plan. MakerDAO is lacking direct feedback mechanisms other than extreme options such as core unit offboarding. Which is also an often heard concern of the core units themselves. This tool will provide the possibility to provide feedback on a more continuous basis. One example that will be available from the start, are the audit reports of the monthly budget statements that will be available on the platform. These audits are checking that expense reporting is in line with the expectation set by the budgets. ",
