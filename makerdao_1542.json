                    "content": "So far we have at least two public projects that are delayed sine die by the situation at RWF-001: MIP65 and domain investigation work on Backed Finance. MIP65 at least has a target size of 500M DAI which would generate 15M per year or above 40k DAI per day at a 3% rate. Lack of legal funding is holding up similar deals with multi-billion $ organizations. Every day of delay has a 40-80k DAI opportunity cost. It is key to return to profitability (see ALM forecast). @christiancdpetersen and his team were kind enough to help us even after Christian resigned (and subsequently getting fired in an email) without any clear compensation. But Christian has had to face some unprofessional behavior and legal threats with implied community tolerance, which is understandably driving him away from a project he has helped put on the map for RWA. Moreover, legal advice from tier 1 firms is not cheap. We would normally be happy to fund legal expenses out of SF-001, but our budget expansion request was recently denied and we don\u2019t have enough to finance these associated legal expenses out of our existing CU budget. I publicly asked the question to @williamr but got no answer so far. I understand that SF and others have reached out privately with simply no response. Every additional day that we waste continues to incur a very real opportunity cost ultimately only really borne by the token holder. My personal LLC is still a client of Latham and of Ogier. I propose that we leverage this existing relationship to avoid spending 2 months in KYC and explaining what a DAO is by onboarding a new entity. To avoid any endless fruitless discussion from trolls, I further propose that someone from GovAlpha, if they agree, be involved in all communications and be present in all the meetings to act as community observer, as they have a neutrality mandate and are well respected in the community. We would prefer not to issue an SPF request out of concern for the overall operating expense at the DAO and for timely execution. Therefore I ask @williamr to fund 500k DAI from the RWF legal budget (based on RWF legal cost expectations) to the SF-001 wallet to pay for legal fees we might have on ALM revenue-generating opportunities such as MIP65. Any excess will be refunded to RWF-001 and/or to the surplus buffer. Thanks @williamr for a prompt answer. In the continued absence of a response we will default to proposing an SPF adding weeks/months of delay to a very straightforward alternative costing 1-2 millions to MKR holders in opportunity cost.

It is just a way of asking a legal firm to do a specific piece of work necessary in order to complete MIP65 and in order to provide an independent legal due diligence on the greenlit Backed Finance. The idea of asking GovAlpha to attend is to recognize that  Someone has to be the \u2018client\u2019 For expedience\u2019s sakes Seb\u2019s LLC is already a \u2018client\u2019 at several law firms the RWF has used in the past In order to remove any potential for impropriety that community members may allege (such as in your message) if they are uncomfortable with a contributor\u2019s personal LLC mandating this work, GovAlpha be privy to all communication  Doesn\u2019t have to be GovAlpha or even limited to anyone in particular, above was just a suggestion.

I understand a bit better now. The RWF funds were approved by governance for the purpose of executing real-world finance transactions and risk assessments. In practice the MIP system asks for blanket approval to execute a mandate and then the core unit has discretion over the use of those funds up to the amount approved in the MIP. The safeguard is that token holders can retract approval at any time, though we can agree that the behavioral kink in this safeguard puts token holder funds at risk.     ChrisBlec:  I have never alleged impropriety. I\u2019ve only said that Maker allows for impropriety. I do not believe that the MakerDAO system should allow for any opacity which inevitably leads to impropriety. This forum post is a great example of that opacity.   Think we can both agree. But for the purpose of executing on due diligence or legal work required for real-world transactions, in practice what we can do is involve more DAO actors to remove the potential for intransparency. I also don\u2019t think this is a regular part of DAO operations but that is why we are making our request public. ",

                    "content": "Reading the OP and the comments in the thread, and as I am passing on the governance torch I expect my comments to taken accordingly. First @SebVentures I have to say I think you and pretty much anyone still retained by CUs does a disservice by hammering on @williamr multiply and repeatedly in this fashion.  What this does is just confirm to my mind that there are many people still in the DAO that can\u2019t or don\u2019t understand professional courtesy and have an axe to grind, both for personal satisfaction and or political gain. So lets get some basics out of the way. \u201cUnblocking the stalled \u2026initiative(s)\u201d Initiative(S!). I know @Rune has been hammering on this bond issue for quite some time, and I can\u2019t even remember where I recently read he was \u2018back dooring\u2019 some kind of deal on this issue and/or RWF/RWA (honestly a bit hard to read between the lines anymore). My point to @iammeeoh is that MakerDAO was unlikely to just drop kick 1B worth of bonds with ONE AO out of the gate.  Hence why @SebVentures said \u2018initiative(S)\u2019.    Each one of these @christiancdpetersen could attest to takes time to hammer out the legal machinery before they can be put into place and even then governance does well to not just put these to the maximum DC initially but to some reasonable starting amount. When Maker started on the RWF adventure @SebVentures was at the helm and got some initiatives going.   @Rune effectively off-boarded @SebVentures and once the new RWF team headed by @williamr came on line they basically had to review the past, and figure out how to process into the future.   But again issues (partially political and partially people) popped up AGAIN basically putting the RWA process on hold. To be fair part of these issues stem directly from @SebVentures and also from @williamr .   So I don\u2019t think it is fair for Seb to get up on his high horse bitching about how everything is stopped and MakerDAO is losing 40K/month due solely to Will for the following reasons:  Unless governance has already decided they would DC $1B to a single player here out of the gate we would have started smaller and probably would not be getting a full 3% on much over 100-250M.  It is more likely governance would have done multiple deals (and doing multiple Arrangers/AOs whatever would have still taken longer) and these would have been starting in the next 1-2 months (maybe). There are still going to be fees on this that are unexpected so an actual 3% ROI may be a stretch (even so 2-2.5% isn\u2019t but then we just quibble over 40K vs. 25-30K/DAI/day) Does Maker want to get this done right (both on a RWF CU front, but also from a DAO perspective) or just toss money out there hoping it comes back? Given even the previous timelines these were not going to be on-line today but more likely once the details were implemented and governance could pass DCs etc.  I have multiple concerns here.  The first is someone else who had significant interest and stake in hiring the people we now have problems with complaining the DAO is losing money.   The second is that @williamr being hammered on while he is having medical issues and not really being given time to respond.    And the third is that somehow the 20-40K/DAI/day Maker is losing, we have been losing that for the past 6 months, also while we wait interest rates (particularly on the short end) are continuing to rise so perhaps by waiting to toss in that $1B MakerDAO is potentially going to earn more.    But I would be the first to admit this is a stretch statement as well. @Recognized-Delegates please don\u2019t get sucked into this push me pull you, passive aggressive approach to drag you around here.   While it is disappointing to see yet a second serious hitch in MakerDAO RWF don\u2019t fall into the trap.  Unless governance intends to actually off-board @williamr and somehow replace him and his new team you have to give him a fair chance to get his house in order and resume progress. Do not mistake what is going on here.   There is a significant push by many still contracted by the DAO to just go around Will and hire the fired team to get something done \u2018fast\u2019.   Given the very high stakes here I think it is prudent for the DAO to digest the situation before it can have any hope of continuing to make healthy strides forward.   It is unpleasant, unfortunate, and I agree is costing the DAO time and revenues, but IMO these ARE NOT valid reasons to run around Will here. ",

I\u2019m also anticipating some needs after onboarding as well. Having ongoing reliable, available, and independent third parties is important to the work at hand. Like many of you, I\u2019d like to avoid delays in getting collateral onboarded. Today, we have a RWF-001 core unit that is responsible for providing these services. If/until governance action is taken, they are the responsible party. Other than transferring a budget, I don\u2019t see how this proposal addresses the root cause. I appreciate Seb offering a solution but the issue is much larger. As I have mentioned, managing the work is already part of the weekly collateral meetings with the collateral stakeholders. GovAlpha is part of that team. We don\u2019t need to create another process outside of this as it would be disruptive the teams already involved. What we need is clarity on who is going to do the work. If we need to start interviewing law and deal firms, all good but we need to know that asap. The amount of Dai in question is 500m. We can\u2019t afford mistakes. This has to be done correctly due to the existential risk. Bonds are RWAs and they are no less complex than all of the other deals we\u2019ve done.
