I also provided a complete implementation and set of tools to use the protocol. The implementation is here: GitHub - ticket721/mTKN And here is the initial draft: EIPs/eip-2280.md at feat/mtkn-proposal \u00b7 mortimr/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub I\u2019d love to discuss it and make this interface one of the first \u201cmeta-extension\u201d of a famous standard (an important step if we want to build Relay Networks (Meta Miners !)). Thank you for reading  ",
