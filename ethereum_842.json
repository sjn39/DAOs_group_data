I have familiarised myself with LES documentation but only see it as an entry point into understanding the protocol. My questions vary from;   What is the best client to refer to in order to obtain the protocol implementation, and therefore ascertain what is needed to be developed; would this be go-ethereum or the third party Parity client for example?   Is there concrete documentation available on the components that make the protocol beyond the LES documentation?   The most efficient strategy for developing the light client, leveraging what is out there already.   Clarification to these concerns will also be beneficial for newcomers wanting to endeavour into the protocols. Thanks in advance. ",
