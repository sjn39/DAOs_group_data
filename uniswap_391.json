They obviously had to make a cut off at some point, partly due to legal reasons such as inside trading. Now everyone ia proposing ways of rewarding current holders with  more uni?  Isn\u2019t the incentive for governance to ensure integrity and stability?   Everyone is just asking for more free stuff when in reality they should be focused on the real implications of UNI. ",

With that said, I do want to point out that I firmly believe the UNI token should have monetary value, UNI isn\u2019t a non-profit DAO right?     Timothy:  Isn\u2019t the incentive for governance to ensure integrity and stability?   I believe we\u2019ve got to align this specifically with financial rewards. UNI tokens represent governance rights over the platform, which is essentially ownership of the protocol. Wouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to include some form of financial reward to the people running the show? I think so!     Timothy:  Everyone is just asking for more free stuff when in reality they should be focused on the real implications of UNI.   I get where you\u2019re coming from, but bar the retroactive smart contract interaction excluded addresses, I don\u2019t see much demand for an airdrop. Instead, there\u2019s a lot of discussion surrounding how the financial model of the UNI token will unfold. Having to own UNI tokens to earn a return is not free stuff. It\u2019s a reward for being part of the protocol\u2019s governance. There is indeed a 0.05% fee switch (section 2.4 of the whitepaper) embedded in the protocol, after all. Over time, I expect this to be implemented, with fees flowing to UNI holders or governance participants. (I think it\u2019d be ideal to have it go towards a governance community treasury first.) In closing, I hope I didn\u2019t completely miss the point! Hopefully you got something of value from my response ! ",
