                    "content": "    TL;DR  WTF is Conviction Voting? 1Hive built the first instance of a super handy tool called Conviction Voting.  If you haven\u2019t heard of it, here\u2019s the TL;DR tweet thread.   The Problem: Many DAOs (including Gitcoin) are struggling hard with the same problems: Insurmountable overhead with keeping up with and voting on every proposal, all or nothing (1 or 0 analog) funding proposals votes like this one where there is significant support but not quorum, last minute vote swings and other governance \u201cattack\u201d vectors that require time weighted voting to correct and more\u2026 A Solution: The DAO buidler tool box must have Conviction Voting to more efficiently distribute & decentralize funding proposals and visualize dynamic average consensus signals. The consent, rather than consensus based tool can help:  Increase operational efficiency Mitigates many governance \u201cattack\u201d vectors   Image by Jeff Emmett  \u201cCV shifts the governance space from majoritarian decision making towards sufficient support for proposals, based on the amount of funds they are requesting.\u201d Credit Jeff Emmett  image929\u00d7571 71.7 KB   (Addressing plutocracy will require SSIDs/DIDs to scale in a meaningful way - I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long!)  Oh and did I forget to mention it provides rich data streams of continuous preference signals?  Who Am I (Reputation Flags) I am a Founding member of the FDD Working Group, Token Engineering & Governance Researcher at BlockScience, Advisor & Course Author at the Token Engineering Academy, Trusted Seed Member of the CommonsStack, Ground Control at the Governauts & Founding Steward of the Token Engineering Commons. Why We Need Moonshot\u2019s Support My colleague, TE OG @jeffemmett & I have been chatting with @owocki and several others about the need to expand and create a public good, chain agnostic version of this tool. I tried to rally some groups last year to fund/build this initiative but they all wanted their own version, to which the incredibly amazing, talented & busy lead engineer/developer of CV said, \u201cHey guys, I can\u2019t support 20 versions, let\u2019s build this in RUST.\u201d To which the groups said, \u201cIf we fund it, we want our way.\u201d So, this is where the heroes of Gitcoin DAO & Moonshot Collective come in -  the pan-ultimate supporters of public goods!   Okay, I it, Now What?  One note before I let you go - this tool is customizable:  image960\u00d7540 107 KB  So, we can build something for funding, for continuous general signaling or ranking like a continous TCR - we definitely would need lots of discussion and some research with developers to figure out what would be the best, high leverage lego version that multiple DAOs could build on. So, don\u2019t be shy and let\u2019s crank up the conversation on this thread - pass to your friends  and let\u2019s get the VC in the pipeline for the MC, who can be a hero for all DAOs - and build the chain agnostic version of Conviction Voting that we all need!  HOORAY!!!  NOTE: @jeffemmett & I are available (limited bandwidth) to support R&D and would also love to see some resources (a few others / CV team) to continue to expand content/education/research/documentation of these concepts/tooling/R&D  Thank you so much for reading and in advance, for your thoughts & support!

                    "content": "To add to this (admittedly, with fewer memes ): Conviction Voting in its present form is geared towards easing fund allocations in DAOs, which is a great use case and is likely to ease some of these kinds of funding decisions.  It could also be augmented with quadratic conviction voting, or perhaps even quadratic downvoting on CV proposals, to provide the capability for a DAO to express negative sentiment towards CV proposals, if there was a concern that too many proposals were passing too easily.  There is still a wide design space to explore in the use of these new tools, and we\u2019re interested to see how they can be iterated & improved! On top of CV for fund allocation, there are also discussions about a CV-variation called #ConvictionRanking, which could act more like a continuous TCR (token curated registry). If this were created with a \u2018BYO token\u2019 design, any DAO could plug in their native token and allow any token holder to surface & vote on anything they see needing improvement in the DAO.  It could be a sort of \u201cdigital suggestion box\u201d which curates & surfaces the most popular sentiments for action in a continuous, distributed & asynchronous manner.  I got the sense that GitcoinDAO would benefit from such a tool (as well as vanilla Conviction Voting for fund allocation!) when I came across a tweet convo between @owocki & @DisruptionJoe: https://twitter.com/jeffemmett/status/1499784633747054592 ",

As a Commons Stacker, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with CV (and Jeff and Jess!) and I agree that it\u2019s:  a necessary piece of the DAO tooling stack full of potential to liberate society from ills of static voting capable of increasing legitimacy & engagement in Gitcoin Steward voting  This last point I see as the major benefit to Gitcoin\u2019s mission. So we must investigate it  1 concern is that the type of decisions that are ideal for CV (long game strategic/organizational direction decisions) might not match the type of decisions that Gitcoin Stewards vote on (regularly scheduled, short interval budgetary/steering decisions). It\u2019s possible that CV could change the way stewards vote, could change the way Workstreams propose. But it\u2019s also possible that the types of proposals & mode of interacting with them would be too disparate and CV would gather dust living in Gitcoin\u2019s governance system. I\u2019m curious to hear what @Pop thinks as steward engagement is truly her domain. Knowing where Gitcoin & Moonshot Collective are at, I don\u2019t see us being focused on providing DAO tooling in the near future. It\u2019s not a major mandate of Gitcoin\u2019s mission. So in order to find alignment to put development work towards this we\u2019d need to see why building chain-agnostic Conviction Voting helps serve the mission of Gitcoin (which is to provide Public Goods Funding infrastructure) thru achieving our current OKRs: 2022 Roadmap & 2022 Goals ",

Osmotic Funding is an interesting modification of CV that may be more useful for continuous Operational Expenses (OpEx) like staff salaries or working group budgets, rather than more discrete proposals for Capital Expenses (CapEx) like one off projects, etc. There are several interesting use cases for variations of the CV tool - eager to see how & where they may find PMF in GitcoinDAO!

My view is that we should focus on something that enables a 20/80 split in voting for budgets where if a small % of a proposal is disputed, it can continue to be discussed vs either holding up the whole proposal or meaning the full amount gets passed even though some stewards may still have reservations around it or require further clarification. Next steps: @lthrift and I are synching to establish what work might look like for Moonshot/the research team ",

To share a few more notes from the meeting - it could also (eventually) be a composite system where Gitcoin DAO uses Conviction Voting for proposal funding for Capital Expenses and develops a new Conviction Funding Flow mechanisms for flowing salaries & ongoing costs (Operational Expenses). FROM MEETING NOTES: An OpEx Conviction Funding Flow Tool would: -Removes the BINARY \u201cfunds\u201d or \u201dno funds\u201d of proposals, and moves towards sliding scale of funds unlocked - like a dam opening with proportional amounts of water flowing according to tokens. -w/ configuration to correlate staking/threshholds with %s of the budget, rather than all or nothing - i.e. stewards agree w/ 80% of the budget, 80% unlocked while discussing/debating the other 20% so work can keep going Here is documentation of a mechanism Sem from 1hive and some others have been working on, that may be useful for the developers in looking at what primitives/code exists for building a tool like this: Osmotic Funding Osmotic Funding \u00b7 ETHGlobal Showcase GitHub - BlossomLabs/osmotic-funding: Superfluid + Conviction Voting Osmotic Funding | Grants | Gitcoin There are other flow funding tools i.e. Radicle Drips, but they don\u2019t have a conviction voting mechanism, so would be a really interesting and incredibly useful for many DAOs to have a tool combining these primitives\u2026 Thank you again and look forward to next steps and supporting  ",
