                    "content": "I\u2019m a six-year crypto CEX player Very concerned about this optimistic hot topic Would like to make some personal comments to provide feedback I\u2019m sorry my English is not good, I can only type in Chinese, I\u2019m afraid there will be errors in the translation, please forgive me For this optimistic airdrop was dumped, the personal analysis is as follows  Because arbitrage players get profit-taking It is still in a bear market, too many people lose money and want to exchange some money to make up for it Optimistic re-emission airdrop #1 creates chaos and loses confidence in the market  Optimism has the right to reduce the reward for dumpers But since optimism gives the token to the holder The holder has the right to buy and sell currency freely And optimism can also set new rules for my personal opinion I would divide the holders into 4 blocks  No dumping (should be more rewarded) Dump 25% (should be flat) Dump 50% (should reduce some shares) Dump 75% (should reduce a large share) To measure the contribution of the wallet to the ecology But I think you should use objectivism instead of coercion Optimism must be announced first Let holders know the rules Then set a snapshot date Let the dumper have confidence in optimism Can be bought back in time In this way, a fair mechanism is created  After the snapshot For the four blocks divided above Issuing non-transferable NFTs Setting new standards for wallets to adjust the proportion of the next airdrop I won\u2019t discuss the weight part. The community can discuss on its own Then for dumpers there will definitely be an airdrop for #2 Open a new wallet 1 new wallet standard can be defined (Assuming you hold 300 OPs) you can get 100% Those who do not hold OP but participate in the DAPP ecosystem get 50% Let OP have a certain value Then you can put part of the airdrop Open staking rewards on the mainnet Allow OP holders to pledge You can get OP to get rewards With a functional market there will be less dumping And it can make more people want to hold Actually, I think only 5% of the airdrop will be released this time. But there have been heated discussions in the market that\u2019s great Although optimistic the current price although not in line with market expectations But dumping coins always has an end Continue to improve prices will stabilize For the witch I think this time did a good job Filtered 17K, plus the HOP filtered part Although not all filtered, but at least the basic list is available also mastered a large part of well done i think After all, ecology has to give the market some space And if the wallet requires 1 person to only have 1, it is too strict After all, not everyone is familiar with wallet authorization I also worry about wallet security concerns, and use a second wallet for shunting Or transfer money between family members if unfortunately excluded This is ecologically repelling Therefore, it is not recommended to continue the rigorous investigation. Too strict filtering will only reduce ecological activity These are my personal thoughts from my recent observation of Optimistic Airdrop #1 Provide feedback to the community Hope it will help the community ",
