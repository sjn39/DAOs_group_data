It introduces the interface for indicating whether the token is transferable or not, without regard to non-fungibility, using the feature detection functionality of [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).  ## Motivation  We propose the introduction of the UNTransferability Indicator, a universal indicator that demonstrates untransferability without regard to non-fungibility. This will enable the use of Soulbound Tokens (SBT), which are untransferable and fungible/non-fungible entities, to associate items with an account, user-related information, memories, and event attendance records, in a universal manner. The [EIP-5192](./eip-5192.md) specification was invented for this purpose, but SBT in [EIP-5192](./eip-5192.md) is non-fungible and has a tokenId, allowing them to be distinguished from each other using the tokenId. However, for example, in the case of event attendance records, it is not necessary to distinguish between those who attended the same event using the tokenId, and all participants should have the same indistinguishable entity. Rather, the existence of the tokenId creates discriminability.       This file has been truncated. show original      ",

A minor comment on the title: I think the best possible title for all these standards (after having one year of time to think about this) is \u201cLockable NFTs.\u201d It is because \u201cLockable\u201d allows all the following states:  permanently locked (Soulbound or account bound or non-transferable) temporarily or conditionally locked/transferrable (loaned) permanently transferrable  Lockable has the added benefit that it hasn\u2019t been social-media captured by some special interest group wanting to push their solution for X (as has been done with SBTs and NTTs). People have genuinely no understanding yet of lockable tokens. But already the name implies: \u201cThis thing is lockable, but it also means that it is potentially unlockable.\u201d It can, however, also mean: \u201cthis thing is permanently lockable.\u201d Then, let me please explain a different feature that you may want to consider that has been implemented in: ERC-5058: Lockable Non-Fungible Tokens approving locks. See, with transfers on EIP-20 and EIP-721 tokens, we can approve a contract or another account to make a transfer on our behalf. And the nice thing about it is that this isn\u2019t hard coded with respect to the approved account. And it translates into e.g. Uniswap contracts managing my EIP20 tokens for trading (which is a very nice feature). Now, with EIP-5192, I had intended to build something like that by allowing the users to implement the locked function themselves and to revert to transfer as they saw fit. But then, this forces hard coding of the values in the respective implementation. So what ERC-5058: Lockable Non-Fungible Tokens, by allowing to approve an operator to manage the lock function, is much better because it generalizes the lock operator instead of the developer hard coding it. I\u2019d consider implementing this @yuki-js unless you see very big drawbacks to this. ",
