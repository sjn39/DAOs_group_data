                    "content": " Executive Summary  The attack vector under scrutiny was a malicious executive spell. Reaction time of delegates to respond was assessed with a poll. GovAlpha, at the behest of Immunefi Security, posted a fire drill poll at Jul 08 20:00 UTC set to close in 48 hours. 89.8k MKR responded within the time window. This area of emergency response is looking pretty healthy.   Attack Vector We envisioned the following scenario:  A malicious executive spell is created. A sufficient amount of MKR votes for this spell to make it the hat.    This MKR could have been gradually accumulated from the market by the attacker and some may have been borrowed from lending markets. The Governance Pause Delay is currently set to 48 hours. Dai and vault holders could leave the Maker protocol as a defensive measure, but it is unlikely that they would notice the threat in time. MKR holders can defend against the attacker in two ways:  Cancel the malicious executive spell by moving the hat to a specially crafted new executive spell. This will require mobilization of strictly more MKR than deployed by the attacker. Trigger the emergency shutdown module. This would be extremely disruptive to users of the Maker protocol and is generally not the preferred reaction, but the amount of MKR required (currently 150k) may be less than deployed by the attacker, although there is the complication that delegates cannot trigger ESM. MKR can only be deposited in the ESM by its owner.     Pragmatic Considerations  To limit expense and risk to MakerDAO, GovAlpha & ISCU agreed on using a poll instead of an executive spell.  A poll is less realistic than an executive spell, but polls offer the virtue of never having on-chain effects on the protocol. Poll votes don\u2019t require locked MKR. We didn\u2019t want to elicit a level of panic similar to what might accompany a real attack. The misconstrual of the fire drill as a real attack could have real consequences. For example:  Protocol users might off-board as a precautionary measure. This could result in permanent loss of users. Emergency procedures to use private keys outside of normal business hours could cause substantial inconvenience and expense to Recognized Delegates. Incorrect use of private keys could result in serious loss.     PECU did not need to invest time in crafting a no-operation spell. Voter due diligence could still be tested by writing confusing poll choices, simulating the confusion anticipated to coincide with a real attack. The poll was posted off hours at the beginning of a weekend, during a period when no votes were planned. This is likely how a real attack would be timed. Contrary to standard practice, GovAlpha agreed not to announce the poll; it simply appeared on the voting portal. As soon as the poll was noticed, GovAlpha posted an announcement. This event sequence was meant to simulate the response to a real attack.   Reception  Poll outcome The poll had three choices:  Vote Yes if you believe these \u201cfire drills\u201d are a valuable use of resources. Vote No if you do not think these \u201cfire drills\u201d are not a valuable use of resources. [Bold styling added.] Vote Abstain if you are not sure or do not wish to give an opinion on the value of these drills.  No received 53,202, Yes received 22,992, and Abstain received 13,643. This represents a total of 89.8k MKR. Since all of the choices were either affirming or not disaffirming, we have to look at the voter comments to understand how voters interpreted the poll.  Doo was somewhat skeptical of the value of the poll, \u201cResponse time is important but how often are we doing this\u201d schuppi took the opposite stance, \u201cfor sure fire drills are important, no doubts.\u201d MakerMan seemed particularly confused, \u201cSwitched to \u2018Yes\u2019 vote as per DOO comments - think we could get valuable feedback here.\u201d ACREinvest made a defensible choice, \u201cI get this is a drill so I vote abstain.\u201d Shadow Delegate 0x14a4e\u202698e4 did not understand the attack vector, \u201cStart with a working process for triaging and escalating bugs before adding pointless drills. No notice on the forum or chat makes this a poor indication of performance in an actual shtf situation.\u201d  Both schuppi and MakerMan seemed confused about the poll choices. Both changed their vote after voting. MakerMan voted for all three choices, sequentially. Recognized Delegates who did not vote within the 48 hour window:  Flipside Crypto London Business School Hasu GFX Labs  Link to raw voting data. ISCU will refund gas used to vote on this poll.   Selected comments from Discord ElPro (3F): \u201cI actually think it was good - it got me! Only checked MakerBurn when I woke up \u2014 when did this poll go up? Just now\u201d ^ PaperImperium (GFX):  \u201cSeems like what you\u2019re really asking is if delegates are awake. Which can be done without me bothering the home office on a weekend. Some of us have internal controls on voting wallets\u201d ^  \u201cAnyway, I applaud the intention. But don\u2019t think it measures ability to pass an emergency executive\u201d ^   ACREinvest: \u201cI don\u2019t know why there is so much push back here, my goodness! Great work - it is super valuable to do any kind of drills. This certainly was a surprise and I am very happy to see GovAlpha is on top of scenario planning. I have been thinking about disaster recovery, emergency response for all kinds of scenarios and wondering to what extent we are prepare. THANK YOU!\u201d ^ Raphbaph (Flipside): \u201cI think the drill is a great idea. Especially on the weekend. It turned out we\u2019re not well prepared for that. Can only vote tomorrow evening ET, too late. We\u2019ll improve our procedures accordingly. But this drill was necessary to point that out\u201d ^ Rune: \"happy people are starting to discover governance frontend risks. Another thing is that if someone compromises the frontend they could steal massive amounts of MKR by delivering bad transactions even to people using ledgers, which could include whales that could put the entire system at risk. This is another reason why we need MetaDAOs, because they would be able to sustainably maintain multiple fully secure, fully decentralized governance frontends, so we can both mitigate the long term risks of governance capture by someone who controls the official voting frontend, and the hacking risks of using diversified centralized voting frontends. Properly built, diversified, decentralized frontends is IMO the only completely future proofed endgame compatible solution to solve the significant risks that exists with governance frontends.\" ^ schuppi: \u201cMaking it easy to run the voting portal locally would be a good first step\u201d ^  Lessons Learned A fire drill with fairly minimal communications rallied 90k MKR over a weekend. We are in pretty good shape. Short-term efforts towards increasing emergency preparedness should focus on triaging and internal communication.  Recommendations What is a good frequency? Fire drills are annoying, but we must stay vigilant. It\u2019s a necessary evil.

I changed 3 times trying to modify my text after Doo pointed out some feedback via vote would be useful (again this was not noted anywhere in the linked text on the fire drill).
