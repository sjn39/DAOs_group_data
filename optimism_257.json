                    "content": " What\u2019s up OP Collective - We\u2019re the team behind the Tally Ho wallet, the community-owned alternative to MetaMask. We wanted to offer you an  early look  at our Optimism integration before the public announcement next week.  Last month we got 70,000+ signatures on our #defendWeb3 pledge(!) and we\u2019ll be launching our on-chain DAO soon\u2026 so the OP integration is coming at an exciting time. We wanted to invite you to try out our OP support before the public for 2 reasons:  We\u2019d love to hear your early feedback! - As part of the core OP community, we\u2019d love have a priority channel to hear your thoughts so we can prioritize any fixes or features you\u2019d like us to implement. We already support Optimism NFTs and in-wallet swaps on Optimism\u2026 and long term one of our goals is to be easiest way for newbies to onboarding straight to OP, skipping L1 entirely. If you find a bug in this version, or just have a wallet idea you\u2019d love to see someone someone implement, let us know and we\u2019ll do our best to make it happen.  Mini alpha leak - We\u2019re running some growth campaigns next week alongside the announcement and would love to make sure the core OP community has the chance to get involved! We\u2019ll be doing Optimism NFT giveaways on Twitter and also running campaigns for you to earn GALXE NFTs. So definitely keep an eye on our Twitter next week\u2026 and if you want to be first in line on the GALXE quests, it couldn\u2019t hurt to start using the wallet on OP now  Many thanks to everyone who\u2019s able to try out the wallet!
