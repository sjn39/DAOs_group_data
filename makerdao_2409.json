The RenVM achieves this kind of interoperability with a network of virtual computers called Darknodes, which provide the necessary computing power to identify and process cross-chain crypto assets movement. At the time of writing RenVM supports cross-chain movement of BTC, BCH and ZEC, with BTC as the biggest locked asset in terms of value. Moving assets is supported between Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polkadot chains. renBTC is an Ethereum ERC20 token redeemable for BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain. One renBTC equals one BTC minus fees and, as an ERC20 token, can be used in various Ethereum wallets and smart contracts. Tokenomics While renBTC itself doesn\u2019t have any special tokenomics we do need to be aware it is tightly bound to the RenVM mechanics and to REN token. The circulating supply and even price of renBTC will be influenced by the RenVM fees and bonded REN token (100K of REN bonding - valued at 30,800$ at time of writing - is currently required to run a Darknode). RenVM is a decentralized custodian that uses bonding to secure the locked BTC and adjusted fees to incentivize Darknodes participation in the network. The renproject wiki states \u201cFees are the main incentive for Darknodes to power RenVM. In return for their work, Darknodes are rewarded with fees that are paid by the user. If the user transfers BTC from one chain to another, the Darknodes earn a small adjustable percentage of that transfer. That is, if BTC is moved by users, BTC is earned by Darknodes, and so on. This helps keep the rewards diverse, and the user experience simple (the user does not need to juggle fee tokens).\u201d The REN bond of a Darknode represents a commitment to good behaviour and can be slashed when the Darknode is responsible for loss of assets. Slashed bonds can be used to restore lost assets. For security reasons RenVM will adjust the fees to try and keep the ratio of bonded value to locked assets value 3 to 1. This means the circulating supply of renBTC will be affected by participation in RenVM and the REN bonded value. Current locked value, bonded value and fees are best monitored on the Ren project mainnet stats page. Besides the fees on cross-chain movements, RenVM can also adjust a continuous fee (currently at 0%) to incentivize the network and users to adjust locked value compared to bonded value. The continuous fee is implemented through a decreasing exchange rate between the pegged asset (renBTC) and the respective origin asset (BTC). Though this value depreciation compared to BTC would be very slow, it would affect the general price of renBTC, as it would no longer be a 1 to 1 minus fees redeemable for BTC. Locked value at end of Oct 2020: $326,682,806.92 Bonded value at end of Oct 2020: $42,989,346.00 Fees in cycle/epoch from mid Sep to mid Oct 2020:  Mint fee: 0.2% (raised from 0.1% in end Oct 2020) Burn fee: 0.1% Continuous fee: 0% Generated fees value: $336,032  Source of data: Renproject mainnet dashboard RenVM security After RenVM transitions to a fully decentralized network and is governed by its community, the security will rely fully on its consensus algorithm and the adjustable economic incentives, mainly through fees. The Ren project wiki pages summarize their security: \u201cRenVM makes use of a modified version of the Tendermint consensus algorithm to guarantee the consensus mechanism cannot be made unsafe (or halted), unless 1/3rd or more of the Darknodes are adversarial and coordinating (or offline). The same guarantees are made for execution by making use of the novel RZL MPC algorithm. To incentivise Darknodes to be non-adversarial, RenVM has a series of slashing conditions that will slash the bonds of malicious Darknodes. These slashing conditions, coupled with economic policies to adjust fees earnt, ensure that it is not profitable to attempt an attack against RenVM. Furthermore, an irrational attacker that is happy to make a loss would still need to have access to a large amount of initial capital as well as a way to collude with large numbers of unknown Darknodes in a short period of time.\u201d During RenVM phases Subzero and Zero (Subzero at time of writing), the Greycore is controlled by the Ren project core team. The Greycore is a special shard of RenVM network that backs all gateway shards and the coordination shard. The Greycore has two core purposes:  Guaranteeing the safety of assets under management by acting as a second signature on all minting and releasing Guaranteeing the uniform randomness of shard selection  While the Ren team controls the Greycore shard, RenVM does not need to be over-collateralized to remain secure. Over time, once the economics are safe, the Ren team will pass the governance of this shard to the community. On-chain fundamentals As described, renBTC supply and to an extent also price depends on the RenVM mechanics and the REN token. REN token is currently intended to be solely used for Darknode bonding but may also transition to a governance token in one form or another in the future. Currently the protocol is governed by the core team to maintain control in its initial phases. Current REN supply has 999,999,632 tokens with 145,000,000 (14.5%) in Darknode bonding and 110,445,763 (11%) in the Ren project MultiSig. Other notable holders are Binance, Aave lending pool, Huobi, OKEx. 1026\u00d7411 40 KB Source of data: Coingecko, Etherscan With the rapid changing of locked value and fee adjustments we can only very roughly estimate around 9% of generated yield annually ($42,989,346 bonded value, $336,032 one month fees). Metrics and analysis CEX and DEX volume The only centralized exchange with renBTC pairs (BTC,ETH) is Huobi. The liquidity and volume is currently negligible. As for decentralized exchanges, we\u2019re seeing most of the renBTC supply available in the Curve liquidity pools with the majority of daily trading volume between renBTC and WBTC: 1200\u00d71200 58.3 KB RenBTC-ETH pair trading is limited to the Uniswap platform: 917\u00d7474 66.5 KB 917\u00d7476 64.5 KB Source of data: Curve.fi, Uniswap Holder distribution With the short time that renBTC is available on Ethereum mainnet it\u2019s understandable there\u2019s not many holders. As we\u2019ve seen, most holders decide to lock it into Curve finance. Current number of holders: 1,364 976\u00d7411 34.1 KB Source of data: Etherscan Tokens on exchanges The vast majority of renBTC resides on Curve.fi decentralized exchange where users are providing liquidity in the pools that swap between different wrapped BTC tokens. renBTC circulating supply end Oct 2020: 25,996 of which 77% (19,898) reside in Curve.fi liquidity pools.  Curve.fi has only increased renBTC holdings in the past couple of months: 930\u00d7530 27.2 KB Source of data: Coingecko, Nansen Redeeming (burning and releasing): At any point, users can burn an arbitrary amount of renBTC. At the same time, they must specify a Bitcoin address. The Darknodes powering RenVM will eventually observe this burn event on Ethereum, and after 12 confirmations will create a RenVM transaction to release the respective amount of BTC to the specified Bitcoin address. Best case redeem scenario: Time for submitted (with included btc address) ethereum tx to be mined + wait for 12 confirmations (3min) + delay by renVM consensus mechanism (to order/batch etc.) to generate signed bitcoin transaction + time for submitted bitcoin transaction to be mined (expected redeem interval: 10min-60min) RenBTC recycling via BTC should be significantly faster than recycling WBTC. reference: https://darknodes.online/transactions/ Downside risks As renBTC has only been available in the last half year we\u2019ll instead look at the data for BTC to get a comparison against ETH on a larger time frame. As renBTC is redeemable for BTC it has closely followed BTC price. Daily pullback comparison between ETH and BTC over the past 2 years:  929\u00d7347 17.2 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare, CoinGecko Volatility We will again use BTC past prices for measuring volatility to get enough data points. As the largest and oldest of crypto currencies BTC is one of the most stable (apart from stablecoins).      volatility scaled yearly     90 days 0.507% 23.56%   1 year 0.781% 73.15%   2 years 0.783% 103.62%    Source of data: CryptoCompare Supply growth Even though renBTC is unique in it\u2019s trustless, decentralized custodial mechanics, it serves the same purpose as the other wrapped/pegged BTC tokens - to get BTC (or rather BTC representation) on Ethereum. Looking at total supply of BTC on Ethereum, renBTC is in second place (~18%), after WBTC (~75%), while others are lagging behind. Total BTC on Ethereum supply end of Oct 2020: 147,434 (0.8% of current BTC circulating supply) 734\u00d7303 2.53 KB BTC on Ethereum in the last year: 840\u00d7393 18.3 KB Source of data: Dune Analytics Defi presence RenBTC defi presence is currently limited to providing liquidity for trading pairs, and is still mostly absent from lending platforms like compound, aave etc. It was recently introduced to the CREAM finance lending platform. By far the largest usage is providing liquidity on Curve in the renBTC/WBTC and renBTC/WBTC/SBTC pools. Summary of notable risks or red flags  RenVM and the in-house developed RZL sMPC algorithm that protects the locked assets hold the biggest risk. A flaw in the protocol may lead to loss of assets and greatly harm the Ren project reputation. Ren project does seem to put security in top priority and has undergone several audits, however the RenVM network is relatively young as it has only been active for 6 months on the Ethereum mainnet. With increasing demand of BTC on Ethereum, the RenVM may have difficulties getting to and maintaining the 3 to 1 ratio of bonded value versus locked assets value. This would result in increasing fees or in hindering the Ren project to move the Greycore shard control to the community and transition to a fully trustless, decentralized network. This likely wouldn\u2019t affect the price of renBTC but would affect it\u2019s supply on Ethereum. Current liquidity is mostly available in Curve, a minor fraction also in Uniswap. In case of issues in Curve, keepers and users wanting to trade may need to go through a more lengthy process of redeeming BTC on the Bitcoin network and trading on centralized exchanges. If Ren governance enabled the continuous fee, renBTC would slowly decline in value compared to BTC. This may be problematic if the BTC-USD price oracle is used for determining renBTC price and would need to be adjusted.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 2 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 DAI The risk parameters are somewhat conservative due to increased risk we\u2019re seeing with the RenVM network. The project is fairly young, considering its age on the Ethereum mainnet, and is currently quite far from reaching the secure ratio of 3 to 1 for bonded versus locked value. Without a more healthy ratio we understand it may be difficult for the Ren project to continue on the desired plan to get to a decentralized network and pass the governance of Greycore to the Ren community. Ren project and its community will use the adjustable RenVM fees to improve the bonded versus locked value ratio which may impose additional problems for the Maker vaults if the current BTCUSD price oracle is used. Debt ceiling is suggested to be increased only if there is a more suitable solution implemented that protects BTC custody.

We\u2019d like to add a few comments/clarificatory statements:     jernejml:  During RenVM phases Subzero and Zero (Subzero at time of writing), the Greycore is controlled by the Ren project core team.   The Greycore will be expanded already during the current phase (Subzero), to include other non-team node operators. And by phase Zero, the Greycore will be under the governance of the community, i.e. the node operators and REN holders, who will be able to vote to add/remove Greycore members (https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki/Phases#sub-zero).     jernejml:  The only centralized exchange with renBTC pairs (BTC,ETH) is Huobi.   Binance just recently listed renBTC, which can provide an additional on/off ramp for renBTC (https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/90f83bbf2b504ffa832f1b1436b52c9b).     jernejml:   If Ren governance enabled the continuous fee, renBTC would slowly decline in value compared to BTC. This may be problematic if the BTC-USD price oracle is used for determining renBTC price and would need to be adjusted.    If a continuous fee would be implemented, the BTC-USD price oracle should still be able to be used for renBTC by scaling it by the renBTC:BTC rate. But we also want to highlight that the continuous fee is a tool we would likely consider last as a measure to balance the TVL and the bonded collateral, as it makes the UX for both users and developers/integrators worse.

This is the part I don\u2019t get. I fail to see how the economics of having a bonded value 3x higher than the value of the renBTC can work at scale. If we use WBTC as an example, the value (WBTC market cap) is increasing linearly but the minting/burning volume is quite flat. Therefore fees are stable while the value increase. The yield decreases for dark nodes. At scale, revenues from fees will be quite small compared to the renBTC market cap (and the REN bonded value). So I will expect continuous fee to be used. If you need to lock 3x the value in the network, you can expect fees to be 3x the risk free rate (whatever that is in DeFi, ETH 2.0 yield or stablecoin supply rate on money market) to compensate the capital put to secure the network. Who would pay 3x the risk free rate to have BTC on Ethereum? ",

                    "content": "    SebVentures:  This is the part I don\u2019t get. I fail to see how the economics of having a bonded value 3x higher than the value of the renBTC can work at scale.   I\u2019m happy to go into more depth here, as the economic security of RenVM is straight-forward in some sense but requires looking ahead a bit, and we haven\u2019t been the best at communicating that clearly. To start with some base context:   RenVM is a growing interoperability platform. Currently almost all fees RenVM generates for the nodes come from BTC to and from Ethereum, but more source chains are being added (FIL, LUNA, DGB, etc.), and more host chains are being added (Binance Smart Chain, Acala, Solana etc.). And when host chain to host chain bridges go live, any arbitrary token can move to and from the supported host chains, including DAI and MKR which can go to and from other host chains, making arbitrage and yield farming across chains super easy.   Every renAsset being minted or burned generates fees for the nodes in RenVM. So the more fees being generated, the more capacity RenVM gets to lock up assets, as more fees earned make REN fundamentally worth more, given the limited supply and requirement to bond your REN to run a node.   The increased price of for example BTC should not be a factor in the TVL vs. bonded collateral situation in a sufficiently efficient market, as fees are earned directly in the bridged asset, so if BTC goes 10x the BTC fees for the nodes also go 10x and hence make REN worth more, so the bond collateral worth should follow.   With that said, we can look at renBTC specifically, and your example with wBTC which has an increasing supply while their volume isn\u2019t (I haven\u2019t verified that). There are basically four kinds of behaviors with RenVM that are relevant for the TVL vs. bonded collateral situation:  Assets being minted with an expectation of staying locked for a longer time (increases TVL and increases volume. Example: yield farming) Asset being burned with an expectation of not minting back in the near term (decreases TVL and increases volume. Example: harvesting yields, exiting to fiat) Asset being minted and burned in short time interval (no change for TVL and increases volume. Example: trading, arbitrage, on-ramping for other wrapped versions like wbtc.cafe) Assets moving between host chains (no change for TVL and increases volume)  The business strategy for Ren team is incentivizing and building for behaviors 3 and 4. And Ren governance is for managing behaviors 1 and 2, by increasing the minting fee to disincentivize minting if necessary, and lowering the burning fee (or even giving rebates) to decrease the TVL if necessary. Of course you also need a good amount of supply and hence high TVL to make the other behaviors possible (to fill liquidity pools for trading), so we did not disincentivize minting during the launch of RenVM. But now recently we\u2019ve increased the fees slightly as the TVL shot up quite fast, and we are still building out the ecosystem and integrating with others which takes time. The results from this fee increase has worked as expected as the TVL has been going down from more burning than minting overall, without a drop in fees earned for the nodes. And now with all that said, it should be clear why RenVM was launched as centralized in the beginning, with the Greycore in the team\u2019s control, because without building out the ecosystem you won\u2019t get behaviors 3 and 4, which are important to increase volume and hence capacity for higher TVL. But the plan is to hand over the governance of the Greycore to the community which can vote to remove it eventually, and in the mean time public nodes will be able to participate in signing transactions with the Greycore acting as a second signing group. So the Greycore won\u2019t have the power to do as it wants, letting community nodes keep the Greycore in check, while the Greycore can keep attackers in check by blocking their attempts to steal funds if the attackers got control of >1/3rds of the nodes in a shard.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 110% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Dust: 2000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-DAI-USDC is the Uniswap LP token consisting of DAI and USDC. The pool currently has over $20 million in total deposits, and is the 3rd most liquid DAI pool on Uniswap. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-DAI-USDC tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Per etherscan data, there are 390 total holders of UNI-V2-DAI-USDC, with the top 12 holders comprising over 50% of total liquidity. 1394\u00d7714 120 KB Source: Etherscan Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-DAI-USDC is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. UNI-V2-DAI-USDC is not presently integrated with any defi platforms or lending services. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of DAI stays stable, a decline in the price of USDC will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-DAI-USDC from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in USDC, and additional losses caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-DAI-USDC percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = USDC percentage price change * USDC allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + USDC percentage price change) / (2 + USDC percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * USDC percentage price change)) E.g. if USDC price suffers 20% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.2 * 0.5 = -0.1 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.8) / 1.8) - 1) * (1 - 0.1) = -0.006 UNI-V2-DAI-USDC loss = -0.106 20% drop in USDC price leads to 10.6% drop in UNI-V2-DAI-USDC value, assuming no change in DAI price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between USDC and UNI-V2-USDC price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 47 KB With a proposed liquidation ratio of 110%, USDC would need to fall roughly 18% before vault debt begins exceeding collateral value. This margin of safety exceeds the 1% loss capacity for the existing USDC-A vault type. Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. As both USDC and DAI track 1 USD, LPs in the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC pool bear low risk of divergence loss or other price risk. While fee returns have fluctuated widely, they have generally ranged between 5-15% APY. The chart below shows annualized fee returns based on trailing 7 day average trading volume and liquidity. Chart1200\u00d7742 67.2 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Nov 2020 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Centralization and Custody Risks USDC is issued by Centre, a consortium consisting of Coinbase and Circle that is subject to US and global financial regulations. Centre has the ability to freeze or blacklist addresses due to court orders or other legal requirements. If Centre froze balances in the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC pool, due to the way Uniswap is designed all funds (USDC and DAI) in the pool would be unrecoverable until the freeze had been lifted. This could substantially impair the value of UNI-V2-DAI-USDC, due to inability to redeem tokens for underlying assets. On the other hand, Centre cannot freeze partial balances of addresses, so the decision to freeze the Uniswap pool would impact all pool depositors. This results in somewhat lower risk of blacklisting or freezing versus USDC vaults or PSM, where censorship action could be directly targeted at MakerDAO. USDC is held in US based bank accounts and is audited periodically, and the risk of credit losses or default on USDC is considered low. However, USDC holders would be exposed to any potential losses in underlying fiat funds. Additionally, if redemption activity was curtailed due to operational or regulatory reasons, the price of USDC could trade below $1 even while remaining fully collateralized. Summary of Notable Risks  Technical risk: While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. Collateral that includes DAI such as UNI-V2-DAI-USDC could increase potential losses for DAI holders if emergency shutdown occurred while there was bad debt (negative DAI surplus). If Maker took action that reduced the collateral backing of DAI below $1 (eg. negative interest rates), this may also lead to increased DAI holder losses in an emergency shutdown event. UNI-V2-DAI-USDC is exposed to any potential drop in the price of USDC, although it would face only slightly more than \u00bd as much loss as holding USDC directly. If the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC pool were frozen by the USDC issuers, all funds locked in the pool (DAI and USDC) would be unrecoverable until the freeze is lifted. USDC\u2019s freeze and burn functionality makes this asset vulnerable to censorship or legal/regulatory pressure. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-DAI-USDC. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs (and by extension would reduce borrowing demand from Maker).  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 110% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Dust: 2000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap LP collateral type oracles. Because the risk of UNI-V2-DAI-USDC is primarily from USDC tail risks (centralization, custody, and credit risk), it is not possible to generate appropriate risk parameters from previous price volatility and liquidity data. We have adapted the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide process to suit stablecoin collateral types. Risk parameters were selected to approximately match the existing, community approved USDC-A vault type. The initial risk premium is set lower than the assumed 4% USDC-A risk premium due to lower exposure to potential USDC price declines and less risk of MakerDAO being individually targeted for blacklisting. Similar to existing USDC vault types, liquidations will be disabled for UNI-V2-DAI-USDC, and the protocol will assume constant prices of $1 for both DAI and USDC. For this reason, auction parameters have been omitted. Data for graphics included in this report can be found here.

UNI-V2-USDT-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = ETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETH percentage price change) / (2 + ETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETH percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 UNI-V2-USDT-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in ETH price leads to 29.3% drop in UNI-V2-USDT-ETH value, assuming no change in USDT price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between ETH and UNI-V2-USDT-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 48.1 KB Uniswap v2 has only been live since May, but based on the past 5 years of ETH and USD price history and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-USDT-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than ETH. The largest price drawdown would have been 33%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%. Chart1200\u00d7742 9.57 KB Source: Coinmarketcap, Jan 2021 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings frequently exceeded 200% at some points over the summer, they have dropped substantially in the past few months due to the massive inflow of liquidity. In particular, the UNI distribution incentivized deposits to UNI-V2-USDT-ETH despite relatively low fee returns. With incentives now ended, natural swap fee earnings have begun to increase as excess liquidity leaves the pool. Chart1200\u00d7742 68.6 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Jan 2021 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Credit and Custody Risk Tether, the issuer of USDT, is under legal investigation and has a poor reputation for transparency. The underlying fiat holdings supposedly backing issued USDT have never been subject to audit or attestations from reputable law or accounting firms. If USDT has a deficit of reserves, USDT price could decline substantially and Tether may be unable to process redemption requests. Lack of controls and transparency around USDT minting versus fiat USD holdings also present risk of token minting attacks, where an attacker or insider mints unlimited tokens and then immediately uses them to drain liquidity from exchanges. In the past, Tether has had banking relationships cut off, which resulted in long periods where redemption for USD was impossible. This creates risk of USDT trading below 1 USD, as users are not able to arbitrage the price difference. While Tether has had a relatively stable banking relationship for the past 2 years with Deltec, government actions could potentially inhibit Tether\u2019s ability to process redemptions, even in cases where they have sufficient USD reserves. The chart below shows sharp price falls and increased volatility in 2017 and 2018 when Tether was unable to process redemptions. 1600\u00d7869 92.9 KB Source: Coinmarketcap, Jan 2021 Tether also has the ability to freeze funds and arbitrarily change balances. If Tether froze USDT balances in the UNI-V2-USDT-ETH pool, all balances (USDT and ETH) would be unrecoverable until the freeze was lifted. This could substantially impair the value of the LP token, as they could no longer be redeemed for underlying assets. Because assets of multiple users are pooled within the Uniswap contract, it would not be possible for Tether to specifically target MakerDAO for censorship action, which reduces potential regulatory risk versus holding USDT as collateral directly. The chart below shows USDT blacklisting activity through October 2020. Additional addresses have been restricted since then 800\u00d7384 51.2 KB Source: The Block, October 2020 Based on the high centralization risks of holding assets linked to USDT, this analysis proposes conservative risk premium and liquidation ratio parameters exceeding those set for UNI-V2-DAI-ETH or UNI-V2-USDC-ETH. While UNI-V2-USDT-ETH has lower exposure to USDT price declines (versus holding USDT directly), a total collapse of USDT would still lead to large losses. UNI-V2-USDT-ETH also faces additional risk from decline in ETH price that is not present for USDT-A vault. Summary of Notable Risks  Technical risk: While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-USDT-ETH. UNI-V2-USDT-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if both DAI supply and ETH liquidity contract during a downturn. Tether has poor transparency over operational processes and reserves, and has never proven its solvency with a full audit. If USDT is insufficiently backed, it\u2019s value could experience sharp and sudden drops when this becomes widely known. UNI-V2-USDT-ETH would face only slightly more than \u00bd as much loss as directly holding USDT, but a USDT collapse may also cause ETH price to fall simultaneously. Tether could lose access to banking services, which would make it impossible to create or redeem USDT for fiat (even if Tether had sufficient USD reserves). USDT could experience much greater price volatility if users are unable to keep the price in line through creation and redemption. Tether insiders or successful attackers on Tether could mint large amounts of unbacked tokens, causing losses to USDT holders and draining liquidity from liquidity pools such as UNI-V2-USDT-ETH. Tether could freeze or burn USDT balances due to regulatory or legal pressure (or potentially other reasons per management discretion). If Tether froze the UNI-V2-USDT-ETH pool, all funds including ETH would be unrecoverable until the freeze is lifted.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 2,000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. There is an active signal request to increase the liquidation penalty and minimum bid increment parameters for Uniswap LP vault types, and any changes will be applied to this vault type as well. Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-DAI-USDT is the Uniswap LP token consisting of DAI and USDT. The pool currently has $16 million in total deposits and averages roughly $1 million per day in trading volume. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-DAI-USDT tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-DAI-USDT tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Per etherscan data, there are 199 total holders of UNI-V2-DAI-USDT, with the top 10 holders comprising over 80% of total liquidity. 1600\u00d7699 158 KB Source: Etherscan, Feb 2021 Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-DAI-USDT is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. UNI-V2-DAI-USDT is not currently integrated with any major defi platforms. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of DAI stays stable, a decline in the price of USDT will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-DAI-USDT from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in USDT, and additional losses caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-DAI-USDT percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = USDT percentage price change * USDT allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + USDT percentage price change) / (2 + USDT percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * USDT percentage price change)) E.g. if USDT price suffers 20% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.2 * 0.5 = -0.1 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.8) / 1.8) - 1) * (1 - 0.1) = -0.006 UNI-V2-DAI-USDT loss = -0.106 20% drop in USDT price leads to 10.6% drop in UNI-V2-DAI-USDT value, assuming no change in DAI price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between USDT and UNI-V2-USDT price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 47 KB With a proposed liquidation ratio of 125%, USDT would need to fall roughly 36% before vault debt begins exceeding collateral value. This margin of safety exceeds the 33% loss capacity for the existing USDT-A vault type. Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. As both USDT and DAI track 1 USD, LPs in the UNI-V2-DAI-USDT pool bear low risk of divergence loss or other price risk. While fee returns have fluctuated widely, they have recently been trending downwards towards the 5-10% APY range. The chart below shows annualized fee returns based on trailing 7 day average trading volume and liquidity. Chart1484\u00d7916 84.3 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Feb 2021 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Centralization and Custody Risks USDT is issued by Tether Ltd, a Hong Kong based company closely linked with the Bitfinex exchange. Tether primarily banks with Deltec, a financial institution based in the Bahamas. Despite being non-US based, the US still has legal leverage over USDT by controlling access to wire transfer infrastructure needed for fiat deposits and redemptions. Tether gives very low transparency into reserves backing issued USDT. While it claims to be fully backed, it admitted in legal proceedings to being only 74% backed by cash equivalents at points in the past. It does not provide audited financial statements or detailed breakdowns of reserve composition, only giving a claim of total assets and liabilities and a letter from their attorney. The USDT token contract gives Tether the ability to freeze or arbitrarily alter token balances. Tether has used these powers relatively frequently over the past year, with dozens of addresses frozen or seized. In a notable recent case, funds hacked from the Yearn yDAI vault were seized by Tether. The risk of seizure should be lower than the USDT-A vault due to the distributed nature of pool ownership among multiple parties. Summary of Notable Risks  Technical risk: While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. Collateral that includes DAI such as UNI-V2-DAI-USDT could increase potential losses for DAI holders if emergency shutdown occurred while there was bad debt (negative DAI surplus). If Maker took action that reduced the collateral backing of DAI below $1 (eg. negative interest rates), this may also lead to increased DAI holder losses in an emergency shutdown event. UNI-V2-DAI-USDT is exposed to any potential drop in the price of USDT, although it would face only slightly more than \u00bd as much loss as holding USDT directly. Tether is not transparent about their reserves. If the reserves fall in value or are insufficient to cover redemption requests, the price of USDT could fall precipitously. Tether could have its banking services restricted due to commercial or regulatory reasons. This could interfere with redemptions and cause price drops, even if Tether had funds available to meet the redemption requests. If the UNI-V2-DAI-USDT pool were frozen by the Tether issuers, all funds locked in the pool (DAI and USDT) would be unrecoverable until the freeze is lifted. Tether\u2019s freeze and burn functionality makes this asset vulnerable to censorship or legal/regulatory pressure. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-DAI-USDT. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs (and by extension would reduce borrowing demand from Maker).  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 2,000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. There is an active signal request to increase the liquidation penalty and minimum bid increment parameters for Uniswap LP vault types, and any changes will be applied to this vault type as well. Because the risk of UNI-V2-DAI-USDT is primarily from USDT tail risks (centralization, custody, and credit risk), it is not possible to generate appropriate risk parameters from previous price volatility and liquidity data. We have adapted the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide process to suit stablecoin collateral types. Risk parameters were selected to approximately match the existing, community approved USDT-A vault type. The initial risk premium is set lower than the assumed 8% USDT-A risk premium due to lower exposure to potential USDT price declines, and less risk of MakerDAO being individually targeted for freezes or seizure.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 1 million Auction Lot Size: 200,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 20 Dai Outline  Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Overview Protocol Summary From the whitepaper: \u201cAave is an open source lending protocol that provides a friendly user experience for anyone to deposit and borrow cryptographic assets. Deposit allows you to earn passive income based on your holdings. Borrow allows you to unlock liquidity without being required to sell your assets. The birth of the Aave Protocol marks Aave\u2019s shift from a decentralized P2P lending strategy (direct loan relationship between lenders and borrowers, like in ETHLend) to a pool-based strategy. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing a collateral. Aave Protocol officially launched on the Ethereum blockchain on 9 January 2020, offering instant-access \u2018flash loans\u2019 to users without the need for collateral. The predecessor to Aave Protocol was ETHLend which launched in 2017 after raising $16m in an ICO.\u201d LEND Token Value Accrual From the website: The platform has 2 types of fees. Borrowers pay 0.25% of the loan amount during origination, of which 20% is used for referrals and 80% is swapped to the LEND token and burned. For flash loans, a 0.09% fee is collected from the loan amount, of which 70% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 30% is split using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee. Additional transaction fees related to Ethereum blockchain usage are assessed based on network status and transaction complexity. LEND Token v2 From Delphi Digital: \u201cLast but not least, they will be updating their token economics and moving from a token burn model to a fee accrual model (something we\u2019ve extensively covered in the past as an option other protocols should consider). While the exact details aren\u2019t out yet, their token (LEND) will be used for staking. Stakers will earn issuance rewards and fees in return for backstopping the risk of the protocol losing funds.This may be ringing some bells for you. This is similar to the MakerDAO model, where MKR is minted in case the protocol becomes insolvent.\u201d Governance function The protocol is governed through AragonDAO, but currently only the team has voting rights. These rights entail the changing of parameters such as rates, emergency pause and collateral onboarding. On the Aave discord the team is suggesting an upgrade to a new governance model this year, where LEND token holders will be able to make decisions on the DAO and its risk parameters. Metrics and Analysis LEND Token Metrics Daily Active Addresses Active address count began to rise in April this year when the Aave protocol started to gain traction. Currently there are around 400 daily active addresses, an uptick likely caused by the recent price performance of the token. Note that LEND tokens are not required to take a loan or make a deposit on the Aave platform. Source: Saniment1600\u00d7648 119 KB Token velocity Token velocity measured about 1 throughout the first few months of this year (through the Aave protocol launch), but increased in May when the LEND price experienced significant increase in activity. Some of the recent excitement is also associated with speculation that Coinbase might list LEND in their next batch of new listings. 1600\u00d7654 174 KB Source: Santiment Daily Onchain Transaction Volume (denominated in LEND) Again, higher transaction volumes in recent months correspond to the price increase. There is between 10m and 30m LEND transacted daily, which is about 1.5% of total LEND supply. 1600\u00d7657 142 KB Source: Santiment Daily New Addresses New LEND address counts are increasing at a rapid pace, especially during the month of June when more than 100 new addresses were added daily. This explains the huge price increase as new investors discovered LEND as part of the general sentiment shift toward DeFi tokens. 1600\u00d7646 169 KB Source: Santiment Token distribution, return & inflation metrics The LEND token contract has a limited supply of 1,300,000,000 tokens. According to Coinmarket cap, all of the tokens supplied are circulating and team tokens have already been vested. Note that this token has been in existence since November 2017. The returns over the last two years (and particularly this year) have been impressive but might contribute to a larger downside risk. Compared to recent token analyses we did for ZRX and KNC, this project doesn\u2019t have as many tokens supplied on exchanges (only one third of supply), as there is only one larger exchange currently supporting it (Binance). On the other hand, one third of supply is locked in the Aave protocol itself as collateral to borrow funds and presents contagion risks (addressed later). Note also that more than 75% of tokens supplied were acquired in the last year (see seniority distribution below) when the price increased between 400% and 700%, which means the P&L of those holders is high and a sudden drop in token value may force aggressive profit taking. We have witnessed a similar sharp drop of the token price on Black Thursday, when LEND fell in value by more than 60% and had one of most severe drops relative to other tokens analyzed by our team.     token supply 1,298,253,016        circulating supply 1,298,253,016 100.00%     LEND burnt 1,814,675      price 0.094      market cap 122,177,293      implied market cap 122,177,293              returns LEND $ price tokens circulating inflation since   3m 443.29% 0.017322 1,299,364,505 -0.086%   6m 334.26% 0.021671 1,128,353,504 15.06%   1y 790.34% 0.01057 1,115,377,294 16.40%   2y 189.99% 0.032452 1,086,433,933 19.50%    Source: Etherscan & Coinmarketcap 1600\u00d7616 175 KB Source: Etherscan 1392\u00d7892 67.2 KB Source: Nansen Treasury funds The team may have already diversified its ETH treasury and converted into fiat. It is hard to estimate current holdings in fiat, but a large chunk of ETH was likely sold in the period between December 2017 and February 2018. The team did an ICO in November 2017 when it raised approximately $16m. Assuming a decrease in the ETH treasury corresponds to conversion to USD on the same day, the Aave team has potentially managed to convert their initially raised $16m to about $24m. 1600\u00d7699 151 KB Source: Etherscan Tokens on Exchanges About 36% of circulating supply is held on exchanges. Of that amount, Binance represents more than 90% of the tokens held on exchanges, which represents a high risk. Some of the figures below may also indicate inaccurate or inflated LEND volumes. On the other hand, this token doesn\u2019t appear to be washtraded very much on other exchanges. Volumes reported on CMC from exchanges that are typically known to produce washtrading don\u2019t appear to be inflated.

Aave\u2019s ability to grow quickly and stay competitive with Compound was due to aggressive policies such as including additional collateral assets in the protocol, setting competitive rates and enabling unique products such as flash loans, Uniswap LP collateral and stable rates. 941\u00d7786 51.6 KB Source: DeBank Unique Lenders The daily unique lenders metric measures about 250 and is in an upward trend. 1273\u00d7399 30.8 KB Source: Dune Analytics Origination Fees The Aave protocol primarily generates revenue through origination fees, which corresponds to steady borrow volume growth. 1264\u00d7399 33.3 KB Source: Dune Analytics Fees burnt Apart from origination fees, the protocol also generates some revenue from flash loan fees. These fees, however, represent less than 5% of the total. All fees are then used to burn LEND tokens, and so far about 2m LEND tokens are supposedly burnt (or queued up to be), covering the 6m period since the protocol has been live. This represents only 0.15% of the total supply and puts the APY of LEND at 0.3%. Note however, that this metric is somewhat downward biased since it includes the smaller borrowing activity of the first few months (compared to the current state). 887\u00d7610 41 KB Source: https://burn.aave.com/ Liquidity breakdown As seen below, Aave collects fees from two kinds of markets: Aave market and Uniswap market, where Uniswap LP shares are provided as collateral. Most of the fees collected are represented by Aave market variable rate borrowing, where total originated fees amount to $118k and out of this $88k was collected so far. 1177\u00d7352 43.9 KB Source: https://aavewatch.now.sh/ Flash loans Flash loans are the unique feature that put Aave on the DeFi map earlier this year. More than 3.6m DAI has been flash loaned already. Although this service isn\u2019t producing a very high amount of fees for the protocol, it has become an important feature for integrated service providers such as DeFi Saver which uses flash loans to build leverage on MakerDAO or perform collateral swaps with higher liquidity and capital efficiency. 920\u00d7642 41.4 KB Source: https://aavewatch.now.sh/ Lending Activity As we would expect, most of the borrow volume is associated with stablecoins such as USDC, USDT and DAI. 1600\u00d71223 400 KB Source: Our Network Newsletter Fee repayments The ability to collect fees is quite important and Aave has been quite successful in this. Only the USDC collateral type has more pending fees than collected. 1088\u00d71154 62.5 KB Source: Our Network Newsletter LEND supply on Aave Roughly 45% ($75m out of $167m) of the total supplied collateral on Aave are LEND tokens. Protocol tokens typically are not the most robust collateral and represent a risk, although we note that the collateral factor is set to a conservative 40% LTV. We analyzed the top 3 LEND suppliers who represent 80% of the LEND collateral to assess how much debt was issued against it. The largest supplier represents 60% of the LEND supply pool ($45m of LEND supplied) and borrowed ~$5m of other assets. Even though collateralization levels are fairly high, the debt borrowed by these three entities amounts to $7.9m which is about one third of total borrows on Aave. On the other hand, these entities also supply other assets and don\u2019t appear to be solely monetizing their large LEND holdings that might be harder to sell on the market.

In May 2020, prior to the release of the Uniswap Market, Consensys Diligence audited Aave\u2019s Constant Product Market Price Provider (CPMPP) Component.   Bug bounties up to $250k https://aave.com/bug-bounty  Admin keys: Team\u2019s multi-sig have access to admin keys which can perform change of parameters including pause function. Legal status: Due to lack of relevant expertise, we choose to omit any legal risk analysis surrounding either the protocol or the token. However, we encourage the community to incorporate this risk into the risk management process accordingly. Oracles:  From the website: First checking for a price from a Chainlink aggregator.  If the price is below or equal to zero, we call our fallback price oracle. The fallback price oracle is currently maintained by the Aave team.     In the future, Aave governance mechanisms will manage the selection of sources and the fallback price oracle. Risk Framework:  Risk Framework addresses mostly if the asset is included as collateral to borrow on top and what kind of LTV and liquidation penalty is used. Approach used is very simplified but transparent: https://docs.aave.com/risk/     Summary of Notable Risks:  More than 90% of the CEX volume is on Binance. DEX volume is improving, but still far behind CEX (even using recent daily traded record figures of $300k, it is still low compared to Binance\u2019s recent average of $2m) We are unaware of a new governance mechanism that is to be announced soon according to their team. Further there are rumors of a v2 that will launch sometime this year which might have similar token economics as MKR. General risks with secondary lenders where aggressive policy of adding new collateral is performed and lack of instruments to limit exposure (no debt ceiling, for example). There are also risks known to secondary lending venues such as bank runs and the inability to redeem supplied funds. Aave has been an innovator in the DeFi space with the addition of unique collateral types and flash loans, but unfortunately this means risk management has increased in complexity. Further, secondary platforms don\u2019t have an insurance buffer attached. Although this actually means LEND tokens don\u2019t have to worry about dilution, if they suffer a loss they could lose users\u2019 trust. Contagion risk is quite severe as the LEND token is itself used as collateral. In case LEND tokens might one day get used as insurance against losses, they shouldn\u2019t be part of the collateral pool. Furthermore, the top 3 LEND suppliers to Aave represent about one third of all borrows. The current speculation surrounding DeFi is making DeFi tokens overvalued in relation to their fundamentals. For instance, Aave was able to collect approximately $100k in fees this year, but the token\u2019s market cap is ~$160m. Hence, downside risk is very high accompanied by a large number of token holders that acquired LEND in the last year and made huge returns. We have evidence from Black Thursday that the asset is prone to large dumps in volatile market events (dropped more than 60%).  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 1 million Auction Lot Size: 200,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 20 Dai We use the model described from the governance call here: a credit risk model that estimates the loss distribution of a portfolio of LEND Vaults. Risk parameters are estimated from this hypothetical loss distribution. Inputs to the model are derived from trading data along with stressed input parameters. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for ETH, with the exception of the lot size that has been normalized to a ~$30,000 amount Despite simulating for a 3 - 5m debt ceiling, we are instead proposing a 1m debt ceiling due to the concentrated oracle risk. When LEND is listed on additional reputable exchanges, we will recommend to the governance community that they raise the debt ceiling to 3 million.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 12% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 1 million Auction Lot Size: 500,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 20 Dai Outline  Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Overview Protocol Summary Decentraland is a protocol for a virtual world where users can create virtual content, purchase virtual real estate, and engage in other simulation-based activities. The protocol has two main tokens; an ERC-20 token called MANA and a non-fungible ERC-721 token called LAND. MANA is a currency for Decentraland-related assets such as real estate and vanity items inside their simulated world known as the Metaverse. MANA is also a voting token in their DAO (described below). LAND tokens are another component and represent real estate inside the game. After several years in development, Decentraland launched their platform in February 2020, where they also started the process of transferring admin controls over to the DAO. MANA Token Value Accrual In addition to being used as a voting token and a currency for Decentraland assets, MANA has a burn function. The three largest token burning events in the past have been two LAND auctions and the establishment of the DAO. Additionally, MANA token holders can vote to adjust various parameters such as the burn fee applied for each trade of Decentraland non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Other governance actions include the whitelisting of NFTs inside the protocol. Decentralization & Governance The MANA token can be used for voting in a DAO that was established along with the launch of the Metaverse in Feb 2020. As part of this DAO token holders can vote on future LAND auctions, whitelist NFTs, and more. The DAO is supported by the Security Advisory Board (SAB), which acts as a guarantor for contract security. The SAB was established for dark bug fixes in smart contracts. Initially the SAB has five members picked by the Decentraland team that can upgrade the LAND and Estate contracts, requiring at least three signatures with no votes against. The members of the SAB can be changed by the DAO. The DAO will also be supported by the Decentraland Foundation, an independent non-profit organization that holds Decentraland\u2019s intellectual property, domains, repositories, social media accounts and other assets. The DAO and the Decentraland Foundation were allocated 222m MANA each, which vest over 10 years and will serve as financing for community related operations. The Metaverse is hosted on a network of independent nodes called Catalyst. Initially, host nodes were selected amongst reputable community members, but the DAO has the authority to alter the list. Catalyst ensures constant uptime of the Metaverse. Metrics and Analysis MANA Token metrics Daily Active Addresses Daily active addresses have typically been highly correlated with the price action of MANA. There was initially a lot of activity during the 2017/18 speculation around its ICO, before going through a relatively inactive period in the post-ICO era. Recently, as a result of the Metaverse launch in Feb 2020, there has been a resurgence in daily active addresses, suggesting that the product launch has garnered traction. 1564\u00d7435 56.2 KB Daily active addresses, since inception; Source: Santiment Daily New Addresses New address growth has been in sync with daily active addresses, implying that a significant amount of network activity is that of new users. The launch of the Metaverse appears to have attracted many new accounts. 1244\u00d7435 48.7 KB Daily new addresses, ICO distribution not included; Source: Santiment Daily Onchain Transaction Volume (denominated in MANA) Onchain transaction volume resembles other network metrics. Activity has mainly been clustered around the ICO era and the recent launch of the Metaverse. Increased transaction volume may suggest an organic increase in demand for the product (or is merely related to the price increase). 1564\u00d7435 55.4 KB Daily onchain transaction volume, since inception; Source: Santiment Token distribution, return & inflation metrics   The Decentraland team conducted an oversubscribed ICO in August 2017, where all available tokens were sold in one hour, raising approximately 68.2k ether or $25m.   With the launch of the Metaverse and establishment of the DAO, the Decentraland team and other vested entities have begun a 10 year vesting period for their tokens.   Out of the 609.3m tokens burned thus far, only 5.3m are due to fees. Approximately 54.6% of the burned amount is due to a decision to burn 333m MANA with the launch of the Metaverse. The remaining tokens were burned during two LAND auctions, which suggests that the primary driver for token burn is increased supply of LAND.

Approximately 530m MANA or 37% of the circulating supply is currently being held by exchanges, of which 55% is on Binance. Strangely, trading volumes on exchanges do not reflect deposits proportionately; the vast majority of real trading volume occurs on Binance, while other exchanges like Bittrex have extremely low trading volumes. This may suggest that many users who accumulated MANA in the past are essentially using the exchange as a custodial service, and likely exhibit very low interest in the platform or the virtual world itself. Chart1200\u00d7742 18.8 KB Source of data: Nansen-d5 In the seniority distribution we can see that token holders accumulated approximately 25% of the supply around the ICO and immediate exchange listings. Fifteen percent was acquired in the post-ICO era and 50% in recent months. The address distribution between these three groups is fairly equal, making it difficult to determine if accumulation was retail or institutional driven (typically recent large acquisitions amongst few addresses would imply institutional interest). Note that this metric can be significantly skewed by exchanges moving token deposits between their custody accounts. 889\u00d7501 18.3 KB Source: Nansen-d5 Trading Data - CEX volume Trading activity on custodial exchanges is atypical and does not reflect proportional deposits on respective exchanges. The large majority of trading activity occurs on Binance, suggesting that tokens on exchanges like Bittrex, Bitfinex and Poloniex have been sitting idle since the ICO era. We have decided to omit OKEx trading volume due to reported volume being significantly higher than their deposits would otherwise suggest (compared to similar exchanges such as Huobi). Trading volumes are insignificant on platforms other than Binance and Coinbase. Chart1545\u00d7955 68.5 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare As seen below, Coinbase listed MANA much later than Binance, who has been consistently leading MANA trading volume market share.Chart1454\u00d7898 54.6 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare Trading Data - DEX volume Trading activity on non-custodial exchanges is very low and suggests that the Decentraland community is not primarily interested in financial services. Kyber has shown the most activity in recent weeks. Shortly after Balancer launched, we noticed an ENJ, MANA and ETH market which, at the time, didn\u2019t have any recorded trading volume and currently does not exist anymore.  Source of data: Uniswap.info, 0x Tracker, Kyber Tracker, Pools.fyi Volatility  Source of data: CryptoCompare Downside Risk MANA has a significantly higher count of negative daily returns compared to ether, especially at ranges between -20% and -40%. This suggests MANA vaults are expected to be liquidated more often than those collateralized with ether under the same circumstances and user behaviour. Chart1200\u00d7742 28.7 KB Source of data: CoinMarketCap Current presence in leverage and lending platforms The only leverage or lending platform that currently supports MANA tokens is Aave, with ~$163k supplied and ~$16k borrowed. There is no sign of significant demand for MANA on lending platforms, which is to be expected given that MANA is not in the financial sector and that the user base is probably focused on other sectors like gaming and VR. Decentraland Specific Metrics  The first LAND auction known as the Terraform Event took place from Dec 2017 - Jan 2018, where 34,356 LAND parcels were sold for 161,483,050 MANA. The highest parcel reached 582k MANA, whereas many of the available parcels were sold for the starting price of 1k MANA. The second LAND auction took place in Dec 2018 where 9,331 parcels were sold for 109,521,854 MANA. This sale was conducted as a dutch auction, where the median price amounted to 12,122 MANA and the most expensive parcels sold for ~30k MANA. During the second auction the Decentraland team decided to spend 15m MANA from the community fund in order to acquire a large chunk of LAND.  Daily trading volume and number of daily trades Below we can see the trading dynamics for LAND on the secondary market. The LAND market experienced increased demand during the second LAND auction in Dec 2018. A second notable increase in demand occurred in Feb 2020 with the launch of the Metaverse, but quickly contracted towards its mean value. Over time, neither the number of trades nor LAND value sustained an increase in activity. 1155\u00d7390 47.7 KB Source; Nonfungible Summary of Notable Risks  The vast majority of CEX trading activity occurs on one exchange (Binance). Some exchanges with relatively large token deposits show very little trading volume. These are likely holders that acquired the tokens during the 2017/18 era. The inactivity may suggest that they are not actively following development of the project and are more interested in price speculation (i.e., no strong sentiment or usage base). Approximately 37% of the circulating supply is deposited on CEX platforms (of which 55% is on Binance). This represents a significant exchange risk. Additionally, the new governance mechanism increases incentive distortions as well. DEX volume and the general presence of MANA in DeFi applications is very low, suggesting that the Decentraland community is not very close to the DeFi ecosystem. Due to the low crowdsale token allocation during ICO (40%), large amounts of tokens are yet to be released into circulation. This could offset any deflation due to the burn mechanism. Competition in the space is high (for example, Cryptovoxels). Additionally, blockchain gaming has been a difficult sector in which to achieve product market fit.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 3 million Auction Lot Size: 200,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 20 Dai Overview Protocol Summary From the documentation: \u201cLoopring is a decentralized token exchange protocol. It is implemented as an ethereum smart-contract at the core of the loopring decentralized exchange system. Its design allows for several improvements over traditional centralized exchanges:  Reduced Counterparty & Exchange Risk: Removing the risk of depositing and storing digital assets on a third party exchange and tokens are never locked by orders. High liquidity: Orders are ring-matched allowing for high liquidity on any trading pair. Fairness: The fee & discount model allows for fairness between all parties involved (Makers, Takers and Miners). Weak Supervision: The whole system is completely decentralised\u201d  From Formal Verification: \u201cLoopring is an open protocol used for building scalable order book based DEXs on Ethereum using zk-Rollup constructions. The DEXs themselves are non-custodial but are each maintained by a single (or set of) operator(s) that batch several transactions together. zk-SNARK proofs are created to prove that all transactions are legitimate which are verified off-chain and then uploaded to the Ethereum mainnet. The goal is to provide a scalable but secure DEX infrastructure on using layer 2 that can lower the on-chain costs requirements.\u201d LRC Token Value Accrual From the blog: LRC Staking for Protocol Fees (Type 1)  70% will be rewarded to LRC stakers  20% will go to the Loopring DAO (to be built) 10% will be burned.  \"Until our DAO is live, the 20% allotted for it will either go to LRC stakers or be burned.\u201d The team\u2019s expectation is to burn 10 to 25 million LRC by the end of 2020, which represents 0.7% to 1.8% of LRC supply. Until the DAO is live, the 20% fees will be allocated to either LRC stakers or be burned. LRC Staking by DEXes for Economic Security (Type 2) \u201cIn addition to staking for the protocol fee distribution, LRC is also used by DEX owners as a bond for economic security. The locked LRC is partially or completely slashed when a DEX violates protocol rules, such as failing to submit a proof for a committed block on time, or having a reversion. Note, this economic security is only \u2018in play\u2019 until the zkSNARKs are submitted, which provides final, cryptographic proof. (See here for a list of protocol parameters / slashing costs.) The amount of staked LRC thus reflects a DEX\u2019s likelihood or disincentive to violating protocol rules. The more LRC locked, the more reliable a DEX should be. Of course, this reliability relates to service performance / execution guarantees \u2014 user funds are 100% Ethereum-level secured by the protocol. It is hard to estimate at this time how much LRC will be slashed from this mechanism.\u201d There are currently two exchanges (that we are aware of) built using Loopring smart contracts: Loopring.io and WeDEX. Exchanges need to stake 500k LRC for economic security. Note that this stake doesn\u2019t reflect user funds at risk, but rather reliability of service. LRC Staking for Protocol Fee Reductions (Type 3) \u201cThe final type of LRC staking is for lowering the protocol fees on a specific DEX. This LRC would be staked by exchange owners, market makers and high-frequency traders, to realize reduced protocol fees on said venue. While it is exchange owners who need to pay protocol fees for all orders to settle, other stakeholders/users of a DEX would be incentivized to stake there if it meant protocol fee reduction was passed through via lower trading fees. We envision that via staking types 2 & 3, exchanges and market makers will lock in no less than 50 million LRC by the end of 2020.\u201d Loopring Exchange From Formal Verification Research: \u201cThe Loopring exchange was launched in February with the goal of being an established DEX built on the Loopring protocol. Specifically, it is a non-custodial exchange that uses a centralised relayer who is responsible in batching transactions, producing a verifiable zk-SNARK proof which can be verified off-chain and then put on the Ethereum mainnet. Maker and taker fees are 0% and 0.10% respectively. The bottom line is operators can censor trades if they choose to but it is not in their economic interest to: all exchanges have to stake LRC and this stake can be burned if the operator doesn\u2019t play by the rules. The Loopring exchange doesn\u2019t behave like a \u2018pure\u2019 DEX for end users - deposits and withdrawals are maintained by the DEX operator too which can sometimes take ~20 minutes to complete. While leaving a lot to be desired, these deposit and withdrawal times are dependent on prover optimisations which should improve in time.\u201d Metrics and Analysis LRC Token Metrics Daily Active Addresses Active address count began to rise in April this year after the Loopring Exchange was introduced in March. Currently there are around 300 daily active addresses, an uptick likely caused by the recent price performance of the token. 1600\u00d7741 119 KB Source: Saniment Daily Onchain Transaction Volume (denominated in LRC) Again, higher transaction volumes in recent months correspond to the price increase.

Users can send ETH and ERC20 tokens instantly on second layer. If this service gains traction we could see increased usage of Loopring Exchange.   loopring.io    Loopring Exchange (DEX) Ethereum's first zkRollup decentralized exchange.      Staking As mentioned above, the token has 3 main functions:  Economic security and reputation for DEXes built on top of the Loopring protocol Value accrual that gives stakers 70% of protocol fees (0.06% of trading volume) from all exchanges Fee discount for exchanges owners. Importantly, protocols fees are abstracted away from traders, and exchange operators normally take on this cost.  Currently, there are 160m LRC staked in the staking pool contract which represents 12% of the total token supply. According to Formal Verification: \u201cThe bulk of this supply that is locked has come from the Loopring team themselves who staked the team supply allocation (34.8m) as well as the developer funds (24.5m) which totalled to more than 108m LRC being staked. They also plan to stake the 20% team supply (1/24th vested monthly starting October 2019). While this means the team is aligned to developing the protocol and the Loopring exchange, other stakers in the pool have been effectively pushed out.\u201d 1442\u00d7778 131 KB Source: Formal Verification Importantly, the staking figures of LRC are well above 0x project, where only 2% of ZRX tokens are staked. Also note that stakers aren\u2019t able to withdraw their LRC for 90 days. 1448\u00d7754 98.4 KB Source: Formal Verification Liquidity Mining The Loopring team is offering a liquidity mining program to earn LRC, but rewards measure only about 6,000 USDT for providing liquidity for LRC-USDT and ETH-USDT. This is not competitive with liquidity mining incentives offered at other protocols in the space. Miscellaneous  Security: Audits from November 2019 Governance: There are plans for a LoopringDAO where token holders will control all on-chain configurable parameters. Currently the team has admin keys, with a delay contract in force. Oracles: LRC price data on Loopring Exchange is sourced from Chainlink, but DEX owners must stake LRC as a form of \u201cservice level guarantee\u201d.  Summary of Notable Risks:  The majority of CEX volume is on Binance since Okex volumes are likely inflated due to wash trading. Gate.io also doesn\u2019t have significant volume. AMM-style DEXes are currently the most utilized in the space due to smoother user experience and passive fees for liquidity providers. Order book DEXes are likely used more by advanced traders, but network fees diminish their utility. It remains to be seen if second layer solutions such as Loopring can attract enough volume to remain viable. DEX volume of LRC tokens is improving, but still lags behind CEX. Critically, most of the DEX volume occurs on Loopring Exchange, which creates composability issues for Maker keepers. Admin keys are held by the team, and it is not known when the DAO will be established. Low generated protocol fees compared to competitors such as Uniswap, Kyber and 0x. This is due to low Loopring Exchange volumes. New APIs and trading bots released by the team may address these issues. zkRollups are still in their infancy. There are technological/code risks associated with the protocol that are unknown at this stage.

Overview Metrics and Analysis Proposed Actions  Overview Protocol Summary tBTC protocol was created to provide a safe way for people to use Bitcoin on Ethereum and offers a trust-minimized, permissionless, decentralized solution for doing so. It is an open source project, available on GitHub, developed and maintained mainly by three groups - Keep, Summa, and the Cross Chain Group. The Keep project and tBTC in general is supported by Thesis, a company backed by several venture capital firms. Besides the tBTC smart contracts, the protocol also leverages on other modules/projects for its operation and security, notably:  Keep Random Beacon for random selection of signers for each deposit. Summa relay for simplified payment verification (SPV) on the Bitcoin chain. MakerDAO price oracles for providing real time deposit's collateral evaluation.  TBTC is the ERC20 token minted through the tBTC protocol. For consistency between this risk evaluation and the official tBTC documentation we will use \"tBTC\" when referring to the protocol in its entirety, and \"TBTC\" when referring to the ERC20 token on Ethereum. tBTC strives to keep TBTC 1-to-1 redeemable for BTC by supply. This means for every TBTC in circulation or available for minting there's one BTC locked in the protocol. This is referred to as a supply peg. On a high level, the mechanics are similar to Maker as it's using overcollateralized bonding with ETH to achieve security and incentivize good behaviour. It uses liquidation mechanics to punish fraud, abort or to prevent under-collateralization. Tokenomics Since the tBTC system is open source, decentralized and trustless (or rather trust-minimized as noted in the tBTC documentation) it relies on fees to incentivize participation. A high level overview of the minting and redeeming process is well described in tBTC security model page: Minting 1 TBTC:  A bonded ECDSA keep is requested from the Keep network to sign for 1 BTC. A signer group forms and puts down 150% the value of 1 BTC in ETH as collateral. The signer group generates a Bitcoin wallet using a threshold ECDSA protocol. The user sends 1 BTC to the generated Bitcoin wallet. The user generates an SPV proof of their deposit transaction, and sends it to the Ethereum chain. The user mints TBTC.  Redeeming 1 TBTC:  User burns TBTC and provides a receiving Bitcoin address to begin redemption. The signer group generates and publishes a signature for a Bitcoin transaction to send the Bitcoin to the user's requested Bitcoin address. The user broadcasts this transaction and the generated signature to the Bitcoin network. The signers generate an SPV proof of this transaction, publish it to the Ethereum chain, and receive their bonds back.  The signer fees are paid on redemption and are currently set at 0.05%, configurable between 0.05% and 10%. The system is also limited to a configurable number of lot sizes that can be used; currently available lot sizes are 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 BTC. While at a high level, minting and redeeming looks fairly straightforward, the specifics of the tBTC system are quite complex. We will mention a few of these specifics but won't cover all scenarios as it would get quite unwieldy and is outside the scope of this evaluation. See tBTC technical specification for more details.  Each deposit has a term duration of 180 days and has different rules governing it in the before-term phase and at-term phase. This is mainly meant to ensure that the signer group is able to close the deposit, get the signer fees and release their bonds. Minting TBTC from the deposit will send 99.95% of the lot size to the minter (TDT owner) and 0.05% TBTC of lot size to the deposit contract. This is the escrowed signer fees. tBTC uses NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to determine deposit ownership and rights to the escrowed signer fees. The tBTC Deposit Token, or TDT, is an NFT and grants ownership over the deposit which can be used for minting TBTC or redeeming the locked BTC. The Fee Rebate Token, or FRT, again an NFT, is used to determine ownership over the escrowed fees. Both tokens rights vary depending on the deposit before- or at-term phase, whether the deposit is in liquidation due to undercollaterlization, and other scenarios. The main purposes of both tokens are to ensure signers are paid and to uphold the TBTC:BTC supply peg. 3 signers and one user are required for each successful deposit. Bad behaviour, fraud or an attack on a deposit should generally only affect the parties involved and only up to the lot size plus bonds of the deposit. A deposit moves to \"courtesy call\" state if collateralization falls below 125%. Anyone is able to start the redemption process in this state and if the deposit is not redeemed within 6 hours, or regains the required collateralization ratio, the deposit moves to the \"liquidation\" state. Bad behaviour or collateralization issues (ratio under 110% or 6 hours after courtesy call) will trigger the deposit to start liquidation. In this state the signers ETH bond is used in a falling price auction to buy TBTC and compensate the deposit owner. This is required for user/depositor protection and to uphold the supply peg. Signers can't rebalance their collateralization. If the collateralization falls below 125% they're advised to close their positions by redeeming the TBTC. A minimum of 70,000 KEEP tokens (currently worth ~$19,600) needs to be staked to start up your own Keep network Random Beacon and become a signer. This is in addition to ETH bonding. The Keep team is planning to enable ETH-only staking in the near future.  Sample deposit that closed with redeeming: https://allthekeeps.com/deposit/0x6c832498fbe83c128699c5914cf69e4a50b14657 Sample deposit that closed with liquidation: https://allthekeeps.com/deposit/0x96c8b0e452833ad6c9709c073ec7f04763f748b6 The tBTC community participation and development is rewarded with an initiative called \"Playing for Keeps\" where community members are rewarded with KEEP tokens, depending on the size of their contribution. The winners are determined by community judges. KEEP is the native token to the Keep network and is purposed for powering the Keep network and supporting the apps built around it. tBTC launched on Ethereum mainnet in mid May 2020 but was soon shut down due to a bug found in code. The team relaunched tBTC on Sep 22, 2020. tBTC governance As noted in the tBTC security model: \"The first version of tBTC has been built without any ability to upgrade contracts, following a Bitcoin-inspired philosophy of immutability and opt-in governance. Any future versions of tBTC will be new systems, and require social coordination to \"upgrade\", similar to how a hard fork on Bitcoin.\" \"Still, the development team maintains a privileged key with 4 distinct capabilities at launch. These capabilities only apply to new deposits, preventing the team from interfering with existing deposits or long-held funds.\" The mentioned team governance capabilities are:  Updating the signer fee. Would only impact new deposits and is limited between 0.05% to 10% Changing list of lot sizes. Would only impact new deposits and has a time delay. At least 1 lot size required and lot size is limited between 0.0005 and 10 BTC. Modifying collateralization threshold. Only new deposits with a time delay. Limited between 100 and 300% Adding a fallback price feed. Would only come in effect if the original price feed fails. Price feeds are queried in order they were added and the first with a price response is used. Pausing new deposits. This is a 10-days pause of new deposits, without a time delay. It can only be used once in the lifetime of a single tBTC version. Meant for 0-day exploits or issues. Note that this was used in the first launch of tBTC in May 2020. As understood by the researchers of this evaluation the tBTC version released in September has not yet \"consumed\" this system wide pause switch. After 6 months live on mainnet without incidents this emergency pause is deactivated and can no longer be used.  On-chain fundamentals A community developed stats site indicates that 8,423.06 TBTC has been burned until today (9 Dec 2020). As signers receive the signer fees upon burning TBTC and releasing the locked BTC we may estimate a total of 4.2 TBTC in generated fees (which would today amount to ~$76,956) generated by the protocol. A total of 683 wallets or contracts are currently holding TBTC, most of which is locked in the Curve liquidity pool contract (~82%): TBTC_Token_Holders975\u00d7429 72.1 KB Metrics and analysis CEX and DEX volume Compared to other tokens, TBTC is seeing little volume on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, which is reasonable considering the short time it's been available on the Ethereum mainnet. At the moment Hotbit and Kraken are the only centralized exchanges trading TBTC, pairing it with BTC, USD, ETH and EUR. Here's the Kraken TBTC EUR and USD pairs volume since listing. TBTC_Kraken975\u00d7688 47.6 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare The biggest volume on the decentralized side is on Curve, with Balancer, Uniswap V2, 0x and Sushiswap lagging behind. Here's Curve and Uniswap TBTC volume for comparison: TBTC_DEX975\u00d7715 50.3 KB Source of data: Uniswap V2 Subgraph, Curve.fi Holder distribution Since the relaunch on 22 Sep 2020, the number of wallets holding TBTC is steadily increasing. There's currently one EOA with ~6.6% of total supply, a few users/addresses seem to have gone for the 10 BTC lot size, while most EOAs hold 1 or less TBTC. Here's a visualization of unique addresses holding TBTC over time: TBTC_num_of_holders975\u00d7625 56.3 KB Source of data: Nansen Tokens on exchanges As mentioned before, the majority of TBTC supply (~82%) currently resides in the Curve pool where users can swap it for other forms of BTC on Ethereum. If we disregarded Curve, we would mention Balancer and Uniswap V2 among the decentralized exchanges with some liquidity and Kraken and Hotbit among the centralized ones. They say a picture is worth a thousand words \u2026 TBTC_on_exchanges975\u00d7694 25 KB Source of data: Etherscan, Uniswap V2, Nansen Downside risks As tBTC has only been on mainnet for 3 months, we'll instead look at the data for BTC to get a comparison against ETH on a larger time frame. As tBTC is redeemable for BTC it has closely followed BTC price. Daily pullback comparison between ETH and BTC over the past 2 years: TBTC_downside_risks752\u00d7452 28.5 KB TBTC and BTC price comparison: TBTC_BTC_comparison975\u00d7365 57.2 KB Volatility As in prior sections we'll have to assume TBTC follows BTC price well enough and would always be 1-to-1 redeemable for BTC to use the BTC price for getting some historical volatility data. As the largest and oldest of crypto currencies BTC is one of the most stable (apart from stablecoins).      volatility scaled yearly     90 days 0.57% 53.16%   1 year 0.78% 73.25%   2 years 0.76% 71.46%    Supply growth Supply of TBTC is at least partly limited or correlated to the Keep network participation and KEEP token as the work token of the Keep network. The majority of KEEP is kept in vesting or grant contracts, the Keep multisig and the KEEP staking contract. With a total supply of 999,848,780.80 KEEP, there's currently 97,874,909 KEEP (9.8%) locked in the KEEP staking contract with 186 operators or signers. There's currently 98,214 ETH bonded, protecting the TBTC supply. TBTC_KEEP_holders975\u00d7431 98.1 KB Source of data: Etherscan We can also look at how the supply of BTC on Ethereum has increased over the past months. The custodial WBTC solution holds the biggest share with 80.7% of BTC on Ethereum, followed by renBTC with 11.9% and others lagging behind. Supply of BTC on Ethereum on 12 Dec 2020:     BTC representation supply     total BTC on Ethereum 142,581   WBTC 115,011 (80.7%)   renBTC 16,960 (11.9%)   HBTC 6,010 (4.22%)   TBTC 1,904 (1.33%)   sBTC 1,814 (1.27%)   imBTC 712 (0.499%)   pBTC 177 (0.124%)    Supply of BTC on Ethereum over the past months: TBTC_BTC_on_Ethereum975\u00d7329 64.9 KB Source of data: Dune Analytics Defi presence With TBTC being relatively young and competing with other BTC on Ethereum solutions the token hasn't been included in most DeFi projects and is just gaining traction. There's some trading volume on the popular decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Balancer, Sushiswap, however as mentioned before, Curve is by far the biggest platform in terms of locked TBTC among DeFi exchanges. TBTC hasn't yet been included in other big DeFi projects but has been proposed on Aave and CREAM platforms. Summary of notable risks or red flags  tBTC relies on 3 key modules for it's operation, with each of those performing an essential operation for the system - Keep network, Summa relay, MakerDAO oracle - a failure in any of them may result in issues with minting, redeeming, erroneous bond slashing or even breaking the supply peg. The first release of tBTC was however stopped by a bug in the redemption part of tBTC smart contracts. This resulted in stopping the first release on the Ethereum mainnet back in May 2020. Luckily, the locked funds were successfully retrieved. The next and improved iteration of tBTC was released in Sep 2020 and the team does seem to strive for a secure solution and has undergone several external audits. At time of writing the system has been live on mainnet for a bit less than 3 months. That is little time, even in these times of chaotically fast DeFi movements. This is most likely the reason that TBTC hasn't yet seen broad adoption, is missing from other lending DeFi projects and doesn't have a lot of liquidity on decentralized exchanges (apart from Curve). This may pose some problems for keepers in volatile times. The TBTC supply however has been increasing ever since the release of it's second iteration and may get good traction in the future. Introducing an asset that is collateralized with ETH is somewhat counterproductive to the Maker efforts of trying to diversify collateral types away from ETH as the dominant token. There's currently little liquidity and trading on exchanges apart from Curve. Having most of the liquidity available on a single exchange can be risky in volatile times and may greatly hinder liquidations in case of Curve issues.  Proposed Actions With the complex system that's been live on mainnet a short time, little liquidity and trading volume, the risk parameters would be somewhat discouraging for adding and using TBTC in MakerDAO. Using the standard risk modelling for example would only allow for a debt ceiling of up to $300,000. With that DC and the cost of adding and maintaining a new token, introducing it to MakerDAO is questionable. We're proposing to re-evaluate it at a later point. We hope and believe TBTC will get good traction and broader adoption in the following months.

Nevertheless, we can\u2019t ignore market dynamics and general directions in which Ethereum Open Finance and the wider crypto ecosystem is evolving; we have given significantly larger weight on market traction and market based metrics such as liquidity and volume and also on how new risks compound with already existing ones - ETH based collateralization lowers the value of diversification of tBTC as non-ETH dependant asset in the collateral. This does not imply we prefer RenBTC collateralization design over tBTC. In the worst case scenario for both assets, Maker will generate bad debt in the amount of max DC. In this stage of development, we have justified the market size and trading activity outweighs the limited risk related to RenBTC, but we don\u2019t feel the same for tBTC, due to significantly lower emission. With the usual risk modelling we calculate the Debt Ceiling based on trading volume on decentralized and centralized exchanges. At time of writing the evaluation the calculated DC was discouraging. With the recent bull run we\u2019re not only seeing a much higher BTC price but also some trading volume spikes, on the downside however we also see TBTC supply somewhat dropped from initial posting of the evaluation. Besides that I\u2019ll give some of my personal opinion and comments - not necessarily shared with the rest of the risk team: While I do find the tBTC project interesting and valuable in terms of decentralization efforts and unique ways of using NFTs even though it adds to complexity, there were some details which hinted to a somewhat early stage of a project. I\u2019ll give one example that raised some concerns in my head. The ETH collateral cannot be rebalanced at the moment (I imagine it would be difficult to coordinate between the 3 signers) so liquidations can be quite common in volatile times. After a position is liquidated the signers need to find each other and coordinate off-chain to unlock and split the BTC in custody. While the Keep team does support channels for that it did raise some questions on how this would work at scale. We can\u2019t really question the design of the system and we\u2019re not deeply familiar with tBTC future plans but it\u2019s definitely a promising project that we should keep following, it will also be interesting to see how BTC on Ethereum solutions develop on a larger scale where I believe diverse solutions - custodial, non-custodial, trustless, synthetic - will enrich the DeFi space. Bottom line is that the risk team currently doesn\u2019t feel confident in onboarding TBTC to MakerDAO. ",

                    "content": "Again, in a vacuum I understand your risk evaluation of tBTC itself, I just continue finding it inconsistent with that of already onboarded collateral from a fundamental point of view.     indy:  In this stage of development, we have justified the market size and trading activity outweighs the limited risk related to RenBTC   For example, in what way does the market size and trading activity mitigate the risk of a critical failure of the underlying multisig, making the asset go to 0 valuation? It seems to me that it doesn\u2019t, and so in the absence of further information about the operational security of the multisig holders, it would not be very desirable to accept such asset as collateral. Conversely, a relative (according to @state\u2019s message above, there is still very acceptable liquidity for this asset on Curve, and I see the -2% slippage is at >$300K on Kraken according to Coingecko) lack of liquidity for an asset which is otherwise more secure seems like it shouldn\u2019t be an impediment in the context of a security analysis. Lastly, your overview of the current limitations of tBTC is undoubtedly correct, and definitely things that should be improved in the long run, but I\u2019m a bit confused as to how this impacts the quality of TBTC as a collateral. Liquidations only concern the signers being liquidated, and are here to maintain the peg of TBTC in the first place, they do not pose a risk to holders of TBTC who might have opened a vault. One could argue that having too high a debt ceiling could remove too much TBTC from the market, thus making it harder for liquidators to do their job, but the initial debt ceiling can definitely be appropriately chosen to account for that imo. Edit: fix typo. ",

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai Overview PAXG is a tokenized representative of physical gold issued on Ethereum as an ERC20 token. Each token represents one fine troy ounce (t oz or a 31.1 grams) of a 400 t oz London Good Delivery gold bar custodied by Paxos Trust Company and stored in Brink\u2019s vaults. Essentially PAXG is a centralized stablecoin soft pegged to gold which represents a form of RWA on Ethereum. PAXG was incepted in Aug 2019 and in Sep, it was approved by NYDFS as a regulated gold-backed digital asset. Subscriptions and redemptions to PAXG are possible via Paxos UI (directly linked to the London gold spot market, operational during open hours) or via ItBit and other CEX/secondary market exchanges. Subscription is possible with USD or Unallocated Gold (Loco London unallocated gold account required). In addition, redemption is also possible via Physical gold bars in London. North America based users can redeem PAXG into physical gold products via Alpha Bullion. All possibilities to subscribe and redeem PAXG are associated with specific fees based on the way of the subscription/redemption. As the PAXG relies on the London gold market for the underlying asset, the subscriptions and redemptions are not available during the market downtimes including holidays and closed hours. Physical gold redemption is time consuming and costly depending on location of delivery, which means that the main market for Keepers to sell their PAXG purchased on a Collateral auction would be various spot markets unrelated to Paxos and the Paxos USD spot market in their wallet UI for large transactions, which is not available during London gold market downtime. Since Paxos and its products are regulated, full KYC is required for any primary market activity. The price of PAXG on a primary market is based on the INTL FCStone price feed, representing the real-time London gold market. PAXG has a subscription and redemption fee based on a schedule for all primary market trades on their wallet UI or gold pages, which includes sales/purchases in USD, physical gold or unallocated gold which is always charged in the token itself. Trades on secondary markets are subject to exchange fee schedules. In addition PAXG has a on-chain 0.02% transaction fee which is charged each time the token is sent on the blockchain. Over time, the feeRecipient address received 28.15 PAXG. The fee was put in place to negate the cost of storing the underlying assets and the fact that the underlying asset is not a yield producing asset. This fee can potentially hinder usability of the asset in DeFi. Metrics and Analysis Supply & Market Share PAXG has been consistently increasing in supply since inception of the project and currently stands at 34,655 tokens or ~$67m at a current price of $1.93k. During 2020 the supply was increasing with an average monthly growth rate of 34%. On the chart below, you can see the total supply of PAXG and corresponding \u201ccirculating or free float supply\u201d (23,864 tokens or ~$46m), as a portion of total supply is held in Paxos controlled addresses. Note that tokens held by Paxos addresses are mostly assets in their custody belonging to different customers, thus majority of this supply is also considered circulating or free float supply. Chart1568\u00d7968 49.2 KB Source: CoinMetrics Price Volatility Price of PAXG is very consistent with LBMA gold reference price, on average it is trading with a ~0.65% price premium. The slight price premium is expected due to additional fees and risks associated with the tokenized asset. Chart1162\u00d7718 56.4 KB Source: CoinMetrics & LBMA PAXG is less volatile compared to ether or bitcoin as visible below. The chart shows rolling daily volatility for a period of 30 days. 1200\u00d7665 49.3 KB Source: CoinMetrics Daily Volume Traded PAXG does not have any single secondary market with a high trading volume, but across different exchanges and trading pairs it does accumulate some trading activity. In 2020 PAXG had an average daily trading volume of $434k considering Kraken, Binance platforms, FTX, Gemini, Uniswap v1,2, Bithumb and the following trading pairs; USD, EUR, ETH, BTC, USDT and BUSD. Chart1200\u00d7742 63.3 KB Source: CryptoCompare, CMC Kraken was historically the dominant exchange but in June this year FTX also offered PAXG and Binance in September, achieving substantial market share. Trading PAXG on-chain is unfavorable as there are fees associated with on-chain transactions explained above. Nevertheless Uniswap achieved ~7% of all trading activity in the past month. Chart1200\u00d7742 104 KB Source: CryptoCompare Token Deposits on Trading Venues PAXG deposited in CEX venues is mostly consistent with reported trading volume in proportions. It seems that a large portion of deposits on Kraken are holders with low trading activity. Chart1200\u00d7742 22.6 KB Source: Nansen Downside Risk In the daily negative returns count comparison with bitcoin and ether, we can see that PAXG is significantly less likely to sharply drop in price in a day, but it still has more negative returns compared to LBMA pm reference price. In the second chart, only days when the gold market was operating were considered. The largest daily drop for PAXG was -8.4% on Nov 17, 2019, on this day the gold market was in a downtime. The largest drop for gold in the observed period was -5.13% on Aug 11, 2020, a few days after reaching new ATH above $2k. Chart1200\u00d7742 20.1 KB Source: CryptoCompare & CoinMetrics Chart1200\u00d7742 32.6 KB Source: CryptoCompare & LBMA Based on historical gold prices in recent history, gold never fell for more than 15% in one day. In Jan 1980, it dropped for 13%, in Feb 1983 it dropped for 14% and in April 2020 it dropped for 9%. Gold is a very safe asset in regards to sharpe price drop probability. Presence in Open Finance and Other Venues PAXG has a low presence in DeFi. Among DEX/non-custodial trading venues, PAXG is only actively traded on Uniswap. Among other DeFi services, PAXG is only present on dForce as currently the only reserve asset for another gold token; GOLDx (currently ~241 PAXG tokens deposited). Contrary to the DeFi space presence, in the CeFi lending space PAXG is listed on the majority of the services; Crypto.com, Celsius, Nexo, BlockFi and others. Low presence might be related to on-chain fees explained above, but the reason can also be in general low traction for precious metals on blockchains in the past. As we saw with WBTC, the financial ecosystem can develop very fast on Ethereum. On-chain Transactions Number of daily on-chain transactions is increasing, averaging at 133 daily transactions. The average daily transaction size (USD) is fairly constant over time, averaging at $3.6k daily. The average daily median transaction size is $11, the median value is low due to all the on-chain tx fee collection transactions. Chart1200\u00d7742 67.6 KB Source: CoinMetrics Regulatory & Counterparty Risk  PAXG is operated and custodied by Paxos Trust Company, the gold bars are stored in Brink\u2019s vaults. The vault provider is also insured for loss of the gold held. Paxos as a trust company and custodian is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). PAXG is also approved and regulated by the Department of Financial Services (DFS). Withum (auditing firm) is performing monthly attestation reports of the issued token amount and underlying assets held found here. In the case of Paxos bankruptcy, the assets held for behalf of customers in the custody are not subject to liquidation mass. Paxos legal and compliance team response on Maker forum with further information can be found here.  Oracles and Liquidations  Despite PAXG being a centralized stablecoin representing a real world asset, we recommend that PAXG oracle is used instead of the underlying asset oracle, as PAXG did experience a larger number of negative returns compared to the underlying. Additionally PAXG is not hard pegged to the underlying assets and the underlying asset has a market downtime days and hours which further supports the PAXG oracle over the underlying asset. We recommend liquidations to be turned on at launch.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai We recommend liquidation ratio at 125%. Despite gold being historically unlikely to sharply drop in price for more than 15% daily, we recommend a bit higher LR to compensate for additional possible price dynamics caused by the PAXG token itself. The token tends to diverge from the underlying price slightly, but during London gold market downtime which prevents redemptions and subscriptions it could diverge more as primary-secondary market arbitrage is not present during this period. We recommend a risk premium of 4%, which is consistent with other custody based assets. Additionally, there are currently no DeFi/non-custodial venues where PAXG or even similar products can be utilized. The legal risk is comparable with other centralized stablecoins, while Maker is already exposed to counterparty risks related with Paxos and is thus not a large risk addition to the system. We recommend the initial debt ceiling to be set at 5m dai. PAXG will be an interesting new collateral type to Maker\u2019s collateral portfolio in terms of asset type diversification and hopefully will become more used in the wider DeFi ecosystem.

They are apparently minting huge sums more tokens than they have gold backing as indicated by any available data source. Archive in case it\u2019s deleted again. Has Paxos every provided or committed to provide complete bar level transparency data? Summary of the issues:   Their Chainlink gold reserve data feed says they have only 60,161.14 troy ounces of physical gold backing the tokens.  This feed says it\u2019s updated every 24 hours.   Their attestation reports which are often released one month or more late show a different number that doesn\u2019t match either the Chainlink data feed or the minted supply.   The number of tokens minted on the blockchain is around 30% more than the gold backing indicated by the Chainlink data feed.   Their largest holder address with almost 20% of total tokens shows no backing according to their own data.   There is no clarity in the details around their storage fee which is only very vaguely explained in their \u2018Terms and Conditions\u2019.   Has there been any official response to any of this? It was suggested that the difference between Chainlink and the Ethereum blockchain minted supply is tokens locked up in a smart contract that are unbacked however that isn\u2019t possible for a number of reasons:   There is no smart contract address that holds enough tokens to make up the difference, there aren\u2019t even two smart contract addresses that could make up the difference together, unless you counted an exchange wallet which would obviously not be legit.   The largest address which has no gold backing according to Paxos\u2019 own data has constant transactions in and out of it.    PAXG1472\u00d7444 45.2 KB    They are constantly minting new tokens, over $2 million worth just a couple of days ago, there would be no reason to mint new tokens if they already have a huge supply of excess unbacked tokens to bring into circulation as they add more gold.  Either Paxos is circulating unbacked PAXG or the data reported by their Chainlink data feed is false. In either case, how can you trust this token? ",

Chart1600\u00d7988 49.9 KB  Source: CryptoCompare Despite the large relative increase in volume, the PAXG did not increase its DeFi presence significantly. The asset is only present in Uniswap v1 and v2, there were few trades on 0x. Average daily trading volume in Uniswap in the past 180 days was $107k. The total liquidity in the pool increased but is still relatively low compared to market capitalization of the project - currently at $2.5m.  Chart1200\u00d7742 21 KB  Source: Uniswap.info The main usage of PAXG is still dominated by centralized lending services such as Nexo, Celsius and BlockFi, as addresses related to those services hold the most tokens besides Paxos related addresses and exchange related addresses. Nexo is currently offering 8% APR, Celsius is offering 5.92% APY and BlockFi offers 5% APY, where the last two display rates after compounding, which means that currently Nexo is the best option, when only rates are considered. This also corresponds with asset allocation, as Nexo holds more PAXG compared to other two services. We can expect that Nexo will probably be one of the largest users of PAXG vault. Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 0.2% Stability Fee: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 5000 Dai Newly calculated risk premium is based on the model here. Even though some metrics did improve for the better, we recommend proceeding with the same initial DC of 5m dai which can be later adjusted based on market traction and improved on-chain liquidity. We have changed the proposed SF from 4% to 3% due to increased liquidity metrics and expectation of primarily institutional usage. We expect that main users of this collateral type will be institutional entities such as Nexo. The dust threshold was adjusted to mimic the rest of the assets in the system. There are some open concerns in the community regarding the management of PAXG Treasury, relevant to total emission of the asset and its corresponding circulating supply. We have contacted Paxos in order to resolve the concerns and are still waiting for the reply. The risk team would appreciate it if the Paxos team can respond to the forum post directly as we want to maximize the transparency of the matter. Additionally, we recommend that the Maker community waits until the issue is resolved before proceeding with the PAXG inclusion. ",

I firstly want to say that we\u2019re excited for PAXG to be onboarded to Maker and will gladly answer questions the community raises. I\u2019ve sent these specific concerns voiced above to the team and have a formal response copied below. \u2013 Thanks for the thoughtfulness and questions around PAX Gold. Trustworthiness is built into our ethos and into every product we deliver. PAX Gold is regulated by NY Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and attested monthly by renowned external auditors. Regarding Chainlink questions, we discussed with Chainlink that their user interface can be confusing for tokens that receive periodic attestations, which is customary for regulated tokens including PAX Gold. Paxos updates our Chainlink API endpoint monthly with the auditor, attestation date, and quantity of underlying gold. Chainlink is working on improving the user interface to make this clear. PAX Gold is fully backed at all times one-for-one with underlying London Good Delivery bars. Regarding the Paxos.com gold bar lookup, this is a tool for individual users to look up gold bars that are allocated to their PAXG holdings. Users that custody gold with Paxos can login to their Paxos account to view the gold bars corresponding to their account. ",

The value of PAXG on Uniswap has increased from $230k to $2.2m since January and keeps growing.  pax1521\u00d7970 127 KB  PAXG currently does ~$500k volume daily on Uniswap and did >$5m over the past week. I think that PAXG will be a great measure to reduce existential risk posed by Maker DAO being very heavily reliant on USDC. I think that listing Uniswap V2 PAXG-ETH and/or PAXG-USDC liquidity provider tokens could be preferable to listing PAXG token itself. That way, collateral can be moved without incuring the 0.02% \u201cfee on transfer\u201d. Allowing PAXG as collateral in the form of Uni V2 LP token remains aligned with Paxos interest, as increased amount of PAXG on Uniswap will increase PAXG trading volumes and effectively will increase Paxos revenues from the 0.02% fee. Maker can actually list all three - PAXG token, PAXG-ETH Uniswap LP and PAXG-USDC Uniswap LP and see which one gets most traction. ",

After the signal request closed, GovAlpha suggested that the community should wait until a new risk assessment with updated recommendations was available, and then re-run the onboarding poll. Hence, this post aims to update relevant metrics and to give appropriate parameter recommendations that reflect the current state of PAXG. Previous discussions, metrics and recommendations are available further up in this thread. The original risk assessment from the @Risk-Core-Unit was published in October 2020. The second updated assessment was posted one year ago, in April 2021. Now, in April 2022, an additional update has been made. This update uses the same metrics as in previous assessments. In addition, since previous PAXG assessments pre-dates the implementation of Liquidations 2.0, this assessment now includes Liq 2.0 parameter recommendations as well. Further context on the developments of the onboarding process for PAXG is available in the links below.  [PAXG] - PAX Gold as MCD collateral (May 9, 2020) [PAXG] - PAX Gold MIP6 collateral application (May 21, 2020) [PAXG] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Domain Community Assessment (Jul 29, 2020) [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation (Oct 22, 2020) Poll - Add PAXG as a Collateral Type (Oct 26, 2020) [PAXG] Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment (MIP10c3-SP16) (Nov 28, 2020) PAXG Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation Update (Apr 15, 2021) [Signal Request] Onboard PAXG (Mar 9, 2022)   Metrics and Analysis  Supply & Market Share At the time of writing, the circulating supply of PAXG is around 318,000. The PAXG market cap is approximately $629 million. In October 2020, the circulating supply was 34,655, with a market cap of $67 million. It is worth noting that the price of gold is approximately the same today as it was in October 2020, around $1,935. So while the price of gold has hovered around the same price level for the last 18 months, the supply of PAXG tokens has grown almost one order of magnitude on Ethereum.  Chart1200\u00d7742 22.7 KB  Source: CoinMetrics  Price Volatility One potential risk of using tokenised assets as collateral in Maker is the possibility of the value of the token depegging from the value of the underlying asset. Each PAXG token represents one fine troy ounce (t oz or a 31.1 grams) of a 400 t oz London Good Delivery gold bar custodied by Paxos Trust Company and stored in Brink\u2019s vaults. The price of PAXG has been consistent with the LBMA gold bar price throughout its existence. Since October 2020, PAXG has traded at a slight premium of, on average, 0.57%. This premium is most likely due to the PAXG transactions fee (0.02%) as well as the additional risks associated with a tokenized derivative versus just holding the underlying asset.  Chart1342\u00d7742 92.6 KB  Source: CoinMetrics & LBMA  Daily Volume Traded The chart below presents CoinGecko data measuring trading volume and price over time. The average daily trading volume of PAXG for 2021 was approximately $10 million. So far in 2022, the average daily trading volume has been $22 million. This increase was mainly due to the substantial trading volume spike in February and March. Trading volume has now reverted back to approximately the same levels as before February 2022.  Chart1200\u00d7742 71.3 KB  Source: CoinGecko The chart below compares the top exchanges by PAXG trading volume, according to CryptoCompare data. It measures PAXG trading pairs with USDT, BTC, BUSD, USD, and WETH. These make up 98.12% of all PAXG trading volume. Binance has become the dominant exchange in terms of PAXG trading volume. Before this, Kraken was the clear leader. Between October 2020 and April 2022, Binance made up 76.5% of all trading volume of PAXG across the measured trading venues. Uniswap v2 and Kraken were next in line, each responsible for approximately 6.4% of the trading volume.  Chart1410\u00d7872 239 KB  Source: CryptoCompare  Token Deposits on Trading Venues In October 2020, the Paxos Treasury was the largest PAXG holder across the cryptoasset ecosystem, with approximately 11,556 PAXG tokens. Kraken was second in line, with 5,422 PAXG tokens. Today, Binance, FTX and Kraken all have larger holdings than the Paxos Treasury. In the last 18 months, PAXG has not only increased in supply across the cryptoasset ecosystem, but the PAXG supply has diversified across more trading venues.  Chart1200\u00d7742 18.8 KB  Source: Nansen  Downside Risk Gold, and in effect PAXG, is generally considered a more stable asset compared to other commodities and asset classes. Historical gold prices in recent history have never fallen by more than 16% in one day. In January 1980, it fell approximately 15% in one day. The maximum drawdown for PAXG since October 2020 was 4.31%. This happened on November 9, 2020. The chart below compares the daily negative return count of ETH and PAXG. PAXG has had two instances of -3% daily price returns, 13 instances of -2% daily price returns, and 58 instances of -1% price returns. In other words, the asset has remained comparatively stable throughout the last 18 months.  Chart1200\u00d7742 23.5 KB  Source: CoinMetrics  Presence in Open Finance and Other Venues In DeFi, Uniswap v2 is still the dominant platform in terms of both volume and liquidity for PAXG. The chart below, measuring weekly on-chain DEX trades, illustrates this relationship. The blue colour represents Uniswap. The turquoise colour represents 1Inch. In comparison, other DEXs in the chart (Sushiswap, 0x, Balancer, Paraswap, and EtherDelta) have negligible trade volumes.  982\u00d7688 52 KB  Source: Nansen The liquidity on Uniswap is predominantly skewed towards v2. The two largest pools measured by liquidity are PAXG/ETH and PAXG/USDP. One year ago, the dollar-denominated liquidity of the PAXG-ETH pool was approximately $2.5 million. Today it is circa $30 million. It is worth noting that $20 million of the provisioned liquidity comes from one single address. The average pool volume from April 2021 to April 2022 was $846,007. The 24h volume peaked on February 24, 2022, at $10.6 million.  Chart1200\u00d7742 66.8 KB  Source: Uniswap v2 Info At the time of writing, the dollar-denominated liquidity of the PAXG/USDP pool is approximately $5 million. The pool experienced a sudden withdrawal of liquidity on November 12, 2021, from approximately $15 million to $5 million, by the same address that accounts for circa \u2154 of the liquidity in the PAXG/ETH pool (1, 2). The same address is responsible for almost all of the liquidity currently provisioned to the PAXG/USDP pool. The daily trading volume in the pool is low to non-existent. The 24h volume is 8,000 USD at the time of writing. This suggests that the PAXG/USDP pool is hardly being utilised, and is centralised in terms of the number of liquidity providers.  Chart1200\u00d7742 39.5 KB  Source: Uniswap v2 Info  On-chain Transactions The change in on-chain activity for PAXG is illustrated in the chart below. It measures the daily transaction count and daily mean transaction size from October 2020 to April 2022. The average amount of daily on-chain transactions was approximately 133 from inception (September 2019) up until October 2020. From October 2020 up until April 2022, the daily average transaction count has been 299. The size of transactions have also increased. In October 2020, the average daily transaction size was $3.6k. From October 2020 to today, daily transaction size averaged $17.9k.  Chart1594\u00d7986 160 KB  Source: CoinMetrics  Regulatory & Counterparty Risk  Added support for DAI may be postponed by Paxos In the summer of 2021, Paxos suggested certain terms when Maker governance was considering and developing the implementation of the USDP PSM. As part of the collaboration, Paxos would add DAI support to Paxos Crypto Brokerage institutional clients (e.g. PayPal, Venmo, and Revolut) so that they could offer DAI to their end users. Paxos stated that by the end of Q1 2022 (if not sooner), they would add DAI support to their platform, which would ensure DAI as an available stablecoin option for institutional clients. The PSM-PAX-A was onboarded on August 27, 2021. Maker now holds 500 million USDP in PSM-PAX-A, which is approximately 50% of all USDP circulating supply. The Growth team recently learned that further DAI integration is not being prioritised by Paxos. This will likely not be prioritised until the end of 2022. As such, providing further Paxos functionality by onboarding PAXG may lead to an even more unbalanced relationship, since Paxos has postponed their plans to further integrate DAI. At present it is unclear whether this will change going forward.  New questions regarding legal, regulatory, and custodial risk Other questions regarding legal risk, regulatory risk, and custodial risk have recently come to light. It is important to note that it is not within the Risk Core Unit\u2019s mandate to assess and/or give legal recommendations on the collateral onboarding process or any other activity. We do not possess the knowledge or expertise to provide any comments or recommendations on such matters. See the legal disclaimer at the top of this post for more information. Hence, we will not attempt to answer any such questions in this assessment. A large part of PAXG risks are related to the counterparties involved and other risks more common to RWA. Hence, the RWF team may be better suited to further research regulatory/legal/counterparty related aspects of PAXG. However, we have tried to identify publicly available information to the best of our ability. Some of the sources provided in this assessment have already been shared on the forum and in the original risk assessment. Nonetheless, we have decided to include them here to make it more accessible for readers and new governance participants. We invite community members to add relevant documents and information pertinent to this thread.  PAXG Terms and Conditions Paxos General Terms and Conditions are available here. Paxos Gold Terms and Conditions are available here. In addition, other relevant information regarding PAXG including (i) buying and redeeming PAXG on the Paxos platform, (ii) settlement time of purchase or sale of PAXG, (iii) PAXG fees, (iv) insurance and published attestation reports, and (v) PAXG allocation and physical gold bar details is available in the Paxos PAXG Help section on their website.  Storage and Sourcing According to the PAXG White Paper, Paxos maintains relationships with several large institutions in the gold market, including gold providers, vaults and miners. These relationships are needed for their other business, post-trade automation for Commodity Settlements. Paxos state that they have an account with Brink\u2019s bullion vaults in London. Brink\u2019s maintain the vaults for storage of allocated gold corresponding to PAX Gold tokens. For sourcing of gold, Paxos has an account with INTL FCStone, a gold-trading and wholesale institution that buys and sells gold to Paxos as needed for token issuance and redemption.  Redeemability According to the Paxos website, only individuals registered with Paxos as account holders can redeem gold. Other individuals may not redeem gold on behalf of the account holder. The Paxos vault provider maintains insurance against the loss of the gold held in custody on behalf on Paxos. This, according to Paxos, protects PAXG tokens both in the vault facilities and in transit. In terms of mitigating multiple claims of the same gold, Paxos seems to have an automated system that sorts gold so that all PAXG tokens are allocated to specific gold bars at all times. In the case of a customer not being allocated ownership of a full gold bar, they will own pro rata shares of bars as determined by PAXG token holdings. PAXG tokens may be reallocated to differents bars over time in order to take into account the transfers of tokens. Paxos has a \u201cgold lookup\u201d page, where anyone can look up PAXG Allocation Reports for specific Ethereum addresses holding PAXG tokens. Such reports contain (i) bar serial number, (ii) brand code, (iii) gross weight, (iv) fineness, and (v) fine weight.  Attestations PAXG attestations are available here. According to the Paxos website, Paxos Trust Company is engaged with the auditing firm Withum. Withum verifies at specific points in time that the entire supply of PAXG tokens corresponds 1:1 with ounces of London Good Delivery gold held by third parties in the United Kingdom on behalf of Paxos. One attestation report per month has been published since September 2019. The latest report available on the Paxos website covers February 2022.  Compliance Paxos legal and compliance team made an official response on the Maker forum regarding regulatory and compliance specific questions in May 2020. The response can be found here.  Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 2% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 5m DC-IAM gap: 3m DC-IAM ttl: 8h Cut: 0.999 Step: 100 seconds Buf: 1.05 Cusp: 0.85 Tail: 272 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.85 Ilk.hole: 3m DAI Dust: 15.000 DAI Reasoning for the liquidation ratio, stability fee, auction parameters, debt ceiling, and dust is set out below: 1. Liquidation ratio: We recommend keeping the liquidation ratio at 125% to compensate for the additional risk of price divergence from the underlying asset, since Maker will use a PAXG based Oracle. 2. Stability fee: Due to the current market dynamics, and in line with the most recent Parameter Changes Proposal update, a stability fee of 2% is recommended (previously 3%). 3. Debt ceiling: It was mentioned in the PAXG Collateral Onboarding Oracle Assessment, published in November 2020, that the PAXG token is problematic from an Oracle risk perspective due to the volume being exceedingly small. Low liquidity makes it more feasible for an attacker to successfully execute an Oracle attack. In order to cap losses from a potential attack, the Oracles team recommended setting the debt ceiling to 1 million. Both liquidity and trading volumes are higher today, which means that this is probably less of an issue now. While the on-chain liquidity has increased, there are still relatively few liquidity providers active in the Uniswap v2 PAXG/ETH and PAXG/USDP pools. This could become a dependency issue. We suggest setting the debt ceiling to 5 million for initial testing. However, liquidity seems to play a smaller role for this particular asset, since PAXG is less volatile compared to other cryptoassets, and because PAXG is redeemable for actual gold. A debt ceiling of 20-30 million would be possible in the future. 4. Auction Parameters: We recommend much slower auction throughput due to very low volatility of PAXG and lower on-chain liquidity compared to other assets. Potentially we may need to rely on capitalised keepers. This means the auction\u2019s cycle will take from about 1h20min up to 5h30min where settlement price ranges from 1.05 to 0.86 of the last OSM update. 5. Dust: The dust limit has increased for almost all vaults in the Maker Protocol. More on the reasoning behind these changes can be found here and here. Following the same reasoning, the updated dust parameter recommendation has been set to 15.000 DAI (previously 5.000 DAI).

As part of the collaboration, Paxos would add DAI support to Paxos Crypto Brokerage institutional clients (e.g. PayPal, Venmo, and Revolut) so that they could offer DAI to their end users. Paxos stated that by the end of Q1 2022 (if not sooner), they would add DAI support to their platform, which would ensure DAI as an available stablecoin option for institutional clients. The PSM-PAX-A was onboarded on August 27, 2021. Maker now holds 500 million USDP in PSM-PAX-A, which is approximately 50% of all USDP circulating supply. The Growth team recently learned that further DAI integration is not being prioritised by Paxos. This will likely not be prioritised until the end of 2022.   No bueno paxos, no bueno\u2026 ",

Each decentralized oracle network consists of a collection of independent node operators, a method for aggregating data, and pre-made \u201cChainlinks\u201d (also called external adaptor) that act as middleware to give you access to any API you want to leverage for data and/or external services.   Chainlink currently provides decentralization at both the oracle and data source level. By using multiple independent Chainlink nodes, the user can protect against one oracle being a single point of failure. Similarly, using multiple data sources for sourcing market prices, the user can protect against one data source being a single source of truth. Both of these ensure that the oracle mechanism triggering your important smart contract is as secure and reliable as the underlying blockchain. You can use Chainlink to connect to data providers, web APIs, enterprise systems, cloud providers, IoT devices, payment systems, other blockchains and much more.  LINK token use From the whitepaper:  The ChainLink network utilizes the LINK token** to pay ChainLink Node operators for the retrieval of data from off-chain data feeds, formatting of data into blockchain readable formats, off-chain computation, and uptime guarantees they provide as operators. In order for a smart contract on networks like Ethereum to use a ChainLink node, they will need to pay their chosen ChainLink Node Operator using LINK tokens, with prices being set by the node operator based on demand for the off-chain resource their ChainLink provides, and the supply of other similar resources. The LINK token is an ERC20 token, with the additional ERC223 \u201ctransfer and call\u201d functionality of transfer(address,uint256,bytes), allowing tokens to be received and processed by contracts within a single transaction.  Regarding the token sale, the whitepaper states:  LINK Tokens are not securities, investments or currency, and are not sold or marketed as such. Also: participating in the sale involves significant technological and systemic risks; the sale is not open to individuals who reside in or are citizens of the United States or Canada. The sale period, duration, pricing, and other provisions may change, as stated in the token sale terms. The LINK Token sale involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual functionality, utility, or levels of use of LINK Tokens to be materially different from any projected future results, use, functionality or utility expressed or implied by SCCL in the terms.  From website  LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the ERC677 transferAndCall token standard.   Token data On-chain activity Daily active addresses The count of active addresses has been continuously rising over the last 12 months. The rise in activity has really sped up since the Black Thursday recovery where it has continuously maintained its level above the two year mean of 1549 daily active addresses. When looking from a distribution point of view, most episodes where the count of active addresses are either above the mean or largely above the mean happened since the second quarter of 2020. The maximum count happened on July 13th where as many as 14253 addresses were active in the network. This rise is likely due also to the increase in token price, where both metrics share a 0.90 two year correlation. However data indicates that the latest rises in price have created more outliers in that correlation between the two variables than historically. image784\u00d7787 53.9 KB Source: Santiment New unique addresses Along with daily active addresses metric, the increase in the count of newly unique addresses has also been very noticeable since the second quarter of 2020. It has mostly moved in tandem with the active addresses over that period. Here the network added as much as 6,508 new unique addresses in a single day on July 13th. As is the case for active addresses, the creation of new unique addresses has been mostly above its two year mean since the Black Thursday events. New unique addresses have also a high degree of correlation with the token price at 0.89. However, it is important to notice here that both new unique addresses and daily active addresses seem to have a high degree of collinearity when it comes to LINK\u2019s price prediction. That means both independent variables would most likely cancel each other\u2019s predictive power in a regression model. Another important point, according to data, is the growing number of the zero balance addresses in the last couple of months. These accounts transfer or sell out all of their tokens which could indicate a fair amount of speculative activity happening beyond the network fundamentals and demand for the asset. image782\u00d7786 55 KB Sources: Santiment, glassnode image1309\u00d7551 58.4 KB Source: IntoTheBlock 2 year correlation to token price     metric closePriceUsd new_unique_add daily_active_addresses     closePriceUsd 1.00 0.89 0.90   new_unique_add 0.89 1.00 0.97   daily_active_addresses 0.90 0.97 1.00     polynomial coeff: [ 975.38918393 -376.65582042]  polynomial coeff: [ 439.20430438 -203.16809245] Daily transaction volume (LINK) The transaction volume shows the aggregate amount of tokens across all transactions that happened on the network for LINK. According to the distribution the bulk of the transaction volume has mostly hovered around its two year mean value of 2,500,150 LINK per day or 0.25% of total supply,despite recent price increases. The last 12 months show however a few spikes in volume activity which seem to indicate these aligned with intervals of significant price decrease. The most recent spikes being Black Thursday and around mid July 2020. image806\u00d7403 40.8 KB Sources: Santiment image909\u00d7374 4.92 KB Sources: Santiment Token allocation The Chainlink contract has a fixed and capped supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. According to data from Etherscan, LINK\u2019s token offering launched on September 19, 2017, after a 32 million fundraise hard cap through the ICO. There were two rounds of LINK sale offerings to the market. One pre-sale where LINK was sold at 0.09 USD per token with a 20% bonus. A second public sale sold LINK at 0.11 USD to investors. In total both sales accounted for 350 million LINK sold to the market out of 1 billion tokens issued in the network. The final ICO allocation of tokens was structured as follows:  35% of supply was allocated to token sale investors 35% of supply was reserved to Node Operators and ecosystem rewards that would be distributed to incentivise network participants 30% of supply was allocated to LINK\u2019s parent company, SmartContract.com and its team members to support protocol development  The details of this allocation can be found on the Etherscan transaction here. The parent company SmartContract.com that is behind the project team has been active since 2014 with the aim to create a bridge product to bring external data sources into public blockchains, through a decentralised oracle network that works along with node operators. Chainlink\u2019s mainnet went live on Ethereum on June 1 2019. Due to the nature of the ICO token allocation, the actual circulating supply of tokens in the market was initially 35%, i.e. which went to investors. But since the ICO, the addresses associated with the treasury had a few rounds of selling which brings the current circulating supply to an estimated 385,009,556 LINK. It is interesting to note that this increased circulating supply seems to have had an effect in the market price, as the first spikes in market activity happened at the same moment as the team started offloading some of its ICO treasury. Circulating supply calculation is based on coingecko methodology. Finally, LINK tokens held by the team do not seem to have a vesting schedule, according official documentation. A number of Chainlink node operators provide data feeds to DeFi services against fees determined in LINK by the operator. This link and here display a list of oracle providers, along with their respective transactions, earned LINK from data feeds and other operational metrics. At time of writing, Chainlink\u2019s official staking program for node operators has not been released to the public. For more information on the notion of implicit vs explicit staking, see article. Other FAQs on node operations, can be found here. In the following sections we will cover asset price returns, token ownership distribution and exchange activity. Token ownership and its concentration amongst top addresses is a particularly important topic in this risk analysis, as it is very noticeable in comparison to other ERC20 projects.

Those involved in the first presale have seen as much as 18,466% return on their investments. At time of writing, over the last 12 months, investors have seen a 353% yearly return and a two year return of 2,579%. Looking at some technicals, LINK\u2019s price appreciation seems to have been mostly supported by its 200 day moving average over the last year, with only one episode early in 2020 where the 50MA crossed below the 200MA trend. By the end of July both 200 MA and 50 MA were sitting at 4.03 USD and 5.91 USD, respectively. Were the price to drop to its 50 MA levels, that would mean a 31.4% decline.

In the following charts we will cover the biggest sticking points when it comes to distribution of assets amongst token holders, the relationship of these to asset pricing and the kind of risks this could bring to the vault portfolio. Amount held by top addresses: as % of total supply and % of circulating supply The amount held by top addresses displays the amount of tokens held by the top address holders, which by default includes the top 10 holders. In this metric both exchange and non-exchange top holders are put together. It shows that for the first 12 months of the timeseries the share of ownership as a percentage of total and circulating supplies has remained mostly unchanged at 76% and 35% respectively. Subsequently, those metrics have dropped in the following 12 months. image769\u00d7713 65.8 KB Source: Santiment Amount held by top addresses: exchanges vs non-exchange addresses However, when it comes to splitting out the token amount held by top holders into two groups, top known exchange addresses and top non-exchange addresses, the data provides a diverging trend in the network. Whilst both have reduced their token ownership share in the network in the first year, we can observe a re-accumulation of tokens in the second quarter of 2020 by top non-exchange addresses. That rise in ownership coincides with increased asset price post Black Thursday events. Top 10 non-exchange address ownership represented 63.7% of total supply by July end. Also the reduced amount of tokens in top exchanges could be one of the reasons for the 2020 recent price increase, drawn out of shortage in liquidity. image803\u00d7713 66 KB Source: Santiment Token amount held by number of addresses When we look at the timeseries dataset at a more granular level, the following chart shows the amount of tokens held by buckets of address counts over time. As we have seen previously, LINK has attracted a substantial growth in daily active addresses and new unique addresses in the last year. However, a significant portion of that growth in address numbers went to addresses holding 1K tokens or less. At the top percentile of the distribution, the count of addresses has remained mostly unchanged. There is a very small number of addresses holding more than 1M tokens, 6 of which belong to the team treasury and one to node operators. Only 328 addresses hold 100K tokens or more. In other words, only 0.16% of addresses hold the largest shares of the network. image847\u00d7411 59.8 KB Source: Glassnode Gini coefficient The gini index provides an extra insight into the LINK frequency distribution of tokens over addresses. Note that this metric calculation by Glassnode excludes exchange addresses, smart contract addresses, and other special asset-specific addresses e.g. team treasury. This metric is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect distribution equality and 1 perfect inequality of token distribution. As of mid July, LINK has a gini of 0.97. It can be noted that the gini index has increased continuously in the last 12 months, despite the growth in active addresses since the mainnet launch last year and the team treasury offloads into the market. This may be a sign that already existing big buyers are acquiring even more tokens in the market. This brings a significant ownership risk to the MakerDAO vault portfolio as actions by these holders, whether coordinated or not, may determine potentially significant swings in the asset price and by extension, in case of negative swings, in increased collateral liquidations. It is important to point out that the use of addresses for the gini index in crypto is purely a proxy for distribution. One entity may own multiple addresses which would bring the gini index even closer to 1. Note however that this type of high gini index is not particularly uncommon in many crypto projects. This post provides extra insights. image819\u00d7441 25 KB Source: Glassnode Treasury funds Team treasury fund addresses have been identified from glassnode and etherscan. Since the ICO, the Chainlink team has offloaded a portion of its original 300 million LINK tokens, mainly in the last 12 months. As per ICO terms, these sales have likely been done to secure funding to support protocol development. In total, 32,009,579 LINK has moved from the team original wallets, bringing their share of total supply from 30% to 27%. The move of tokens out of treasury accounts indicates there is no vesting of funds, which may bring asset price risks should a large portion come into the market in a short interval of time. No official documentation analysed indicates a vesting schedule for these funds. In this analysis treasury tokens have been accounted in the calculation of estimated circulating supply. In terms of treasury management, in a recent announcement Chainlink appears to have placed a portion of its bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) crypto holdings under Celsius\u2019 treasury management service. Unfortunately, this analysis could not identify the addresses holding ETH or BTC on behalf of the team. image871\u00d7713 48.6 KB Source: Santiment Token Velocity & Age consumed Velocity displays the average number of times that a single LINK token changes addresses daily. Higher token velocity means that a single token is used more often in daily transactions. For the most part of the last 12 months, velocity has hovered around its 2.09 median value, with very little deviance. The biggest outliers in that long term trend happened between February and April 2020, with its highest point on Feb 17, 2020 at 5.67. Since then, velocity has returned to its yearly mean. On the other end, age consumed may be a valuable metric to observe long term for Risk teams. It tracks the movement of previously idle LINK tokens. The metric shows the amount of LINK changing addresses daily multiplied by the number of days since they last moved. Spikes indicate a significant amount of previously idle LINK tokens moving between addresses. In other words, it gives a sort of view of \u201cnetwork inertia\u201d. This metric can be used to track the movement of big longterm token holders with historically little trading activity. Spikes such as those of July 2019 can be used as preemptive measures for selling pressures. For most of the last 12 months, this metric has not moved much beyond its median 32,054,984 mark. But this recent historical precedent should not be discarded in long term analysis of extreme events. image822\u00d7716 68.2 KB Source: Santiment ",

It is important to point out that this metric has been continuously deteriorating in the last 12 months without any significant rebounds. For risk, this reinforces the likelihood of liquidity shortages in the event of liquidations. Also, note a significant negative two year correlation between token supply on exchanges and price change at -0.88. However, that correlation seems to be reducing in the last month or so. Across different exchanges, Binance has the largest market share by a considerable margin with 87.2% of tokens being stored in their wallets as of July end. This is not surprising considering how high LINK\u2019s daily trading volume is on that exchange.

This considers only a subset of significant and regulated exchanges, given the unfortunate common practice of wash-trading across the industry. Click here for further details. Off that list, it is very visible that Binance and Coinbase are the key exchanges for LINK trading. Both exchanges account for about 75% and 19.25% of trading volume in CEX, respectively, at July 2020 end. Aggregated exchange volume (snapshot)  Note: See Messari \u201cReal volume\u201d Sources: Coingecko, Messari List of exchange pairs At a more granular level, LINK/USDT and LINK/BTC on Binance and LINK/USD on Coinbase are clearly the dominating trading pairs (86.4% of total) across major centralised exchanges.

There is only 62,316,642 LINK (6.23% of total of supply) readily available in aggregate on exchanges. Given the trend in the last 12 months, in the event of a significant price decline, there is a risk of lack of liquidity for MakerDAO auction keepers. This risk will be proportional to long term debt ceiling levels. Another aspect to take into account is the growing number of leveraging platforms such as Aave including LINK in their listed collaterals. With declining token supply on exchanges, the competition for trading activity tends to accelerate, with likely risky effects for keepers trying to liquidate LINK. For these reasons this metric should be very closely monitored by Risk teams and debt ceilings as well as risk premiums set accordingly.  Note: unfortunately, in the following chart Coinbase data was not readily available. Therefore there is a significant discount to the actual amount of LINK in wallets.  image880\u00d7457 36 KB Source: Glassnode Trading: CEX volumes \u201cReal trading volume\u201d has fluctuated significantly across exchanges in the last two years. Although we have a mean daily value of 21,492,798.15 LINK traded in the markets, the variance of that mean is as much as 459053733493354.56, indicating a very high level of oscillation in trading activity. The volume variation goes from a minimum of 1,773,250 LINK to a max of 220,741,335 LINK traded in the two year data. In the second chart below, we smoothed out the real volume metric with a 30 day rolling value to give a view of the oscillation from that mean (in green). Although trading volume association with price was clear in Black Thursday events, there is no significant two year correlation between price and volume (0.23). image880\u00d7457 64.5 KB image800\u00d7444 51.5 KB Source: Cryptocompare Trading: DEX & Liquidity pool Volumes Trading: CEX vs DEX volume In comparison to centralised exchanges, trading volume in decentralised exchanges and liquidity pools is fairly low for LINK. It has been on the rise from mid-second quarter of 2020, particularly since the launch of Uniswap V2 on May 18. It included LINK/ETH trading pairs. As of the end of July, the biggest share of DEX volume has been traded on Uniswap or 0x liquidity DEXes. Bancor and Kyber also report some increase in volume, but insignificant in comparison.  Disclaimer: It is important to note however that timeseries data for decentralised exchange volumes is not only dispersed across different api services, but also not properly maintained. This creates a lot of gaps for longer timeseries\u2019 views or poorly reliable information. Very few data aggregator services (eg. cryptocompare) maintain any timeseries for DEX volumes and often reported volumes conflict with project application dashboard ones. This situation is constantly evolving with new services now starting to fill that gap in the ecosystem. There is an opportunity for monitoring of this dataset based on new data providers coming to the marketplace.  image828\u00d7444 44.8 KB Sources: Cryptocompare, 0xtracker, Bancor image912\u00d7482 59.5 KB Source: Uniswap.info image1616\u00d7557 52.9 KB Source: 0xtracker image1115\u00d7505 23 KB Source: Kyber Tracker Trading: DEX vs CEX volume distribution From a distribution perspective, we have a mean value of 4,823 LINK for DEXes and 21,492,798 LINK for centralised exchanges over the same two year period. This share of trading activity may shift over the coming years towards more DEXes with services like Uniswap. The last three months has seen a significant shift in the distribution (31,073 LINK mean value). But for the foreseeable future we expect the large majority of LINK trade still flowing through centralised exchanges. image743\u00d7431 13.5 KB Sources: Cryptocompare, 0xtracker, Bancor image732\u00d7431 14.2 KB Sources: Cryptocompare, 0xtracker, Bancor image730\u00d7431 13.3 KB Source: Cryptocompare  3rd party earning & lending platforms List of DeFi platforms A small number of DeFi and CeFi lending platforms have included LINK in their reserves over the last 18 months. At time of writing, Aave is the only one in DeFi proposing both savings and lending services, ever since bzX paused its offering. In CeFi, Nuo has both savings and lending facilities and Celsius and Argent only savings. For comparison with MakerDAO only, this analysis focuses on Aave.  Note: We plan to extend this kind of scope with more data in future onboarding assessments and data monitoring. The purpose is to benchmark some risk policies and strategies applied on these platforms in order to assist in MakerDAO\u2019s own vault portfolio management.  Interest rates As a snapshot, earning rates on LINK across all platforms stands at a median 0.02%. The outlier in the group is Celsius network running a 1.98% earnings APR. At this point, due to lack of internal data, we cannot provide a clear reason for that rate disparity, other than potentially a special trading relationship with the Chainlink project. However, this assumption has not been verified. On the borrowing side, Aave has both floating (variable) and fixed (stable) rate tranches for LINK. At time of writing, it runs a 3.25% stable and 0.55% floating, which is close to Nuo\u2019s 2.3% borrowing APR. For the rest of the analysis, we will look mainly at Aave variable reserves, which may have more resemblance with MakerDAO vaults.

Historically, the mean variable borrow rate has been 0.61% in the platform. However, low variable rates have mainly been sustained in the first two quarters of 2020. From July, with the acceleration of price increases for LINK and growing debt in the platform, Aave has adjusted its risk pricing to a 5.59% max value to rein in some of the downside risks of the growing collateral reserves. image729\u00d7431 6.62 KB image757\u00d7444 38.6 KB Source: Aleth.io Outstanding debt Aave\u2019s LINK debt levels have stayed relatively low for most of the year. Leveraging appetite has picked up from early July which coincided with the pace of price rises in LINK. However this appetite has since diminished to historical levels i.e. closer to the year mean of 359,292 LINK. Unfortunately, at this stage we have not been able to source LINK liquidation data from aave yet. This may be updated in the near future to consider the extent of liquidations which occured over the last year and during the recent upswing of LINK asset price. Most importantly, it would be valuable to know whether the protocol borrowing rates have picked up not only due to increased leveraging but also in line with a risk-based pricing strategy in reaction to liquidations. In the future, this sort of benchmarking observation of Aave liquidations may have the advantage of informing MakerDAO\u2019s own ongoing risk policies and parameters. At least, this 3rd party liquidation data may be valuable to assist with management of future LINK vault events, while we may not have enough of our own data observations. image800\u00d7444 40.4 KB Source: Aleth.io Dynamic borrow apr vs debt The aave protocol appears to set a strict linear relationship between its outstanding debt and borrow apr rate for LINK. This reflects in the very dynamic nature of its floating borrowing rates that change in the system to adjust demand and supply for assets. At 0.98 historical positive correlation, both variables move in nearly perfect sync.  polynomial coeff: [1.42119299e-06 1.04068609e-01] Source: Aleth.io Summary of LINK stats on Aave     aave_earn_apr aave_borrow_apr aave_link_col_ratio aave_link_outst_debt aave_link_supp_vol     count 222.00 222.00 222.00 222.00   mean 0.12 0.62 5.45 360910.47   std 0.37 1.18 1.11 823042.34   min 0.00 0.00 3.59 0.00   25% 0.00 0.12 4.42 30110.54   50% 0.00 0.22 5.43 107627.86   75% 0.01 0.29 5.99 137784.71   max 2.28 5.59 9.68 4069828.26    Correlation of LINK variables on Aave   Summary of Noticeable Risks: Below is a brief summary of the key risk factors identified by looking into the data available for this risk analysis:   Short term liquidity risk: The available supply of tokens held on major exchanges has been continuously reducing over the last 12 months. In the event of sharp asset price declines and subsequent asset liquidations, it is likely this may cause a short term liquidity problem for the asset while keeper auctions are running. This analysis has indicated the supply on exchanges has deteriorated despite the growing circulating supply throughout the period.  Trading volume concentration risk: Binance and Coinbase dominate trading volume for LINK pairs with 75% and 19.25% of all activity, respectively. Within these markets, LINK/USDT, LINK/BTC (Binance) and LINK/USD (Coinbase) account for 86.4% of all trades. In the rather unlikely event that these marketplaces face any technological issue or otherwise, liquidity and trade for LINK pairs would be directly impacted. At this point, no exchange platform, centralised or decentralised, has seriously challenged these two players.  Token holding concentration risk: In the LINK network, data indicates only 0.16% of addresses hold 100K tokens or more. This distribution is rather skewed towards already large token holders. Data also indicates that the distribution of token ownership has deteriorated in the last 12 months according to its calculated \u201cproxy\u201d gini index at 0.97, all that despite the increased circulating supply in the market.  Low DEX trading volume risk: Trading activity for LINK tokens within decentralised exchanges and liquidity pools has only taken pace in the last couple of months. However, the trading volume in these platforms is insignificant when compared to centralised exchanges such as Binance. Should centralised exchanges face any operational issue preventing trades, it is unlikely decentralised exchanges would be able to offset the trading activity, at least in the short term.  Competitive liquidity for collateral risk: This data analysis has indicated that a growing number of DeFi and CeFi lending platforms are adding LINK to their collateral portfolios. As benchmarking analysis has shown, Aave has reached a 4 million debt threshold collateralised in its platform in a relatively short period of time.  This analysis has shown already existing LINK liquidity risks across exchanges. Should a few lending platforms have similar volumes as Aave, there is a real risk of \u201cliquidity competition\u201d across DeFi in case of simultaneous liquidations occurring in the industry.  Speculative behaviour risk: This study has indicated a continuously growing activity for Chainlink, using daily active addresses and new unique addresses as proxies for ecosystem adoption. However, this study has also shown zero balance addresses are growing in the network over the last few months. In usual settings, the growth of this metric indicates growth in purely speculative behaviour in token ownership.  Shared oracle infrastructure risk: There is a growing number of DeFi platforms embedding data sourced from Chainlink\u2019s decentralised oracle network into their own platforms. While in theory this creates efficiencies of scale for the DeFi ecosystem, there is potentially a risk of increased interdependency of big platforms to the services provided by Chainlink oracles. However, this analysis does not have the data to measure that risk quantitatively at this point. Chainlink\u2019s own terms of service covers some of these risk factors.  Circulating supply increase risk: The total supply of LINK tokens is capped at 1 billion according to ICO terms. However, this analysis has shown that the initial circulating supply, initially at 350 million LINK, has been increasing since July 2019. Addresses identified to belong to the team have been selling LINK into the market. As the analysis has not identified official documentation covering a vesting schedule for treasury tokens, it indicates a potential risk of sell offs in a short interval of time. In case of such events occurring, this could cause significant downward pressure in the asset price and by extent on vault liquidations.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 2% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai For parameter suggestion, the team has used the model described in the governance call here: a credit risk model that estimates the loss distribution of a portfolio of LINK Vaults. Risk parameters are estimated from this hypothetical loss distribution. Inputs to the model are derived from trading volume data along with stressed input parameters. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for ETH, with the exception of the lot size that has been normalized to a ~$50,000 amount Beyond the actual model outputs, our analysis of LINK indicates this asset still has a set of noticeable risks (see summary of risks) which point to a cautious and progressive approach to parameter setting. Our proposal here is to collect live vault data which assists in determining whether model expected performance fits the actual performance of vaults. And from there, adjusting risk parameters (e.g debt ceiling, risk premium, liquidation ratio) to actual data. However, despite simulating for a conservative 3 - 5m debt ceiling, we are conscious that the community may have other priorities such as a higher level of risk appetite for this asset. For this reason, the community input may affect the actual final recommendation for governance voting on LINK.

In the stress testing approach, the risk premium has got a certain level of relationship to other input parameters such as debt ceiling, but not uniquely DC. A number of variables influence each other in the simulation, not necessarily in a linear fashion by the way. Second consideration, which is closer to your question, is the external relationship between collateral types and their related risk premium output variables. In this case, the influence of one output (RP) from one collateral type (e.g. ETH) on another output (RP from LINK) requires a wider portfolio view in a sort of \u201cmulti-factor\u201d simulation. It is certainly an interesting suggestion which requires a bit of investigation/further modelling to cater for those external relationship between modelled simulations. ",

Compound Labs has raised $33.2M from several well-known investors in the crypto space, like Polychain capital, a16z and Coinbase Ventures. Compound v1 launched in September 2018 and the v2 version launched in May 2019, being one of the first operational DeFi protocols on Ethereum. In June this year, Compound released COMP governance token and transitioned into DAO. Rougly 50% of COMP tokens were distributed between mentioned investors and team members, while the rest was reserved for distribution between users of the protocol via liquidity mining. Liquidity mining is issuing COMP tokens linearly each block, which will last for 4 years. COMP total supply will be 10M tokens. COMP token allows for delegation of votes to another address and a certain threshold of voting weight is required to propose a change to the protocol, making governance organized and effective. Compound managed to attract large amounts of capital into the protocol after they initiated liquidity mining and arguably, started a new trend of \u201cliquidity mining or farming\u201d in crypto, which largely impacted the state of the DeFi economy and demand for Dai as a domestic stablecoin on Ethereum. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues COMP is widely present across CEX venues including Coinbase Pro, Binance, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Huobi Global, OKEx, Kucoin and others. The following exchanges which represent the majority of real trading volume are Binance, Coinbase and Huobi, which were also used for trading volume aggregation. Some venues like OKEx and Kucoin also report significant trading activity, but due to relatively proportionally smaller asset deposits in their custody we omitted the activity from the time series. On the DEX or non-custodial trading venues, COMP is present across the majority of popular venues, but the vast majority of trading activity in this group comes from UniswapV2 COMP-ETH pool which had an average daily trading volume of $2.56M since inception of the market. The median aggregated daily trading volume across all included venues in the analysis since Coinbase listing on 6/23/2020 is $14.2M, which is large relative to other \u201cnon-native\u201d collateral assets currently in MCD. Chart1600\u00d7989 198 KB Source of data; CryptoCompare (CEX), Uniswap.info, Kyber Tracker, 0xTracker Token distribution & Issuance schedule In total there will be 10M COMP tokens. Initially, 24% of tokens were allocated to Compound Labs shareholders (Coinbase VC, Polychain, a16z and others) and ~26% were allocated to Compound founders & team, which are subject to 4-year vesting. Finally, ~50% is allocated for liquidity mining. The issuance schedule for liquidity mining will release ~2880 tokens daily or approximately 9.5% of total supply per year. As we are currently in the beginning stages of the public distribution (only 243k COMP earned to date), the initial shareholders hold a large majority of circulating supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues Majority of tokens in custodial venues are deposited in Coinbase and Binance. OKEx and Kucoin have much smaller token custody compared to Binance and Coinbase, which signals that their reported trading volume might be inflated and is not reliable. As seen on the chart below, UniswapV2 holds more tokens compared to Binance, which is positive as the liquidity is accessible at any time. Chart1200\u00d7742 21.3 KB Source of data: Nansen-d5 Downside Risk COMP just entered its fourth month of trading, thus downside risk analysis is not something we can rely on for modeling jump risks. COMP also did not exist during the events of Black Thursday, where the majority of crypto assets realized their most severe negative returns. The largest daily pullback of COMP was -36%, which occurred shortly after token liquidity mining distribution started, and is more related to initial price discovery than serious price pullback due to market conditions and uncertainty. (Note; considered time-period for COMP is much shorter than ETH in this analysis) Chart1200\u00d7742 7.54 KB Source of data: CoinMarketCap Summary of Notable Risks  Given that COMP is a relatively new asset, historical data is not indicative. Additionally, due to fast changing DeFi ecosystems and development, we will monitor its development and reevaluate when necessary. Compound Labs shareholders were allocated a very large token amount (~24% of total supply & ~93% of current circulating supply), which gives them dominant power over the protocol\u2019s governance and ability to sell the tokens and influence the price disproportionally to other potential holders (farmers and others who acquired the token on the open market). Compound protocol like any other collateralization based protocol is exposed to the risk of insolvency, which could potentially be reflected in the COMP token price, which would occur simultaneously with large market sell-off. In the instance of appetite for yield farming and/or general DeFi space cooling down, COMP linear issuance schedule would continuously apply selling pressure potentially driving the price down.

Outline  Proposed risk parameters Background Industry analysis Peer analysis Asset originator analysis Lending process Levels of risk Borrower analysis Token issuer analysis Implementation details Proposed covenants   Proposed Risk Parameters Debt Ceiling: 2M DAI Stability Fee: 6% Min Vault CR: 105% Min SPV CR: 109% Min Vault Underlying CR: 114% Liquidation Process: MIP22  Background ConsolFreight is a SaaS freight technology provider that focuses on enabling digital transformation and integrating a network of entities engaged in international trade. The company connects a network of small/medium sized freight forwarders under its logistics platform (ForwardTogether). Their goal is to grow a trusted ecosystem of freight forwarding partners where entities can have access to digitalisation, business and financing solutions, including the use of blockchain and smart contracts. ConsolFreight, the Asset Originator, is applying to use Maker MCD as a credit line to originate new loans against both its tokenized freight invoices (CFactoring) and trade financing (Trade Forward) solutions. Centrifuge Tinlake will act as the backend tokenization platform for ConsolFreight collateralized assets. In a global supply chain environment where trade opportunities and financing are increasingly verticalized around big players, from shipping to banking, ConsolFreight\u2019s network is positioned as a niche ecosystem for SMEs, centred on freight operators. References:  [CF-DROP] MIP6 Application: ConsolFreight DROP: Tokenized Freight Shipping Invoices MIP22: Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module   Industry analysis There are two types of collateral under study for this risk assessment: freight invoice financing (factoring & reverse factoring) and trade finance of cargo. ConsolFreight\u2019s business model and collaterals under study are directly related to the state of the international trade of merchandise, i.e. physical goods.  Trends in Trade Finance It is estimated that the dollar value of world exports was USD 18.89 trillion in 2019, according to the WTO. While trade was already in slight decline YoY (0.1%), due to geopolitical tensions and slowed growth, world trade of goods is set to decline between 13% and 32% in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. North America and Asia exports will likely be hit hardest. Several recovery scenarios are possible for coming years. The path will depend on policy responses, impacts to global supply chain actors (manufacturers etc) and spending by businesses and households. World merchandise trade volume, 2000\u20112022 Index, 2015=100 source: WTO  1000\u00d7689 42.6 KB  Global trade is supported by financing the flow of goods through credit (trade finance). It is estimated that only about 9 trillion of the total global trade uses trade credit, mainly via banking \u201cletters of credit\u201d (L/C) and documentary trade. Before the pandemic that finance gap was a USD 1.5 trillion/year of unmet trade capacity. With covid19, the ICC estimates the trade credit market gap has widened to USD 1.9 - 5 trillion necessary to allow a V-shaped recovery to 2019 levels. This unmet demand affects mainly SMEs which account for the highest rejection rates in trade credit. Globally, it is estimated that the rejection rate of trade finance to SMEs is 45%. These companies either don\u2019t have an \u201cacceptable\u201d credit history or cannot afford high operational costs (see below) required to satisfy traditional lender requirements.   Industry concentration, reduced banking-originated credit and digitalisation are the other big trends of the last decade. Given their share of global trade and control over the supply chain, large corporations and the shipment industry have increasingly integrated and concentrated the market. This has led to a shift from trade credit (L/C) to open account transactions between big players where goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due. In addition, these companies have been investing heavily in platforms and digitalization of manual processes for the various actors in their closed ecosystem. A whole \u201cTradetech\u201d and Blockchain industry has formed around these consortia to support their integration and financing. This includes the digitalisation of banking-led financing (L/C and documentary collection).   These trends have largely excluded the integration with freight forwarders, smaller logistic players and SMEs, left out of both digitalisation and financing opportunities. ConsolFreight\u2019s freight forwarder network and its suite of digital tools and financing intend to fill that gap in the market.   Default rates Default rates in trade finance banking products have remained very low in the last decade. Exposure-weighted default rate for import L/C was only 0.14% in 2018. It\u2019s generally a very low rate when compared to other asset classes. Given the under representation of SMEs in banking trading finance it is important to note these figures (default rate, LGD, EL) may not be fully representative of that cohort.    Factoring Factoring, receivables factoring or debtor financing, is when a company buys a debt or invoice from another company. Overall the global factoring market has seen a growth of over 5 % to an estimated 2019 volume of 3,495 billion USD compared with the previous year\u2019s 3,308 billion USD. At a regional level, Europe, the largest contributor, makes up 68% of the total, with 2,372 billion USD. This shows an overall growth of more than 8%. The Asia Pacific region accounted for 23% of the global volume with 816 billion USD which indicates a drop of just under 2% compared to the 2018 level of 831 billion USD. The Americas together are in third position with 8% share of the total world factoring volume. The overall value was 264 billion USD, a growth of less than 5%. Within that region, South and Central America have a 5% share of the total world factoring volume with a value of 160 billion USD which is a 10% increase. Argentina (+34%) Chile (+26%) and Peru (+15%) are key markets in that region. With a value of under 104 billion USD, North America suffers from the drop in Chinese trade with a decrease just short of 4%. Factoring is expected to grow rapidly in Africa. Currently the value of the African market sits at roughly 28 billion USD with a growth of 10%. That is due to the contribution of more mature players like South Africa (+11%) and Egypt (+13%).  Default Rates Reliable default rates for factoring have not been identified. The exposure-weighted default rate for Supply Chain Finance (SCF) Payables Finance was low at 0.13% in 2018, a 0.02% increase compared to 2017 level of 0.011%.  Peer analysis This section is about providing details of the asset originator main competitors. This can be used as a benchmark when comparing financials with peers in the industry to have a relative measure of health of the business. As described above the key focus of ConsolFreight is on logistic providers that have been largely excluded from the industry concentration around multinationals and on SMEs who don\u2019t have access to Letters of Credit. Whilst there is a movement in the industry of digitalising the Letter of Credit process this includes large multinational companies and banks, not the logistics providers who also face high operational costs as a barrier to entry. ConsolFreight has a number of competitors in the Factoring and Trade Finance space. This analysis will look at the key ones.  Factoring Out of the key competitors in Factoring, Paycargo is the main competitor for ConsolFreight because they both operate in the same competitive logistics market. Paycargo was founded in 2005 and aims to simplify the payment process for faster cargo movement for their customers. Their network includes around 3000 vendors, including large companies such as Hapag Lloyd, Hamburg Sud and Air France to name but a few. Paycargo\u2019s headquarters are located in Florida, USA. The company employs an estimated 50 staff and has an approximate annual revenue of $8m. In addition, it has been announced that Paycargo raised $35m from Insight for its cloud based payment and financing services. The CEO, Eduardo del Riego who joined Paycargo in 2013 has extensive industry experience. Qwil was founded in 2015 and offers an automated global payments and liquidity solution that allows suppliers to get paid how, when, and wherever they choose. There is no further indication of that solution being limited to specific industries. The company\u2019s headquarters are located in San Francisco, USA. The three founders bring IT, blockchain and start-up experience. The estimated annual revenue according to www.owler.com is $3m. Other competitors in the factoring space include Universal Funding Corp, Grenke and Bibby. They offer factoring across a range of industries. For Bibby this includes export and transport so there is an element of competition with ConsolFreight. However, in the case of Bibby these are just two areas out of many that they offer factoring services.  Trade Finance TradeIX was founded in 2016 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. Additional offices are located in London and Singapore. TradeIX is a leading provider of technology for global trade and supply chains that enables their customers, partners, and stakeholders to transact and exchange data smarter, faster, safer, and with more transparency. In 2017 they implemented the first ever blockchain enabled trade finance transaction. TradeIX is an award-winning Fintech company that is proud to work with well known financial institutions and companies in the world including ING, BNP Paribas, Accenture, DHL, AIG, R3, Microsoft, and Oracle Netsuite. TradeIX is managed by a team of over 120 staff with experience in blockchain technology, trade finance and enterprise software. According to www.owler.com the annual revenue is just under $5m but expects it will be generating more than $100m in annual revenue by 2021. MODIFI was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. The company currently employs more than 30 employees and has an annual revenue of $4.9m. The amount of total funding is $8.5m. Modifi aims to empower SME businesses to trade internationally with digital trade financing. Other competitors include Komgo, We.Trade and Tradeteq.  Asset originator analysis Focus on the asset originator and the kind of business that will be conducted in the SPV. Founded in 2016 ConsolFreight specialises in providing liquidity to the Logistics industry and international commerce parties (buyer/sellers). The services that are provided relevant to this study include:   Freight Factoring (factoring of own invoices, reverse factoring of own invoices and reverse factory of supplier\u2019s invoices) is a service provided to Freight Forwarders.  Trade Finance is a service provided to buyers and sellers involved mostly in international trade transactions of goods.  ConsolFreight headquarters are based in Miami, USA, with operations in Barcelona (Spain) and Dublin (Ireland) and a rapidly expanding team. The founding team is made up of: Ernesto Vila CEO/Founder 20 + years of logistics industry experience. Founded Double Ace Cargo, a Freight forwarding company with +25MM sales. Alejandro Gutierrez CSO/ Co-Founder 10 + years of experience in supply chain management, logistics and procurement and strong background working with high profile companies in the industry and consulting. Jose Maria Sola Member of the Board/ Co-Founder 15 years of logistics industry experience. Founder of SC Line Shipping Company and Fast Terminal, from which he successfully exited. At time of writing Consolfreight has deployed 865,000 USD in 3 pools (CF1, CF2 and CF3) of funds all using Tinlake. A fourth pool is currently ongoing with a 445K DAI value at time of writing. The forecast for ConsolFreight is looking as follows: Freight invoice factoring  By December 2020 have all 31 members of the network using the factoring solution Each member submitting 10 invoices per month The average invoice value of US$ 5000.00 Total monthly invoice factoring protected by December US$ 1,550,000.00  Trade Finance  By December 2020 have all 31 members of the network using the trade finance solution 50% of the members submitting 1 invoices per month The average invoice value of US$ 65,000.00 Total monthly invoice factoring projected by December US$ 1,007,500.00  During the latest seed round in November 2020 ConsoFreight raised $438.5K.  The scope of this analysis excludes fraud/ AML/ KYC assessment of ConsolFreight so no comprehensive information gathering and analysis of judgement proceedings, bankruptcies or insolvencies of the originator (current or historic) or any of its directors and related entities has been performed.   Lending process This section describes the operational lending process used by the asset originator to originate new loans that are then collateralised. It also covers any internal due diligence processes followed to onboard assets, including how the asset originator manages risks in its loan book.  Factoring/Reverse factoring The following diagram describes the lending process facilitated by ConsolFreight with regards to factoring (left) and reverse factoring (right) to freight forwarders. ConsolFreight provides the following lending facilities:  One type of factoring on account receivable invoices from clients of freight forwarders (supplier) Two types of reverse factoring, on freight forwarders\u2019 own invoices (receivables) and on freight forwarders\u2019 suppliers invoices (payables)  In both cases, invoices are the collateralized assets that have been tokenized in the Tinlake pool (NFTs) against the issuance of a credit line (in DAI) to Consolfreight. However, as we\u2019ll see later on, the major bearer of credit risk will be a different party depending on the type of factoring applied. According to Consolfreight, a typical process of onboarding freight forwarders to provide its factoring/reverse factoring occurs like this:  Freight Forwarder applies to join the Forward Together Network  When the Freight Forwarder has been approved in the network, they can apply for liquidity using the portal Freight Factoring Application  Freight Forwarder submits an application (if new to the platform) and uploads the assets (invoices) it needs working capital against. Consolfreight conducts due diligence on the Freight Forwarder and its counterparty. It assesses the assets and provides a proposal including terms and conditions (advance rate, interest rate, repayment terms, etc). Typical advance rate will be less than 100% of face value, plus interest. Freight Forwarder accepts terms and conditions offered by ConsolFreight. Consolfreight transfers funds in advance to the Freight Forwarder.  In the case of factoring:  On maturity of the invoice or obligation the client (payor) of the Freight Forwarder (payee) pays the service (factoring) to ConsolFreight SPV.  In the case of reverse factoring either:   Own invoice type: the payee will receive funds from ConsolFreight. On maturity of the invoice (receivables) the Freight Forwarder (payee) will pay the invoice directly to Consolfreight SPV plus interest.  OR   Supplier\u2019s invoice type: the payor will receive funds from ConsolFreight. On maturity of the invoice (payables) the Freight Forwarder (payee) will pay the invoice directly to Consolfreight SPV plus interest.   Personal - RWA - Lending - factoring process1273\u00d7785 127 KB  Due diligence ConsolFreight has designed its own internal counterparty onboarding, risk assessment and pricing framework to lend against collateralised invoices (factoring and reverse factoring). The framework is designed to assess risk in both the parties involved (e.g. buyer and freight forwarder) as well as in the transaction. Here is a summary of the assessment steps:   Suitability assessment: vetting process as FFs need to be onboarded as members into ConsolFreight\u2019s Forward Together network before submitting invoices.  External assessment: credit information data gathering on the freight forwarder applicant using company registration via Euler Hermes (insurance) oracle.  Internal assessment: operational assessment on technical capabilities of FF to operate efficiently and legally (licenses, years in operation, media presence, customer/partner references). Approval at this stage enables applicants to request for liquidity on invoices.  Risk scoring: scoring will be the first gate for a transaction approval on request for liquidity. Scoring methodology and pricing terms will change depending on type of service from the freight forwarder\u2019s (FF) perspective and the bearer of risk.    Factoring own invoice: ConsolFreight uses a 5 point scale over 4 criteria focused primarily on payor (Buyer): payor creditworthiness, frequency and length of relationship between parties (payee-payor), industry health rating, country rating  Reverse factoring of own invoice: ConsolFreight uses a 5 point scale over 4 criteria focused primarily on payee (FF): payee creditworthiness, frequency and length of relationship between parties, industry health rating, country rating  Reverse factoring of supplier\u2019s invoice: ConsolFreight uses a 5 point scale over 4 criteria focused primarily on payor (FF): payor creditworthiness, frequency and length of relationship between parties, industry health rating, payor country rating    Pricing: the sum of the scores obtained is then mapped out to an overall score and related rating (A-F). For each risk bucket, ConsolFreight defines terms of funding (advance rate, financing cost of money APR). Terms can change for:    Factoring: From no financing to 100% advance rate  Reverse factoring (both types): From no financing to 95% advance rate   Note that ConsolFreight is going through a model enhancement process with Experian. Updates are pending and the Risk team will be notified.   Default handling process ConsolFreight claims to have a 0% default rate on its portfolio. The following diagram describes a typical mitigation process followed whenever a risk of non payment arises:  Personal - RWA - Factoring collections (1)776\u00d71287 98.3 KB  The write-off schedule for the Tinlake pool is as follows:     Write-off Event     10% If overdue by 2 days and no payment arrangement set up (step 4)   25% If no agreement is set at beginning of collection process (step 5)   50% If the invoice is sent to collection agency (step 6)   75% If no agreement is set after 60 days (step 7)   100% Final write-off after all recoveries are collected     Trade Finance The following diagram describes the lending process facilitated by ConsolFreight with regards to its trade financing service. As opposed to factoring, ConsolFreight here offers a service and risk assessment focused on buyers (importer) and sellers (exporter) of goods. Freight Forwarders act as intermediaries recommended by ConsolFreight in the organisation of shipment of cargo with carriers. Most importantly, Freight Forwarders are bearers of the custody of the physical goods via the Bill of Lading. This document is the main proof of a contract between a shipper and a seller. It serves as a receipt when the goods being shipped arrive at their destination. It is evidence of shipment and proof of receipt of the goods by the carrier from the company providing the goods for shipment.  From Maker\u2019s perspective, the associated invoices and Bill of Lading (title of goods) are the collateralized assets that have been tokenized in the Tinlake pool (NFTs) against the issuance of a credit line (in DAI) to Consolfreight.  According to Consolfreight, a typical process of onboarding buyers and sellers to provide its trade financing service occurs like this:  A buyer has a request for trade finance service from ConsolFreight The buyer, if new to the platform, will apply to be accepted in the platform Trade Finance Application loading all data requested for KYC and AML Consolfreight will assess data submitted by the user and approve or deny the application If application is accepted, the user/buyer will be able to apply for Trade Finance loading the required documentation and assets. Consolfreight conducts a due diligence on the transaction and if accepted provides a proposal including terms and conditions (advance rate, interest rate, repayment terms, %deposit, etc) The buyer accepts terms and transfers deposit to Consolfreight SPV bank account Consolfreight SPV transfers funds (prepayment) to the seller of the transaction. The seller starts a transaction for manufacturing or preparing goods to be shipped When the product is ready for dispatch, Consolfreight nominates a freight forwarder of the network that will take custody of the goods transported. Consolfreight proceeds to finalise payment to the seller. Goods arrive at destination and buyer pays the service to Consolfreight When payment is received Consolfreight proceeds to release Bill of Lading.   Personal - RWA - Lending - trade finance process1311\u00d7762 103 KB  Due diligence ConsolFreight has a different risk assessment process for trade finance, although keeping a  multi-phased approach. Process is somewhat stricter and more comprehensive on both parties of the transaction (buyer/importer and seller/exporter). Here is a summary of the steps:   External assessment: credit information data gathering on the buyer and seller using company register inputs via Euler Hermes (insurance) oracle. Both parties require clearing.  Internal assessment: further documentation required to assess legitimacy, health of business and creditworthiness on both parties (articles of incorporation, bank account ownership, 3x bank statements, proof of transactions between parties). Validation of documentation at this stage enables applicants to move to scoring and pricing terms.  Risk scoring: scoring will be the first gate for a transaction approval on request for liquidity. ConsolFreight uses a 5 point scale over 5 criteria focused on both buyer and seller: frequency and value of transactions within the network, frequency and length of relationship between parties (buyer-seller), seller industry health rating, buyer industry health rating, buyer country rating  Pricing: the sum of the scores obtained is then mapped out to an overall score and related rating (A-F). For each risk bucket, ConsolFreight defines terms of funding (advance rate, maximum deposit, financing cost of money APR). Advance rate terms go from 0-80% and maximum deposit up to 20%.  It is worth noting that Euler Hermes (Allianz) assesses every shipper before providing credit insurance coverage. They may also underwrite based on their own risk scorecard. Default handling process ConsolFreight claims to have a 0% default rate on its portfolio. The following diagram describes a typical mitigation process followed whenever a risk of non payment arises:  Personal - RWA - Trade finance collections (1)828\u00d71207 98.6 KB  The write-off schedule for the Tinlake pool is as follows:     Write-off Event     10% If the cargo is moved to a bonded warehouse and there is no payment arrangement (step 4)   50% If the cargo is offered to the FF network or loaded into the liquidation partners webpages (step 6)   100% Final write-off after the cargo is liquidated     Levels of Risk This section describes and analyses the different categories of risks possibly impacting the collateralized assets. The goal is to provide a summarised approach to assist Risk teams in the overall Risk Management of these assets through policies and covenants. Credit risk and operational risks are the biggest risks for the collateral under study.  Credit Risk  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty in a transaction is unable or unwilling to make payments on its obligations. In international trade, it also includes a counterparty\u2019s ability and willingness to make physical delivery of goods (trade finance). Third, global trade includes the counterparty\u2019s ability and willingness to produce the ordered goods.  Other risks associated with credit risk are country, sector and type of security for pledged collateral (e.g. invoices, goods). Country risk gives a macro-level assessment of a country associated with a transaction and the risk of non-payment for companies in that country. ConsolFreight summarises this risk using a medium-term country grade (A-D) considering macroeconomic, business environment and political factors. Sector-level risk considers the outlook for industrial sectors in a given country and the risk of non-payment of those companies. It looks at demand, profitability, liquidity and business environment, then summarises this risk to a qualitative metric (from \u201cvery favourable\u201d to \u201crecognised crisis\u201d). ConsolFreight uses Euler Hermes\u2019 framework for determining both country and sector risk on a collateral transaction level. Based on the first 3 Tinlake ConsolFreight pools, we can state that: Factoring  Factoring (factoring and reverse factoring) made up 74% of all collateral One single freight forwarder accounted for 23.4% (197K) of all factoring portfolio The top 4 freight forwarders accounted for more than 53% of all factoring portfolio 58% of invoice value is linked to payors from medium-higher risk graded (B-D) countries 41% of all invoice value is associated with one single country, though an A graded one Factoring had some sector diversity (38% logistics) while reverse factoring (83% logistics) is very concentrated, however reverse had 3.6x higher collateral value Given the relative size of reverse factoring, the primary credit risk is on freight forwarders themselves, both as payee (own invoice) and payor (supplier\u2019s invoice)  Trade Finance  Trade finance made up 58% of all collateral value in CF3 One single buyer represented 76% of the trade finance loan advanced and as much as 67% of all loan advanced in CF3 Small portfolios for trade finance concentrate single buyer and single loan risk as trade finance deals tend towards 50-150K in size Both country and sector risks were concentrated. But the data sample is too insignificant Credit risk lies on the buyer (capacity and willingness to pay) as well as on the exporter i.e. capacity to produce and deliver the goods.  ConsolFreight mitigates the seller\u2019s delivery risk through its incoterms (EXW), transferring risk to the freight forwarder/buyer early in the shipping process.  Market Risk  Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors can affect the value of a transaction. Two primary sources can be interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Rising interest rates can reduce the present value of future interest and principal payments while changes in foreign exchange can reduce the value of payments when translated back into the base currency used.  For trade finance and invoice factoring, we consider both risks to be low and mostly mitigated by the structure of the loan-backed portfolio.  These loans are of short maturity, so floating rate commitments can be well managed through careful governance. Foreign exchange risk is also low. Nearly all transactions performed by the asset originator and end borrowers are denominated in USD. So the risk is on keeping the stability of the DAI peg through the maturity of the pools (30-90 days mostly).   Liquidity Risk  Both collateral assets have a different degree of liquidity. Underlying freight invoices (receivables or payables) can be a relatively liquid market with a number of factor companies operating. Trade finance is illiquid by nature.  A few characteristics related to trade finance liquidity:  There is no or little secondary market for trade finance assets (yet) Both liquidation and redemption requests on existing assets can take more than 30 days On the bright side, short maturity allows the Risk team to propose input parameter adjustments to credit quality in a period of market insecurity   Operational Risk  Operational risk in global trade can be complex and involve a lot of documentation and legal oversight and monitoring. There are various jurisdiction boundaries and agreements that may impact the ability to secure payments and collateral. Relying on the asset originator having a well designed legal and administrative process is crucial.  Here are some operational risks in trade finance: (non-exhaustive)   Eligibility risk: some jurisdictions may have restrictions on financing arrangement and impose controls on transactions and freeze assets e.g. OFAC in the US  Counterparty & fraud risk: inability to obtain timely, reliable and accurate information from the counterparty (buyer, seller, carrier, freight forwarder) to manage risk at each point in the cargo transaction  Legal risk: poorly designed and monitored documentation that can lead to loss of securing collateral  Payment risk: risk of not being able to collect collateral assets through collection agencies in overseas jurisdictions  Damage or loss of goods: risks of having goods damaged in transit or incorrect quantities/qualities than specified leading to disputes and delayed payments  A thorough review of all these risks is out of the scope of this assessment. However, ConsolFreight claims to have in place a number of risk mitigants including:  Use of offshore companies for liquidation of distressed assets Independent inspection and valuation of collateral (cargo) by third party agents.This service is contracted depending on collateral estimated value e.g. SGS, Bureau Veritas Enforcement of shipping insurance before approving financing to collateral Presence of IoT (RFID) to track and monitor flow of cargo. This will depend on value of collateral Internal due diligence on both buyer and seller described above Use of its own internal freight forwarder network and trade financing as the hub for exchange and hosting of both physical and financial information   Borrower analysis The borrower analysis takes a closer look at the top six customers of ConsolFreight by invoice loan advance value (loan value > $30K each). The total list of borrowers provided by ConsolFreight includes 32 entities.

Issuance platform analysis ConsolFreight has partnered with Centrifuge to facilitate tokenization of its assets (invoices and bill of lading). Centrifuge is a German start-up that was founded in 2017 and provides decentralised asset finance. Centrifuge is known to Maker from previous POCs, community proposals and the extension of its platform to integrate with Maker vaults and smart contracts. The Centrifuge tokenization platform Tinlake allows Asset Originators to access a decentralized line of credit backed by their real-world assets. The Asset originator can issue DROP tokens that are deposited into a Maker vault in order to borrow DAI against these redemption tokens. Simultaneously, other DROP (junior tranche) and TIN (senior tranche) tokens are offered to external investors or purchased by the asset originator itself. TIN tokens offer protection to junior tranches by absorbing the first losses in the portfolio. The protocol coordinates the various parties required to structure, administer, and finance collateralized pools of assets categorized by type and risk (for example, invoices, mortgages, auto loans, or royalties). Asset Originators using Tinlake can benefit from financing flexibility through simplified processes and reduced cost.  This allows them to optimize risk allocation and access instant funding from DeFi or their traditional investors. Any Asset Originators using the Centrifuge platform are expected to deal with defaults in their portfolio following usual processes. The Maker liquidation model must account for this accordingly, discussed below.  Implementation details ConsolFreight\u2019s implementation uses the Centrifuge Model. Let us cover some important dynamics. The issuance of senior (DROP) and junior (TIN) tokens is managed by Securitize. It follows AML/KYC compliance based on US securities rules. For US residents only accredited investors can invest in these instruments. The SPV (ConsolFreight) issues DROP tokens for the Maker vault so that the SPV can mint DAI against NFTs deposits. The liquidation mechanism of Maker vault is defined by MIP22. Liquidation is triggered when the TIN value falls below the minimum collateralization ratio set by the governance to the asset originator (ConsolFreight). As opposed to crypto-native assets, there are no keeper auctions to liquidate assets in the vault. Centrifuge has developed some mechanisms to stop new loan generation should the liquidation be triggered.  1280\u00d7720 133 KB  The following process map shows the sequence of possible events at different stages of the risk mitigation process: Centrifuge has designed an internal feature to protect DROP tokens. A TIN-adjusted collateral ratio (set at 118% for ConsolFreight) is triggered by the Centrifuge NAV model when the value moves below its expected point (TIN is 15%). It causes the Tinlake pool to freeze further investment in DROP until the asset originator either increases its TIN investment or adjusts the portfolio. Once adjustments are done, the pool continues its operation. Whenever a liquidation is activated, all DROP from the Maker vault is withdrawn and any funds reaching the Tinlake pools will be \u201creserved\u201d to redeem DROP token holders. To prevent this extreme measure, a multi-staged approach has been designed to capture any warning signs coming from the underlying portfolio that allow time for preventive actions. This involves working closely with the asset originator to implement Risk mitigations (See Covenants). At each stage of the mitigation process, the Risk team will assess the course of action and propose either to reduce the debt ceiling or to activate liquidations. Given the nature of ConsolFreight\u2019s business model, it is recommended to allow sufficient time so that they can implement mitigations in the portfolio, including engaging in a debt collection process. For factoring and trade finance this can be a relatively quick process, from a few weeks to a couple of months. The Risk team will ensure other preventive actions are in place by analysing the performance of the portfolio on a monthly basis and through monitoring dashboards.  1148\u00d7871 121 KB  ",

Allowed investments List the kind of investment that the SPV can make. Try to be as specific as possible. The investments allowed by the SPV are freight invoice financing (factoring and reverse factoring) due in up to 75 days and trade finance on cargo of up to 120 day duration. Advance rate allowed are up to 100% and 95% for A-rated entities for factoring and reverse factoring, respectively. Maximum advance rate for trade finance deals is 80% where a maximum deposit rate of 20% applies, both for A-rated entities only.  Exceptionally, the SPV may carry complex trade financing activities of up to 180 days in duration. These deals may only be approved on a case by case basis, subject to review of due diligence documentation by the Risk team. By default, advance deposits on these are capped at 10%.  Any changes to scoring inputs or methodology needs to be communicated to the Risk team. A Risk team member will join a model change committee led by the SPV to ensure transparency in the methology used. Also, the mapping between SPV risk scores and financing terms must be consistent. A table of ConsolFreight internal ratings and financing terms is provided below: Factoring     Risk rating Score Advance rate     A 17-20 Up to 100%   B 13-16 Up to 100%   C 9-12 Up to 95%   D 5-8 Up to 95%   F 1-4 No financing approved (\u201cRisk cut-off\u201d)    Reverse factoring     Risk rating Score Advance rate     A 17-20 Up to 95%   B 13-16 Up to 90%   C 9-12 Up to 80%   D 5-8 Up to 70%   F 1-4 No financing approved (\u201cRisk cut-off\u201d)    Trade finance     Risk rating Score Advance rate Maximum Deposit %     A 45-50 Up to 80% 20%   B 40-44 Up to 70% 20%   C 30-39 Up to 60% 10%   D 20-29 Up to 50% 10%   F 5-20 No financing approved      Minimum overcollateralization ratio Maker sets a minimum collateralization ratio to protect collateral in the Maker vault. This ratio is set between the pool value (100%) and the TIN-Adjusted Collateration Ratio (TACR). TACR is set at 118% (Pool / DROP = 100% / 85%). Given an average loan of $9K, a vault size of $2M and an average LGD of 25%, the TACR could decrease from 118% to 112% if 10 average defaults occurred. To allow for 15 defaults, the Minimum Collateralization Ratio is set at 109%.  Collateralization ratio formula This Risk team is setting up a model to track the value of the underlying trade finance and freight invoice portfolio. This will allow us to monitor the change in value on the Tinlake pool.  Due to confidentiality requirements, this sheet won\u2019t be made publicly available unless consented otherwise by the SPV/ConsolFreight.  ConsolFreight will provide updates of their loan portfolio on a monthly basis to enable the Risk to perform ongoing monitoring and raise any concerns on its performance. We expect this data to be enhanced with as many third party data sources as practical to allow cross validation of data on the health and value of the portfolio, such as inspection and valuation of cargo goods and data ensuring mitigation of operational risks (see \u201cLevels of risk\u201d). The debt amount is the one on the Maker vault but also the amount subscribed by other co-investors. It is important to note that the DROP supply is the sum of DROP in the Maker vault plus DROP allowed to other co-investors. Other investors can participate in the pools with either TIN or DROP. ConsolFreight will be the primary TIN investor at the start.  Collateralization ratio proposed threshold ConsolFreight proposed a TIN proportion of 15% of the Tinpool. As a result, the DROP proportion is 85% and the pool/DROP ratio of 118%, also referred to as TACR (see above). Maker proposes a minimum collateralization ratio (MCR) of 109% of all pool DROP. Maker vault will likely be the largest DROP holder. It will have a collateralization ratio of 105% which creates a discount of DROP for the vault. The stability fee proposed for the vault corresponds to a single-B yield bond index at 5%. We believe ConsolFreight needs to take steps toward diversifying the risk in its portfolio. In the future, the Risk team can review the SF downwards given some concentration risks are mitigated. Finally, we propose an underlying collateralization ratio of 114% (collateralization ratio * minimum collateralization ratio), also called pool/DAI loan ratio. To sum up, there will be three levers for action:   TIN-adjusted collateralization ratio, triggers Tinlake pool actions  Minimum collateralization ratio (MCR), triggers Maker actions  Vault collateralization ratio (CR), relates to DROP in the Maker vault  The initial proposed Debt Ceiling is 2M DAI. We propose to review this upwards every revolving pool opening subject to ConsolFreight evidence of reduction in concentration risks (see below).  Concentration risks Given the levels of risks observed in past ConsolFreight pools (See \u201cLevels of Risk\u201d) we propose the following covenants to mitigate risks: The asset originator must be transparent about any changes affecting its internal risk assessment score and methodology and how it impacts payment terms (e.g. advance rates, fees, maximum deposit rates). At a minimum, the monthly data provided must reflect consistency. A single loaned asset (either cargo or factoring) must not exceed 15% of the maximum Vault DC i.e. 300K The maximum exposure to any single borrower entity must not exceed 30% of the maximum Vault DC size (600K). It\u2019s expected that the percentage of exposure decreases as the vault size increases to mitigate risks. The following is the recommended maximum exposure for any single borrower:     Debt ceiling Max borrower exposure %     $2,000,000 30.0%   $3,000,000 20.0%   $4,000,000 15.0%   $5,000,000 12.0%   $6,000,000 10.0%    Additionally, for entities with a low creditworthiness factor in the risk scoring (less or equal to 3), the maximum borrower exposure in the portfolio is 10% of the DC i.e. 200K. Current pools have also a relatively high concentration risk on single countries and on countries with high risk grades, based on Euler Hermes ratings. No single country must have more than 40% of the Vault DC exposure (i.e.800K) and no high risk country (rated D) must exceed 25% of the Vault DC i.e. 500K. The following are some limits on portfolio allocation by country risk grade:     Country grade No more than Amount     A - AA 50% $1,000,000   B-BB 40% $800,000   C-CC 30% $600,000   D 25% $500,000    Another point of concern is the sector concentration in ConsolFreight pools. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the freight forwarder network, it is a risk hard to mitigate at this stage. As the business grows we will need to review this sector concentration.  Stakeholders rules The risk team has assessed that ConsolFreight is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months. This impression is based on an analysis of internal forecast models from the company. Analysis of past financial statements is pending. TIN investors are providing equity in the pool, and therefore it makes sense for the Asset Originator to be a primary investor in TIN. In addition, it could make sense to require a minimum level of DROP co-investors, as they could assist in enforcing contract rights, benefitting Maker. ConsolFreight should keep an exposure of $20K in the TIN tranche of the pool. The MakerDAO vault should not have more than 75% of the outstanding DROP share. ",

Both have been fully executed and are effective as of 14-July-2021. CitadelSPV (https://citadelspv.com/) has appointed Orlando Figueroa as independent manager and managing director making the SPV fully bankruptcy remote Every interested community member can register as a DROP Investor Representative to get full notification rights without the need to sign a DROP subscription agreement and to purchase DROP tokens individually. The independent manager will ensure that changes to the Executive Summary can only be executed if:  the SPV has notified all DROP Investors and DROP Investor Representatives about the change in an email with the Executive Summary attached including deleted, replaced, and new content; the SPV has posted these changes on the Maker forum the notification has happened at least 28 days ago there are no open DROP redemption requests  The last point gives MKR holders the ability to disagree with those changes. The Maker community has 28 days to do a vote and trigger the redemption of the DROP tokens in the Maker vault if there is a disagreement. The change cannot take place as long as this redemption is not fully satisfied, meaning all DROP tokens of the Maker vault are liquidated.

The 0x exchange process works by allowing market makers to signal their intent to trade a specific Ethereum asset at a certain price for a fixed period of time off-chain, where market takers may see and accept the trade by adding their cryptographic signature. The transaction is only settled on-chain and value is transferred between wallets as a final step facilitated by 0x smart contracts. 0x enables anyone to join the network as a relayer by maintaining an off-chain order book where makers and takers can discover one another. Transactions can be executed either point-to-point or broadcast through relayer-maintained order books.\u201d ZRX Token Value Accrual With the introduction of 0x v3 in 2019, the ZRX token accrues value in two ways:  Staked based liquidity rewards Governance function  Staked based liquidity incentive From the documentation: \u201cMarket makers (MMs) that stake ZRX tokens \u2014 directly or by proxy \u2014 receive a liquidity reward that is funded through a protocol fee applied to every 0x trade. The fee is denominated in ETH and deposited into a staking contract. Fees are pooled within the staking contract over a fixed window of time, which are referred to as an epoch. At the end of each epoch, MMs that stake ZRX tokens collect a portion of the accumulated pool. Liquidity rewards are a function of fees collected (which is supposed to be a proxy for volume) and ZRX staked (including delegated stake).\u201d The protocol fee for a trade equals 150k units of gas (this number is configurable) times the gas price. Once MMs collect their liquidity rewards at the end of each epoch, a predetermined percentage is shared with their ZRX pool holders. From the documentation: \u201cA market maker, for example, can increase their liquidity reward without exposing themselves to the price fluctuations of the ZRX token. Market makers, in turn, incentivize delegators to contribute their ZRX by paying them a portion of the liquidity reward.\u201d Governance function From the documentation: \u201cStaking pools can also be used to increase voting power. Delegators share a portion of their vote with the pool (50% of their vote goes to the pool operator and 50% is retained by the delegator), amplifying the pool\u2019s impact in governance over 0x. This allows stakers to form cliques within the greater governance system. Governance over the protocol is conducted by voting on ZEIPs (ZeroEx Improvement Proposals). A ZEIP generally corresponds to a modification or upgrade to the 0x protocol. The ecosystem votes on the proposal, collectively deciding whether the feature will be included in a future version of the protocol. One Staked ZRX equals one vote.\u201d Metrics and Analysis ZRX Token Metrics Daily Active Addresses There were roughly 700 daily active addresses in the last 2 years on average. This figure increased to ~1,000 in the last month due to the ZRX price rally. To put this figure into context, DAI has roughly 3,000 addresses interacting with the token daily. 1016\u00d7513 56.3 KB Source: Saniment Token velocity The token velocity is a rough gauge for how active or passive token holders are. In other words, it can describe how utilized the token is for its intended function (such as trading). Velocity for ZRX has been steadily increasing and indicates user adoption is growing. However, for staked tokens (that are not used as a currency) velocity becomes less meaningful. Chart1200\u00d7742 73.1 KB Source: Santiment Daily Onchain Transaction Volume (denominated in ZRX) Daily onchain transaction volume for ZRX measures about 50m on average and is increasing, although this metric might not be the most appropriate for measuring the health of networks that are staking-based. 1017\u00d7512 56 KB Source: Santiment Daily New Addresses About 2,000 new wallets holding ZRX are added daily, but the number has been trending slightly downward. 1016\u00d7510 50.1 KB Source: Santiment Token distribution, return & inflation metrics A third of the ZRX supply is still held by the team, although the largest chunk (15%) is reserved for incentivizing ecosystem development.

Looking at the seniority distribution below, about one third of the tokens have moved in the last year during the time the ZRX price stayed flat (although it experienced a significant price increase in recent weeks).

It is hard to estimate current holdings in fiat, but a large chunk of ETH was likely sold in the period between August and December 2017.

The low stake rate could be due to a relatively low yield on staked tokens (1.21% APR), likely due to low trading volume.

Protocol upgrades are of course executed on-chain, but others are executed offchain (i.e. APIs, libraries, toolings, project fundings).    Summary of Notable Risks:  Version 3 staking is still gaining traction, but currently the staking yield is low. Low profitability versus competitors in the DEX space. Low ZRX token volume on DEXes. The majority of ZRX trading happens only on Coinbase and Binance. Large amount of tokens on exchange: 55% of circulating supply Annual inflation of circulating supply up to 10% (due to token vesting), with one third of supply still locked. Roughly 11% of ZRX tokens are still in team vesting account. Shorting ZRX is available on Compound, Aave, Bitfinex and Binance. After the recent price increase, short open interest increased. Some reports indicate an overvalued ZRX token. Market cap of 0x measures 1.7x of Kyber, although Kyber makes significantly more money from fees. Most relayers don\u2019t have a defensible business model. Introducing additional fees may make 0x less competitive versus other protocols. Admin key can wind down the protocol.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 5 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 20 Dai Outline  Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Overview Protocol Summary KyberNetwork is an onchain decentralized exchange that aggregates liquidity from a variety of sources. Orders are relayed to the network via integration partners. KyberNetwork has five main stakeholders.  Reserves or market makers. These are market makers who set limit orders in the network via different types of reserves. There are three main types of reserves: Feed Price Reserves (market making strategy based on an oracle price feed); Automated Price Reserves that use an algorithmic smart contract (similar to the Uniswap bonding curve); and lastly Orderbook Reserves (where one can set a limit price). Integration partners. These are \u201cmerchants\u201d, dapps, or services such as payment processors, wallets and other applications, that are integrated into the network and facilitate or bring market orders. The integration partners utilize liquidity from the reserves. KNC token holders. Currently, tokens accrue value via token burn, which is determined by network utilization. At the end of Q2 2020, KNC is scheduled to upgrade, adding additional governance features such as staking and voting. The protocol will then allocate a portion of network fees to stakers who also actively participate in governance decisions. Users will decide what portion of the cash flow will be used to acquire KNC for the token burn, and what portion will be directly distributed (similar to a dividend yield). Kyber Company/Team. They currently serve as network maintainers and have all administrative rights to change the system. They grant access to the network by whitelisting new ERC-20 tokens, reserves and integration partners. The Orderbook Reserve is the only reserve type which can be added in a permissionless way. They do not, however, have the ability to confiscate user or reserve funds; they can merely disable an individual or specific reserve from interacting with the network. After the KyberDAO is established, they will still maintain some of these key functions. Users or market takers. They are market participants which post market orders via different UIs of integration partners.  KNC Token Value Accrual  KNC is a currency used to distribute accrued fees between 1) reserve pools, 2) integration partners, and 3) KNC token holders (via token burn). When a \u2018reserve\u2019 matches a market order relayed by an integration partner, it pays a 0.25% fee in KNC for the opportunity to have participated in the order flow. In the current fee sharing structure, 30% of the fee paid is allocated to the integration partner and 70% is burned. Token burn: for each trade 0.175% (70% of 0.25%) of the value is burned in KNC token. KyberDAO Staking & Voting: Kyber Protocol will undergo a network upgrade known as Katalyst at the end of Q2 2020. Together with the upgrade, a KyberDAO will be launched which will introduce token staking and voting. Token holders will then be able to vote on a) network fee rate as a percentage of trade volume and b) the distribution of fees between stakers/voters, KNC token burn, and \u2018reserve\u2019 incentives. Initially the Kyber team will serve as a maintainer of the KyberDAO and take on certain key roles. After the Katalyst upgrade and establishment of KyberDAO, a formal KIP (Kyber Improvement Proposal) process will be put in place.  Staking, Voting, Delegation and Rewards after Katalyst and KyberDAO  Introduction of Epochs. Staking and voting will be done in epochs, a fixed time period expressed in Ethereum blocks which lasts approximately 2 weeks. Rewards will be distributed based on stake amount and voting participation in campaigns which occurred during the epoch. Delegation to Pool Masters. The Kyber team expects the emergence of delegates which will be active participants in governance and charge their own fees from pool contributors. This is similar to (political) delegation on Tezos or Cosmos, where block producers share network fees, but also vote on the behalf of their contributors.  Decentralization & Governance  In the current state, the Kyber team is the only network maintainer (although this may change at some point after the KyberDAO is established). As a result, they control admin access to the smart contracts in the form of a multisig wallet. The multisig wallet is only as safe as the security practices behind their key management.  Metrics and Analysis KNC Token metrics Daily Active Addresses The daily active addresses have started to increase lately, due to (perhaps) the Coinbase listing, general crypto adoption, and anticipation for the Katalyst network upgrade and the establishment of KyberDAO. 1564\u00d7430 35.1 KB Source: Santiment Daily Onchain Transaction Volume (denominated in KNC) Onchain transaction volume tells a slightly different story than DAA, but in combination the two give us good insight into the nature of token holders who accumulated or held at various points in the token\u2019s history. During the initial days of the token (ICO, initial listings, and frenzy), the DAA was high but transaction volume was relatively small. This indicates that initial holders were more retail-like, dealing with smaller amounts individually. In the middle of the period (2018-2019), we can see an increase in transaction volume despite low DAA, indicating that larger holders were likely accumulating. The most recent period may indicate that traction has been significantly increasing since February and that DAA metric is not being manipulated. 1564\u00d7430 38 KB Source: Santiment Token distribution, return & inflation metrics     token supply 210,728,530.82        circulating supply 179,895,689 85.37%     price $0.68      market cap $122,329,069      implied market cap $143,295,401             returns   tokens circulating inflation since   3m 4.94% $0.65 179,239,809 0.37%   6m 262.03% $0.19 168,591,095 6.71%   1y 139.31% $0.28 166,543,752 8.02%   2y -46.03% $1.26 134,461,723 33.79%   since ICO (Sep 2017) 78.95% $0.38 134,132,697 34.12%    Source of data: CryptoCompare, CoinMarketCap, Etherscan Chart1200\u00d7742 33.5 KB Source of data: CoinMarketCap, Kyber Tracker Even though KNC has a burning mechanic, the circulating supply is being inflated over time.

The figure is quite high for any asset and presents a certain degree of exposure to exchange hacks and other exchange related issues (such as exchange counterparty risks). With establishment of KNC governance and voting, the custody related risks will be greater as the mechanics offer new vectors to exploit and benefit from large amounts of KNC tokens in the wrong hands. 926\u00d7519 40.9 KB Source: Nansen-d5 According to the seniority distribution of tokens, approximately one third of the token supply has not moved in the previous two years. This group is likely the first wave of token holders that have either held since the token sale or have acquired the asset shortly after exchange listings. This group is also the most distributed as they represent approximately 60% of addresses. Another interesting observation is the group of holders who have acquired KNC in the preceding year. They hold approximately 60% of the token supply, but represent only 10% of addresses. This may indicate increased institutional interest in KNC. Trading Data - CEX volume Aggregated daily trading volume and market share distribution from the largest venues can be seen in the charts below. Total trading volume significantly increased after the Coinbase listing in February 2020. Coinbase also gained a large market share considering how long the token has been listed there. We applied a significant haircut (90%) to trading volume reported by OKEx, as their volume significantly increased simultaneously with Coinbase after their listing, even though OKEx listed the token in 2017 and has relatively much lower token deposits in their custody.

However, we encourage the community to incorporate this risk into the risk management process accordingly. ICO / Funding process  Between a public token sale in September 2017 and a private round the team raised ~200k ether or ~$50 million. A whitelisting and registration process required KYC and an Ethereum address. US Citizens and individuals or organizations in the sanction list were prohibited. Token distribution. Initially 226m tokens: 61.06% Public, 19.47% Company, Founders/Advisors ~15% (fully vested in 2 years, with a one year lock-up period), ~4.47% Seed Investors. Unsold tokens were burned - 10,374,651.16, total supply after token sale was 215,625,348.84 and tokens in circulation at Oct 15 were 134,132,696.93 or 62.2%. 50% of the raised funds was intended to be used for establishment of a reserve to facilitate liquidity in the protocol and in addition they planned to tokenize non Ethereum assets on Ethereum. Public sale price was 600KNC = 1 ETH or 0.00166 KNC/ETH.    Summary of Notable Risks  Approximately 48% of the circulating supply is currently deposited in centralized trading venues, representing some degree of counterparty risk. Additionally, the project is planning to implement staking and voting, which may increase this exchange exposure. The Coinbase listing significantly expanded token metrics such as price and trading volume. New demand is a positive sign, but we must consider that the token could be subject to unsustainable \u201cCoinbase listing\u201d hype. The Kyber Team will most likely remain the only maintainer of the network in the short to midterm, which means that the central point of failure represents a certain degree of counterparty risk.

That multisig wallet makes me nervous\u2026 I very much agree that 41.8% of total supply on centralized trading venues, with the establishment of of governance and voting, could lead to new vectors for exploit and benefit.

It\u2019s one that\u2019s so far out of my domain that I would consider it as foreign to me as the smart contract risk. Having the community reach out to more qualified people though seems like a natural starting point. For example, community members such as  Chris Padovano have been great in this area. I think as the DAO matures over time it will become natural to formalize or professionalize some of these working arrangements.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 2% Liquidation Ratio: 150% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 500 DAI Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH is the Uniswap LP token consisting of WBTC and ETH. It is currently Uniswap\u2019s 2nd most liquid pool with over $180 million in deposits, and also a top trading venue for the ETH-BTC pair. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Per Etherscan data, the vast majority of LP tokens (~91%) were deposited in Uniswap\u2019s incentivized UNI farming pool, with some deposited through yield farming protocols such as Yearn, Pickle Finance, and Farm. However, the Uniswap incentive program has ended as of November 17 and there was an outflow from the staking contract into individual wallets. The top 10 addresses in the UNI farming contract held approximately ~56% of the total supply of UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH as of November 10, but this number was likely skewed by yield aggregators increasing ownership concentration. Currently, the top 10 holders own ~66% of supply, while the top 100 own ~90% of supply. 1600\u00d7750 163 KB Source: Nansen, Nov 2020 AlphaHomura is a yield farming platform which allows users to lever up in LP token positions to earn higher returns by borrowing ETH. Currently, the farm based on UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH had ~$3,000,000 million in TVL, with around $1,500,000 in ETH borrowing demand. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or WBTC will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + BTCUSD percentage price change * WBTC allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETHBTC percentage price change) / (2 + ETHBTC percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETHBTC percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% price drop while WBTC suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in ETH price and 30% drop in WBTC price leads to 41.2% drop in UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between WBTC or ETH price changes and UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 47.2 KB Uniswap v2 has only been live since May, but based on the past 5 years of ETH and BTC price history and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH would have experienced significantly fewer sharp drawdowns than ETH. The largest price drawdown (measured from close to close) would have been 53%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%. Chart1200\u00d7742 10.1 KB Source: Coinmarketcap, Nov 2020 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings frequently exceeded 200% at some points over the summer, they have dropped substantially in the past few months due to the massive inflow of liquidity to the pool. In particular, the previous UNI distribution incentivized deposits to UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH despite relatively low fee returns. However, with the UNI incentives now ended, swap fee returns have been on an uptrend as excess liquidity exits the pool. Chart1200\u00d7742 66.5 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Nov 2020 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks  While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. LP tokens are vulnerable to custody and credit risk of WBTC. LP shares could face serious decline in value if WBTC lost its peg. If Bitgo blacklisted or froze the WBTC-ETH Uniswap pool, all assets in the pool would be unrecoverable. BTC is a bearer asset, so WBTC faces higher custody risks from potential hacking or insider misconduct than comparable USD stablecoins. UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH or BTC experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH. The Uniswap protocol liquidity mining program was only scheduled for a 2 month initial period. Uniswap governance may not renew the liquidity incentives, or may redirect them to other pools. This could reduce the total supply of UNI-V2-WBTC-ETH and could have unpredictable impacts on borrowing demand. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 165% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 2,000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-UNI-ETH is the Uniswap LP token consisting of UNI and ETH. It is currently Uniswap\u2019s 2nd most liquid pool with over $180 million in deposits, and also the top trading venue for the UNI-ETH pair. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-UNI-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-UNI-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-UNI-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. UNI-V2-UNI-ETH is not widely integrated with defi platforms or lending services. Alpha Homora offers a user interface that supports adding liquidity in unequal amounts, and offers up to 2x leverage on UNI-V2-UNI-ETH LP into their lending platform (only ETH borrowing is supported, not USD). Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or UNI will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-UNI-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-UNI-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = ETHUSD percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + UNIUSD percentage price change * UNI allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + UNIETH percentage price change) / (2 + UNIETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * UNIETH percentage price change)) E.g. if UNI price suffers 50% price drop while ETH suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 UNI-V2-UNI-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in UNI price and 30% drop in ETH price leads to 41.2% drop in UNI-V2-UNI-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between UNI or ETH price changes and UNI-V2-UNI-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 45.1 KB Based on the past 5 months (since the launch of the UNI token) of ETH and UNI price history and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-UNI-ETH experienced lower volatility than holding UNI alone. The largest price drawdown (measured from close to close) would have been 19%, experienced on January 21, 2020 when ETH fell 21% and UNI fell 17%. Note that the time period covered is less than 5 months, and has not included any severe intraday drops rivaling March 12, 2020. Chart1200\u00d7742 8.99 KB Source: Cryptocompare, Jan 2020 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings were extremely high during the price discovery period immediately after launch in September, they have dropped substantially in the past few months. Recently, they have been fluctuating between 10-40% annualized. Chart1200\u00d7742 68.9 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Feb 2020 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks  While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. UNI governance controls a large amount of UNI tokens. If these were released on the market quickly or unexpectedly, this could cause a large price impact. UNI-V2-UNI-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH or UNI experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during large price movements, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and general asset liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-UNI-ETH. If Uniswap creates staking mechanisms or other incentive programs for the UNI token, these may compete with LP positions and lead to generally lower demand for loans backed by this asset. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs. This may also lead to a decline in the UNI token price. LP tokens including ETH increase MakerDAO\u2019s already substantial exposure to ETH price movements.

UNI-V2-LINK-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = LINKETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + LINKUSD percentage price change * LINK allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + LINKETH percentage price change) / (2 + LINKETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * LINKETH percentage price change)) E.g. if LINK price suffers 50% price drop while ETH suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 UNI-V2-LINK-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in LINK price and 30% drop in ETH price leads to 41.2% drop in UNI-V2-LINK-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between LINK or ETH price changes and UNI-V2-LINK-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 44.5 KB Uniswap v2 has only been live since May, but based on the past 1.5 years of ETH and LINK price history (based on Coinbase data) and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-LINK-ETH would have experienced significantly fewer sharp drawdowns than LINK. The largest price drawdown (measured from close to close) would have been 53%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%. Chart1200\u00d7742 9.64 KB Source: Cryptocompare, Jan 2020 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings frequently exceeded 200% at some points over the summer, they have dropped substantially in the past few months due to the massive inflow of liquidity to the pool. In particular, the previous UNI distribution incentivized deposits to UNI-V2-LINK-ETH despite relatively low fee returns. However, with the UNI incentives now ended, swap fee returns have been on an uptrend as excess liquidity exits the pool. Chart1200\u00d7742 70.9 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Nov 2020 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks  While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. A large portion of the LINK supply is still under the effective control of the core team. If this supply were released rapidly or unexpectedly, it could cause a severe price drop. UNI-V2-LINK-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH or LINK experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-LINK-ETH. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs. LP tokens including ETH increase MakerDAO\u2019s already substantial exposure to ETH price movements.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 1% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 500 DAI Overview Protocol Summary The Uniswap protocol allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to rebalance token weights and correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where directional price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP somewhat less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-USDC-ETH is Uniswap\u2019s LP token consisting of USDC and ETH. Currently, it is Uniswap\u2019s 3rd most liquid trading pair with over $150 million in total deposits, and a top decentralized venue for trading ETHUSDC based on volume. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-USDC-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-USDC-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-USDC-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Per Etherscan data, the vast majority of LP tokens (~98%) were deposited in Uniswap\u2019s incentivized UNI farming pool, with some deposited through yield farming protocols such as Yearn, Pickle Finance, and Farm. However, the Uniswap incentive program ended on November 17 and there were substantial outflows from the staking contract into individual wallets. The top 10 addresses in the UNI farming contract held approximately ~86% of the total supply of UNI-V2-USDC-ETH as of Nov 10, but this number was likely skewed by yield aggregators increasing ownership concentration. Currently, the top 10 holders (including the contract for the now ended UNI distribution) account for ~80% of supply, and top 100 holders account for ~95% of supply. 1600\u00d7727 167 KB Source: Nansen, Nov 2020 There is a Uniswap market available on Aave that offers ETH or stablecoin loans against LP tokens from Uniswap v1 (note that the LP tokens for v1 are separate assets from v2). However, there is currently less than $100 of UNI-V1-USDC-ETH deposited as collateral, demonstrating a very low level of market utilization. Usage may be limited by the low amount of stablecoins and ETH available to borrow, as well as the fact that most liquidity has moved from Uniswap v1 to v2. AlphaHomura is a yield farming platform which allows users to lever up in LP token positions to earn higher returns by borrowing ETH. As of 10 Nov 2020, the farm based on UNI-V2-USDC-WETH had ~$200,000 in TVL, with around $100,000 in borrowing demand. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of USDC stays stable around $1, a decline in the price of ETH will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-USDC-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in ETH, and additional losses caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-USDC-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = ETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETH percentage price change) / (2 + ETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETH percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 UNI-V2-USDC-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in ETH price leads to 29.3% drop in UNI-V2-USDC-ETH value, assuming no change in USDC price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between ETH and UNI-V2-USDC-ETH price performance is shown below.

Summary of Notable Risks  Technical risk: While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. LP tokens are vulnerable to custody and credit risk of USDC. LP shares could face serious decline in value if USDC lost its peg. If Centre blacklisted or froze the USDC-ETH Uniswap pool, all assets in the pool would be unrecoverable. UNI-V2-USDC-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and ETH liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-USDC-ETH. The Uniswap protocol liquidity mining program was only scheduled for a 2 month initial period. Uniswap governance may not renew the liquidity incentives, or may redirect them to other pools. This could reduce the total supply of UNI-V2-USDC-ETH and could have unpredictable impacts on borrowing demand. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs.

But with UNI-V2-USDC-ETH at a 125% liquidation ratio, USDC price would need to decline by ~36% (assuming constant ETH price) before Maker loses money. With respect to regulatory risk, if USDC in UNI-V2-USDC-ETH was frozen, it would render all assets in the pool as unrecoverable.

Just another short comment from my side, same as for UNI-V2-DAI-ETH: \u201cJust wanted to note that Rates Group might potentially propose higher SF than your proposed Risk Premium of 1%. The low risk premium does make sense for a starting DC of only 10m, where model predicts at least 100m as Maximum DC. Both underlying assets are highly liquid. Also, I think @NikKunkel might propose even lower starting DC than 10m due to initial Oracles testing for UNI-LPs.\u201d ",

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 1% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 500 DAI Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-DAI-ETH is the Uniswap LP token consisting of DAI and ETH. It is currently Uniswap\u2019s 4th most liquid pool with around $150 million in deposits, and also the most important venue for trading in the ETHDAI pair. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-DAI-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-DAI-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-DAI-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. Per Etherscan data, the vast majority of LP tokens (~97%) were deposited in Uniswap\u2019s incentivized UNI farming pool, with some deposited through yield farming protocols such as Yearn, Pickle Finance, and Farm. However, the Uniswap incentive program ended on November 17 and there was substantial outflow from the staking contract into individual wallets. The top 10 addresses in the UNI farming contract held approximately ~47% of the total supply of UNI-V2-DAI-ETH as of November 10, but this number was likely skewed by yield aggregators increasing ownership concentration. Currently, the top 10 holders (including the contract for the now ended UNI distribution) own ~82% of supply, and top 100 holders own ~95% of supply. 1600\u00d7677 180 KB Source: Nansen, Nov 2020 There is a Uniswap market available on Aave that offers ETH or stablecoin loans against LP tokens from Uniswap v1 (note that the LP tokens for v1 are separate assets from v2). However, there is currently around $17,000 of UNI-V1-DAI-ETH deposited as collateral, demonstrating a low level of market utilization. Usage may be limited by the low amount of stablecoins and ETH available to borrow, as well as the fact that most liquidity has moved from Uniswap v1 to v2. AlphaHomura is a yield farming platform which allows users to lever up in LP token positions to earn higher returns by borrowing ETH. As of 10 Nov 2020, the farm based on UNI-V2-DAI-ETH had ~$1.6 million in TVL, with around $800,000 in borrowing demand. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of DAI stays stable, a decline in the price of ETH will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-DAI-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in ETH, and additional losses caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-DAI-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = ETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + ETH percentage price change) / (2 + ETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * ETH percentage price change)) E.g. if ETH price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 UNI-V2-DAI-ETH loss = -0.293 50% drop in ETH price leads to 29.3% drop in UNI-V2-DAI-ETH value, assuming no change in DAI price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between ETH and UNI-V2-DAI-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 48 KB Uniswap v2 has only been live since May, but based on the past 5 years of ETH price history and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-DAI-ETH would have experienced substantially fewer sharp drawdowns in price than ETH. The largest price drawdown would have been 33%, experienced on 12 March 2020 on the same day when ETH price fell 55%. Chart1200\u00d7742 9.57 KB Source: Coinmarketcap, Nov 2020 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings frequently exceeded 200% at some points over the summer, they have dropped substantially in the past few months due to the massive inflow of liquidity. In particular, the UNI distribution incentivized deposits to UNI-V2-DAI-ETH despite relatively low fee returns. With incentives now ended, natural swap fee earnings have begun to increase as excess liquidity leaves the pool. Chart1200\u00d7742 70.7 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Nov 2020 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks   Technical risk: While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds.   Collateral that includes DAI such as UNI-V2-DAI-ETH could increase potential losses for DAI holders if emergency shutdown occurred while there was bad debt (negative DAI surplus). If Maker took action that reduced the collateral backing of DAI below $1 (eg. negative interest rates), this may also lead to increased DAI holder losses in an emergency shutdown event.   UNI-V2-DAI-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and ETH liquidity contract during a downturn.   Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-DAI-ETH.   The Uniswap protocol liquidity mining program was only scheduled for a 2 month initial period. Uniswap governance may not renew the liquidity incentives, or may redirect them to other pools. This could reduce the total supply of UNI-V2-DAI-ETH and could have unpredictable impacts on borrowing demand.   Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs.

Eg. a hypothetical emergency shutdown where there\u2019s 80 DAI from ETH and 20 DAI from UNI-V2-DAI-ETH. There would be ~90 DAI in circulation (10 is locked in LP token collateral).

The MKR loans based off of regular ETH vaults increase the volatility of ETH. This new type of collateral will make the ETH/DAI LP bigger; it should stabilize ETH.

The low risk premium does make sense for a starting DC of only 10m, where model predicts at least 100m as Maximum DC. Both underlying assets are highly liquid. Also, I think @NikKunkel might propose even lower starting DC than 10m due to initial Oracles testing for UNI-LPs. ",

But it is definitely not up to me, it is to be discussed within the group and on forums. Also it really depends on usage as well. If Uniswap restarts liquidity mining, we may not see much demand until such vault type has farming feature enabled. Agree, DAI-ETH could carry a bit lower risk premium than USDC-ETH but I think it is almost negligible difference considering improved USDC-DAI liquidity overall and when implementing PSM. Also, DAI is 40% backed by USDC and possibly well over 50% after PSM. ",

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 7 million Auction Lot Size: 50.000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 DAI Overview Protocol Summary Yearn.finance (Yearn) is a decentralized protocol initially developed by Andre Cronje, with a primary focus on aggregation and yield optimization. The initial building blocks of the Yearn ecosystem were released in early 2020, and included yTokens and the Curve yPool. yTokens rebalance their lending activities between several platforms to optimize returns, while the Curve yPool uses yTokens as building blocks to help provide stablecoin liquidity providers the highest possible returns. Ownership of YFI was distributed to users who staked assets in the protocol over 1 week in July. Since shortly after the initial distribution, the protocol has been governed by a community multisig that enacts the votes of YFI holders. There is a plan to transition to fully on-chain governance. An active community has emerged to build out the ecosystem of Yearn products. These now include yVaults, yInsure, as well as other projects still in development. The majority of Yearn\u2019s income is derived from withdrawal and performance fees from yVaults, with profits distributed to users who stake their YFI in the governance contract. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues YFI is actively traded on several CEX platforms including Binance and Coinbase, as well as decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, and 0x. Among DEX platforms, the vast majority of trading volume is on Sushiswap, which has a liquidity incentive program for LPs of the YFI/ETH pair. Trailing 10 day average volume amounted to $50.8 million on Sushiswap, $12.7 million on Uniswap, and less than $500,000 each on 0x and Mooniswap. Chart1600\u00d7989 168 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare (CEX), Uniswap.info, Sushiswap.vision, 0x Tracker, Mooniswap.info Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule The current total supply of 30,000 YFI was issued over a 1 week period, from July 17 to 24. Users could participate by staking assets in one of 3 contracts to earn tokens proportional to their value locked. This is essentially a lockdrop mechanism, with the additional feature that the locked assets helped to increase YFI token liquidity (via the 98% DAI or yCRV/2% YFI Balancer pools) and utilization of Yearn\u2019s existing protocol (yCRV and underlying yTokens). A proposal that is currently being considered by Yearn governance would burn the admin keys controlling minting to permanently cap YFI token supply at 30,000. Token Deposits on Trading Venues The majority of balances at custodial exchanges are with Binance and Coinbase. Token balances for Huobi and OKEx are relatively low compared with other exchanges, indicating that their reported volumes may be inflated. While Balancer has a relatively high share of liquidity among decentralized exchanges, most is locked in the YFV farming pool. Excluding this pool, Balancer follows Sushiswap, Uniswap, and Mooniswap in terms of usable liquidity. Chart1200\u00d7742 18.6 KB Source of data: Nansen-d5 Downside Risk YFI has been trading for less than 3 months, giving limited data for analysis. YFI was not trading during Black Thursday, so its performance during a severe market crash is untested. The largest daily pullback for YFI (from close to close) was -21.4%, which occurred on September 5 during a broad market decline when ETH fell 13%. (Time period reviewed for YFI in the chart below is much shorter than for ETH). Chart1200\u00d7742 12.5 KB Source of data: CoinMarketCap Assets Under Management (Total Value Locked) Yearn had a relatively low TVL of less than $10 million up until the launch of the YFI token. It experienced a short lived spike while YFI was being distributed, followed by a more sustained increase coinciding with the release of the Curve CRV token. 1086\u00d7740 54 KB Source: DefiPulse Revenue and Profits Yearn derives most of revenue from vault performance and withdrawal fees. Fees amount to 0.5% of any funds withdrawn and 5% of any gains. Any funds remaining after paying for vault gas costs, Yearn treasury operating expenses, and the strategy creator fee (10% of performance fees) are distributed to YFI holders who stake in the governance contract. 1302\u00d7789 58.6 KB The chart below shows cumulative deposits and withdrawals for the yUSD (yCRV vault) strategy. Withdrawal fees have comprised a substantial amount of Yearn\u2019s revenue to date, but could decline as more liquid pools emerge for trading yVault tokens instead of redeeming from the contract. So far, there does not seem to be a drop off in withdrawal volumes and fees. 1600\u00d7683 88.2 KB Source of Data: Dune Analytics Summary of Notable Risks  YFI is a new asset with relatively short trading history and limited data. Admin functions are currently in the hands of a community multisig. An on chain governance system is planned but full details are not yet public. Yearn\u2019s aggregation business exposes users to layers of technical and economic risk. A serious loss of funds could harm reputation. Unaffiliated projects made by Yearn contributors may also cause reputational blowback on YFI. If yields decline for farming opportunities, yVaults may become less attractive and earn lower performance fees. Withdrawal fee income is likely to decline as exchange liquidity for yVault tokens improves. Competitors are emerging in many of Yearn\u2019s business lines, particularly yield aggregation. This could lead to lower fee income and loss of market share. While Yearn has an increasing number of participants, the project is heavily connected to Andre Cronje and might struggle without his continued contributions.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 7 million Auction Lot Size: 50.000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 DAI We use the model described from the governance call here: a credit risk model that estimates the loss distribution of a portfolio of COMP Vaults. Risk parameters are estimated from this hypothetical loss distribution. Inputs to the model are derived from trading data along with stressed input parameters. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for ETH.

It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. Uniswap is open-source software licensed under the GPL. Each Uniswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC20 tokens. Anyone can become a liquidity provider for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time. Pairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the \u201cconstant product\u201d formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pair\u2019s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones. In practice, Uniswap applies a 0.30% fee to trades, which is added to reserves. As a result, each trade actually increases k. This functions as a payout to LPs, which is realized when they burn their pool tokens to withdraw their portion of total reserves. In the future, this fee may be reduced to 0.25%, with the remaining 0.05% withheld as a protocol-wide charge. Because the relative price of the two pair assets can only be changed through trading, divergences between the Uniswap price and external prices create arbitrage opportunities. This mechanism ensures that Uniswap prices always trend toward the market-clearing price. UNI is an ERC20 token aimed for the purposes of enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future. Tokenomics At the time of this analysis (Nov 2019) UNI token is strictly a governance token without any yield/revenue. Its market value is based on its governance capabilities and the potential protocol fees in the future. UNI governance may enable the 0.05% protocol fee after the 180 day time lock (at earliest at end of April 2021). At v2 launch, the protocol charge was set to 0% , and the liquidity provider fee to 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%. Therefore this action does not affect traders, but would affect the amount received by liquidity providers. Since 17 October 2020 UNI owners control the (community) treasury where protocol fees (in traded ERC20 pairs) would accumulate. The specifics of revenue distribution is yet to be determined by the UNI holders. If hypothetically all revenue from the protocol fee goes to UNI holders we could very roughly estimate a P/E ratio:  As of Nov 2020, average daily revenue is around 200-300mil. Treasury annualized revenue: 365 * 250m * 0.05% = 45.625mil USD With this estimation of revenue, a fully diluted market cap after 4 years (1B UNI), unchanged volume and many other assumptions, this would translate to a P/E ratio of 75 (using current price of 3.5 USD).  On-chain fundamentals At time of writing the UNI token does not produce yield but might in the future - see the Protocol Summary and Tokenomics sections. Since the initial distribution included a broad range of users or rather wallets - anyone that has ever interacted with the Uniswap protocol before Sept 1st 2020 - the token is held by a vast number of wallets.

We can only speculate how release will impact the UNI price (for example, short term increase in volatility)   AMM protocols are still (relatively) new tech, especially in combination with token governance and there could be unforeseen risk, like sudden and permanent loss of liquidity (locked capital). There seems to be a widely held belief that AMM protocols are the winner-take-all markets, however future Ethereum scaling solutions may bring order book trading dominance.   Efficiency of the new decentralized governance may hurt Uniswap reputation (many holders might not have much governance experience, high UNI threshold for new proposals)   Aggressive competition may steal liquidity from Uniswap V2 which would possibly also affect UNI price. We've seen very big shifts of liquidity between protocols, mainly lured by liquidity farming incentives.

Outline  Synopsis Initial parameters Background Industry analysis Asset originator analysis Token issuer analysis Implementation details Proposed covenants   Synopsis Tenant lease finance is a specific area within commercial real estate that is traditionally stable with clearly bounded risk parameters. The two main risks are interest rate and economic conditions. Interest rates are unlikely to increase in the short term and economic conditions, while hazardous to predict, are unlikely to impair too much the senior position of Maker if the investment is made with proper risk management. Nevertheless, some risks are present in the collateral under study :  There is possibly a conflict of interest as 6S Development (the main developer) and 6S Capital (the asset originator) are managed by the same people. The industry is also called Credit Tenant Lease but some of the tenants are not credit worthy according to notation agencies. This seems quite a deviation from industry standards. There is no constraint on credit quality and neither on concentration risks. The Trust scheme removes Maker from the actual decision process and sets a rigid contract that must be followed. The only power really left in Maker hands is the liquidation which is not practical and costly.  A solution was found between 6S and the risk team. It gives the Maker Representative all the due diligence information on every investment project a week before the credit line is drawn by LendCo. That will leave enough time to reduce the debt ceiling and avoid the transaction by letting a risk domain facilitator issue an executive vote. Nevertheless, it is expected that 6S Capital Partners managers and Maker Representatives will establish a more informal way of working. Warning: For the sake of speed, and to move forward, this risk assessment has some limitations notably:  No NDA was signed and no confidential information was exchanged, therefore due diligence on the stakeholders is limited, notably on their financial stability. This risk assessment focuses mainly on the tenant risk and is light on construction risk as this space is less documented. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no risk. Final contracts and details were not available at the time of the risk assessment (which is a prerequisite to finalize those). We made this risk assessment considering that the finals contracts correspond to the spirit, our understanding of the term sheet and the discussions.   Initial parameters Those are taken from MIP13c3-SP4 that was approved on chain. Debt Ceiling: 15M Stability Fees: 3% Liquidation: See MIP21  Background The collateral under study (SIXS) is single-tenant commercial leases construction projects (some being finished). 6S Capital LLC is an asset originator in commercial real estate throughout the United States. The company is incorporated in the Delaware. It is specialized in Single-Tenant Net Lease. The managing director is Matthew V Rabinowitz, a Maker community member (@mrabino1). It \u201cwas born during the COVID-19 banking credit squeeze when its sister company, 6s Development LLC, had challenges with banks no longer wanting to provide credit.\u201d 6S Capital Partners LLC is the SPV. It is managed by 6S Capital LLC. The senior tranche of the SPV will be subscribed by the Maker Protocol. The equity tranche is expected to be subscribed by external accredited investors. 6S Development LLC is expected to be the main project developer. It has been managed by Jordan Amyx since 2016. Previously to that, he was Real Estate Manager for Dollar general. Matthew Rabinowitz is exercising as CFO. He joined the company in 2016. The company was formed in Delaware. Wilmington Trust will be the trustee defending the MakerDAO interest in the lending process. References:  MIP21: Real World Assets - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender MIP13c3-SP4 Declaration of Intent & Commercial Points - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets as Collateral for a DAI loan   Industry analysis Provide an overview of the industry where the SPV assets will be, especially what are the risk, benchmark and historical behaviour. A market comparison with other lenders can be useful as well. The overall industry is the single-tenant commercial lease business. The collateral under study is focused on the construction part and the initial lease (bridge). This industry enjoys long-term leases (10-20 years) and few expenses as the tenant pays directly for most of it. It is also called triple net as the tenant pays for property taxes, building insurance and most maintenance costs. The rent usually has an escalator part meaning that the rent is contractually increasing year after years (1-2%). An example of single-tenant net lease contracts can be found here. The value of a single tenant lease property tends to decrease with time. Indeed, the value of a property with a 20 year lease is higher than a similar property where only 10 years of lease remains. A vacant property is an expense (insurance, \u2026) and might require a significant cost to be rented again (up to demolition and rebuilding). Using this example, we can estimate that a property value can fall by as much as 43% between a 15-year lease rented property and a vacant one (before annual expenses to keep the property in good shape and commercial expenses to find a new tenant). This can happen quickly if the tenant defaults (which highlight the need of having good tenants). There can also be lease cancellation clauses. Using the vacant discount discussed earlier and the Wawa cap rate profile from the Boulder Research report, can can deduct the following property value according to the duration of the lease left (the property value is based on a 20-year term lease).  The Boulder Group is providing research on the single tenant lease market. One main metric is the cap rate (annual rent / acquisition price) which is displayed in the graph below. It is at a low level mainly due to the fall in interest rates. If we focus on the beginning of the graph, we can see that the 2007 crisis impacted the market with a significant delay.  771\u00d7323 103 KB  It makes sense to use the spread between the cap rate and the risk free rate to see what variation is due to a stress in the market. If we look at 2010 the spread with the 10-year government bond (the risk free rate, not displayed) was 460bps which is quite an increase from 250bps in 2007 (+210bps). Currently the cap rate is around 6% for retail. Should this cap rate increase by 200bps, it would negatively impact the value of the asset by 25% (assuming the rent stays constant). 10-year bond Interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future, therefore the risk is small on this front.  Peers analysis This peer analysis section presents a comparison with other companies in the industry.  Realty Income case study Realty Income is a $20B market cap company. It is one of the biggest owners of single-tenant commercial properties (triple net leases) in the USA. Texas is their main market with 11% of rental revenues (834 properties). It is worth noting that the debt ratio (LTV or total debt / gross asset value) of Realty Income is only 38% at 2020Q2 (i.e. 62% of equity). This is a much lower level of debt compared to the collateral under evaluation which proposes having only 15% of equity against stabilized leases. The risk is an order of magnitude higher in the proposed collateral. While not perfect this example allows us to understand the overall market. It contains mainly stabilized leases while the collateral under study has mainly construction projects. This, again, is more risk on for the proposed collateral. The stock price (equity valuation) was hit by the Covid fear but the current price level is similar to 2017/2018.  The company was able to issue $600M of unsecured bonds in May 2020 at 3.25%, showing that the primary market is still open for such a business. Looking at the secondary market, using the July 2024 maturity, we can see that after a small stress in March, the price is now at an all time high (higher price meaning a lower yield and a lower perceived risk).  1107\u00d7617 22.4 KB  In conclusion, this example shows that the industry is well rated by investors even in the middle of the Covid crisis.  Expected Tenants analysis As defined earlier, the quality of the tenant is of first importance for credit tenant lease as it influences the price of the property a lot. The table below presents all tenants defined in the term sheet, their expected risk bucket, the rating from Moody where applicable and the average cap rate provided by Net Lease Advisor (the lower the less risky). All leases are expected to be signed (or guaranteed by) the tenant declared in the term sheet and not a franchisee or a subsidiary.     Tenant Risk bucket Moody rating Avg. Cap rate     Dollar General Very low Baa2 6.75%   Service King  Very high   Caa3    Caliber Collision  Very high  B2-PD 6.43%   Signature Collision Unknown     O\u2019Reilly Auto Part Medium Baa1 5.54%   Wawa Low  4.73%   Tractor Supply Low Baa1 6.12%   Grocery Outlet Low B1    Dutch Brothers Coffee Unknown     Starbucks Coffee Low Baa1 5.24%   7-Eleven Very low Baa1 5.00%   Amazon Very low A2    FedEx Low Baa3 5.93%   UPS Very low A2    Brambles Companies Very low Baa1     We also provide a more detailed discussion of each tenant.  Dollar General Dollar General is a $50B public company. It operates 16,368 variety stores in 45 states. Just looking at the share price, you can deduct that the company is in good shape. Indeed, revenue growth for 2020S1 is +25.9% (+20.2% same-store comparison). Cash flows from operation are great too.  S&P is rating the long term debt BBB which is investment grade (with one grade safety before junk). Moody rating is in line with Baa2. This is a very low risk tenant.  Service King Service King is a national automotive collision repair company. It is currently owned by Blackstone and Carlyle in a LBO from 2012 (and 2014 for Blackstone). The owners tried to sell the company in 2017 without success. In 2017, it had 312 locations in 23 states. A Google Trends search on Service King shows a drop on traffic starting with Covid-19. People drive less and therefore have less repairs to be made. Moody downgraded the company in August to Caa2-PD with a negative outlook (L12M of EBIT doesn\u2019t cover interest costs) and a good amount of debt is due next year. The senior unsecured debt is rated Caa3. If the Google Trend data is indicative, we can assess that the situation is only getting worse before taking in account any possible lockdown. Below you can find congestion data from TomTom which shows the same story.  1459\u00d7623 56.7 KB  This is a very high risk tenant as the company is likely to be bankrupt in the next year.  Caliber Collision Caliber Collision is an auto body repair and paint shop with more than 1100 centers across 32 states. Following the Covid-19 slowdown, it has reduced the rent payment by 40% to the landlords. Again Google Trends data on \u201cCaliber Collision\u201d are not supportive of a recovery. There is no evidence that the rent is now paid fully neither.  Moody rating is B2-PD with negative review and some debt is already Caa1. This is a very high risk tenant as it has already started to default on his rent.  Signature Collision Signature Collision is a collision repair business started in 2004. It has 20+ locations across the east US. Few data has been collected on this tenant.  O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts is an american auto parts retailer with 5,400 stores across 47 states. It is a publicly traded company member of the S&P500 with a $32B market cap. A look at the share price shows that the market isn\u2019t much concerned about O\u2019Reilly prospects.  The company seems unaffected by Covid19 with sales and operating profit increasing. One should still note that the liquidity position of O\u2019reilly is not the safest. The current ratio (current liabilities minus current assets) is below 1 (but above 1 if considering the Credit revolving facility). Using the more restrictive quick ratio measure (which mainly removes inventories), the situation is even worse as most of the current assets are inventories.  Financial leverage is a trend for O\u2019Reilly with a long term debt to equity ratio hitting 700% in 2020S1. Before 2014, it was never above 30% (the last highest ratio was 77% in 1998, ten times less than currently). Moody still gives a Baa1 rating (but that was more than one year ago and Moody focuses mainly on debt/EBITDA metrics. S&P ranks the company as BBB (again with a focus only on earning related metrics). Due to the financial leverage on the balance sheet side, this is a medium risk tenant.  Wawa Wawa manages more than 900 convenience stores and gas stations across the east coast. The company is privately owned so it is difficult to find more information. Nevertheless, according to anecdotal evidence (BBB rating from Fitch) and the very low cap rate asked by the market, we can put it under low risk.  Tractor Supply Tractor Supply is a rural lifestyle retail chain. It is a $11B market cap company. A look at the share price shows a company profiting from Covid. Indeed, the 2020Q3 results are very good with a +31% sales (+27% on a comparable basis) and +56% in net income.  Financial metrics are with a current ratio above 1 and a long term debt to equity ratio of 25%. Moody rating is Baa1 which makes it investment grade. This is a low risk tenant.  Grocery Outlet Grocery Outlet is a chain of 347 discount supermarkets. It is a $4B market cap publicly traded company. A look at the share price shows a company in good shape. Indeed, 2020Q2 results were great with +24.5% sales growth (+16.7% on a comparable basis) and a healthy 7.5% adjusted EBITDA margin and 5% adjusted net income margin.  Financial metrics are healthy as well with a current ratio above 1.5 and a long term debt to equity ratio of 53%. The company is rated B1 by Moody which remains in the highly speculative area. Since, the ratings metrics have improved (as they are since the IPO). The poor rating is mainly due to the small size of the business and a more leveraged past. This is a low risk tenant.  Dutch Brothers Coffee Dutch Brothers Coffee is a drive-through coffee chain with more than 347 locations. It is privately owned and no information was found.  Starbucks Coffee Starbucks Coffee is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses. It is a $110B publicly traded company. A look at the share price shows support from the stock market despite a -9% revenue growth from comparable stores. Net earnings for 2020Q4 (fiscal) are down 51% and 2020 fiscal full year are down 74%. The company expects a sharp increase for next year.  The company is rated Baa1 by Moody. The current ratio is above 1. The long term debt over equity is meaningless as the equity is negative. Debt to EBITDA is around 6.6x. This is a low risk tenant.  7-Eleven 7-Eleven is an international chain of convenience stores. It has 71,100 stores in 17 countries and is owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. Moody recently placed the Baa1 rank under negative perspectives due to the acquisition of a competitor that will increase the debt burden. Nevertheless, there is strong support from the parent company (evidenced by equity infusion). S&P rating is AA-. This is a very low risk tenant.  Amazon Amazon is a behemoth, profitable, rated A2 by Moody, A+ by Fitch and AA- by S&P and with a strong balance sheet. This is a very low risk tenant.  FedEx FedEx is a multinational delivery services company. It is a $70B publicly traded company. The share price of the company is quite unsure but feels quite supportive recently. The company had some \u201cnot so good\u201d years in 2019 and 2020 (fiscal years) with losses in some quarters. Nevertheless, FY2021Q1 was very good  The long term credit score is Baa3 for Moody and BBB from S&P. Both outlooks are negative. The company has started to reduce the debt level and stopped share buybacks. The yield on the 2046 maturity bond is decreasing, showing support from the bond market, with a yield to maturity of 3.2%.  1132\u00d7447 31.1 KB  This is a low risk tenant.  UPS UPS is a multinational package delivery and supply chain management company. It is a $115B publicly traded company. The stock price was quite flat those last years with a recent surge. There was some growth in 2020Q3 (+16% revenues, +11% operating profit, +12 net income).  The credit score is A- for S&P and A2 for Moody. This is a very low risk tenant.  Brables Companies Brables is a public Australian company that specialises in the pooling of unit-load equipment, pallets, crates and containers The stock price is moving sideways.  The company is rated Baa1 by Moody and BBB+ by S&P. Net debt/EBITDA is 1.1x and EBITDA/net finance costs is 19.3x. Current ratio is above 1, long term debt to equity is 64%. The management seems to pursue a more aggressive financial strategy but, so far, the financial leverage is still low. This is a very low risk tenant. .  Simulation of a Single Tenant Lease portfolio To get a feeling of what can happen with a portfolio of credit tenant leases, here are some projections of a possible portfolio under some scenarios. It is limited to stabilized leases but we expect that construction risks are hard to model. If there is no construction issue, a construction project ends up as stabilized anyway. This portfolio is diversified on the expected tenants. Currently, nothing enforces such diversification and the portfolio might end up concentrated on a few lowest quality tenants.  1073\u00d7464 19.6 KB   Scenario 1 - the impact of time As we have seen, the value of a property is directly linked to the lease on it. The longer the remaining lease, the higher the value. So what happens if we move forward a portfolio 5 years in the future to account for the property value decay? We assume the cash flow of the period to be null (repaying the loan interests and recycling the exceeding capital elsewhere). As you can see in the spreadsheet, going from a 20-year lease to a 15-year lease decreases the value of the assets by around 6% (as expected cap rate increases by 6%). Nevertheless, most leases have an indexation clause that increases the rent by 10% every 5 years. Therefore, all other things being equals, the portfolio has increased its value. No issue here but one should remain attentive to the reindexation clause.  Scenario 2 - Stress test 1 During a crisis, like 2008, the market might increase the expected cap rate by 2%. While this change remains minor, it decreases significantly the market value of the properties. This wipes out all the equity in the SPV (15% of the value as it is stabilized properties) and incurs a 14% loss on the debt. This is only the mark-to-market evaluation and it doesn\u2019t mean that there is any liquidity issue if the rents stay above the debt interest expenses. Nevertheless, liquidation is no longer an option in such cases.  Scenario 3 - Stress test 2 For scenario 3, we use the same settings that scenario 2 but adding two properties that become vacants due a default from their tenants. Interestingly, this doesn\u2019t change much from scenario 2 results (just a bit worse). Indeed, we keep the same 43% discount on vacant properties. Maybe we should expect more difficulties to sell a property without a tenant in the middle of a crisis. We remain in the same issue as scenario 2 with no possibility to liquidate without a significant loss. Assuming only two tenants are no longer paying rents, cash flows should be enough to cover the loan interest increase.  Industry analysis questions  What are the metrics usually used for assessing credit quality? According to a Realty Income Moody evaluation, loan-to-value (LTV), net debt to EBITDA and fixed charge coverage are the metrics under analysis. One criteria also used in covenants is the Interest Coverage Ratio.  How does those assets respond in the event of a particular major economic event? The Covid crisis shows that the leading indicator to follow is the rent collection. The following data from Spirit Realty shows the rent collection discrepancy between industries. There is a huge discrepancy between movie theaters that are closed and grocery stores. One should note that the economic downturn is only at the beginning.  979\u00d7901 193 KB  Using a longer time horizon and the Realty Income portfolio, we can see that the occupancy stayed strong even during economic downturns (2001 and 2007-2009).  1065\u00d7498 47.5 KB   What remedial measures might be undertaken? Usually, you need to find another tenant. The issue is that if one tenant didn\u2019t succeed at the current rent, it\u2019s likely that the rent is too high and will be reduced by market forces. The construction also limits the usage: an auto repair shop can\u2019t be used by a 7-Eleven. At worst, the whole construction needs to be rebuilt. It is in the interest of all parties to find an arrangement if possible by diminishing the rent.  What are the historical default rates in this industry? We didn\u2019t find statistics on the default of Single Tenant Leases. As they are linked to the credit score of the tenant, we can use the realized default rate from credit ranking as a proxy. The chart below illustrates the point for S&P credit scores. We can see that with investment grade tenants, the default rate is around 5% after 20 years for a BBB score (corresponding to Baa in Moody\u2019s notation). This is what can be expected at worst for investment grade tenants. If we go lower in the credit score, things quickly deteriorate up to a 50% probability of default for ratings in the Cxx range.  720\u00d7331 25.9 KB   What is the average cap rate of the market? The cap rate is currently around 6% according to Boulder Research which is confirmed by looking at Loopnet listings.  Is there liquidity in the market? The market seems fairly liquid for finished constructions as there are 3000 properties on sale currently. Quite obviously, when times are hard, the market can freeze and there is a flight to quality. While it is very difficult to sell a movie theater currently, very high quality properties can be sold for a price never seen before. For unfinished constructions, there is no evidence that such a market exists at all.  Asset originator analysis The asset originator and manager of the SPV is 6S Capital LLC. We expect that most deals (if not all) will be sourced from its sister company 6S Development LLC. This risk is somewhat mitigated at the Trust level (see the Implementation details section).  When was the asset originator incorporated? 2016  What is the background of the asset originator managers? Jordan Amyx - LinkedIn Matthew V Rabinowitz - LinkedIn  How many deals has the asset originator already done? What is the notional amount? \u201c6s Development has completed 11 of these projects. ~$35MM deployed and exited. \u201c  Has the asset originator experienced a default? What is the plan in case of default? \u201cZero defaults. All tenants paying their rent and all projects divested on schedule\u201d  What is the due diligence they use to accept an asset? The due diligence from LendCo to issue a loan is quite extensive. It contains an analysis of budgets, usage of by an external appraiser and all the legal documents one can ask for.  The operation goes through a title company. Each operation should be accepted by the \u201cBank\u201d which in our case is the Trust. Therefore it is the Trustees that check if the loan is in accordance with the Revolving Credit Agreement.  What is the valuation model used? The valuation of a property or a construction project is only done at the closing of the operation and never reassessed after that. It is done by a licensed appraiser selected by LendCo. For construction projects, developer fees are included in the project valuation.  What is the nature of asset defaults for the originator, and the possible solutions? In this specific case, there can also be a default of 6S Development which obviously never happened during the lifetime of 6S Development but can happen in the future. In such a case, the Trust will have to deal directly with the projects and properties.  What are the historical default rates of the originator? 0%  What explains the difference in default rates between the asset originator and the industry? Defaults are rare in this industry because they are not randomly distributed. They occur when a tenant defaults, which is more likely to happen in economic downturn.  Issuance platform analysis In some cases, an external platform may be used to facilitate tokenization of assets and management of asset pools outside of the Maker vault. No external platform is used for tokenization.  Implementation details Provide the mechanics of the vault management. This can follow the Centrifuge Model, the Trust Model or something specific. Please detail any deviation from the model if applicable. The process is outlined in MIP13c3-SP4. Legal risks inherent to this approach are outside of this risk evaluation. The MIP delegates most of the work (and power) to a Trust managed by a third party Trustee. The Trust manages its relationship with the SPV (LendCo) using the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement defined in the MIP.  On the Trustee Wilmington Trust (as this stage, the expected Trustee) is one of the top 10 largest American institutions by fiduciary assets. They will be in charge of managing the Trust. Wilmington Trust made some bad loan investment to small real estate developers before the subprime crisis. To cover for their mistakes, the President and the CFO dissimulated hundreds of millions of dollars in matured, past due loans. They were sentenced 6 years of prison term. While obviously unlikely to repeat, it shows that trust shouldn\u2019t be given too easily even to a reputable 100 year hold Trust management business. In the process outlined by MIP13c3-SP4, Maker Representatives should be in place to avoid such issues.  Maker Governance role The MIP defines 5 levers that are under the responsibility of the Maker Governance.  Aggregate Debt Ceiling Risk Premium - Interest Rate Scope (may be modified by MKR governance ratification of a LendCo request) Equity Requirement per LendCo transaction (may be modified by MKR governance ratification of a LendCo request) Liquidation  For the debt ceiling, the minimum is set at 15M DAI with a forward guidance to 100M DAI. The amount needed is for two reasons. First, due to the trust structure which is costly, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a low debt ceiling for the borrower. Second, part of the risk reduction is due to the diversification of the projects and the tenants. Considering an average of $2-5M per project, a $20-50M debt ceiling seems a minimum for risk diversification. For this kind of collateral you can\u2019t start with a low debt ceiling, see if things are working, then increase it after a few months. It is unlikely that any issue arises in the first year at least as defined by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. For the interest rate, the term sheet cap is at Wall Street Prime + 100 bps which is 4.25% at the time of writing. The scope can be modified by Maker Governance only by a request from LendCo which defeats the point from a risk perspective. The equity requirement by investment is capped at 30% which is already the value for a new construction project. The liquidation is the main action Maker Governance can take. There is a 12-month notice before the actual liquidation starts. One should be careful in the definitive wording (the final contract is not written yet). There are a lot of occurrences in the term sheet where a liquidation can only be triggered by a covenant breach on top of a Maker Governance decision. Covenants are quite light so this can remove the ability of Maker Governance to get back its loan. Nevertheless, Maker Representatives have all the due diligence information on every investment project a week before the credit line is drawn by LendCo. That will leave enough time to reduce the debt ceiling and avoid the transaction by letting a risk domain facilitator issue an executive vote. In this sense, there is a control of all investment.  Proposed covenants Covenants are already detailed in the Term Sheet in MIP13c3-SP4.  Allowed investments There are two dimensions on the allowed investments. For the developper (who will own the equity of BorrowCo), there is no limit to who LendCo can choose. Due to the familiarity we can expect 6S Development will be quite frequently used, at least at the beginning. For the tenants, there is a list that defines where most of the investments should be done. It is important to note that there is no limit in the credit quality of those tenants. As we have seen some tenants on the list are defined by Moody as highly speculative and are at the bottom of the group defined as \u201cjudged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk\u201d just a rank above the \u201clikely in, or very near, default\u201d group. Another tenant has unilaterally reduced his rent.  Minimum overcollateralization ratio  Collateralization ratio formula Asset / debt amount (with accrued interest) The assets are defined being the construction cost. It is not expected to evaluate assets in a mark-to-market way after the BorrowCo loan is accepted.  Collateralization ratio proposed threshold The collateralization is used only at the beginning of a project (close of the transaction). From 15 to 30% of equity must be used per project. This equates to a collateral ratio between 118 and 143%.  Concentration risks There are no rules to avoid concentration risk. There is an indication of it in the \u201cOther Lending Constraints\u201d section but it is unclear at the time of writing who set those constraints (LendCo or Maker). As suggested by an expert we have consulted, we might want to limit exposure to up to a maximum of 10% of the assets for each tenant and 30% for a group of BorrowCo (BorrowCo\u2019s from the same developer). Having a limit on non-investment grade tenants would also makes sense as a lot of risk is concentrated in those.  Stakeholders rules The stakeholders risks should at least be the financial stability of the asset originator. This part should be assessed even before the vault is opened. The equity providers of the SPV/LendCo are external Accredited Investors. It will be needed to assess what rights equity holders have in the final version of the shareholder agreement of 6S Capital Partner LLC. 6S Developer LLC, 6S Capital LLC or the management are not expected to have \u201cskin in the game\u201d by being shareholders themselves. There is an informal rule that the Risk Team asks for asset originators to put money in the SPV. Nevertheless, they support all the legal costs of setting the infrastructure which is significant. At this stage, no extensive due diligence was done on them and we can\u2019t assess their financial stability. ",

It is a non-custodial automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor.The big idea of Balancer is, it is a financial primitive that combines asset management and decentralized exchange. It is like combining an exponentiation of Uniswap AMM and the Set protocol where up to eight tokens can be allocated to a pool following customisable arbitrary weights, fees and strategies. Balancer pools charge traders for swapping any two tokens in pools and pays liquidity providers with fees collected. In Balancer v1 pools can be either shared (\u201cfinalized\u201d) or private (\u201ccontrolled\u201d). Shared public pools are immutable. They have fixed weightings and fees and allow anyone to deposit assets. Private pools enable the creator to alter parameters interactively. Balancer also allows pools to be smart-contract owned allowing more complex logic to dynamically adjust weightings and fees. Changing a pool from private to public is a one way direction only. Balancer originated as a research project with a team of engineers and mathematicians led by Fernando Martinelli and Mike McDonald. The team has spun out the BalancerLabs entity to coordinate the development of the protocol. It has three releases planned, currently operating in v1 released in February 2020. Sources: Whitepaper, Balancer docs BAL token use Balancer has no native protocol token embedded in v1. BAL is used as a governance token over the network. BAL can be used to vote on proposals such as adding new features, adjusting liquidity mining dynamics or changing fee structure and steer the direction of the protocol. BAL tokens are not intended as an investment, but as a way to decentralize governance. Liquidity mining & inflation: Balancer Labs implemented the concept of liquidity mining, where Balancer governance tokens (BALs) are distributed to liquidity providers. Every week 145,000 BALs, or approximately 7.5M per year, are distributed to LPs. In the first year, there would be 30% supply inflation from the initial supply of 25M vested tokens. At the current rate of 145,000 BAL per week, it would take 8.666 years to distribute the whole 65M BAL remaining, before reaching the 100M cap. The schedule of BAL distribution over the next few years is subject to governance adjustments. Assets eligible to be deposited to gain BAL from liquidity mining are whitelisted by governance. Here is the most up to date whitelist. Liquidity staking: In August 2020, BAL token holders voted to incentivize liquidity that have BAL in the pool. About 31% (45K) out of BAL distributed through liquidity mining (145k/week) goes to liquidity providers of key BAL pairs such as BAL/ETH,BAL/USDC, BAL/WBTC. Token metrics Active addresses Data shows very regular spikes in active addresses using BAL rather than a continuous increase in numbers. This is probably not uncommon given the regular weekly interval at which liquidity mining rewards are distributed to LPs. Maximum activity happened on 22 Sept with 8,929 active addresses. Given the short timeseries, no further conclusion should be drawn on the long term trend of this metric for now.  Source: Santiment Fees generated The whitepaper covers two types of fees in balancer v1: trader token swap fees and liquidity removal fees (i.e. pool exit fee). In controlled pools, these fee structures may change through time. 100% of swap fees go to liquidity providers as well as most of exit fees.The protocol also enforces a \u201cfeeFactor\u201d calculation that weighs down pools according to their fee (in %) in order to incentivise pool usability. This calculation is constantly revised by the community. For further details see here. Balancer pools have generated 14.75M in swap fees on a cumulative sum basis by Sept end. Daily fees generated kept steady in the last 2 months. The protocol pools have accumulated more than 200K on average daily. 1030\u00d7515 39.5 KB Source:Balancer Token allocation & issuance Key general information     Variable Value     ID balancer   TOTAL_SUPPLY 37,465,000   CIRCULATING_SUPPLY 8,208,450   CURRENT_PRICE 15.89   MARKET_CAP 130,482,359   MARKET_CAP_RANK 82   TOTAL_VOLUME 99,289,722   ATH 37.01   ATL 6.65   FULLY_DILUTED_MARKETCAP 595,318,850    Initially, the total supply of BAL tokens is capped at 100M, subject to adjustments.  25M BAL tokens were allocated to founders, stock options, advisors and investors, all subject to vesting periods. 5M were allocated for the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to incentivise protocol development 5M were allocated for the Fundraising Fund to support Balancer Labs\u2019 operations and growth. The remaining 65M tokens will be distributed to LPs in the coming years through liquidity mining, at a rate of approx. 7.5M annually.

The average negative daily decline was -7% in the period. However, it is important to note BAL was launched after Black Thursday so it has not been truly stress tested yet. ETH and BAL had a light positive correlation to each other at 0.74 in the period. BAL has a very high short term volatility with a 90d std deviation of 6.78 (634 yearly). For comparison, LINK recently assessed is a much more liquid asset with only 1.43 90d stdDev. This volatility is not surprising for BAL given how recent and illiquid it is. 717\u00d7428 8.05 KB Source: Santiment Exchange activity Exchanges and trading pairs This analysis adopts Messari\u2019s methodology for \u201cReal volume\u201d for exchange data to prevent reporting wash traded activities.

However, the use of Balancer\u2019s liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs) is a growing use case among Defi advanced protocols. LBPs are smart pool templates that allow teams to release a project token while at the same time building deep liquidity. These pools enable teams to create token liquidity without the upfront cost of capital of a constant product 50/50 AMM rule. From an initial 80/20 XYZ/ETH for example a team can slowly adjust pool weights and distribute tokens dynamically. Aave is one of the first major Defi projects integrating a version of a LBP in its Safety Module (SM). An 80% AAVE/20% ETH liquidity pool using Balancer will be used to provide benefits in terms of market depth for the AAVE token and earnings from locking AAVE. On top of that, as a liquidity provider, the SM in Balancer unlocks further rewards from BAL tokens through liquidity in the protocol. In simple terms, Aave here acts as a \u201ccontroller\u201d(owner of a \u201ccontrolled\u201d pool) in Balancer and governs its own self-contained contract using Balancer technology. It is expected that future projects in defi may leverage similar mechanisms for bootstrapping liquidity using balancer flexible architecture. Another clear use case for DeFi and CeFi will be the use of \u201ccontrolled\u201d index funds using balancer customisable and adjustable weights. The generated BPTs (Balancer Pool Tokens), which represent proportional ownership in the pool\u2019s liquidity, can serve as derivative versions for diversifying loan portfolios such as MakerDAO\u2019s (e.g. managed properties). Summary of Noticeable Risks   Circulating supply inflation risk: Due to vesting schedules BAL tokens have a very limited free supply in the open markets outside Balancer and Binance. However, their liquidity mining program will be increasing supply inflation by about 30% this year. Should this extra supply not be utilised in pools, this could create problems for keepers at liquidation events. We believe that a clever combination of liquidity mining and liquidity staking incentives by the protocol will solve this issue in time.  Volatility risk: The project is very new and still suffers from significant volatility orders of magnitude higher than more liquid collaterals in the Maker Vault portfolio.  Complexity & competition risk: Despite the novelty of implementation of multidimensional pools provided by Balancer which combine both AMM and asset management use cases, the project could suffer from its complexity to less technically minded users. Those may decide to stick with simpler implementations such as Uniswap or TokenSets.However, as a protocol primitive to other higher level applications, Balancer offers a powerful use case.  Smart contract exploits risk: Two balancer pools suffered from a sophisticated exploit which implemented a deflationary token hack mechanism draining 500K of pools in June despite the contract been audited twice by then. The extensibility and flexibility of balancer contracts may be one of their core strengths but also their weakest points.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 5% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 4 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 100 Dai For parameter suggestion, the team has used the model described in the governance call here: a credit risk model that estimates the loss distribution of a portfolio of BAL Vaults. Risk parameters are estimated from this hypothetical loss distribution. Inputs to the model are derived from trading volume data along with stressed input parameters. A link to our model specification with inputs and outputs can be found here. Auction parameters have been selected to mirror those for ETH, with the exception of the lot size that has been normalized to a ~$50,000 amount.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 10 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 500 Dai Overview Protocol Summary From Aave Documentation Aave is a decentralized non-custodial money market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity or flash loan) fashion. The platform has 2 types of fees. From borrowers, a 0.00001% of the loan amount is collected on loan origination, from which 20% is used for referral integrators and 80% is allocated in the protocol fund. From Flash Loans, a 0.09% is collected from the loan amount, from which 70% is redirected as extra income for depositors of the protocol and 30% is split using the same 20%/80% model of the origination fee. There are also transaction fees for Ethereum Blockchain usage, these fees depend on the network status and transaction complexity. No platform can be considered entirely risk free. The risks related to our platform are the smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). We take every possible step required to minimize the risk as much as possible-- the protocol code is public and open source and it has been audited. Additionally, we have an ongoing bug bounty campaign live and running. AAVE is used as the center of gravity of Aave protocol governance AAVE is used to vote and decide on the outcome of Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Apart from this AAVE can be staked within the protocol Safety Module to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol. We have released our documentation with specific details about tokenomics and governance for more details please check our flash paper our full documentation and join the discussion in our governance forum. Aave is currently using Chainlink aggregator as a price oracle, but also has a proprietary fallback price oracle in case the prior fails. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues AAVE is trading on several venues including FTX, Gemini while Binance is the dominant by trading volume. Amongst DEX venues, the most popular by far is Uniswap. As seen on the chart below, trading activity increased during the last month. Chart1200\u00d7742 58.6 KB Source of data: CryptoCompare (CEX), Uniswap.info, Kyber Tracker, 0xTracker Token distribution & Issuance schedule The project was incepted during the 2017 ICO era, selling LEND tokens according to the distribution schedule; all team vested tokens and such were already fully vested, meaning all LEND tokens were free floating prior to token migration. During last summer the project completed significant upgrades to the protocol and token. New protocol features demanded for a token with additional functionality (today\u2019s AAVE) which was conducted via token migration. The migration is still undergoing, currently more than 91% of tokens have been migrated. The migration results in a 100:1 LEND:AAVE rate, reducing the supply by a factor of 100. The project also created additional supply of 3M tokens or 23% (13M->16M), where new supply is allocated to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. The reserve was established as a safety and ecosystem incentive, but is currently only used for safety incentives. They reward users who stake their AAVE as a collateral of last resort. The safety incentive is currently set to 400 AAVE distributed between stakers daily, which currently results in ~5% APY based on the current amount of staked tokens (2.9M tokens) Additionally, fees collected by the protocol are allocated to an account owned by the governance and are currently not being distributed yet. Based on Aavewatch, the protocol accrued about ~$500k in fees to date, evenly distributed between flash loans and normal borrowing fees. Token Deposits on Trading Venues Majority of tokens deposited on centralized venues are on Binance which is consistent with the reported trading activity. Aave does not have a clear dominant non-custodial trading venue. Chart1200\u00d7742 15.1 KB Source of data: Nansen Downside Risk For this analysis we constructed the price feed for AAVE with addition of historical LEND prices normalized by token supply. The observed period is one year and as it is evident that AAVE tends to have higher frequency and severity of negative pullbacks. Largest pullback was recorded during the event of Black Thursday in March, when LEND dropped for -47.76% in one day. Chart1200\u00d7742 6.88 KB Source of data: CoinMarketCap Total Value Locked (USD) Assets supplied in the protocol increased rapidly during summer of 2020, when liquidity mining was the most popular and profitable. The abnormally high liquidity mining yields in the ecosystem caused several token interest rates on lending platforms to spike, which pulled a lot of deposits and activity to the protocol. For comparison, Compound protocol which is the strongest competitor in the space, currently only leads the TVL metrics by 22%.814\u00d7421 22.7 KB Source: DefiPulse Total Borrow Volume As opposed to the TVL metric, Compound is leading for much more in the Total Borrow Volume as seen on the chart below. Assets on Compound are utilized much more compared to Aave. The main reason for this dynamic lies in the difference between listed assets on the platform and economic activity of the users. Large share of TVL on Aave is due to assets such as YFI, AAVE, LINK and REN which are not present on Compound. Additionally many positions in Compound are purely constructed for liquidity mining, highly leveraged and would otherwise be non-economic sensible positions. These reasons increase the asset utilization and volume on Compound, while Aave holds a larger amount of actual economically sensible positions such as short and leveraged long positions. 948\u00d7607 20.4 KB Source: DeBank AAVE governance has an ability to enable Ecosystem Incentives, which are a similar concept as COMP liquidity mining, but the feature is currently not utilized. DeFi Presence  3.3M tokens supplied to Aave protocol as collateral, the asset is not enabled for borrowing and lending. 2.9M tokens supplied to Aave Safety Module 115K tokens as liquidity in Uniswap  Summary of Notable Risks  Majority of trading activity is conducted on Binance. DEX volume is relatively low, especially for an asset with such high market capitalization and popularity in the space. AAVE token is enabled as collateral in the protocol, but AAVE tokens deposited in Safety Module serve as insurance/security to the protocol/deposits. This combination can produce unexpected instances where large selling pressure is put on the token. General risks with secondary lenders where aggressive policy of adding new collateral is performed. There are also risks known to secondary lending venues such as bank runs and inability to redeem supplied funds.  Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 6% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling: 10 million Auction Lot Size: 50,000 Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 500 Dai We used the model from the Collateral Risk Assessment Guide here.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 3% Liquidation Ratio: 125% Debt Ceiling: 10 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 2,000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC is the Uniswap LP token consisting of WBTC and DAI. The pool currently has low liquidity of less than $10,000. But there is a highly liquid WBTC/USDC pool with over $7 million in deposits, and some of these users may be interested in moving their positions over if Maker offers borrowing capacity. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. There are not currently any defi platforms offering borrowing capacity or integrating the UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC LP token, or any other BTC/USD LP tokens. Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. Assuming the price of DAI stays stable, a decline in the price of WBTC will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in WBTC, and additional losses caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = WBTC percentage price change * WBTC allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + WBTC percentage price change) / (2 + WBTC percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * WBTC percentage price change)) E.g. if WBTC price suffers 50% percentage drop: Loss from existing holdings = -0.5 * 0.5 = -0.25 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.5) / 1.5) - 1) * (1 - 0.25) = -0.043 UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC loss = -0.293 50% drop in WBTC price leads to 29.3% drop in UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC value, assuming no change in DAI price and excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between WBTC and UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 51.6 KB Uniswap v2 has only been live since May, but based on the past 5 years of BTC price history and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC would have experienced significantly fewer sharp drawdowns than BTC/WBTC individually. Chart1200\u00d7742 10.5 KB Source: Coinbase, Feb 2021 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. Annualized fee earnings in the Uniswap WBTC/USDC pool (the closest analogue with significant liquidity) have fluctuated between 10% and 60% over the past 3 months, with around 40%average annualized returns since early January. Chart1200\u00d7742 68.3 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Feb 2021 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks  While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. LP tokens are vulnerable to custody and credit risk of WBTC. LP shares could face serious decline in value if WBTC lost its peg. If Bitgo blacklisted or froze the DAI-WBTC Uniswap pool, all assets in the pool would be unrecoverable. BTC is a bearer asset, so WBTC faces higher custody risks from potential hacking or insider misconduct than comparable USD stablecoins. UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC will suffer from divergence loss when BTC experiences large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price decline, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs.

Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Overview Metrics and Analysis Risk Parameters  Summary Proposed Risk Parameters Risk Premium: 4% Liquidation Ratio: 165% Debt Ceiling: 5 million DAI Auction Lot Size: 50,000 DAI Minimum Bid Increment: 3% Bid Duration: 6 hours Max Auction Duration: 6 hours Liquidation Penalty: 13% Dust: 2,000 DAI Note: Debt ceiling will initially be set at 3 million DAI, and can be increased after completion of audits on Uniswap collateral type oracles. Overview Protocol Summary Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds. UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH is the Uniswap LP token consisting of AAVE and ETH. It is currently Uniswap\u2019s 2nd most liquid pool with over $180 million in deposits, and also a key trading venue for the AAVE-ETH pair. While it often boasts the highest volume for AAVE among decentralized exchanges, Sushiswap\u2019s AAVE-ETH pairing has roughly twice as much liquidity deposited due to ongoing liquidity incentives. Balancer\u2019s 80% AAVE 20% ETH pool will likely become the top liquidity source due to Aave\u2019s staking incentives. Metrics and Analysis Trading volume on CEX & non-custodial venues (excluding Uniswap) Uniswap LP tokens can be minted and redeemed from the pool contract with the underlying assets. There is essentially no trading of the UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH tokens themselves, so liquidity of LP tokens is best understood as a function of the liquidity of constituent assets. As an example, keepers can liquidate LP token positions by redeeming the token with the contract and then selling the underlying assets. Token Distribution & Issuance Schedule UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH tokens are created and redeemed via the Uniswap pool contract, so the total supply of LP tokens depends on users\u2019 decisions to enter or exit the liquidity pool. There are no centralized minting functions or other inflationary factors in token supply. Token Deposits on Trading Venues and DeFi Exposure UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH is not listed for trading on any centralized or decentralized exchange venues, as creation and redemption is available directly through the pool contract with no fees or slippage. UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH is not widely integrated with defi platforms or lending services. Alpha Homora offers a user interface that supports adding liquidity in unequal amounts, and offers up to 2x leverage on UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH LP in their lending platform (only ETH borrowing is supported, not USD). Downside Risk Because Uniswap LP tokens are not traded independently, it\u2019s not possible to check previous trading history to assess downside risks. But, Uniswap\u2019s invariant function allows for calculating drawdowns deterministically based upon the price performance of constituent assets. Details about LP returns can be found in Uniswap\u2019s blog and this Medium post. A decline in the price of ETH or AAVE will lead to a corresponding decline in the price of UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH from two factors: the loss in value of the 50% of the pool already held in the declining asset, and additional negative returns caused by \u201cdivergence loss\u201d. UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH percentage loss = loss from existing holdings + divergence loss Loss from existing holdings = AAVEETH percentage price change * ETH allocation (50%) + AAVEUSD percentage price change * AAVE allocation (50%) Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(1 + AAVEETH percentage price change) / (2 + AAVEETH percentage price change)) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * AAVEETH percentage price change)) E.g. if AAVE price suffers 50% price drop while ETH suffers 30% drop: Loss from existing holdings = (-0.5 * 0.5) + (-0.3 * 0.5) = -0.4 Divergence loss = ((2 * sqrt(0.7142) / 1.7142) - 1) * (1 + (0.5 * -0.2858)) = -0.012 UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH loss = -0.412 50% drop in AAVE price and 30% drop in ETH price leads to 41.2% drop in UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH value, excluding any positive fees earned by LPs. The relationship between AAVE or ETH price changes and UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH price performance is shown below. Chart1200\u00d7742 45.8 KB Based on the AAVE and ETH price history since the AAVE token migration was initiated and Uniswap\u2019s invariant formula, UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH would have experienced significantly fewer sharp drawdowns than AAVE. Note that the period covered in data below is only from May 2020 through the present, when LEND began to have substantial market cap, trading volumes and liquidity. Chart1200\u00d7742 10.3 KB Source: Cryptocompare, Feb 2021 Historical Fee Returns Uniswap liquidity pools earn a 0.3% fee from each trade. Over time, this income accrues to liquidity providers and helps counteract negative effects of divergence loss. While annualized fee earnings approached 100% at some in the fall, they have trended between 25-50% over the past few weeks. Chart1200\u00d7742 65 KB Source: Uniswap.info, Feb 2021 If Uniswap governance chooses to activate the protocol fee switch, 0.05% of each swap would be redirected from LPs to the Uniswap treasury. This would leave the remaining 0.25% swap fee for LPs, reducing their annualized fee earnings by around 17% assuming volume and liquidity remain constant. Summary of Notable Risks  While Uniswap v2 is a well vetted system, there is a potential for undiscovered bugs or flaws to cause loss of funds. AAVE backstops the Aave lending platform, similarly to how MakerDAO backstops the DAI credit system. During a market downturn, there is higher risk of Aave having a shortfall event, which would put pressure on AAVE token price. This risk is likely to be correlated with risks from other parts of Maker\u2019s portfolio. UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH will suffer from divergence loss when ETH or AAVE experience large moves. LP borrowers may have an incentive to repay their debt and remove liquidity during a large price shift, which would cause pro-cyclical pressures on MakerDAO if DAI supply and liquidity contract during a downturn. Uniswap governance can turn on a 0.05% platform level swap fee, which would be taken from LP earnings and could reduce demand to borrow against UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH. Other decentralized exchange venues such as Sushiswap, Mooniswap, Bancor v2.1 or other platforms compete with Uniswap for volume. If Uniswap captures less volume, this reduces fee returns earned by LPs. LP tokens including ETH increase MakerDAO\u2019s already substantial exposure to ETH price movements.

Outline  Proposed parameters Background Industry analysis Asset originator analysis Issuance platform analysis Implementation details Proposed covenants   Proposed parameters Debt Ceiling: 5M DAI Stability Fee: 3.5% Collateralization Ratio (vault-based): 105% Minimum Collateralization Ratio (pool-based): 108% Underlying Collateralization Ratio (pool/DAI loan): 113%  Background New Silver is an online real estate lender with a primary focus on \u201cfix-and-flip\u201d real estate, a large but fragmented market in the US valued at $60-100 billion annually. Most of their loans are for single family residence properties with terms of 12-24 months. Together with Centrifuge, they are proposing to use Tinlake pools to deposit into a Maker vault and generate DAI as a credit facility. References:  MIP6 Application: New Silver DROP: Real Estate-Backed Loans MIP22: Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module   Industry analysis \u201cFix-and-flip\u201d real estate is a large and growing industry in the US, accounting for roughly 7% of all real estate transactions. The strategy is to buy a property and improve it with high-value renovations in order to sell it at a substantially higher price in a relatively short time. As with regular mortgage lending, loans are backed by the property and the borrower must invest its own capital alongside the lender. New Silver focuses on companies that pursue fix-and-flip on a professional basis and non-owner-occupied properties, operating in an area known as \u201chard money\u201d lending for real estate investors. Traditional lenders have used FHA-backed construction loans in the consumer market, and new online services typically focus on retail consumer mortgages, such as Rocket Mortgage. Some fix-and-flip competitors include: Lending Home, RCN Capital and Lima One Capital. LendingHome (https://www.lendinghome.com) is an online version of a \u201chard money\u201d lender, offering bridge loans and longer-term rental loans. Bridge loans are often referred to as \u201chard money\u201d due to their short-term nature, and generally come with a higher interest rate. Bridge loans also can be offered at a higher Loan-to-Value (LTV), sometimes up to 90%, and sometimes alongside other loans, and can take the form of rehabilitation loans. Like New SIlver, LendingHome performs rapid pre-approvals online. Founded in 2013, LendingHome has funded over $5 billion for over 23,000 projects, and provides statistics about the industry in 11 of the states where they operate (out of 28 states). RCN Capital (https://rcncapital.com/) offers fix-and-flip, rental and bridge loans, and bridge loans can apply to multi-family or commercial properties. Most of its loans seem to be short-term, running for 12 months to 24 months, though rental loans can have 30-year terms, like traditional mortgages. Established in 2010, their scope is nationwide and in most US states. They also work with real estate brokers. Lima One Capital (https://limaone.com) offers loans for a full range of investment property financing needs, including fix-and-flip, rental, multi-family and new construction. Its website includes a link to the public record of its mortgage banking licenses in various states. Interestingly, if the borrower owns another property, it can be used as collateral in lieu of a down payment. Lima One also works with real estate brokers, offering preferential service to the most active brokers. New Silver uses advanced techniques for automated lending approval and deals primarily with businesses. Then a traditional process of property appraisal and loan servicing is used to issue and manage loans to maturity. New Silver operates in a small number of US states (currently 6) where they are legally exempt from mortgage lending regulation (39 US states offer exemptions from mortgage license requirements). They utilize credit scores of company directors and Attom and Clear Capital for automated valuation models as part of the approval process. The relatively short term of New Silver\u2019s loans limits risk substantially, as changes in the real estate market generally take place over a number of years. Nevertheless, black swan events can occur and the recent one in 2008-09 provides a useful worst-case scenario. As Wall Street leveraged up subprime mortgages based on an obvious bubble caused by 10 years of money printing, the bubble burst and shoddy lending practices resulted in widespread foreclosures, collapsing real estate markets in inflated areas. The worst-hit markets dropped up to 40% over a period of 18 months to two years, and lending freezes made it difficult for buyers to step in. Such events are exceedingly rare, but it provides a kind of stress test for downward price movements in real estate, which typically move up gradually over many years. This event demonstrates a price floor of -40% in some parts of the US. However, it is much more likely that a particular property will experience some problems, in which case that risk can be monitored and mitigated, as will be discussed below. The process of recovering from loan defaults is well defined, and most options do not involve foreclosure, where the primary lender pursues a sometimes lengthy legal process for repossessing a property. Default rates were elevated during the subprime crisis, but the US market has recovered and for fix-and-flip or hard money loans, default rates may have been as low as 1% in 2008-09 or as much as 2% in 2013, according to this article. The current real estate market during the pandemic has been strong in non-urban areas, and some data backs that up. There are also negative economic impacts in some urban areas as people move away from them, and the economic fallout is still playing out. New Silver estimates that only 5% of defaults end up in foreclosure, indicating a diversity of resolutions are possible. This diagram illustrates the default process:  New Silver Default Process 30 Oct 20717\u00d71052 29.1 KB   Asset originator analysis Founded in 2018, New Silver Lending LLC is a relative newcomer to the hard money lending industry in the US. It takes a tech-heavy approach to streamlining the loan underwriting process, using a variety of data sources and metrics to assess creditworthiness and suitability of a borrower and property. After providing a pre-approval within minutes, New Silver collects a variety of due diligence information prior to issuing the final approval, contingent upon an official property assessment by a third party. Credit scores of the individuals in a company are averaged together. As mentioned above, New Silver currently operates in 6 US states - Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Texas and New York, though it aims to expand into a total of 39 states. Its loan portfolio consists mostly of purchase + renovation loans with short-term maturities of 12-24 months. The small proportion of long-term loans will not be included in the Tinlake pool and Maker credit line. New Silver is the only lender for a property and keeps the senior debt position, which is transferred to the SPV and indirectly to Maker via the mechanism described in \u201cIssuance platform analysis,\u201d below. The management team consists of: Alex Shvayetsky, Managing Partner: 25 years in real estate investment and management and property development, including 22 years as CFO of Udolf Enterprises, a large commercial property operator based in Connecticut. Kirill Bensonoff, Managing Partner: an experienced entrepreneur in enterprise IT, starting his career at IBM Global Solutions and an active investor and advisor at over 30 startups and also active in private lending, driving the vision to enable a new user experience in private lending while using modern software to scale. Alexey Shevchenko, CTO: full-stack developer with years of experience in real estate, blockchain and fintech, previously CTO of OpenLTV, which enables fractional investing in high-quality short-term debt backed by real estate with yields of 8 to 12%. From 2019 to the present, New Silver provided 134 loans at a notional value of $34,510,864. In 2019, all loans were sold to a range of partners and serviced by New Silver and a third-party servicer. The average loan size is $195,000 with an average Loan To Value of 71%. The interest rate charged to borrowers is around 12% and varies up or down based on loan amount/LTV and creditworthiness. The goal going forward is to refinance those loans via Maker. New Silver has never experienced a default by any of its borrowers. The default process is shown above, and there are numerous remedies that can be pursued before the estimated 5% of cases in which a foreclosure is required. Default can be triggered by delinquency of a monthly interest-only payment or the \u201cballoon\u201d payment at the end (which is the loan amount). In about 80% of cases, payments resume, and then in 80% of the remaining 20% of cases a work-out is implemented. Foreclosure is the last resort and very undesirable to borrowers because of its impact on their credit standing, and is also more time-consuming than the other remedies. Work-outs are usually document-based, such as assuming a controlling role in the borrower\u2019s LLC or a deed-in-lieu transfer, which can take from a few weeks to a few months - on the shorter end of the time scale if a loan is sold and on the longer end if the property is sold. Foreclosure can take 6 months or longer if it goes through the state court system, but it can also proceed directly as a distress sale, with a potential recovery of 50-90% of the market value. It should be noted that borrowers will be very motivated to maintain good standing if they have a significant amount of equity in the property, and especially if their own funds are at stake. This kind of loan is backed by real estate as collateral, after all. This is the reason that Loan-to-Value or Loan-to-Cost percentages are kept within reasonable levels, usually 70-80%. The automated pre-approval process includes a variety of checks that reduce risk and the cost of underwriting. These checks include:  FICO score of the borrower Borrower experience (low: 0-1, medium: 2-3, high: 4+) Automated Property Valuation Average days on market in Zip Code Standard deviation from median sales price in zip code  FHFA HPI Maximum Yearly Decrease 2006-2018 in County and State vs National  ZHVI (Zillow Home Value Index) Median sale price for zip code to ARV % Monthly sales count by zip code Census data - average household income, town population  Before issuing final loan approval, additional information is collected, including:  Appraised property value Borrower liquidity Borrower and entity background Entity Good Standing Corporate docs Verification of experience OFAC Flood zone Insurance If its a condo, HOA and master policy  While New Silver assesses these metrics at the time of loan origination, Maker will assess and monitor risk via an asset valuation model that incorporates the same valuation metrics and others, which will be described in detail below. For most projects there is a second construction loan, on top of the primary loan for acquiring or refinancing the property. The construction loan is based on the initial assessment of After Repair Value, and is kept within a maximum level of 85% of ARV (usually less). As the construction proceeds, the borrower puts up their own cash at each step and then requests an inspection. A third party makes the inspection and reports if the proposed work was done, then that portion of the construction loan is sent to the borrower. In this manner, the construction process is closely monitored, and never exceeds the agreed level of ARV. Fix-and-flip is growing and services like New Silver and its competitors are expanding the range of financing options for property investors. Even during the pandemic, demand for properties in some areas is growing and by selectively choosing the markets experiencing the most growth, while avoiding the markets that experienced the most declines in the bursting housing bubble of 2009, New Silver can use the Maker credit facility to grow its business and increase DAI generation.  Issuance platform analysis New SIlver has partnered with Centrifuge, a tokenization platform focused on loans as assets. Unlike tokenization platforms designed to turn assets like real estate into fungible or non-fungible tokens, Centrifuge creates a bridge between lending in the real world and borrowing DAI. The asset pool it creates is called Tinlake and it uses two tokens to establish senior and junior debt positions, DROP and TIN. The SPV can issue some DROP to be deposited in a Maker vault to borrow DAI, while TIN and other DROP are offered to external investors or purchased by the Asset Originator itself. The TIN tokens fluctuate based on a NAV (Net Asset Value) model and provide a safety buffer for DROP holders by taking portfolio losses first. DROP holders have the equivalent of senior position in traditional collateral-based loans, though the main difference is that a lender with senior position can take possession of the underlying collateral in the case of default, whereas in the Centrifuge model, TIN holders create a buffer and the SPV that holds the Tinlake pool can exercise its right to repossess collateral on behalf of the DROP holders. For Asset Originators using the Centrifuge platform, the expectation is that they must deal with defaults in their portfolio in the normal ways, as discussed above, and the Maker liquidation model must account for this, as discussed below. Centrifuge is a startup based in Germany that has worked closely with Maker in POCs and community proposals and is extending its platform to integrate with Maker vaults and smart contracts. The Centrifuge platform was launched on May 26, 2020 and the company was founded in 2017.  Implementation details The Centrifuge model is used in this case and several aspects of the model are worth mentioning here. First, the issuance of DROP and TIN tokens is handled via Securitize, with AML/KYC procedures and compliance with US securities guidelines. Investors based in the US must be accredited investors (generally defined as having a net worth of at least $1 million). The SPV issues DROP tokens for the Maker vault, and Centrifuge will post legal discussion about potential implications for Maker. Second, MIP22 provides a liquidation mechanism for the Maker vault, and the liquidation process will depend on the type of underlying asset. In general, the liquidation process is triggered by the TIN value falling below the minimum collateralization ratio set for the Asset Originator. There is no auction or keeper function to liquidate the vault, but Centrifuge can \u201clock\u201d incoming funds to redeem DROP tokens and prevent further loans. The collateralization model is illustrated here:  Collat levels diagram 61280\u00d7720 137 KB  The risk mitigation process looks like this:  Risk process 21148\u00d7871 131 KB  Centrifuge has its own mechanism to protect the safety of DROP, and that level has been set at 118% of the DROP level, i.e., TIN is 15% of the pool. When the Centrifuge NAV model detects TIN value moving below that level, the Tinlake pool will freeze the ability to invest in DROP and allow the Asset Originator to increase TIN investment or adjust its portfolio. If the TIN level gets above 15%, the pool reverts to normal. The Maker liquidation mechanism is detailed in MIP22 and is an extension of the Centrifuge platform. The Maker liquidation results in removal of all DROP in the Maker vault, and funds coming into the Tinlake pool will redeem DROP. This is a drastic action, and will likely take time to complete. Therefore, it makes sense to monitor the pool and underlying portfolio and be proactive with the Asset Originator at the earliest warning sign. In addition, a violation of any covenant below can trigger risk mitigation. Before liquidation is triggered, the Risk team will make an assessment and may propose an executive vote to decide on reducing the debt ceiling or activating liquidation. For New Silver, it makes sense to allow sufficient time to mitigate any issue in its portfolio. This time period could be one month to several months, depending on further discussion with New Silver and Centrifuge. The standard NAV model in Centrifuge, and the NAV calculation framework, is modeled on invoice factoring, and over time we will suggest some changes for other asset types like real estate. For example, monthly payments of interest only carry some weight in consideration of default, rather than only lateness of the balloon payment at the end of a 24-month term. Invoice factoring expects one payment at the end of a very short term. Regardless, lateness in monthly payments will be monitored via the asset valuation model described below, and Maker will have its own safety buffers, as described below.  Proposed covenants  Allowed investments The allowed investments by the SPV are real estate investment loans of 12- to 24-month duration, whether including a renovation component or not, and within maximum LTV (Loan to Value) or LTC (Loan to Cost) levels of 80% and 85% respectively.  Minimum collateralization ratio The Minimum Collateralization Ratio is set as a floor by Maker to protect the collateral in the Maker vault. This is based on the Tinlake pool but below the TIN-adjusted Collateralization Ratio. The value of a potential default resulting in 50% loss of one loan (worst case of distressed sale) is $95K on average. With a vault size of $4 mill, the TIN level could decrease from 118% to 113% if two such defaults occurred. To give room for four worst-case defaults, the Minimum Collateralization Ratio is set at 108% of the overall DROP level. We won\u2019t provide 1:1 DAI for nominal DROP value. The initial parameter is to allow a vault collateral ratio as low as 105%. In other words, a loan of 100 DAI can be generated from 105 DROP value. See \u201cCollateralization ratio proposed threshold,\u201d below.  Collateralization ratio The Risk team has created a tracking sheet that models the value of the underlying property portfolio, and calculates the loan amounts as the assets in a Tinlake pool, basically as a check on the Tinlake pool. Due to NDA, it is not possible to share this document. The model will evolve over time, but it starts with a total of the loan amounts and remaining pool value compared to the TIN amount shown in the pool, and monitoring of equity value in the underlying portfolio. New Silver will provide a monthly update of their loan portfolio. This gives the Risk team a view of the underlying properties and any anomalies that may require discussion with New Silver. Over time, this view will be supplemented with external data sources that validate property values. In addition, New Silver has agreed to provide API access to their data so a Maker dashboard can access not only the loan tape but also underwriting criteria. In general, this view of the underlying properties is an early-warning signal provider and ensures that Maker is confident about a number of potential scenarios:  Increasing the debt ceiling Increasing the timeframe before liquidation, should a collateralization level be crossed Reducing the Stability Fee  Of course, red flags that are not remedied could lead to actions in the reverse direction. From the view of the underlying properties, the total loan value is used in a monthly snapshot of the balance sheet, using some values available in the Tinlake pool UI, such as total DROP supply and Pool Reserve. This provides a check on the TIN level as well as a view of the overall pool status. The debt amount is the one on the Maker vault but also the amount subscribed by other co-investors. Total DROP supply accounts for all DROP investments, not just the DROP in the Maker vault. We expect other investors to participate in Tinlake pools, either with TIN or DROP. New Silver has proposed to be the primary TIN investor initially. Other DROP investors can\u2019t deposit into the Maker vault, but they have similar rights as senior debt holders. See \u201cStakeholder rules\u201d below. This part also contains the data that the SPV should provide on an ongoing basis to the risk team. As mentioned above, New SIlver has agreed to provide monthly snapshots of its loan tape, and eventually API access to its data.  Collateralization ratio proposed threshold New Silver has proposed a TIN proportion of 15% of the overall pool. That means a DROP proportion of 85%, and therefore a pool/DROP ratio of 118% (100%/85%), referred to as the TIN-adjusted collateralization ratio. This is based on the Tinlake pool itself. From the pool perspective, Maker proposes a minimum underlying collateralization ratio of 108% of all DROP, called the Minimum Collateralization Ratio. The Maker vault receives DROP from the SPV and is likely to be the largest holder of DROP. The vault imposes its own collateralization ratio of 105%, thereby limiting the DAI that can be withdrawn and in effect creating a small discount for its DROP. This creates a slight buffer in the vault itself, and compensates for a slightly lower interest rate. The Stability Fee of the vault\u2019s DAI loan is 3.5%, whereas DROP receives a 5% yield generally. In addition to the TIN-adjusted Collateralization Ratio and the Minimum Collateralization Ratio, we also propose a pool/DAI loan or Underlying Collateralization Ratio of 113%. Even though there will be other DROP investors, it is clear that overcollateralization in the vault will have in addition at least 8% overcollateralization in the pool based on the MCR. From an overall pool perspective, Maker gets four buffers of safety:  TIN-adjusted Collateralization Ratio, triggering Tinlake pool actions Minimum Collateralization Ratio including TIN as well, triggering Maker actions DROP co-investors, who share our interests Vault collateralization ratio, for the Maker portion of DROP  In addition, another level of safety exists in the properties and New Silver\u2019s borrowers. The loans represent only a portion of the overall property values, and the borrowers have their own equity at risk. Assuming the worst case of 85% ARV or LTC, there is a 15% buffer outside of the loans. Calculating this (1 / 0.85 x 1 / 0.85 x 1.05 with no DROP co-investors) reveals a \u201creal-world\u201d collateralization ratio of 145.33% (usually higher). The initial Debt Ceiling is proposed at $5 mill, and New Silver estimates it could reach that level within two months of opening the Maker vault.  Concentration risks The maximum loan amount for a single loan is the maximum of 10% of the pool or $500k. The maximum exposure to a borrower is 25% (with a pool size of $5 mill or $1,500k) if FICO score is above 650, and 10% or $500k if FICO is below 650. More important are geographic diversity and choice of markets where the chance of severe price drops and defaults is relatively low. Maximum loan concentration is 30% per state. New Silver must focus on areas with price appreciation, jobs growth and a robust sales environment. Regarding the current situation with COVID-19 and the potential impact on default rates in some urban areas, New Silver has focused on suburban areas where demand is growing and prices are rising. While it is true that rising defaults in cities could impact markets generally, that also creates opportunity for its borrowers in the form of additional inventory to fix and flip. An additional covenant is to manage the location of properties to be in areas of price and demand growth.  Stakeholders rules The Risk team has assessed that Centrifuge is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months. This impression is based on an analysis of bank statements and internal forecast models from the company. The Risk team has assessed that New Silver is financially sound and most likely will be in business in 12 months. This impression is based on an analysis of recent financial statements. Details of the Centrifuge model and investors in a Tinlake pool were mentioned above. TIN investors are providing equity in the pool, and therefore it makes sense for the Asset Originator to be a primary investor in TIN. In addition, it could make sense to require a minimum level of DROP co-investors, as they could assist in enforcing contract rights, benefitting Maker. New Silver should always keep an exposure of $40k in the TIN tranche of the pool. The MakerDAO vault should not have more than 75% of the outstanding DROP. ",

You end up quickly with something of investment grade quality. That\u2019s because most of the risk is on the junior tranches.

Compared to CrescoFin, we don\u2019t have insurance but are taking a senior tranche. We are targeting a BBB risk which I think is good. I think we don\u2019t want too much risk currently as we don\u2019t have the solvency tools in place to sustain losses. On the smart contract risk, and I would say more broadly the operational risk, it\u2019s hard to price that exactly and remains competitive. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think we should go in higher credit quality because the decrease in credit risk doesn\u2019t compensate the still present operational risk. We can target pocket of good yield (mainly stuff that no big bank really care because it doesn\u2019t scale and too complex to manage on their side). But after that, you are right, I have no idea what we can do. We can hope that the yield curve will improve when our size will be too big. 3% is, for me, the limit on the low side. Governance can signal they want more or less. Happy to discuss if you have a source of CLO with a 4% floor and good credit rating (and I would add short maturity). We might also want to invest in long maturity to avoid, as you say, the fall in interest rates (that I think will happen). But we have no idea how to manage interest rate risk.

This is far from optimal given the effort it will take to make sure RWAs don\u2019t cost MakerDAO any money. When I said we should set a floor I meant that the floor for MakerDAO lending to RWAs that are more or less BBB-rated should be set at 4% which is in my opinion reasonable. CLO debt tranches price their cost of borrowing at 1-month LIBOR plus a spread. However, they also make sure that no matter what the floor on LIBOR is 100 bps. So there is no borrowing at 0.25 plus a spread because it would be uneconomical. BBB-rated CLOs with a 3-year loan maturity are priced at around LIBOR plus 350 bps.  Screen Shot 2020-12-04 at 5.19.26 PM1139\u00d7411 43.5 KB This is in line with what I think we should be charging, which is far above what the BBB-rated corporate bonds are charging. If we want to compete with them, then we will be at a marked disadvantage. Instead of trying to import the yield curve that is manipulated by central banks, we should be working to create a DeFi yield curve that is priced by the free market. This is what Robert Sharrat of CrescoFin is trying to accomplish and I think we should be trying to work with him and Aave to possibly create a bigger pie rather than fighting for crumbs which hurts both protocols. Since he owns 95% of the company, he intends on selling his equity in order to finance operations. I was trying to convince him to work with us to onboard wCRES tokens and use them to open a working capital line of credit. MakerDAO would have a super safe form of collateral (possibly use it as strategic reserves) and he wouldn\u2019t be forced to sell his ownership stake given that he has built it from the ground up and financed it all. Since he has credit insurance experience, he has the infrastructure to invest in listed securities, and a passion for bringing RWAs to DeFi why not work with him rather than against him. On the one hand, he can focus on onboarding institutional investors (i.e. KYC-compliant) and TradFi assets (e.g. asset-backed securities); on the other, MakerDAO can focus on onboarding DeFi assets and non KYC-compliant investors. It doesn\u2019t have to be a zero sum game, it can be a win-win-win scenario. ",

The probability to have a credit even is the same, when on the CLO tranches it\u2019s more often 100% of losses. That\u2019s the difference between losing 1M of a 5M vault and losing the 5M. I don\u2019t think that there is a free lunch. Speaking of food, I would make the analogy between tranches and the movie The Platform (El Hoyo). A BBB bond is like eating from level 1 to level 60.

NS-DROP yield is 5% APR (not APY like our vaults) and we are giving a way to refinance those tokens. There is an extra cushion on top of the NS-DROP token. We can be wrong, but we feel quite safe. Quite sure we can find a way to make a NS-TIN vault that can yield a 20%+ yield. But the risk would be quite big and not serious. If this experiment is working well, quite sure also that we would be able to ask NS for a custom pool that match our preferences. @Planet_X I think it\u2019s a third way.

Planet_X:  Maker is underestimating the risk involved   I am suggesting that anything below 4% without insurance on principal is underestimating the risk. By bringing in the yield curve of TradFi (i.e. LIBOR and Prime) we are trying to compete with an infinite supply of negative real interest rates. They don\u2019t care about credit risk because they can just print their way out of insolvency, MakerDAO cannot.     SebVentures:  the issue with BBB CLO tranches is that there is many tranches on top of it   Actually there are also many tranches beneath which absorb defaults first which serves as a cushion against losses. Also, CLOs lend on an over-collateralized basis to further insulate against credit risk. In order for the BBB to lose any money all of the equity, B- and BB-tranche has to be wiped out. This would be EXTREMELY unlikely since BB-rated tranches have only sustained 1.5% defaults over 2 decades.

The interest rates on BB-rated CLO debt is in the range of 6.5% with the credit risk of a A-rated corporate bond. The same kinds of structures exist for other assets such as collateralized mortgage obligations, insurance-linked securities (i.e. catastrophe bonds), collateralized bond obligations, credit card asset backed securities, student loan asset backed securities, and so on. Only institutional investors can purchase these assets which is why I want someone like Robert to act as the bridge between TradFi and DeFi. MakerDAO can then be the source of long-term capital. ",

In NS-DROP, our loan is similar to the AAA tranche (31% of buffer on the property value vs 35-40% in the infographic). Your BB tranche is more or less the TIN tranche (the equity tranche being the borrower equity). I made a quick analysis for a base case (1% default, 80% recovery on the property value), mild case (20% default, 60% recovery) and big stress (50% default, 50% recovery). I don\u2019t model price appreciation from the renovation which is why, borrowers are always losing money. There is a bit of randomness, but Maker is only sometimes impacted in case of a big stress. The TIN tranche take a serious hit already in the mild case and is fully destroyed in case of a big stress. The yield on the vault equity is a bit overestimated, but probably something to adjust moving forward.  The last line is the yield if you had invested in the overall pool (TIN + DROP), before being shared between TIN, vault equity and Maker Loan (with DROP = vault equity + Maker Loan). Again, it\u2019s something simplistic, maybe buggy and not fully accurate. But it gives the idea. ",

Over the past decade, BRMK has only sustained 0.1% in loss of principal. Most of it can be attributed to superior management, conservative LTV, and having multiple exit strategies. Even though BRMK has no debt at the entity level they do have individual mortgages that yield a weighted average of 16% which is comparable to the DROP token. I think the equity shares paying 7% are a good proxy to the TIN token given that they are in a sense senior-secured. Even though New Silver is not tried and tested, are more aggressive with a much higher LTV, and carry more overall risk related to technology and legal compliance they are getting a cost of borrowing that is about half of what the free market would dictate from a Blue Chip real estate investment trust.

I agree that on paper and before study, investing in BRMK seems a better solution. If we remove the fact that one asset is equity (and has lost 18% YTD) and the other a bond, sure 7% is better than 3.5%. Nevertheless, the risk evaluation still shows that we think NS-DROP is a good collateral to start onboarding RWA in Maker. Who knows, maybe we will onboard BRMK in 2 years thanks to the success of NS-DROP. ",

Regarding previous comments, New Silver had no defaults in 2019 or 2020 and has benefitted from the coronavirus, on the whole. Yes there is still some risk as defaults in urban areas go up. This is discussed in the risk evaluation and the short summary is demand and prices are rising in suburban areas. No one is arguing about 7% dividend on a stock, which comes with capital gain or loss and no preferential rights (unless preferred shares). And I think CrescoFin and Broadmark were two different topics. I\u2019ll be back with comments about the two aforementioned issues (non-judicial foreclosure and deed-in-lieu). It\u2019s great to get diverse input and points of view - a big strength of this community! ",

                    "content": "About the issues mentioned before, here are some details: Judicial and non-judicial foreclosure states - needless to say, in states that allow non-judicial foreclosure, the foreclosure process can be relatively fast, though the rules vary widely state by state. New Silver does not restrict its lending to these states, and of the states they are active in, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Texas allow non-judicial foreclosure, while Connecticut is a strict foreclosure state which allows courts to be bypassed in certain cases. Prior to foreclosure, there are more desirable and faster paths to a resolution. These are shown in the default process diagram in the risk assessment, but in a generalized form. The better options are deed in lieu of foreclosure, which is allowed in all states though NY has a regulation that makes it less attractive to lenders, and pledge of shares, which gives the lender controlling interest in the borrowing company. Since New Silver only lends to companies, pledge of shares is both feasible and desirable. In terms of priority, pledge of shares is at the top, shown in the diagram at the same level as a successful work-out. Deed in lieu is an alternative to foreclosure that may be faster but may also include less than 100% recovery of the loan amount, and distressed sale, which has the potential to recover considerably less than 100% of the loan amount, are at the same level just above judicial foreclosure, and all of these undesirable options including foreclosure account for 20% of 20% (ie, 4%) of default scenarios. Deed in lieu of foreclosure and a short sale are both feasible since New Silver is the only lender on a property, and they are somewhat less damaging to the borrower\u2019s credit than foreclosure. It is worth mentioning that New Silver uses a third party servicing agent to handle work-outs and foreclosures according to the rules of each state. Also it is important to understand that New Silver has normally sold its loans to a number of partner companies. Selling loans is another method of last resort, and one that is quite accessible to New Silver. Finally, a new feature in New Silver\u2019s platform, FlipScout, provides an automated way to find and evaluate \u201cflippable\u201d properties. In the context of default options, FlipScout could provide a way for distressed properties to find buyers, including any that may be in its portfolio, thereby facilitating short sales. This is another possible failsafe mechanism, and it could potentially shorten the timeframe to achieve a sale. Once again, New Silver has never experienced a default both before and during the pandemic. ",

                    "content": "Hello, I am the Managing Partner at New Silver, I have been keeping my eye on the discussion, and happy to answer questions here. I wanted to point out a few details about some of the comments earlier on:  We will be working on making the investment in DROP and TIN more attractive, and I believe it will be over time. If we think about publicly traded REITs (which we are not necessarily a great comparison for), the average across the board is 5-7%. Furthermore, by buying equity in a traded security, you assume downside risk should underlying collateral or general market conditions change (of course, there may be an upside as well). I took a look at Broadmark, whilst they may be a good business, they are not a great comparison to ours - they lend in different geographies, in different amounts and use a different asset class as collateral. They target commercial projects, with a minimum loan amount of $500k up to $50mm. For comparison, our minimum loan amount is $100k and average loan is $200k. We lend to small businesses that are in the \u201cfix and flip\u201d business focuses on single family residential assets, whilst their focus is on larger commercial assets. These assets are less diversified and may be more risky, as was shown during the recent pandemic. They started paying dividends, from what I can tell, about a year ago, according to their own website and here: https://www.dividend.com/stocks/real-estate/reit/other/brmk-broadmark-realty-capital-inc/ . So their track record there is not long, and dividends are subject to change any time. If we look at price of their equity, its down about 20% on the 1 year and about 10% on the 5 year. So any dividend gains would be wiped out by losses on the security price. We started in 2019 and have gone through the full wrath of Covid, and none of the properties in our portfolio had been foreclosed upon. To date, we have originated over $35mm worth of loans. There are many investment options, some pay a higher yield and others lower. I believe we are in the general market for our type of asset, and we are working on making this better. Our differentiator is the tech we built, which we hope will make originations less expensive and less risky.  I hope I have addressed some of the points, but probably not all, that were mentioned earlier. Happy to answer questions as they come up. Thank you. ",
