                    "content": "We are approaching a point where fixing the peg with stablecoins won\u2019t be possible without having a great majority of collateral locked in centralized stablecoins. From past experience, it\u2019s clear to me  that the problem (peg) won\u2019t go away if we add just another 100M of stablecoins to the books. Instead of waiting a month or so for this to happen and losing more market share and reputation because of being way off the peg - I suggest a new approach. Let\u2019s print 100M DAI, buy ETH and deposit it as collateral that we keep on our books for as long as we decide. Assuming we buy ETH below $450, we can keep it (sell for DAI and cancel the debt) until:  1 DAI = $1 OR 1 ETH = (insert any value here, i.e. $600) OR the emergency shutdown OR until needed (as a kind of surplus(hopefully) buffer) OR forever \u2026  We can have a separate discussion/governance poll about what to do with the ETH collateral. Pros :  100M DAI will be sold immediately for ETH bringing the DAI price down. decreasing dependence on stablecoins the announcement and the purchase of ETH could start the positive loop and keep the ETH price above our purchase price avoiding the system being undercollateralized.  Cons  DAI may become temporarily or permanently (if ETH price never goes up) undercollateralized probably needs some manual action for execution sets a precedent (this is not good, right) 100M might not be enough to lower the DAI price to $1  So, should we print 100M DAI, buy ETH with it and deposit it in a vault?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     All the technical details could be worked out later if there is a will to use this method. If you like (not hate) this method but you are afraid that we won\u2019t be able to execute it successfully (i.e. ETH price moving too fast, the amount is too big/small, problems with unwinding, other complications\u2026 please vote Yes and No) The poll will be open for 2 weeks unless there is a majority  for \u201cYes\u201d who wants to move faster with the implementation.

Speaking personally, generally i am supportive of this idea and have been advocating for selling DAI for other non-protocol assets for some time, but i could see someone taking issue with the 100M price tag. Additionally I also have a question of what we would be doing when we \u201cbuy ETH and deposit it as collateral.\u201d Presumably we are opening a vault here. Would we draw DAI out against that ETH at that point? If so how do we manage servicing that debt? Lastly there is the question of if ETH is the right choice.
