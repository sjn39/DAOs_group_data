Right now there\u2019s two majors concerns that seem like they need to be addressed:  Editors are having to help juggle and steward many different EIPs through the process The quality of EIPs is largely dependent upon the author because EIP editors can\u2019t be experts in all different topics that are discussed  For this reason, it seems like we\u2019re encountering some boundaries of the current model of governance where we can efficiently ship standards that lead to rough consensus and running, interoperable code.

I don\u2019t want to weigh in too strongly before understanding the problem better, and also understanding how other communities (IETF, W3C, etc.) deal with stewarding proposals. What do you think are the key causes of these challenges? The editors do seem to lack the operational support and ability to recruit help vs. other groups who are a part of the larger process. And it also seems as if there has not been enough editors to handle the workload, particularly as there are EIPs and ERCs being submitted from so many different topics / technical areas. ",

To me each of these tasks are big enough these days that they could be separated out at this point. Especially for volunteers who often time have secondary work outside of this. Even just splitting off the need to be a domain expert and editorial review from the enforcement/governance of process would be helpful IMO. This could be done via the usage of a process to form working groups (WG) is what I\u2019m thinking and as a part of this \u201cchairs\u201d and \u201ceditors\u201d of the WG can exist to help steward specific proposals through the EIP process. At face value this sounds simple, but there\u2019s likely a lot of things that would still need to be addressed if there\u2019s buy in to go in this direction. For example,  how do we know if there\u2019s enough interest to establish a WG? How do we go about selecting people to run these WG? What expertise do they need to do so? What do we need to do to bring the appropriate people into these WGs to better establish consensus?  Additionally, I think it would be useful to consider how this might affect this other thread @xinbenlv has proposed here: Discussion of Criteria for advancing EIP status: A Straw-man Proposal - #8 by kdenhartog Just some thoughts to keep the discussion moving here ",

People with successful EIP Lane one: EIPs that have had previous EIP Authors vouching for the new author or they themselves are an author of the EIP in waiting.   People without successful EIP Lane Two: pending EIP authors must wait a min. of x amount of days before acceptance such that their is sufficient time for the res publica to be informed about this. Additionally have them submit to some mandatory event or process. Eg attending one ACD (not necessarily to speak, etc) or even better having them implement some portion of their proposal (can be a toy implementation etc).  The idea being that the process itself filters out less serious proposals by imposing a min. fixed cost of time on their part that is commensurate with the scope of their EIP. I think having previous author\u2019s involvement for providing a reference will bring additional benefits as well. Edit: Also this would mean making a list of EIP Process Status, i.e.: Draft / Pre Qualify Pending Consideration, Accepted but not Implemented, Implemented, Obsolete These would be editor status, a sort of EIP meta categories ",

We shared a lot of thoughts and views. Given EIP has earned a lot adoption and respect while the latest activities on drafting and reviewing EIPs seems encounter a few challenges, it\u2019s good to start discussion about how we could borrow the wisdoms from various mature standard body. I think we can try to learn from IETF/W3C and a few others. Whether to \u201cmove into\u201d is an open questions and I don\u2019t have a good answer yet. I recognize the difference between Web3 space vs traditional web space, and the role of EIP for Ethereum rather than IETF/W3C for general web. Also the legitimacy of  a standard body mainly comes from the adopting stakeholders. And the main stakeholders (browsers, email client, websites, etc) of IETF/W3C and other standard body are quite different from EIP\u2019s adopting stakeholders (Web3 wallet, Smart Contract etc). Therefore we probably want to sort out a better way to identify stakeholders and invite them. Let\u2019s chat a bit more. @kdenhartog and I will start some Zoom / Discord voice chat soon.

For me I don\u2019t think the answer is that we need more editors, but rather that we should distribute their responsibilities to more people. From a governance perspective this is also useful because it decentralizes the power placed in any one role within the standardization process.     TimDaub:  Having had conflicts with EIP editors, I think one problem is also that their job is to criticize a submitter\u2019s proposal, and while this makes it eventually better (I appreciate all EIP editor\u2019s critique), this giving of feedback will inevitably lead to feelings being hurt too. Do people see this as a real problem, or am I off here?   Personally, I think feedback is a feature not a bug (which I\u2019d guess is your believe as well @TimDaub), but with that said I think the only real feedback within the process which has the power to affect the standard is the editors which is more of a bug than a feature. A standardization process is to meant to establish consensus, usually by way of controversy, and feedback is necessary to achieve that in my opinion. If there\u2019s no one providing feedback then the specification probably isn\u2019t well suited as a standard.     TimDaub:  We once practiced Holacracy, and one key tenant was that mediators must always focus on executing the process and not voicing their subject-matter opinion. E.g., I had EIP editor fights over ideas I brought to fruition as EIPs, but these could have been avoided if the EIP editor had strictly reviewed for form and not the proposal\u2019s idea(ls).

Dunno, just an idea.   I agree this is a problem. While I understand that all of the EIP editors today have good intentions and operate in good faith we can all find ourselves at times tied to a particular idea, solution, or way of doing things. I know I\u2019ve encountered this numerous times when working on standards. With that said, I think it\u2019s important for editors themselves to recognize which \u201chat they\u2019re wearing\u201d when providing feedback. It should be OK for them to provide subject-matter opinions and feedback, but it\u2019s not OK to use their editor capabilities in order to block proposals from moving through the process. That is a conflict of interest and a corruption of the role and I believe should be grounds for removal if it becomes a repeated issue. Unfortunately, while that is ideal and the way it\u2019s handled in other standards organizations we\u2019re not there yet with the EIP process because we lack in contributions from others in the Ethereum community these days on many EIPs. This is either an indication that some things just aren\u2019t ready to be standardized or that the process has pushed people away from contributing. I believe it\u2019s actually a bit of both. For this reason, the lines can become very blurry when the editors are the only ones commenting and providing feedback on EIPs. In nearly all the cases I\u2019ve seen they\u2019re doing this out of best interest of the community and to help start the discussion with thoughtful feedback. I don\u2019t believe it always used to be editors guiding the discussions and being lead contributors in feedback though. For example, look at the liveliness of discussion that occurred around EIP-1098 with 25 different participants. Similarly there were some great discussions around EIP-1193 and I\u2019m sure there was plenty round EIP-712. This is all to say, I think that we\u2019re at a point where it\u2019s necessary for us to evaluate what\u2019s the right way to split up the work that editors take on. Not only to help reduce the time and effort they have to spend in volunteering, but also because this will help get more people involved and decentralize the power to create a more robust process. Proposal In my opinion we should be splitting out the responsibilities into 3 separate roles. A WG to manage the governance process (EIP-1) and maintain the bots, a role I\u2019m calling an \u201cArea Director\u201d which helps to establish whether a WG should be formed or a proposal should be tied into an already running WG, and a role which helps to manage a WG called a \u201cWG chair\u201d who\u2019s there to maintain the WG and make sure work items and proposals are moving towards completion. We\u2019d then also have EIP Authors which remain the people driving a proposal forward to completion. With these new roles, I\u2019d imagine the process for moving a proposal from draft to completion would look a bit like this.  Put forward a proposal to draw feedback and decide if it should be standards track or informational  preferably this step is actually done outside the EIP repository to increase the noise to signal ratio it\u2019s up to draft authors to gather enough attention to get a WG formed. This could be done via area directors helping to promote group on FEM or on twitter so they can determine if now is a good time to start the standards process for a particular item of work. Things can sit in \u201cidea\u201d stage form indefinitely. These are essentially like internet drafts in IETF   Once the area director has determined a WG should be formed (or assigned a piece of work to a WG) then the idea is converted to the \u201cdraft\u201d step and moved into a GH user (e-g EIP-Core or EIP-ERCs) focused on a particular area. It\u2019s at this point that the iterative design process begins by forming a repository for the proposal, filing issues, and updating the spec. There should probably be re-occurring discussions or at least some way to separate feedback to make sure that all of the concerns are being addressed. Once a draft is believed to be at a fairly stable state, it should enter a review period which should include a call for implementations and a test suite or reference implementation should be built ideally to make sure the spec is actually able to be implemented by multiple people and no interoperability concerns are left unaddressed. Finally, once the authors, WG chair, and area director believe the spec is at a state where we\u2019re close to consensus we can enter the \u201cfinal call\u201d period. At this point any last objections will be required to be lodged within a 2 week window and be addressed within a 4 week window from the point they\u2019re addressed. Once confirmed they\u2019d be finalized and moved into the official EIP repository. At that point only errata can be filed to modify it which would need to be done via the WG that moved it forward (or a maintenance WG for that).  ",

The primary role of the Editors would be to approve the actual merges into the repo.   Yes, this does seem to be the heart of the issue for a lot of the quality control side of things which editors have taken on because these rings never properly formed like originally envisioned. I think we\u2019ve kind of got some self emerging rings appearing, which is a good sign, but they\u2019ve just not quite appeared like originally intended. So it\u2019s not like we need to go back to the drawing board with this. Just need a bit of refinement about their purpose and what decisions they\u2019ve maintain within the process. For example, I think rings should be used to establish quorum and decide whether a draft EIP is ready to be standardized. If it deems it is, then the ring should establish a place to coordinate all the tasks that need to be completed to finish the standard. My preference is that we just setup a github repository for a EIP once it\u2019s been decided quorum is possible so that we can use the issue tracker to track all the updates. Once the participants who are actually moving the spec forward have decided the work is done, they can request broad review from the ring as a whole. This is when the EIP hits review period which signals to the broader ring that review objections should be raised and addressed otherwise the EIP will be proceed to final call. At the point of final call, the Ring proposes the EIP to the broader EIP community (via a PR to the main EIP repo) where one final consensus point is established for any final objections to be lodged. If none are (or they\u2019re not actionable) then the EIP is considered final. So the principle I\u2019m operating under here is we should move some of the hard power (e.g. decisions and enforcement to have a EIP proceed) that\u2019s being enforced by editors today and shift that power to rings. This serves two benefits. First it makes it so that editors have fewer responsibilities, and second it gives legitimate reason for people to participate and focus on the rings. This is only one piece of the puzzle though, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s time I write a longer blog post about how I see this potentially all fitting together so others can provide feedback and critiques.
