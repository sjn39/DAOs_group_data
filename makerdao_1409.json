Good news is it was us that put it there in collaboration with @immunefi-core-unit and the Security Stakeholder Initiative team. Please vote on the poll as quickly as you are able to! This is a drill, so please stay safe and don\u2019t go overboard rushing to submit your vote. The goal here is to see how much MKR we can get to vote on the drill in a 48 hour period to test our response time. Here is the poll link - https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQXTMw1#vote-breakdown - we\u2019ll be posting a report detailing this drill in the next two weeks. @Recognized-Delegates your participation will be noted in this drill but it will not affect metric scores or compensation. Whether you are a delegate or casual voter please consider voting here so we can see how much MKR would have been around to respond to an urgent event this weekend  . ",

Please vote in this poll to indicate you would have been able to assist the protocol in an urgent/emergency situation. Since you\u2019re already submitting a vote why not give us a little info. Please submit your vote for yes, no, or abstain to participate in this drill. Vote Yes if you believe these \u201cfire drills\u201d are a valuable use of resources. Vote No if you do not think these \u201cfire drills\u201d are not a valuable use of resources. Vote Abstain if you are not sure or do not wish to give an opinion on the value of these drills. This discussion thread will give you more information on the motivation behind this drill. A thread will be posted in response to this fire drill once this exercise has been noticed by the community.\" I believe these fire drills are useful for GSM exec protection,  but I also believe if any info on ES is to be gleaned in terms of response it has to come not from delegates but actual MKR holders.
