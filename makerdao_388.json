The European market is big but I don\u2019t think there is that level of control or imposition of the banks as in other countries, since there are very good banking products and better in many ways to a crypto stablecoin. The best way to create something like this would be a currency similar to Dai as you mention, perhaps algorithmic could be interesting. ",
