                    "content": " Executive Summary This thread will be used to discuss and vote on the ratification for Interim Facilitator(s) of Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001). This process is governed by MIP41c6: Interim Facilitators and the Fallback Decision Process and will be administered by @Patrick_J and myself. We, as Governance Facilitators, have opted for the following approach in the interest of transparency so that the community may monitor the ongoing vote. We have balanced this with the need to move swiftly so that the Interim Facilitators can get to work on continuing the CES-001 mandate.  Interim Nomination Process This is the first time this process is being utilized so let\u2019s start with our procedure:  Per MIP41c6, @monkey.irish has nominated two candidates for Interim Facilitator, @dbkcan and @zmtong. Later today, we will post two Yes/No polls gated to Core Unit Facilitators to vote anonymously on each candidate. They will be included in this thread. The community will be able to verify that only Core Unit Facilitators are able to vote in the poll, and to verify membership of the Core Unit Facilitator Forum Group. Core Unit Facilitators can be cross-referenced using MIP38c2  Since MIP41c6 requires a simple majority of active facilitators to approve an interim appointment. Therefore, either one or both of the candidates must receive 10 Yes votes for the interim nomination process to be a success. Considering @monkey.irish\u2019s voluntary off-boarding (and mitigated by needing 9 other facilitators to support at least one of his choices), he will be allowed to vote in this poll, but will be removed from the list of facilitators at the end of voting regardless of the outcome. We will run these polls for 24 hours, or until both candidates have at least 10 facilitators supporting a single, individual outcome. If neither candidate receives 10 Yes votes, we will start the Fallback Decision Process at the conclusion of the polls. To avoid unnecessary communications delay, we will report on our exact procedure for that process tomorrow.   Clarifications Because an Interim Facilitator needs 10 votes from Facilitators (including @monkey.irish there are 19 active Core Unit Facilitators) to proceed, it is very important that @Core-Facilitators are aware this vote is taking place. The MIP does not allow for proxy voting, so in an effort to increase participation will will be launching the vote after today\u2019s Mandated Actor call, so a majority of facilitators can be aware and respond to it, as well as allowing twenty-four hours for voting to take place. The Fallback-Decision Process is somewhat slow, so all voters and DAO participants should be aware that if neither candidate is ratified by the end of polling, CES will be left without a facilitator for at least an additional week. Community members may wish to talk about the process for interim facilitator selection (and would be encouraged to do so!) but be warned that would be most appropriate in a separate thread. Our intent as moderators is to keep this thread limited to questions about the procedure/its implications and the voting matter at hand, if @dbkcan and @zmtong should be supported as Interim Facilitators of CES-001.

I received feedback from that call and I\u2019d like to help clarify a few points. I was hoping to take the higher road and describe the overall situation and leave it at that. Since I don\u2019t think my message came across as intended, I\u2019ll be more specific now. If you haven\u2019t read the offboarding, please take the time to do that. My sole reason for leaving MakerDAO is the project has changed dramatically and it\u2019s no longer the place I came to work three years ago. I do not have any more value to offer so I departed. The concept of a DAO is great but in actual implementation, it\u2019s about one person driving a vision. I\u2019ve worked in centralized organizations my entire career and I can find that anywhere. I feel neutral and have no energy on the situation. If I was mad or \u201craging,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have spent the time to carefully put together a plan to ensure CES continuity. Before CES was ratified, I agreed to set up a legal entity (company) to represent the work CES would be doing. The company hired all the CES Contributors and each had a Contributor agreement. As Rune worked directly with Nikolaj, material breaches  occurred meaning, there was an attempt by people (Nikolaj & Miguel) inside my company reaching out to recruit coworkers (Henrique & Nazar) and form a new company or entity or whatever. I have a long history of hiring and managing teams and when something like this happens, I terminate everyone involved. With that termination, no severance is paid and all incentives are immediately revoked. It\u2019s straightforward and there isn\u2019t a lot of debate if a coup happens inside of my company. The remaining CES contributors agreed to help with an orderly shutdown of CES. Rune shared with me he was going to offboard CES so I took him at his word and filled out an offboarding MIP. Everything I have done was completed in a professional manner. All funds have been accounted for, tracked, and reported publicly since I started the CES core unit, GitHub - monkeyirish/ces-core-unit: Public repo for the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit.. Perceptions, thoughts, opinions, and conspiracies are generated when something like this happens. Agree with me, don\u2019t agree with me, it\u2019s your call. Vote YES or NO for the interim facilitators, it\u2019s also your call. What remains are the realities of the culture at MakerDAO. I simply choose not to be part of it anymore. ",

                    "content": "To assist facilitators in making the ratification decision, below I detail our plans to ensure an orderly and smooth off-boarding of the CES Core Unit and/or should governance approve a transition of the core unit into the role of ecosystem actor under the endgame plan. First and foremost, our main priority will be to minimize any disruption to the services provided by CES with respect to the current onboarding of collateral. In that regard, our key short-term priority will be to prepare spells for the upcoming executives to onboard gno and the blocktower transactions which need work completed in advance so that if approved they can be implemented in the December 7 executive. Our next priority will be completing technical implementations and assessments for deals that have been approved but that are still pending implementation details. This includes transactions such as MIP81 - coinbase institutional rewards whose exact implementation is still under discussion with Coinbase. In addition, there will likely be additional technical implementations, assessments and spells that will need to be prepared for transactions that are currently under governance poll. With respect to some immediate priorities - as most of our core units\u2019 infrastructure and services were provided by Clio Finance we would plan to reinstate these services (email, GitHub, alchemy, notion, google, etc). On the manpower front, none of the core unit contributors have contracts in place with the core unit - so we would plan to put contracts in place reflecting the previous arrangements that were in place with Clio (which will not include severance and or incentives where severance has already been paid). In addition, we have spoken to the devs on our team who were terminated with cause from Clio Finance and have indicated that as soon as we are ratified as interim facilitators we would like to enter into contracts to retain their services until the Core Unit is formally off-boarded or an alternative transition is approved by Maker Governance. In the event of the off-boarding of the core unit once it has been determined if/who will be assuming the responsibilities of CES\u2019s collateral onboarding mandate - we will ensure a smooth transition of all the data and files etc. required to execute the mandate. With respect to the budget, we have reviewed the amounts available in the operational wallet and believe that this will be more than adequate to fund our activities until a projected off-boarding that is currently projected for Jan/Feb 2023. Obviously, if Governance decides that instead of off-boarding the core unit - that the core units will execute under a different mandate and not be off boarded we would adjust the plan accordingly with the intent of ensuring a smooth and fair transition, whilst retaining the necessary staff to execute on that mandate and support the implementation requirements of the endgame plan as required. In terms of qualifications to execute these tasks, as a former banker, I led, built and managed teams in multiple roles. And as a hands-on engineer, I have played tech lead roles for teams at both Chainsafe and EY for blockchain protocol level and dapp projects. Mabel Tong, the proposed co-facilitator, is a certified Professional Project Manager, Scrum Master, and has over 20 years of experience in Project & Program Management.  She has facilitated the collateral onboarding process and hosted the weekly Collateral Status Index (CSI) updates since joining MakerDAO in May of 2022. ",

Not an oversight, as stated here:     prose11:  Considering @monkey.irish\u2019s voluntary off-boarding (and mitigated by needing 9 other facilitators to support at least one of his choices), he will be allowed to vote in this poll, but will be removed from the list of facilitators at the end of voting regardless of the outcome.   The way the numbers breakdown it allows him to be a tie-breaker if half of the active facilitators support the nomination. Given the undefined nature of the MIP we felt this was the most fair way to proceed. ",

I would have hoped we learned from the RWF unwinding,  a situation that you were quite vocal about.     monkey.irish:  Given my resignation as a facilitator, I am also no longer a mandated actor and therefore did not attend the meeting today.    Given your trajectory in the project, I would have hoped that you understood the importance of communicating your actions to the other mandated actors, who now have to decide on a transition with little to no information. As stated by @prose11, you are still considered a mandated actor who is able to vote in this poll.  There were several last-minute transactions on the Operational wallet, including MKR transfers. We are now left parsing those transactions wondering if there was any misappropriation of funds.  You took yourself out of the Operational wallet control and gave it to @dbkcan and @zmtong before any vote could occur.     monkey.irish:  If I was mad or \u201craging,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have spent the time to carefully put together a plan to ensure CES continuity.    For anyone outside of your immediate team it looks like a rage-quit. I would have hoped you would join the meeting and explain your actions and the plan for continuity. Ideally, you would even have told us before taking those actions to ensure a smooth transition.     monkey.irish:  The company hired all the CES Contributors and each had a Contributor agreement. As Rune worked directly with Nikolaj, material breaches occurred   While these matters might be happening within your legal entity, Clio Finance is part of a much wider organization, Rune and Nikolaj are part of that organization.     monkey.irish:  Rune shared with me he was going to offboard CES       monkey.irish:  there was an attempt by people (Nikolaj & Miguel) inside my company reaching out to recruit coworkers (Henrique & Nazar) and form a new company or entity or whatever.   Based on the above two quotes and the lack of information that you have provided on the situation, I can only speculate and find myself thinking that these firings are inappropriate:  You knew that CES would no longer be continued There were plans to create a  new team with some members of your current team to do work in the future (supposedly not disrupting the current operations of CES).   Instead of overseeing the wind-down of CES and allowing Nikolaj, Miguel, Henrique and Nazar to transition to their new team you instead decided to fire them, relinquish their MKR vest and instead assign it to you as \u201caccelerated vesting\u201d.  How can we expect the community to trust mandated actors if this is how we act? ",
