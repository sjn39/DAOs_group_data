I\u2019ve had this challenge myself in promoting EthMagicians issues. This seems like a good way to promote how to get started, especially for non-code tasks. Also, diving into Product Hunt again inspired me to put more time into that community to surface Ethereum related projects and services \u2014 and makers! I\u2019m going to mention this to Eth Cat Herders too, as they are the source of a lot of issues that are non-code. Also this definitely is for developers, too! I want to see us onboard more open source contributors. ",
