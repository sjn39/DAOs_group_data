                    "content": "Thank you to everyone who had the opportunity to join the Strategy Process Review call last month. The next step in moving this initiative forward will be to vote as a community on the 3 - 5 most important Strategic Focus Areas.  As most are aware, the business model of MakerDAO is an overcollateralized stablecoin lending platform. Generally speaking, the more Dai that is minted the more stability fees can be earned by the protocol. The protocol is only limited by the amount of assets that are on-chain which I expect to increase tremendously over the coming years as the crypto markets continues to grow and traditional financial assets are moved on-chain. As discussed on the call, we believe the strategic focus areas are:  Grow market share of ETH and WBTC lending Scale Real World Asset Collateral Increase demand for Dai a. Expand our presence on Level 2s  To reiterate why we believe these are critical to MakerDAO\u2019s success, let\u2019s briefly revisit the valuation framework we posted last Spring as well as Messari\u2019s valuation of MKR. Under the current tokenomics, the value of MKR is primarily driven by long term free cash flow. With current operating expenses quite low relative to traditional startups, most of our revenue converts to cash flow and either increasing the surplus buffer or burning MKR. Today, over 97% of the protocol\u2019s revenue is generated from Ethereum and BTC vaults and derivatives. @Primoz summed it up quite nicely in Nik\u2019s recent thread regarding offboarding unprofitable collateral types,  saying that the issue with other vanilla ERC20 tokens is that:   Either they are very illiquid on-chain and we cannot offer high debt ceilings or They are liquid but they are newer and carry higher risks due to having not gone through a stress test (e.g. OHM) Maker doesn\u2019t offer cross-collateralization which hurts users since they have to maintain every single vault type   Additionally, Oracle expenses are much higher than most of us expected and will likely continue to trend higher in both Dai and ETH terms until more level 2 infrastructure is build out and sharding is implemented. Therefore when it comes to crypto-native collateral, MKR should focus on:   ETH and WBTC derivatives (different LR, fixed rates, stETH type of products, etc.) LPs (again mostly ETH and WBTC based) D3M type of modules   As the crypto market grows, we should continue seeing an increase in Dai denominated lending. That itself will not be indicative of success assuming continued price momentum in ETH. When it comes to Real World Assets - I strongly believe this avenue is our best chance to scale MKR to a $Trillion+ behemoth and enable us make an impact when it comes to financing sustainable and renewable energies and averting the climate crisis. The total addressable market (TAM) for RWAs is in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. Credit alone is estimated at a $124 Trillion market compared to a minuscule $2.8 Trillion for crypto today. As more and more financial assets make their way on-chain, we need to continue building expertise and position ourselves to be the go-to lending platform for those looking for liquidity. As the backbone of the DeFi stack - keeping Dai safe should be priority number one. Increasing demand and the utility of Dai will drive the supply of Dai up and the better Dai is as a product, the higher our chances of success. If you believe there is another area we should focus on that\u2019s on par with the aforementioned  metrics, please comment in this thread and provide your reasoning.     ETH & WBTC Market Share Real World Asset Collateral Growth Dai Market Share Other     0 voters     To briefly reiterate why we believe these recurring Strategic Reviews are valuable:  Gives the community an opportunity to take a step back from day to day operations and assess how CU\u2019s are executing the mission and agreed upon strategy Understand what issues or obstacles the DAO needs to address Discuss new opportunities that have arisen that the DAO may want to pursue Decide if adjustments are needed to our plan Optimize capital allocation by providing more capital to high performing CU\u2019s  These meetings will also present us with an opportunity to talk about the achievements we\u2019ve made, what\u2019s going well, and new innovations in the industry and how to take advantage of them. We will have a standardized format to review what CU\u2019s have delivered and analyze critical data points driving the health of the MakerDAO ecosystem. Once the community is aligned on the primary strategic focus areas, we will post another poll to align on the top ten KPIs that support them. Link to the deck presented last month. ",

                    "content": "The most shared goal of MakerDAO is to increase MKR value. If we assume the markets are somewhat efficient over long term that means accruing capital per MKR token. Accruing capital is not really actionable by itself so you need to break this objective into subgoals. Hence the goals from @aes. All are measurable in real-time and accrue value to MKR token in a straightforward way. They should probably be divided again in subgoals that are easy to track and more actionable (increasing demand for DAI is quite broad). Notice also that the choice of metrics in strategic objectives is quite important. It\u2019s market share of ETH lending, not DAI issues from ETH lending (there is a strong correlation with ETH price, so this isn\u2019t super relevant). For DAI, it\u2019s again a market share (in market cap and transaction volume). We have spent hours discussing the Wintermute proposal to add liquidity on who knows where (and mainly discussing MKR liquidity). I didn\u2019t see much discussion about how we lost the first battle of stablecoin supply on Arbitrum (neither on how we won the Optimism one).  image1575\u00d7888 98.5 KB  This is the key of strategic reviews, to focus on what community decide matters and avoid discussing the last random topic. The list should be short otherwise it\u2019s not a strategy but a wishlist. I think 3 is more than enough (with maybe up to 3 subgoals for each), but we can maybe go to 5 (Oracles would be easy to track, governance health is less linked to accruing capital but somewhat makes sense). It\u2019s not that the rest doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s just that bandwidth of governance is limited. List of stuff that are not included but could:  cost control. Less useless expenses more capital accrued to MKR holders. tokenomics. I don\u2019t have much interest in that but I do recognize that there can be some reflexivity (having a higher artificial MKR price can indirectly accrue value to MKR holders, for instance with token-based M&A). It seems to be 80% of the governance bandwidth of some other protocols. term lending/yield curve products increasing the number of collaterals climate change cost/benefit (in term of CO2 footprint?)  Again having only 3 slots makes us decide. PS: Maybe this strategy review should be limited to what impacts the P&L and balance sheet? I\u2019m not sure a \u201cfinance\u201d CU is the best to facilitate non-financials discussions. ",

I agree these metrics are important, but feel that they would be more appropriately discussed in a separate call focused on Operations (which I have plans for following the roll-out of the recurring strategy reviews). Good goals should follow the SMART guidelines and be:   Specific  Measurable  Achievable  Relevant  Time bound  The Strategic Focus Areas I\u2019ve listed out meet all of these criteria and as @SebVentures mentioned, can all be measured in real-time, today, leveraging the blockchain. While Security, Governance Effectiveness, and Community Health are all important metrics, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re at a point where we are sophisticated enough to be able to quantify those without a very high degree of subjectivity. Could they be measured in the future? Absolutely, but there are more qualified individuals that can create and assess those metrics.     wouter:  Unrelated point is that if @Oracles-Core-Unit \u2019s ambitions are to be fulfilled, I believe we should add oracles as a separate business line?   The metrics we listed are not set in stone - if Oracles as a Business (OaaB) starts earning revenue and growing we could certainly add it as a strategic focus area.
