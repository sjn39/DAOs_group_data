                    "content": "Hi all. I have a question regarding the offboarded USDC A vault type, mostly out of curiosity. The DAI supply from this vault type currently is 238.2m while the total value of locked USDC collateral is only 238.8m. The vault type currently has a stability fee of 1% and the largest vault is well below the liquidation ratio of 101%, but still not liquidated. Is liquidation not turned on for this vault type? And if not, what will happen if this vault gets undercollateralized due to the stability fee? Will stability fees still be accrued to the surplus buffer, even though the DAI is minted from an undercollateralized vault where the vault holder no longer has an incentive to repay the debt? ",

And if not, what will happen if this vault gets undercollateralized due to the stability fee?   Liquidation is not turned on. Nothing happens really.     Future_of_Finance:  Will stability fees still be accrued to the surplus buffer, even though the DAI is minted from an undercollateralized vault where the vault holder no longer has an incentive to repay the debt?   Yes. When we get around to liquidating these and moving the debt to the PSMs this will come out of the surplus buffer again.  It\u2019s not really an ideal situation, but it is mostly harmless. Ideally we\u2019ll deal with it sometime early next year though. ",

It\u2019s just that it\u2019s a low-moderate amount of technical work, and PE basically always has more impactful things to be doing. I believe the current plan is to liquidate them into the appropriate PSMs. Maybe @Derek can comment. ",
