For a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, please see the updated Operating Manual.  Context Voting Cycle 6 is officially underway! Provided your proposal has received explicit approval comments from two delegates with >0.5% voting power, as outlined in the Operating Manual, please use the below format to list your proposal in a reply to this post.   Proposal A: [NAME]  Proposal: [LINK] Delegate Approval 1: [LINK] Delegate Approval 2: [LINK]    Proposals will be included in the Snapshot vote only if they (a) have explicit delegate approval and (b) are added to this Voting Cycle Roundup thread. Please remember that all grant recipients will need to provide KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant. Proposals that have not agreed to this by checking \u201cYes\u201d to the related field in the grant proposal template, will not be included in the Voting Roundup. ",

A snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the Voting Cycle. For a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating Manual.  Context Voting Cycle #2 begins the process of voting for Phase 1 of the Governance Fund. This begins the more open-ended side of the Governance Fund, where allocations are no longer restricted to existing Optimism Projects. A few notes on the process as we enter Phase 1:  Votes will not be batched and each proposal should be individually considered based on its own strengths and weaknesses. As stated in the OPerating Manual, it is the recommendation of the Optimism Foundation that at least one delegate (with >0.0005% of voting power) signals their belief that the proposal is ready for a vote before passing.  The Optimism Foundation has made its best effort to enumerate which proposals have received such supporting signal. The order for this cycle prioritizes those proposals to the start of the list, both in this post and on Snapshot. However, in our spirit of governance minimization, all proposals marked READY by authors are up for consideration and votable. As such, the recommendation of the OPerating Manual can be overridden if delegates so choose.   As a reminder, the purpose of the Governance Fund is meant to spur sustainable growth and activity on the Optimism network. More information can be found in the Governance Fund Phase 1 template.  The Optimism Foundation notes that there is a significant allocation OP tokens for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF), as detailed in the Allocations Documentation, which is distinct from Phase 1. As above, in the spirit of governance minimization, the Optimism Foundation has not performed any filtering based on whether or not a proposal accomplishes this goal. The Token House could override the above intention and pass any of the votable proposals. As a reminder, this would not be decremented from the RPGF allocation, and instead be removed from the ~230M OP Governance Fund.     Proposals Aside from the approval/non-approval delineation, proposals are listed in order of first appearance on this forum.

Consequently, there are projects we like but didn\u2019t vote for this time, and we look forward to slightly adjusted proposals in the next Phases. ",

This time there was lot of confusion.   Would be great if delegate(s) took some of their time and provide feedback before the proposal goes to voting, I have see that many project(s) are quite active on their proposal, seeking feedback and willing to update and amend their proposal depending the feedback from users/delegates. What\u2019s the point of giving suggestion when proposal is live, the project team cant amend the suggestion even if they want to, jumping it at the last moment is not helping anyone.   There should be at least 24hr cool down period before bringing proposals to voting, during this time the responsibility will be on project team to make sure that their proposal is adhering to all the requirement and is ready for voting, if they miss to do so, they will be accountable rather than OP Team or delegates.   This one is for me but would like to mention, delegate should be precise in their word when providing their support to a proposal.   We need some active participation from OP team on discord gov channel, during Phase 1, I had few queries related to couple of proposal, I did post them on discord gov general channel but did not got any response from team. Again, as a delegate, its my responsibility to make a judgement call but little help here and there could help me make a better decision.   If project submitting a proposal is not willing to submit a report on their last phase spending sighting extra and unnecessary work, I expect that OP Team should provide us with such a report. This is again just for me, I am not asking other do the same or suggesting on making this a rule but I am willing to invest my time looking at those report so that a. I can make better decision on the basis of those report. b. I would like to make sure that funds are being used properly ie. accountability.   This is to the team submitting the proposal focusing on LP and airdrop, on \u201cwhy the users will stay once incentives are over\u201d; these two are my favorite line a. users will come for incentive and stay for the product b. we believe our project has this and this to offer and users will stay because of this I request you to understand this, those using L2 as their main chain to do their transaction, we dont need someone to tell us about a unique and innovative project, its vice versa, we are looking for them. If I am using a platform just because of an incentive, I will use it as long as incentive exist but on the other hand I will continue to use if the platform is self-sustainable and rewarding me for using it, OP incentive are just a boost, if you need an extra incentive to sustain your project, you need to re-think your stagey. Again, my opinion, highly dependent on individual.   See you all in Phase 2. Cheers! ",

Money would be spent on liquidity mining, marketing (??) and developer ecosystem with no oversight Proposal C: GYSR - NO  $200k requested, no links to previous work. 25% of it be spent of maintenance of already deployed system. Rest will go to \u201cincentives\u201d in different parts of the protocol. Proposal D: Mean Finance - NO  $150k requested. 45% of it will go to cover fees from the users (so\u2026 will go straight to the protocol\u2019s revenue??), 20% will go for \u201cgrowth\u201d. Project more likely to be a startup rather than a public good Proposal E: Raptor - NO  $400k requested. This one is actually interesting! I wanted to vote yes, but there is no way of providing an oversight over this system and OP could do the very same thing and just setup eth2 validators without funding raptor Proposal F: Balancer & BeethovenX - NO  $250k requested. 100% will go to some very complicated ponzinomics related to liquidity mining. I\u2019m not a fan of increased speculative \u201cadoption\u201d \u2014 my OP mandate is to fund social & identity public goods Proposal G: Summa - NO  $1m requested, for\u2026 an accounting service? Also no previous work done. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here Proposal H: WardenSwap - NO  $150k requested. 20% goes to \u201ctraders\u201d and 45% for different growth strategies. The project is a DEX aggregator that ~probably~ charges fees. Not a public good Proposal I: Pickle Finance - NO  $100k requested. 100% goes to liquidity rewards in vaults that currently have $115k TVL on optimism. This proposal is just asking to put OP tokens into pockets of pickle users? Proposal J: Ooki Protocol - NO  $350k requested. It\u2019s a trading / speculative product, it is also probably not a public good. Proposal K: Infinity Wallet - NO  $500k requested. 15% will be spent on an airdrop , rest very vague. No oversight & it\u2019s probably also not a public good Proposal L: Beefy - NO  $325k requested. 90% for boosting yield in their products. Not a public good Proposal M: 0xHabitat - NO  $200k requested. The app hasn\u2019t been deployed yet, i don\u2019t really know how will benefit from it and how. 90% to be vaguely spent on \u201cincentives\u201d and \u201cdeveloper grants\u201d. Proposal N: Thales - NO  $1m requested. Everything will be spent on trading incentives and competitions. Not a public good Proposal O: ParaSwap - NO  $225k requested. ParaSwap is a company that charges everybody on swaps. 50% of the funding will go into growing their ecosystem and integrating their FOR PROFIT system into more apps. Proposal P: Rotki - YES  $95k requested. My only \u201cyes\u201d and I am beyond happy to see here at least one true OSS, public good project. @LefterisJP is a developer with a long & great reputation, the budget breakdown is excellent and rotki is stellar example of a project built with a decentralization, privacy and resilience in mind. Portfolio management is also outside of my OP mandate (social & web3 identity public goods) but im giving rotki a pass since it\u2019s clearly the best project in the round Proposal Q: Candide - NO  $95k requested. I respect the proposal and the author & believe it has a good potential \u2014 however, as for today, it\u2019s essentially a vc investment without a clear benefit for the community or public goods. General feedback:  I am new to governing over funds on this scale, but why is it a norm that we are just sending $100k-$1m based on a forum post & send that to a private address without any oversight? I feel like i could write a very well sounding anon proposal and just get a life-changing money from Optimism Collective without delivering any value. I only hold a small share of voting power (0.29%) and my NOs don\u2019t mean much, but it looks like this round will fund many projects that can rug and run with the money any time. Most of the applying projects are not public goods. At best some of them are legit crypto startups, at worst they are plain cash grabs without anything built yet. Proposals lack links to projects and author\u2019s reputation. With 17 proposals it\u2019s hard to read (sometimes very convoluted) descriptions and pitches. Proposal authors should be encouraged to leave more links. My voting mandate is to support decentralized identity & web3 social projects. I\u2019m more than happy to work & help polish proposals for them in next rounds, but I haven\u2019t seen any so far.

A snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the Voting Cycle. For a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating Manual.  Context Voting Cycle #1 only includes proposals from Phase 0 of the Optimism Foundation\u2019s Governance Fund. You can think of this as a sort of test run for future open-ended voting cycles. Phase 0 of the Governance Fund is designed to:  Kick off OP Summer by rewarding early projects in the OP ecosystem Allocate OP fairly based on a simple set of on-chain metrics Avoid setting a binding precedent for future funding proposals by being an isolated phase Immediately deploy 36m OP tokens  To accomplish these goals, Optimism worked with projects to craft a set of guidelines for Phase 0 proposals. These guidelines are as follows:  Proposals must be submitted to the governance forum on or before May 27, 2022 Projects could not request more tokens than they were eligible for in the Phase 0 allocation. No more than ~20% of a project\u2019s allocation should be distributed as retroactive rewards. No more than ~20% (or ~200k) of a project\u2019s allocation should used for grant programs. Token allocations should not be used for internal development or operations costs. Rewards should be distributed as OP (i.e. no token sales or swaps).  Phase 0 proposals that follow the guidelines above have been bundled in to a batch vote. These proposals have been drafted in cooperation with the Optimism Foundation, and the Token House will vote on the batch as a whole. Phase 0 proposals that did not follow the guidelines above will be voted on individually. We leave these up to the Token House to evaluate on their own merits. Those separate proposals are:  Uniswap submitted a proposal after the May 27 deadline, so this proposal will be voted on individually. 0x has chosen to allocate 100% towards grants. We\u2019re big fans of public goods funding, but since this does not fit the batch guidelines for phase 0, the proposal will be voted on individually.  In light of recent events, no tokens distributed via governance will be sent without a two-way test transaction.

I don\u2019t like rubber-stamping anything. Governance is not just logging in snapshot and signing a YES or NO message. In fact I find it insulting and I will reject the proposal outright for that. Yes some projects in there do make sense and would really benefit OP ecosystem such as HOP, connext and aave, but you are asking us to vote for 24 different projects all in one proposal, yes or no. In fact I am absolutely amazed this is passing governance.  Proposal B I will vote to reject this proposal from uniswap, since it has missed the phase 0 deadline. I would be open to reconsidering a phase 1 proposal from uniswap since I truly think it would be useful and am a fan of the project. But rules are rules and we should be credibly neutral and fair.  Proposal C Just like with uniswap\u2019s proposal I will vote to reject this proposal since it has missed the deadline and we should not bend the rules for anybody. I am also not 100% certain if the proposal would end up benefiting the OP ecosystem sufficiently, but this is mostly an after-thought compared to the deadline being missed. ",

I would have preferred to see these proposals broken out individually instead of a batch vote as I\u2019m in support of some proposals way more than others. However, since there are many that would be beneficial to Optimism and I have confidence in the Optimism Foundation working with the teams to iterate the proposals so they were beneficial to the ecosystem, I\u2019m comfortable voting on it. It also sounds like future cycles won\u2019t have these batched which is great to hear. Proposal B: Voting For. While Uniswap missed the deadline, they have been and are an important partner for Optimism so I\u2019m comfortable with an exception on this in the interest of furthering the Optimism ecosystem. Proposal C: Abstaining from this vote due to a potential conflict since my husband is the co-founder of 0x. ",

A- It\u2019s ridiculous to expect token house governance to make an educated decision on token allocation by batching 20+ GovFund candidates together. Optimism Foundation is basically asking us to \u201capprove\u201d their decisions, instead of allowing us to vote individually on each one. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t ecosystem funding supposed to be covered by the citizen house? Proposal A should either bring each GovFund to individual vote, or should be the responsibility of citizen house to approve. We are not comfortable voting only to approve OP foundations decision, rather than being able to make our own. It sets bad precedence and diminishes the role of token house. We are strongly against B- Like @lefterisjp we are unsure why Uniswap is being given special treatment despite missing the deadline. Obviously Optimism foundation is giving them favor - again another point where our governance decisions are being guided by the foundation. We will be voting No but will likely be approving them for the next batch C- 0x is being voted on how we believe is fit. We are confident in supplying them with a YES vote. And look forward to the grants they will be funding. We hope not to be harsh on individual grant applications and apply undue scrutiny. But we strongly believe Proposal A and B dismiss the role of governance - a trend we must stop before it becomes normal. Remember in this space things trend towards centralized decision making, and it\u2019s up to us to push against that wherever possible. We would be happy to approve these grants, but not in this way.

                    "content": "I am intending to vote Yes for all 3 Proposals. Uniswap didn\u2019t meet the deadline and 0x didn\u2019t fit the specified criteria, but both proposals seem like they will be beneficial to the ecosystem so I think flexibility with rules is sensible in this first round. I\u2019m not completely happy with all of the ones included in the big batch and would have voted No for a couple had they been separated out, as I don\u2019t think they are designed to be maximally beneficial to the Optimism ecosystem. Due to them being included with other great proposals I will have to vote yes on A as a whole. A short breakdown of my views on the batched group follows:  Perfect Proposals - Would vote yes without reservations:   Synthetix   Perpetual Protocol   Lyra Finance   Celer Network   Hop Protocol   Chainlink   Rubicon   Thales   Pika Protocol   Connext   Layer2DAO   Gelato   AAVE    Okay Proposals - Would probably vote yes, but hesitantly:   Stargate Finance (assuming that \u2018Qualified Partners who integrate Stargate widget\u2019 will be builders on Optimism)   Synapse Protocol (large chunk of incentives to SYN holders seems a little self-serving, but this was addressed somewhat in the comments)   Zipswap (Proposal is fine but they are deployed on Arbitrum as well as Optimism so not sure why they got the 3x multiplier)   Aelin Protocol (Would just like clarity on the Aelin Council if they are to have veto over OP incentives to liquidity pools)   Polynomial Protocol (20% retroactive distribution which will probably have less effect on encouraging future users than the other segments, basically fine though)   Clipper (Unsure about the method of requiring Discord verification and the Optimism pools were closed at the time of checking, also the project\u2019s community engaged in a ridiculous brigading of the governance forum\u2026 however the team attempted to stop this and on reflection it probably demonstrates that they are already attracting \u2018new\u2019/inexperienced users to their platform)   Slingshot (No response was given to a query regarding avoiding sybil attacks on the referral link based rewards)   WePiggy (20% retroactive distribution which will probably have less effect on encouraging future users than the other segments, basically fine though)    Disappointing Proposals - Would vote no if not part of the batch:   Kwenta Protocol (66% is targeted specifically at 1,000 previous users of dYdX, if they were to get an even distribution they would end up with 600 each, purely because they didn\u2019t claim their dYdX tokens? Kwenta is a key part of Optimism\u2019s synthetix ecosystem but I don\u2019t think this proposal is reflects this.)   1Inch (one of the requirements for Phase 0 was \u201cToken allocations should not be used for internal development or operations costs\u201d it would have seemed important that they clarify what is meant by \u201c1inch Network plans to accelerate the development of Optimism native features and expand R&D for L2\u201d. This question was raised 2 weeks ago but the 1Inch team never responded)    I will not vote until tomorrow, to give time for any strong objections to my reasoning to be offered. ",

Most users are unlikely to read all 24 proposals and thus can\u2019t make an informed opinion. It would make sense to approve each individual proposal as each proposal is unique. Proposal B Vote: No Deadlines are deadlines. Even though uniswap is an important partner, there are rules to follow and it is important that there are no exceptions to this rule. We are open to approving their application for their next cycle but it is unfair to give them special treatment. An individual vote also makes it more likely to be passed so this might encourage other protocols in the future to purposely miss a deadline since uniswap got this treatment. Proposal C Vote: Yes We believe grants are a great way to help the community. ",

Voting on grant proposals should use quadratic points like we did in the first RPGF round, and delegates will sign a single message with the points distribution.  For other types of proposals (non-grants) we should vote on each one separately by signing an array of Yes/No/Abstain votes for all the proposals. I might vote For the current proposal because we didn\u2019t discuss this beforehand, but in the future I\u2019m going to vote Against any rubber-stamp batch proposals. ",

In addition, we would have liked to see some more transparency around the batch sums / numbers to help inform the macro decision. Proposal B Vote: No We considered being lenient with deadlines here because it is the first round, but considering we were voting no on Proposal A which included several legitimate projects that did follow the rules for submission, it does not seem fair to give Uniswap special treatment here.

This will be the last voting cycle for Season 1 of OP Governance. For more info, read Governance Update #2 here. Voting will take place in Snapshot. A snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the Voting Cycle. For a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating Manual.  Context Voting Cycle 4 is officially underway, and includes 6 proposals for voting.  There are just a few notes that the Optimism Foundation would like to highlight going into this cycle:  This will be the last voting cycle for Season 1 of OP Governance, and a 3-week break will commence after this cycle. For more info, read Governance Update #2 here. As stated in the OPerating Manual, it is the recommendation of the Optimism Foundation that at least one delegate (with >0.0005% of voting power) signals their belief that the proposal is ready for a vote before passing. As in the previous cycle, proposals which have not received explicit approval by a delegate are still included. But, as a reminder\u2014such proposals have not correctly followed the rules laid out in the OPerating Manual, and this behavior should be considered by delegates in voting**   Proposals Aside from the approval/non-approval delineation, proposals are listed in order of first appearance on this forum.

I\u2019ve had enough interactions with them to see the quality and expertise they bring to the table. They\u2019ll be a huge value add for Optimism and Balancer/BeethovenX will work closely with them to bring some really cool stuff to life. Proposal D: xToken - voted yes. Overall I think the proposal is reasonable and the tech is solid. Getting it into the hands of users on Optimism should lead to good things. Proposal C: dHedge - voted yes. They\u2019ve seen some initial usage already on Optimism and they have a good reputation from my experience. Should be a value add for the ecosystem. Proposal B: Boardroom - voted yes. Tooling around governance is a great thing, especially since governance is so important for Optimism. Looking forward to what these people do in the future. Proposal A: Rocket Pool - voted yes. I view liquid staked ETH on L2\u2019s to be one of the easiest ways we can onboard tons of users and TVL. Balancer/BeethovenX will be working with the rocket pool team to support their rollout on Optimism. ",

The proposal, as it stands now, is basically using the value of the granted OP tokens directly to juice the price of dHEDGE\u2019s native token. In my opinion, this is a terrible use of these funds. I outline the logic of how this is happening in the video linked above (link with timestamp). This is nothing against dHEDGE as a platform, I recommend that they re-submit a proposal that focuses less on incentivizing their native staking of their own token, and more on incentivizing overall platform usage.

In these cases, as well as those you mentioned in previous cycles, the proposals which were included later did meet the written criteria, with the authors having marked [READY] before the deadline, etc.  The problem is that they were missed in the initial roundup threads/snapshot generation, an oversight by the Foundation, not the authors. In these instances where authors did follow the rules, but the Foundation failed to initially include, we\u2019ve elected to include them late, with the same cutoff date as others, as opposed to pushing them to the next cycle. Hopefully that makes sense and seems justifiable to you. It\u2019s definitely not ideal, and Season 2 should include a more rigorous (or potentially automated) path forward so this doesn\u2019t happen again. ",

We have used boardroom multiple times and find it to be a great tool. C: dHedge - No We do not agree with artificially raising the value of DHT in this manner. D: xToken - Yes We will support this. Since it is being split across 3 different projects, it is essentially 300k each. Not too hard to digest. E: Byte Mason Product Suite - Yes Co-incentives are matched, last a good time, and have a good track record. F: GARD - No Far too large, not launched on optimism. G: Beefy - Yes It is live now, and they have gained a large amount of TVL. Overall, the proposal looks strong, and we will support it. H: BarnBridge - No I: QiDAO - Yes We appreciate that they changed their proposal based on feedback. They matched with x1.7 incentives, allow OP as collateral, and have been live for a while. ",

I\u2019m not sure what the incentive match process is currently (I\u2019ll do some research when I find time), but I think it would be prudent to have a sound framework around the incentive match mechanics so that neither proposers or delegates feel slighted. Delegate for or against votes are cast based on the express match promise from proposers, I think this should be as unambiguous as possible prior to funding $OP tokens.

Competition is good   Incentivizing rETH will eventually lead to enough liquidity on OP to use as collateral. Additionally OP could become the place to be for taking out rETH loans as liquidity begets liquidity   B: Boardroom - Yes  Love this as we need a one-stop shop to learn about OP delegates then actually be able to delegate in the same place.  C: dHedge - No  Hmmm don\u2019t like that users have to purchase DHT tokens either  D: xToken & Gamma - Yes  Excellent synergy between all three protocols  E: Byte Mason - No  Product was not even live  F: GARD - No  Thats a lot of tokens requested. I think this can be done more efficiently  G: Beefy - Yes  I have a high level of confidence that the liquidity brought into Beefy will stay there long term. 70% of TVL has up to this point  H: BarnBridge - No  Too mucgh $OP requested  I: QiDAO - Yes  Large existing user base from other chains. This will introduce many users to OP ecosystem who otherwise may not have checked us out  ",

A snapshot of delegate voting weights will be taken at the start of the Voting Cycle. For a detailed breakdown of the governance and voting process, see the Operating Manual.  Context Voting Cycle 3 is officially underway, and includes 9 proposals for voting. Hopefully this will relieve some pressure which delegates faced in the rather large Cycle 2.  There are just a few notes that the Optimism Foundation would like to highlight going into this cycle:  As stated in the OPerating Manual, it is the recommendation of the Optimism Foundation that at least one delegate (with >0.0005% of voting power) signals their belief that the proposal is ready for a vote before passing. As in the previous cycle, proposals which have not received explicit approval by a delegate are still included. But, as a reminder\u2014such proposals have not correctly followed the rules laid out in the OPerating Manual, and such behavior should be considered by delegates in voting.  One proposal whose vote did not pass in Cycle 2 has been marked as ready for Cycle 3. This highlights an edge case which was not previously considered in the OPerating manual. The Optimism Foundation will make an updated release for the next cycle, but until then, this proposal has been re-included. A bug was fixed in Snapshot for this cycle, so that Optimism-native contracts which have been delegated can now make votes.   Proposals Aside from the approval/non-approval delineation, proposals are listed in order of first appearance on this forum.  Proposals with Explicit Delegate Approval   Proposal A: Superfluid  Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314  Approval: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314/24     Proposal B: Kromatika  Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650  Approval: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/21     Proposal C: Hundred Finance  Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733  Approval: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733/10     Proposal D: Biconomy  Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880  Approval: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880/6     Proposal E: Dope Wars  Proposal: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722  Approval: https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/52     Proposal F: Infinity Wallet  Note: this proposal was included in Voting Cycle 2 and did not pass. However, the authors (who have enough delegation to self-approve) have marked it to be included in the next cycle. This is an edge case that the Optimism Foundation had not previously considered, and the OPerating Manual will be updated to consider such edge cases going forward. For now, the proposal is re-included.

I would like to see at least a minimum of a 2 week break between rounds, currently it gives no breather to review or provide feedback to draft proposals, most delegates will be focusing on the active voting round proposals. Another thing I would like to point out, there are some delegates that are purposely voting NO for their competitors or friends competitors, I think there needs to be a mandate in place to prevent this. I find it very disrespectful to the projects and highly unprofessional from these delegates! These individuals are working against the Optimism mission and in the previous round some had their own proposals, this behaviour actually swayed a couple of proposals from majority yes to majority no which was unfair on those proposal. Also after reviewing 17 projects from the last round and reading the comments from delegates I have noticed some are basing their decisions off of presuming without asking the proposal team questions and some are actually commenting false statements on proposals. I have seen a couple of projects defunct the information in some comments, yet some delegates ignore it for what reason I have no clue! There needs to be a committee in place to enforce rules to ensure delegates are kept to standards so we don\u2019t see more of this behaviour. As also suggested on this proposal and some examples of the issues mentioned above [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet - #70 by fewol, there are other proposals with the same issue. The other issue is that there are far to many projects applying and its only going to grow, leading to even more of these issues, projects need to be short listed. ",

There needs to be a committee in place to enforce rules to ensure delegates are kept to standards so we don\u2019t see more of this behaviour  My fren, if this is has to work, OP vision of governance with its two pillar(token house and citizen house) in a truly decentralized way, we dont need rule, you are the rule. Committee after committee will not work, can you say with 100% confidence that the committee will be true to its vision. We can work this out with active participation and positive criticism. Reach out to the team, by helping them you are helping us all. ",

N-for-1 deal. B: Kromatika: Against \u2013 The influencer marketing campaign is interesting but its allocation is far too high in my opinion. I see Phase 1 funding being better allocated to fund R&D and usage from L1/L2s to Optimism vs being used for a specific project\u2019s marketing budget. C: Hundred Finance: For \u2013 Performance targets are clear (and great to see featured), proposal is straight forward. D: Biconomy: For \u2013 Great team and product which matters a lot. Proposal is relatively straight forward and great to see it be so builder focused. E: Dope Wars: Against \u2013 Simply put the amount of requested tokens is too high for the lack of available clarity in the proposal for outcomes, timelines, and performance. I don\u2019t see a requirement for this proposal to require so much upfront funding to be successful. F: Infinity Wallet: Against \u2013 Wallets are better when built together. I\u2019m a big fan of the model that Tally has taken towards a community-built wallet and a closed-source wallet seems antithetical to that model. I understand their reasons for doing so (and I have also created companies with closed-source software) but there are additional options for funding these types of projects beyond public governance. G: Dexguru: Against \u2013 Not certain that the allocation does enough to drive users to Optimism. In general, the thread seems filled with low-quality support statements (maybe bots?) and a decent bit of drama. We can probably wait for things to shake out with the DAO before moving forward. H: Overnight: Against \u2013 Reconsidering when the project is deployed on the OP chain. I: Saddle Finance: Against \u2013 This proposal burns too fast and too bright, a large requested amount for a short-term distribution does not provide incentives beyond 3 months. It could work, but I\u2019d rather see something with a longer timeline, seems to me this will just get farmed and moved. ",

                    "content": "I have been looking to make a proposal the last week for my project, however I have some concerns. I noticed that voters abstain or put no to infrastructure projects because they cant validate the metrics, as an infrastructure project my self I am worried that by applying I am just going to be wasting weeks of my time to get an abstain or no and basically be pre-determined on the decision of my proposal. I done some DD and it looks like voters in majority are only interested in supporting protocols and not infrastructure projects from when looking at another infrastructure project to get ideas on how to apply and what metrics to provide for my own proposal. Its like if a well known infrastructure project like this [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet is getting no or abstain due to not been able to validate metrics even when its all over the place on most dapps and has traction, then how does any of us little projects have a chance?  It seems really unfair to infrastructure projects like me. Infrastructure projects bring the most long term value and also have the most costs to support a chain, it seems pretty unfair to ignore/discard us because of metrics.    [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet   (again, I understand why this is the case that it can\u2019t be verified) and I will be abstaining for the same reasons as I provided in the last cycle.      [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet   The metrics are good but we can\u2019t check them 100% as there is no data in the chain.      [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Cycle 3 Proposal] Infinity Wallet   tend to be sceptic of metrics that we can not doublecheck ourselves      StableNode Delegate Thread   In the previous cycle we voted yes, but we had a change of mind as we share a similar concern about open-source and a lack of metrics to support the proposal.   I would love to know if anyone or even @linda @Bobbay_StableLab could tell me if there is any point applying because how can I validate if I make a proposal and provide metrics, it seems impossible for infrastructure projects like me and others ",

After reviewing for a few days (did not just write this off from the start), I was very much on the fence still with not being able to verify the metrics as one of the factors and if I were to vote a yes or no it would have determined the outcome of the proposal. I didn\u2019t feel strongly enough in either direction. The other factors for me were I am not an expert on wallets but am generally not a fan of closed-source wallets. Abstaining does not affect the vote in terms of getting towards the 51% yes so I don\u2019t think that my decision as a delegate to abstain in that proposal should mean you shouldn\u2019t consider applying as each proposal is different. However, I would recommend getting some basic feedback / sense check in Discord first on what you\u2019re building. ",

As I wrote, our initial vote was yes but we decided to change our mind, and we will continue to treat each proposal with an unbiased view. At StableNode we have a combination of factors that we take into consideration, but on a minimal level, smaller amounts of OP requested with supporting metrics and a detailed explanation of OP distribution make it easier to support a proposal. Those protocols with a proven track record have a better rate of getting passed but it\u2019s because they have proven themselves. I don\u2019t want to delve deeper into our reasons for saying no to Infinity Wallet because I will add them to our delegate thread but the best way is to probably make a proposal. No one is going to \u201cwrite you off\u201d as you say above but see these proposals as a way to get your project out there. I personally read about every protocol that goes to vote and that itself is a marketing tool and a way to gather feedback. ",

My voting will always be heavily biased into builders and honest users. I\u2019m not comfortable with spending $OP for paid tweets. Proposal C: Hundred Finance - ABSTAIN  Abstaining because i don\u2019t understand the process behind this defi system. Proposal D: Biconomy - FOR  Biconomy does a great job at lowering the barriers to use crypto. I\u2019m hugely in favor of using $OP to bootstrap reimbursing fees to Optimism users. The amount requested is big, but as far as i understand it will not be used to directly cover costs. Proposal E: Dope Wars - AGAINST  I just don\u2019t believe this type of a game works best in driving optimism adoption. I would be more comfortable with assigning 100k $OP since the project already exists and has traction and could use it to build something cool, but 1m $OP is way too much. Proposal F: Infinity Wallet - AGAINST  500k $OP requested. Directed fully into funding a non-open source project. Proposal G: Dexguru - AGAINST  300k $OP requested, the distribution will be decided by a token that doesn\u2019t exist yet, which introduces a potential for abuse. Proposal H: Overnight.fi - ABSTAIN  Abstaining since i don\u2019t understand this value proposition. Proposal I: Saddle Finance - ABSTAIN  Abstaining since i don\u2019t understand this value proposition. Free thoughts:   Maybe this is just me, but i would appreciate some criteria for voting in these \u201cecosystem\u201d rounds. I signed up to be a delegate to work on funding public goods and this voting requires thinking in a different context.   Changed AGAINST to ABSTAIN for projects that i don\u2019t understand. In general i assume that overcomplicated defi (gauges, rebases, non-utility-staking) serve to build ponzis and speculation projects, but I don\u2019t want this bias to work against legitimate defi projects.

Due to a vulnerability, Snapshot has changed their settings last week for security reasons and is only allowing votes from safes on the same network from now on. We\u2019ve been in touch with Snapshot to resolve this (they were helpful!) and ultimately we tried to recreate our Safe on the Optimism network with the same address according to a tutorial and with help from a friend from Gnosis Safe but unfortunately the network address on Optimism differs from the Ethereum network address and they do not recommend redeploying and using the address on another network and make it consequently hard for future use. Solution - Manual redelegation is needed! As currently delegated tokens can not be used to vote on proposals anymore(!), we have created a new account that we will use from now on to vote on Op proposals. We ask the Op team to change our delegate address to the new address to make sure no new votes are delegated to our old address. We hope you consider redelegating with us but we understand if you pick 1 of the other great delegates.

Doug has stated:     MoneyManDoug:  The reason they are back to back is to distribute the 36m tokens set aside for kicking off the ecosystem.   But according to:   Optimism Docs   Governance Fund Overview To discuss Phase 0 and Phase 1 of the Governance Fund, head to the Optimism governance forum. Notice: OP Airdrop #1 is now available to claim Click here to claim Airdrop #1 does no      the actual amount of OP to be distributed is closer to 196m, i.e. \u201cPhase 1 will begin after Airdrop #1 and will distribute the remainder of the Governance Fund (approx. 196,128,233 OP) to projects in the Optimism ecosystem. Phase 1 will run from Airdrop #1 until the Governance Fund is exhausted.\u201d Am I wrong here? Or am I not mistaken? My point is if these voting cycles are going to run back to back for every fortnight, how long is it going to take to distribute 196m OP when more than approximately 3 in every 4 Proposals gets voted down? Has anyone calculated how much OP is being distributed every fortnight, on average? I haven\u2019t done exact calculations, but a rough guess is that it\u2019s going to take a LOT of fortnights to crank through 196m OP. My suggestion is that the super delegates (let\u2019s be straight, they\u2019re deciding most of these voting outcomes) could maybe be a bit less cynical and/or less risk adverse? No need to be foolish, but if this process is meant to kickstart an ecosystem, then perhaps power voters could try being a bit more optimistic and show a little more faith in new ideas, even if they aren\u2019t proven, world leaders (yet!). Or more formally: They could recalibrate their proposal evaluation criteria to place greater weight on the ecosystem\u2019s early momentum? After all, you\u2019re acting as a delegate of another\u2019s fund. These proposals aren\u2019t asking for the OP to come out of your own back pocket. Thanks for your time. It\u2019s nice to be back. Cheers, Axel EDIT: Disclosure - part of my motive for this comment is that I\u2019m thinking of re-drafting or creating a 2nd proposal, but I\u2019m still on the fence as to whether it\u2019s worth the time & mental effort when the bar appears so high to pass, and proposal success appears to be limited to established, insider projects who often shouldn\u2019t need any more incentive. So my motive was to see if I could ideally shift the standard For/Against waterline, and from here see which side I came off the fence on. ",

Then Snapshot changed their settings, now requiring voters to be on the same network to vote (Op governance \u2192 Optimism).   We needed to gain access to our Safe address on Optimism.    We checked how to recover funds / redeploy gnosis multisig on other networks (Gnosis Safe guide)   Our hopes got up as we saw that our case is covered (Safe version 1.3.0) and we found this tutorial   Following the short tutorial, we realized that the network address of Optimism (Chain ID 10) differs from Ethereum (Chain ID 1). The tutorial speaker tell us that it\u2019s impossible to recreate a Safe on another network if the network address differs. Snapshot guys confirmed: \u201cAnd in your case, your contract factory is not 0xC22834581EbC8527d974F8a1c97E1bEA4EF910BC , relayer only read and verify signatures coming from this factory on OP network\u201d (See Gnosis Safe proxy contract)   Also, the Gnosis Safe interface does not support the new Op Safe: (not exactly sure why)   \u201cIt needs to be noted that Safes with the same addresses on L2 and sidechains work out of the box with the Web and desktop UI. However, existing Safe addresses on Eth mainnet re-created on L2/sidechains (and vice versa) do not load up within our UI. This is because they use different singleton contracts.\u201d   \u201cGnosis Safe doesn\u2019t support redeployed Safes in their frontend as that feature is only available to recover funds but not supposed to be used for ongoing processes\u201d   There we stopped initially due to too many hurdles to get going and for future use.  Then, we saw the guys from GFX claiming that they could vote with their multisig address using the Boardroom interface.   image708\u00d772 17.2 KB   We tried to use Boardroom but we got the following error message \"Boardroom requires that you switch your wallet to the Optimistic Ethereum network to continue. Some wallets may not support changing networks. If you can not change networks in your wallet you may consider switching to a different wallet\" - basically running into the same issue again.   image1775\u00d7760 103 KB   At that point, we tried once more to access the address on Optimism following the tutorial but we realized that we created our original Ethereum Safe with the Argent Wallet which basically makes it impossible to go through the process of recreating the address on Optimism.  Maybe GFX managed to access their Ethereum address on Optimism despite the network address difference and could therefore utilize the Boardroom interface? Did you use Metamask? @GFXlabs @kevinknielsen maybe you can help? ",
