Why this is profitable to Optimism and the wider ecosystem is that Optimism will earns fees from these \u2018add on\u2019 L2s by them using the Optimism Sequencer. This is what @MinimalGravitas was mentioning, I think. The fees earned by the Sequencer (Coinbase using it) will in turn fund future OP Grants and Public Goods infrastructure. So, if I\u2019ve heard the news correctly, Coinbase will be building one of these \u2018add on\u2019 L2s. A Coinbase L2, Base, that\u2019s built with Optimism tech stack. As I\u2019m not a tech expert, don\u2019t quote me, ha! I\u2019ve only read the news on the CryptoCompare Newsletter, and just got my Bedrock/OP Tech Stack/Sequencer info from a single YouTube video produced by @Michael But overall, it does sound exciting, and I look forward to hearing more. EDIT: After just reading it myself, have a look at the Mirror article linked by MinimalGravitas. And please replace my mentions of \u201cOP tech stack\u201d with \u2018OP Stack\u2019, which appears to be the official jargon. ",

If even a small % of Coinbase\u2019s existing user base migrates to Base, it could spark an onchain renaissance of sorts. There\u2019s probably only ~2 million active daily users across all chains. Much less across the L2 space, maybe ~100k. Coinbase has 110m verified users. If they can onboard even a tiny percentage of that user base, 2%, we\u2019re looking at a 10x onchain user growth. Hopefully EIP-4844 won\u2019t take too much longer to lower fees and account abstraction can hide away wallets/address and devs can make ux a lot more simple/intuitive. ",
