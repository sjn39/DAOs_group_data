The downside is that you can basically claim anything about who the author is, but the upside is that from a UX POV, you can support EIP-5375 without forcing all users to sign EIP-712 messages. While less secure, this simplifies adoption, since NFT platforms can make ACPs optional. In my opinion, I think ACPs will end up being like the blue checkmark on Twitter: pretty irrelevant for most people, but extremely important for \u201ccelebrities\u201d to distinguish themselves from scammers. Obviously, a platform can also force all users to sign ACPs, for maximum security. ",
