If you haven\u2019t checked it out and weighed in, please do! I\u2019d also like to have a space to discuss collateral a little more in this thread. Specifically, what can we do to aid those charged with the due diligence and on boarding of new types of collateral? I personally see Maker as well positioned to dominate the real-world collateral \u2014> crypto financing space. Aside from diversification of collateral base just making for us a healthier balance sheet, this seems like a moat that would be quite wide once established. So\u2026 ELI5 the process from start to finish to find, evaluate, onboard a collateral type, and what the pain points are for each step of the way. Where can we as a DAO speed up the pipeline, and what new types of collateral do we not even have in the pipeline? Insurance policies? Annuities? Bonds? Municipal government assets? Artwork? Car title loans? You tell me, because I\u2019m sure someone is tokenizing it all somewhere. And if you don\u2019t think we should be heavy on RWA, what\u2019s your line of thinking? Thanks for all thoughts! ",

                    "content": "Sorry meant to circle back here sooner! This is probably the best place to start, but the ELI5 is that a collateral journey starts with an application on the forum, that collateral is polled and then added to the collateral onboarding sheet based on how the vote goes. From there the different domain teams (Risk, Oracles, RWF if applicable etc.) start the work of getting everything together to add a new vault type to the system. Depending on the type of collateral, this can be a very intensive process or a fairly straight forward one. But ultimately, once all relevant teams sign off, the Risk Team will propose parameters for the vault type and then those parameters will be voted on by Governance, with the vault type being added upon implementation of the executive vote containing it. Phew. I might have glossed over something, so please correct me if I missed something experience folks! Basically we can onboard as much as we can safely sign off on, so bringing \u201cproven\u201d collateral types is a huge help. Other than that we\u2019re probably talking about proposing additional core units and adding hands to the workforce of people that come together to get a new vault type in action. Hope that is somewhat helpful! ",
