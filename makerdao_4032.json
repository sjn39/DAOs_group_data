While we all wanted this process to go faster, my intent from day one was to only request the debt ceiling when the deal was \u201cfully baked\u201d and welded together. Now it is. Similar to the blockchain scaling trilema of speed, price, and security, I am of the opinion that if we have to give on one of those, it should >>> never <<< be security. If there are any additional questions or concerns, please direct them to me or @g_dip.  In addition to the above, 6s is requesting the DAI target BD address (part of MIP21) to be updated to 0xE5C35757c296FD19faA2bFF85e66C6B25AC8b978 (as outlined HERE) in the earliest possible executive vote.
