                    "content": " Abstract Here we propose a way to scale the on-chain collateral types by adopting the tokenized vault standard: EIP-4626 type tokens as collateral types. These collateral types can create ERC20 compatible shares out of any yielding strategy. These tokens can be created by anyone and brought forward by anyone, while the actual integration itself can be similar to that of GUNI in the Maker Protocol. As GUNI saw a great product market fit, we suspect that this can also hold true for some of these EIP-4626 collaterals. As always, we must not underestimate associated risks and oracle costs, which are excluded from this initial post.  Motivation One of the goals for Maker governance is to scale dai supply while increasing the decentralization of the underlying collateral. In sideways, or bear market circumstances, the demand for speculative use cases for borrowing dai drops significantly. In Maker, currently all crypto non-stablecoins account for about 3.5B DAI, down from 5.6B DAI in November 2021. To scale Dai supply in these market circumstances, while reducing PSM exposure and increasing decentralised collateral, yielding tokens should be added to the protocol as collateral. We\u2019ve seen a great demand for the GUNI collaterals, as these provide users of the Maker protocol with ways to gain a yield on their DAI, without risking their assets. There are many other avenues for achieving yield on-chain. Maker is positioned perfectly to provide these yield strategies additional leverage, due to the cost of capital for the protocol being effectively 0. Therefore, allowing others in DeFi to create lego blocks similar to GUNI, to then be integrated into the Maker protocol, can help scale the Dai supply for the good. Adopting the EIP-4626 standard, and actively promoting usage of this standard as MakerDAO, will increase the overall composability of DeFi. And, thereby the amount of suitable collateral for Maker.  EIP-4626: Yield Bearing Vault Standard The yield bearing vault standard, is an effort to standardise the way yield bearing assets work in DeFi. This in theory should reduce errors & development efforts when integrating with various different protocols. This standard is in RFC-phase, but is gaining a lot of attention. For more information about the standard, see: the discussion on Eth Magicians here: EIP-4626: Yield Bearing Vault Standard - EIPs - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians  EIP-4626 in Maker To explain how EIP-4626 can be used to increase the DAI supply in Maker, we use abstracted Yearn strategies as an example. Below are the steps to support an abstracted yearn strategy as collateral in Maker, and why it is also a win for Yearn to do something like this.  Preface: Current Yearn vaults Currently, Yearn vaults allow users to enter with, say USDC for the yvUSDC vault, and the user receives shares to this vault. This USDC is allocated to one of the underlying strategies of this vault, and is constantly being rebalanced by the Yearn strategists and keepers, based on the most optimal yielding strategy. Supporting the Yearn vaults as collateral like this, would mean that Maker cannot control the risks associated with a Vault\u2013neither the amount of exposure to any given strategy, nor which strategies are in use. Therefore these vaults as is are not well suited as collateral for Maker. So how does EIP-4262 change this?  1600\u00d71035 59.7 KB   Step 1: Abstract & isolate Yearn strategies as EIP-4626 strategies The first step towards adoption in the Maker protocol, would be to abstract & isolate the underlying strategies of the Yearn vault. In the yvUSDC example, there are currently 8 strategies underlying the vault, see: The Vaults at Yearn. A few of these strategies might make great collateral in Maker if they would be isolated & abstracted. Let\u2019s take the Compound Finance Flashmint Folding as an example. This strategy should then be updated to follow the EIP-4262 standard, meaning that it must be made possible to enter this strategy itself with USDC, and receive shares into only this strategy. The compounding of the strategy should be done within this tokenized vault, and as permissionless as possible. The advantage of this step is that this tokenized vault has a much different set of risks, which should be significantly smaller than yvUSDC. This in itself is a great DeFi lego brick, and could be used by many different protocols. The advantage of using the already existing Yearn strategies would be that these are already battle-tested to great extent.   1600\u00d7851 115 KB    Step 2: Onboard a strategy in Maker This is the \u2018easy\u2019 part. The part MakerDAO knows best. Do all the due diligence & governance processes required to onboard a wrapped strategy in Maker. Obviously here it should also be taken into consideration which strategies make sense for Maker, and which don\u2019t. Some strategies might require some additional work to onboard. For example rebasing tokens would need to be wrapped, just like stETH is now in the Maker protocol. Another suggestion (by @Kurt_Barry ) would be to automate the stability rates to some extent. It\u2019s possible to measure (approximately) the instantaneous interest rate of a Vault on-chain, so we could in principle build a rate adjusting module that targets a certain rate spread (with a sensible lower bound) that gets continuously adjusted by Keepers.   1600\u00d7856 124 KB    Step 3: Add the Maker collateral to improve the yield for aggregators The reasoning for aggregators, like Yearn, to propose these collaterals and create them according to the EIP-4626 standard, would be to ultimately use it themselves to improve the yield. In the example, gaining extra exposure through DAI to leverage the Compound Finance Flashmint Folding even further, would be beneficial and a unique selling point for yield aggregators that do use it like that. In this way it truly could be a win/win for the yield aggregator & Maker.  1600\u00d7987 182 KB   Call to action This post is meant to be an inspiration to DeFi builders, to build more lego bricks which could be onboarded into the Maker protocol. Doing so could help scale DAI for another 10 Billion in the coming year, no matter the market action. Now would be a perfect time for Maker folks to comment on the standard, to make sure it is usable for Maker. You can do so here: EIP-4626: Yield Bearing Vault Standard - EIPs - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians The standardisation of tokenized vaults can help the innovation in DeFi greatly, and increase simplicity. It would become much easier for Maker to integrate with multiple of these tokenized vaults, despite the complexity underneath the various options available. This post is also meant as an invite to everyone who is considering writing new protocols, or upgrades to existing protocols, to use this EIP-4626 standard. Especially if you are considering it for collateral for the Maker protocol. Thanks to @Haiku , @Kurt_Barry , and Facu for review of this post. Please post any ideas, doubts, feedback. ",

While they will be a strong liquidity injection vector for the protocol. What incentive do they have to use us? To use say their yvUSDC or yv3Pool, to issue DAI and re-issue more leveraged? If that is a use case I can see it positively. But then our stability rate should be competitive enough to keep oracles, strategies fee and generate profit for the protocol. ",

So the Yearn (V2) yvUSDC vault that would use the EIP-4626 would not make for the best collateral, as that has a much different set of risks than Maker generally accepts. However, some of the underlying strategies might make great collateral. For example: the USDC compound Finance Flashmint Folding. A simpler one could be the supply side USDC on Compound (so effectively cUSDC). If someone would create an EIP-4626 compliant token version of that, then it would mean much less hassle for the Maker protocol, as the integration is much simpler. ",

                    "content": "I think proposition confuses few things about what it tries to achieve and what is the actual use case of 4626 interface. If it\u2019s about using yearn (or any other agg) LP-tokens from vaults, it\u2019s difficult because of economical incentives and not because of a technical limitation. LP-tokens (or, shares) are not minted/issued by specific strategy utilized currently by given vault but by the vault itself operating on registered strategies. Proposed decoupling of strategy is synonymous with forking strategy. Even if, it makes little sense as this wouldn\u2019t offer any higher yield than vault with multiple strats under the management, locked liquidity and often additional boosters (curve gauges). You can approximate value of LP-token and account for it to be used as collateral (lets say, with slight discount). But, locking LP also means locking away yields and at a discount at that! Additionally, most of yearns lp-tokens are re-staked for curve gauges, so you naturally would be competing with their yield. MIM used yDAI for their stablecoin, and the reason is yDAI was pretty much locked out of recirculating into Curve/Yearn ecosystem as collateral. There is also yLUSD and you can find few more LP-tokens which could make more sense to be allowed as collateral to increase supply of DAI. LPs of pairs on UNI, Sushi etc. are almost always locked inside of protocols for fees so that\u2019s that. You don\u2019t need exactly to implement 4626 for all that. It will make sense for MakerDAO to follow standardized interface to gain potential interoperability with diff protocols or easier integration, but it will not increase yield of anything as it doesn\u2019t solve economical problems limiting amount of investors willing to lock their liquidity for borrowing DAI. That\u2019s for today at least. ",

In terms of what this idea tries to achieve is really a win/win for multiple parties: For the Maker protocol:  Scale Dai supply without even more enormous PSMs Simplify & standardize the way of integrating with yielding tokens, so that adding a new one as collateral isn\u2019t a ton of technical smart contract work aside from the risk, oracle, and general due diligence.  For Maker users:  Have an additional way to get an attractive yield, in a lower risk method than a yearn vault itself (as the yield is coming from a single strategy). This does mean that the yield might be lower than on yearn, but there will be a ton of demand for that.  For Yield aggregators:  If the standardization will result in the possibility of onboarding a part of your strategy into Maker, then it can be very attractive, as the additional leverage that Maker provides, gives the yield aggregator a competitive advantage. See Step 3 in the post.  For buidlers:  Generally to get inspired that standardization makes sense.  ",
