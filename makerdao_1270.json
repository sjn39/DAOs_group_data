This additional risk assessment is issued by the incubating Lending Oversight Core Unit (\u201cLOVE\u201d) the ratification of which is subject to vote by the MakerDAO Community. The assessment is intended to be reviewed in conjunction with the other documents referenced herein. Please refer to the Huntingdon Valley Bank (HVB) Risk Assessment posted by the Real-World Finance Core Unit (RWF) and the incubating Legal and Transactional Services Core Unit (LTS) for a more comprehensive analysis of this transaction.  Content Outline  Executive Summary Transaction Details Key Risks and Mitigating Factors Process Overview Conclusion & LOVE Recommendation   Executive Summary Huntingdon Valley Bank (HVB) is a 150+ year old community bank headquartered in suburban Philadelphia, PA, USA with approximately $556.5 million of total assets as of March 31, 2022. HVB is a wholly-owned subisidiary of HV Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HBVC), a publicly-traded bank holding company with a market capitalization of $43.7 million as of June 13, 2022. HVB has proposed a transaction whereby it would sell portions of select commercial and residential / consumer loans (Participated Loans) to MakerDAO (Maker) to be held in a dedicated trust, while continuing to service the loans and transfer principal and interest payments to Maker. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2022, HVB\u2019s commercial lending division closed $150.7 million in new loan production. Per the MIP6, HVB and Maker would have a pari passu relationship, with HVB maintaining a minimum 50% ownership of the Participated Loans at all times. The initial proposal is for a 100 million DAI debt ceiling on the loan participation facility. The Participated Loans would be commercial and residential / consumer loans (commercial real estate, construction, residential real estate, capital call lines, business loans, etc.) credit-rated 6 or better out of a 10 point scale where a lower value is more favorable. Maker would establish a trust (RWA MPT) for the sole purpose of receiving and holding the Participated Loans. RWA MPT\u2019s real world sponsor would be a Caymans-based foundation (RWA Foundation) designed to execute Maker decisions off chain through three independent and autonomous corporate actors. WSFS Bank (WSFS) would serve as Maker\u2019s escrow agent and trustee to facilitate the flow of USD while Genesis Trading would execute the DAI/USD conversions and Ankura Trust, as calculation agent, would reconcile all fund flows. RWF and LTS have invested extensive time and effort into thoughtfully developing this structure to best suit the Maker community. Further transaction structure information can be found below in \u201cTransaction Details.\u201d  Transaction Details The following Diagrams 1 - 3 are replicated from the RWF / LTS risk assessment referenced above. Diagram 1: Commercial Terms:  Diagram 2: Transaction Parties:  1622\u00d7928 129 KB  Diagram 3: Legal and Contractual Structure:  1700\u00d7842 160 KB  Structure Summary: The step-by-step outline below details the flow of funds and reporting in the proposed transaction.  RWA Foundation is established in the Cayman Islands  Glenn Kennedy, Leeward Management; Zedra Directors; Silverside Management serve as agents of RWA Foundation to perform the minimum duties required of foundation companies by Cayman Islands law.  All Sacred Rights are directed solely by MKR holders Other actions decided by Maker Delegated Committee (elected by MKR vote)  Glenn Kennedy, Leeward Management; Zedra Directors; Silverside Management are intended to only act out the decisions of the above Maker groups; not to make decisions on their own, subject, of course, to applicable Cayman Islands law.       RWA Foundation is the sponsor of RWA MPT RWA MPT buys loans from HVB  HVB services loans  Sends P&I to RWA MPT   RWA MPT sends $USD to WSFS Escrow   WSFS Escrow sends $USD to Genesis Trading Genesis Trading converts $USD to DAI Genesis Trading sends DAI to RWA Foundation (from accounting standpoint)  RWA Foundation sends DAI back to Maker Surplus or Vault (from accounting standpoint)    The payment rails from the RWA MPT to Maker are intended to be hard-coded into the agreements so that no person (or persons) can independently make a change. Any changes will require an affirmative Maker vote.   Key Risks and Mitigants: Counterparty Risk: This transaction would expose Maker to multiple new counterparties, many of which are operationally and organizationally exposed to single points of failure. Both HVB and WSFS are traditional banks subject to US regulatory requirements and oversight. The transaction is directly reliant on the actions of HVB and WSFS and indirectly impacted by the decisions of US financial regulatory bodies such as the Federal Reserve. Additionally, Genesis and Ankura are critical to enabling and verifying the flow of funds; each of these entities is heavily reliant on the actions of a few select key individuals and not subject to any smart contract controls. Maker\u2019s off-chain representative, RWA Foundation, is designed to effectively be a pass-through entity relaying Maker Community and Delegated Committee decisions to real world actors. However, the RWA Foundation is overseen and represented by three agents (Glenn Kennedy, Leeward Management; Zedra Directors; Silverside Management), each of which is contracted solely through legal commitments. In theory, any one of these three actors or other real-world counterparty could breach the legal contracts and ignore the given orders to act in their own interest. Mitigating Factors: Maker is entering new territory interacting directly with such centralized off-chain entities. However, the associated risks are lessened by several aspects of the transaction. First, HVB and WSFS are subject to stringent regulatory oversight as public companies and as US-based depository institutions. Their deposits are insured by the FDIC and their governance functions are frequently examined by bank regulators. While this does not eliminate all risk, it does add an additional layer of checks and balances to Maker\u2019s own thorough due diligence. As highly regulated institutions, HVB and WSFS need to interact only with equally reputable entities. Therefore, each bank is expected to perform its own examinations of the additional parties to this transaction. This additional scrutiny will assist in reducing the risks of associating with Genesis, Ankura, and RWA Foundation\u2019s three agents. Finally, by utilizing Ankura Trust to confirm the eligibility of loan participations (not HVB itself) and separating the roles of supervisor, director, and secretary among three separate Cayman Islands entities, the transaction intends to heighten the level of decentralization. Single Points of Failure: Most traditional institutions, organized around a few key individuals, are subject to single points of failure. Maker would be interacting with and reliant on multiple such entities in this transaction. As a traditional bank, HVB is operated by a select group of key executives and directors with full shareholder input rarely solicited. Additionally, HVB\u2019s three largest shareholders own a collective 26.8% of the company, while executives and directors own 19.9% in aggregate, per the April 2022 14A Proxy Report. WSFS, also a traditional bank with a top-down structure, operates similarly to HVB while its top 10 institutional shareholders own a total of 52.2% of its shares. These marked deviations from the Maker community-driven model force the transaction\u2019s success to be significantly influenced by a handful of key individuals and investors; adding single points of failure. Maker is also creating an element of this risk in its own right through the RWA Foundation and Delegated Committee structures. The Maker Delegated Committee would provide directions to RWA Foundation\u2019s day-to-day real-world agents (Glenn Kennedy, Leeward Management; Zedra Directors; Silverside Management) and, while most Sacred Rights decisions would be decided by MKR vote, all other general decisions would be made by the Delegated Committee. This layers the risks of the Delegated Committee\u2019s decision making on top of the risk of the three agents acting as directed. Mitigating Factors: For the avoidance of the doubt, LOVE does not believe there are other alternatives available based on the current technology stack that would avoid the risks of single points of failure outlined above, and believes that those risks have been minimized as much as possible by the proposal. Yet, we would suggest all community members to engage and ask the questions they see fit. Regulatory oversight of HVB and WSFS mitigate some of the risks associated with their operational and ownership structures. Both banks are subject to banking regulators (OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve) and, as public companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each bank must act according to the best practices outlined by these regulators and in the best interest of all shareholders, together reducing the possibility of bad actors and creating a demand to serve a broader community. Even with any single failure points, as HVB\u2019s interests are aligned with Maker\u2019s through its 50% ownership minimum of the Participated Loans, HVB should act also in Maker\u2019s interest if it acts in its own. The RWA Foundation\u2019s agents (Glenn Kennedy, Leeward Management; Zedra Directors; Silverside Management) would be mandated to serve strictly as Maker\u2019s representatives and at the guidance of the Maker Delegated Committee. Under this structure, these entities should only be the executors of Maker\u2019s decisions. Reliance on individual human agency and control risks of the Maker Delegated Committee are mitigated by the committee\u2019s structure. Each member of the committee is selected by MKR holders for a one-year term and may be removed at any time by a Maker Governance poll. Additionally, new members may be added to the committee at any time through a governance poll. As a final check, MKR holders may vote to have 0 representatives on the Delegated Committee and retain all decisions (sacred and non-sacred). The Delegated Committee would be required to report all communications with the RWA Foundation\u2019s agents on forum.makerdao.com for absolute transparency. The Delegated Committee also provides an aspect of \u201coperational continuity,\u201d as it can continue to act as a Maker oversight unit in the event of governance malfunction. A full discussion on the use of similar delegated committees in RWA transactions will be had in a separate forum post. Loan Concentration and Credit Risk: Maker\u2019s capital and any returns would be subject to the performance of the underlying loan borrowers. HVB proposes issuing or purchasing commercial loans which are typically made to SMEs operating in and dependent on a targeted geographic region. Maker would therefore be exposed to the economic health of a narrow section of the Northeastern United States, HVB\u2019s primary geography as defined in its most recent 10-Q filing. The Participated Loans would include commercial real estate and construction loans, which, in community banking, are generally regarded as among the riskiest types due to the real estate market\u2019s unpredictability. Maker does not have the developed lending / credit function required to fully review these loan types and would therefore be putting its trust in HVB\u2019s underwriting. Mitigating Factors: HVB has over 150 years of lending experience and a proven track record of success as a commercial lender. Non-Performing Loans represented only 0.79% of HVB\u2019s total loans (NPLs/ Loans) at March 31, 2022 and annualized Net Charge Offs (NCOs/ Loans; charged off loans net of any loan loss reserve released) were only 0.01% of average loans. For reference, the FDIC reports industry-wide NPLs/ Loans and NCOs/ Loans of 0.84% and 0.22%, respectively, for all of its insured institutions as of the same period. These metrics are closely monitored by regulators with increased reporting and capital requirements in the post-Great Recession Era, especially for banks with real estate (commercial and residential) loan concentrations. Further, while HVB\u2019s Northeast US lending focus may pose a risk, it is also a key asset: HVB\u2019s lenders are intimately familiar with their home markets and can be expected to use years of local knowledge to source sound credit opportunities. HVB added a unique layer of security to its lending by, as RWF notes in its Risk Assessment, hiring a \u201cseasoned contractor to monitor all draws, review all budgets, serve as an independent reviewer, and provide a level of expert oversight to the process.\u201d Per the terms of the agreement, the RWA MPT would retain ultimate autonomy in the structure as it would make the decision of whether to purchase or forego a loan; no loans could be forced upon the RWA MPT. As a final measure, RWA MPT would have the option to terminate all future loan purchases with ninety days prior notice. This gives Maker an emergency brake should credit deterioration emerge or accelerate. Off-Chain Collateral Monitoring: This would be a primarily off-chain transaction with limited-to-no smart contract controls placed on real-world actors or operations. All collateral and off-chain data monitoring would therefore be entirely human, or manual, processes. A large amount of trust and responsibility would be placed on the individuals monitoring these components, including RWF which would also need to dedicate significant resources to developing and maintaining adequate real-world oversight infrastructure. We believe this to be one of the main points of weakness that should be addressed by technology in the future of the real-world initiative. Mitigating Factors: HVB is very experienced at monitoring credit with robust, time-tested infrastructure in place to facilitate the function. In addition, and probably most importantly, HVB appears fully aligned with Maker in providing appropriate reporting and valuation of the loan book, as well as heavily supervised. In this regard, HVB has the real-world experience and teams Maker does not, further proving the partnership\u2019s value. HVB, as noted above, maintains extremely sound asset quality metrics with limited loan losses. Further, RWF and LTS have diligently assessed their real world counterparts, especially the RWA Foundation\u2019s agents, and designed legal constructs that place checks on these entities. HVB\u2019s skill and the transaction structure drastically reduce the inherent risks associated with this off-chain, manual monitoring. Additional real-world safeguards come from the monitoring function that Ankura, the calculation agent, provides. This represents a party independent from HVB that acts in Maker\u2019s best interest only. Non-conforming assets would not be partcipated to RWA MPT and Ankura would \u201cspot-check\u201d assets for performance, while providing crypto servicing reports to the community. DAI Concentration Risk: With a requested debt ceiling of 100 million DAI, HVB\u2019s proposed vault would be Maker\u2019s largest RWA relationship and increase total current RWA exposure by 2.7x. The transaction terms propose the full 100 million DAI funded upfront into the RWA MPT for deployment over a 12 - 18 month target, putting the DAI at risk from day 1 and representing Maker\u2019s 5th largest DAI supply equivalent to ~6.4% of total DAI supplied. This concentration level is especially noteworthy given the deal structure\u2019s reliance on several key figures, primarily HVB. As noted above, weaknesses within any one of these entities could derail the transaction and, with such a material concentration of DAI supplied, Maker is taking on significant risk. Mitigating Factors: As RWA Foundation is a Maker-controlled entity and the sole beneficiary of RWA MPT, any DAI held by the trust is for the benefit of Maker which keeps the assets only one degree outside of the protocol. Additionally, HVB\u2019s interests would be directly aligned with Maker\u2019s, as the bank proposes investing at least an equivalent amount of capital in the loans in a pari passu agreement. While an additional juniority protection would be an added benefit, HVB\u2019s substantial skin in the game, implies it will strive to protect all capital in the deal. HVB\u2019s more than 150 years of lending experience and pristine credit quality further mitigate concentration risk to Maker. Liquidity Risk: Maker would be deploying its capital into loans secured by collateral that would need to be liquidated or the loan would need to be sold to cover losses in the event of a borrower default, as well as for internal liquidity / pegging reasons. In the case of seized hard asset collateral, demand may not exist or the market value may not fully cover all losses. This is especially risky as it relates to construction loans, which may be backed by incomplete real estate development projects, and loans secured by commercial real estate, which may be in economically-distressed areas with low demand. The materiality of Maker\u2019s 100 million DAI supply compounds these risks. Mitigating Factors: In order to qualify for RWA MPT purchase, Participating Loans must be fully performing and free of defaults which limits the risk of a liquidation event. In the case of a default after purchase, HVB\u2019s skilled \u201cSpecial Servicing\u201d team, a part of Loan Operations, would use their years of experience to liquidate the collateral, sell the loan, or negotiate new terms with the borrower. HVB also has additional channels to leverage and may sell the loan to specialized non-performing loan funds or employ outside professionals to help liquidate the collateral. The largely homogenous credit policies placed on all US banks creates a \u201cfungibility\u201d to the products HVB originates, thus creating a broader potential market for any assets, distressed or performing. Credit (Solvency) Risk of HVB: As noted throughout, HVB\u2019s performance and overall operations heavily influence this transaction\u2019s success. HVB, similar to other traditional banks, finances a large portion of its operations with deposits and debt instruments. HVB must make the required timely payments on these obligations or risk insolvency. Mitigating Factors: HVB reported a 2.63% Interest Rate Spread (IRS; weighted average yield on assets minus weighted average cost of liabilities) and a 2.74% Net Interest Margin (NIM; interest income net of interest expense as a percent of average interest-earning assets) for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. For reference, the aggregate NIM of all FDIC-insured institutions was 2.54% for the same time period, proving HVB\u2019s above-class ability to service its debts. Further, at March 31, 2022, HVB\u2019s sole longterm obligation was a $10.0 million subordinated debt note representing approximately 1.8% of total assets and bearing a fixed rate of 4.50% through mid-2026. Finally, regulators require HVB to maintain certain capital ratio minimums to remain in good standing. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, HVB reported robust capital ratios with a CET1 Ratio of 13.9%, more than 2x the \u201cWell Capitalized\u201d regulatory threshold. As noted and per the terms of the agreement, the RWA MPT would have the option to terminate future loan purchases with ninety days prior notice. This emergency brake could be used should Maker see any signs of financial distress at HVB. Regulatory Risk: This transaction would expose Maker to traditional bank regulatory bodies which may add more scrutiny than solely on-chain contracts. This adds additional risk to the transaction as digital asset regulation remains unclear in most jurisdictions and is subject to change. The materiality of this risk for Maker, its Core Units, and individual contributors remains untested. Mitigating Factors: HVB and WSFS both remain in good standing with their respective regulators which helps reduce the potential for regulatory probing of the transaction. Further, given its relatively small size, HVB is not subject to the same level of oversight that a larger bank, such as a multinational one, would be and is afforded more operational flexibility. Maker could potentially forge symbiotic partnerships with both HVB and WSFS through this transaction which may help in navigating any future traditional regulatory exposure. Smart Contract Risk: This transaction structure adds a unique risk factor to the broader smart contract risk inherent to all on-chain interactions. This deal would utilize the MIP21 suite with the addition of a new RWAJar contract, which would include a void() function to transfer all DAI to the surplus buffer and a toss(uint256 wad) function to only send a specific amount of DAI to a specific wallet. These new, untested additions to the MIP21 suite of contracts would not be audited prior to deployment in the transaction. The unaudited and untested nature of these additions add additional risk to this transaction\u2019s inherent smart contract risk. Mitigating Factors: The base MIP21 contract suite has been audited and tested thoroughly by Maker CUs and external parties, which limits potential broad smart contract risk. Regarding the additional contract, CES notes in its risk assessment \u201cthis new contract has been reviewed and approved for use by Protocol Engineering without an audit due to its simple semantics and permissionless operation.\u201d CES and PE are highly regarded core units in and outside of Maker, continously and diligently producing high-quality products that have withstood many tests. The addition of contracts with \u201csimple semantics\u201d tested by both parties is noteworthy, but should not likely pose a material risk to the transaction. LOVE would encourage CES and PE to continue to monitor these additions and seek an audit should any concerns emerge.  Process Overview This process operated with high levels of professionalism and effectiveness beginning with the initial MIP6. Multiple Maker core units have worked directly with HVB to ensure all facets of the transaction, from legal to credit to engineering, have been thoroughly analyzed and their risks assessed. Further, this process has established new frameworks and transaction structures that may be replicated for onboarding future real-world assets. It is especially noteworthy and complimentary that HVB, as a local community bank which relies heavily on its reputation, has chosen to work side-by-side with Maker\u2019s CUs. This is a testament to the Maker individuals\u2019 exemplary performance throughout this process. The end results of the efforts of these CUs and the entire Maker community should significantly bolster Maker\u2019s reputation on and off-chain. LOVE, in its prospective role as a lending facilitator, has noted no material conflicts and believes the process followed here by all parties should stand as a future example of best practices across all transactions.  Conclusion & LOVE Recommendation Strategic Real-World Expansion. This is an opportunity for Maker to not only expand deeper into real-world asset lending, but also to partner with a highly-regarded 150+ year old financial institution and build significant brand recognition. For a bank of HVB\u2019s size, Maker is providing a transformational amount of capital via 100 million DAI, which could lead to more demand from like-sized financial institutions. This could position Maker to be the decentralized lender of choice for real-world community banks; a sector with over 4,500 individual institutions in the United States alone. Maker and HVB\u2019s Interests are Aligned. Maker\u2019s position would be pari passu with HVB, meaning the bank would act in Maker\u2019s interest as it acts in its own; that which benefits HVB also benefits Maker. Likewise, an action against Maker would be an action against itself. This is a critical safeguard as Maker expands more meaningfully into off-chain arrangements and provides a well-protected test case for similar future transaction. High-Caliber Analysis and Structuring. The relevant parties, both within and outside of Maker, in this transaction have expended tremendous effort analyzing this opportunity and optimizing its structure. The Real World Finance and Legal and Transaction Services (in incubation) core units have thoroughly diligenced the commercial and legal aspects of this proposal. Additionally, the RWF / LTS risk assessment is a comprehensive piece outlining the merits and concerns around this engagement. LOVE holds the work of these parties in the highest regard. LOVE, based on its thorough review of this transaction and extensive experience working with traditional banks, recommends proceeding with the HVB agreement as presented herein. Please note that the LOVE Core Unit is in incubation with its ratification subject to vote by the MakerDAO community. ",

Any changes will require an affirmative Maker vote.    I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m misunderstanding the path of returning the DAI back to the RwaJar That you describe here, but CES has described it as:   Genesis sends the DAI equivalent of the monthly investment and participation income component of the remittances to the RWAJar contract;  Genesis sends the DAI equivalent of participation funding requirements to the RWAUrn contract for reducing the debt in the RWAUrn contract;  Your description alludes that the RWA Foundation will send DAI back to Genesis? Is that correct? Or are you referring to as an accounting report. Sorry for the confusion, but I have zero trust that an RWA Foundation based in Cayman can push DAI on-chain when so many people make mistakes making transactions. Hence, why I am asking if I misunderstood.
