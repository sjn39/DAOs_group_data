We also dig deep into the community\u2019s discussion this week about turning back-on the DAI Savings Rate (DSR), as well as the brilliant invention of the TRFM (Target Rate Feedback Mechanism) by the late MakerDAO Co-Founder, Nikolai Mushegian. @ultraschuppi  and I were grateful to have spoken to Kurt, as we gained additional knowledge about the TRFM, the DeFi Collateral Problem, and so much more from the mind of one of Maker\u2019s most brilliant developers.
