                    "content": "As most will be aware, recently Maker Governance have had to react quickly to the introduction and growing popularity of liquidity mining in the DeFi ecosystem. This post summarizes the emergency and non-emergency responses that we\u2019ve taken so far, and will be kept up to date as the responses continue.  USDC-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling Increase July 2nd - [Signal Request] USDC-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments Just after the July 2nd Governance And Risk meeting, @cyrus of the Risk Team proposes to adjust the USDC debt ceiling and / or stability fee in response to the proposed change to the COMP distribution as an emergency measure. The result of the polls is a majority for the increase of the USDC-A debt ceiling to 40 million, and the Risk Premium to 4%. This change is included in the regularly scheduled executive vote on Friday 3rd July, which passes successfully.  ETH-A Debt Ceiling Increase July 5th - [Signal Request] ETH-A Stability Fee and Debt Ceiling adjustments On Sunday July 5th, @cyrus of the Risk Team polls to change the ETH-A debt ceiling and risk premium as a result of the amount of Dai minted from ETH-A increasing to within a few million Dai of the existing debt ceiling. The result of the polls is a majority for the increase of the ETH-A debt ceiling to 160 million. This change is included in an emergency executive vote on 6th July which passes successfully.  Peg Stabilization Module (PSM) Proposal July 4th - Peg Stabilization Modules: A Pre-MIP Discussion On Saturday, @charlesstlouis describes the idea of Peg Stabilization Modules on behalf of the Maker Foundation. The PSM is a new smart contract that would allow the trading of minted Dai for USDC to directly help to maintain the peg (along with other advantages.) July 6th - Forum Poll: Deciding the Peg Stabilization Modules Implementation Timeline On Monday, @charlesstlouis creates a poll to find consensus on the desired implementation speed for the PSM. The poll and the urgency surrounding it is somewhat controversial. Given the timing and nature of the change @LongForWisdom, one of the Governance Facilitators imposes a higher bar for implementing the PSM as an emergency action. This bar is not met, and the PSM is instead planned to be discussed over the month of July, and implemented at the end of the month provided it can pass on-chain polls confirming that MKR Holders support its implementation. July 10th - [Signal Request] Consider refinements to PSM or release ASAP? @Joshua_Pritikin proposes the above signal to read the feeling among the community around some of the more complex proposals surrounding the PSM. This was in response to a number of proposals from various community members that would be unlikely to be technically feasible for the first release of the PSM. The poll is ongoing, however at the time of writing it appears that the majority would prefer to see the PSM implemented without major scope changes. July 14th - PSM Governance Timeline @LongForWisdom, shares the timeline for voting on the PSM and calls for Maker Governance to work on figuring out what parameter sets should be available for vote on-chain. July 22nd - A word on the PSM concept and next steps for the Foundation The Foundation shares the above statement, saying that they will not continue work on the PSM. July 23rd - PSM Poll fails to pass (barely) The first on-chain poll on the PSM fails to pass. If the community wishes to pursue this further, the community will need to work through the MIPs process.  Request COMP Rewards exclude DAI July 7th - [Signal Request] Should MakerDAO signal that it prefers for COMP rewards for DAI suppliers and borrowers to be disabled? On Tuesday, @equivrel formally begins a signal request around a suggestion that had been discussed over the weekend. Namely that Dai be exlcuded from recieving COMP rewards on the Compound platform. Naturally this is not within the power of Maker Governance to change, but members of Compound Governance indicated that such an action may be possible, if it was desired by Maker. This signal request returns consensus on a negative outcome. Maker Governance will not signal to COMP that it wishes for COMP rewards to be disabled for Dai markets.  Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceilings July 16th - [Signal Request] Should we raise the ETH debt ceiling? On Sunday July 16th, @Cyrus recommends further increases in the ETH-A debt ceiling in response to the uncertainty around the Dai peg. The poll ends successfully to increase the ETH-A ceiling to 180 Million. July 17th - The increase to the ETH-A debt ceiling is included in Friday\u2019s executive, which passes.  Raise the ETH-A and USDC-A Debt Ceilings July 19th -  [Signal Request] Increases in the ETH and USDC-A debt ceilings On Sunday July 19th, @Cyrus recommends further increases in the ETH-A and USDC-A debt ceilings in response to the start of YFI farming. The poll ends successfully with a majority for: ETH-A Debt Ceiling =  220 Million USDC-A Debt Ceiling = 80 Million These changes were included in an emergency executive on the 20th, and passed shortly afterward.  Reduce the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio and Risk Premium July 22nd - Signal Request: Lower the USDC-A Liquidation Ratio and Risk Premium On July 22nd, @hexonaut proposes lowering the Liquidation Ratio and Risk Premium on USDC-A after it is discussed heavily in this weeks Governance and Risk meeting. July 23rd - [Signal Request] Should Emergency Action Be Taken Due To Elevated Peg On July 23rd, @Jtathmann proposes expediting the desired changes in response to the pressure on the peg arising from the YFI liquidity mining pools. On July 24th, and as a result of these polls @LongForWisdom adds the proposal to change the liquidation ratio on USDC-A to 110% to the weekly executive vote. This action takes place before the polls officially end, with the justification that it becomes awkward to take action early next week due to the monthly MIPs executive. The weekly executive vote passes, and the USDC-A liquidation ratio is modified to 110%.  Raise the ETH-A Debt Ceiling July 27th - MIPs Executive - 27/07/20 On July 27th, the MIPs monthly governance cycle executive is due. Due to the increased demand for the ETH-A package, and on the recommendations of @Risk, @LongForWisdom makes the decision to bundle the ETH-A increase into the monthly MIPs executive. The reasons for which are described in the above thread.  Unscheduled Call and Debt Ceiling Raises July 29th - Emergency Peg Management Governance and Risk Meeting - Wednesday, July 29 6:00 PM UTC On July 29th, @LongForWisdom organises an unscheduled emergency peg management meeting after having a conversation with @cyrus, @rune and other members of the Maker Foundation. This meeting is meant to communicate and discuss stronger measures to control the peg with the community, specifically in relation to an emergency executive vote. The emergency executive goes live later that night. In addition, @Cyrus posts the following thread: [Discussion] Executive Vote to Raise ETH-A, USDC-A, USDC-B, W-BTC, BAT debt ceilings so that discussion can continue. The emergency executive passes and the following changes to the Maker Protocol take place:  ETH-A debt ceiling to be increased from 260 to 340 million. USDC-A debt ceiling to be increased from 80 to 140 million. USDC-B debt ceiling to be increased from 10 to 30 million. W-BTC debt ceiling to be increased from 20 to 40 million. BAT-A debt ceiling to be increased from 3 to 5 million.   Feel free to discuss the overall issue as responses to this thread. In addition, I\u2019d love to have feedback over whether this sort of summary is useful in order for people to keep track of events. Thanks! ",

I\u2019m sure there are other ideas floating around that haven\u2019t been discussed fully. Also, would there be any way to speed up the inclusion of new collateral types? I don\u2019t know what domain team\u2019s schedules are like, or if there\u2019s a way for us as a community to help speed things along in that regard. It seems like most of the greenlit collateral types are due in about 2 weeks. Even if we can\u2019t do anything about the current collateral in the pipeline, I think it\u2019s worth discussing ways to compress the process. I\u2019ve heard rumors of forming community-sourced domain teams, as a way of expanding our bandwidth here. It seems a serious bottleneck we have right now is in collateral onboarding, and I think most of us agree that\u2019s one of the best things we can do to help the peg. ",

I was thinking that we need to do two things.   Define what is the effect of compound mining on Maker and DAI.   My personal opinion is that this comp mining is draining DAI liquidity below 1.015.  It appears unwilling to pay 4% for additional liquidity.  The real effect is an upwards driver on the PEG which the community is having a hard time with.   Once we settle on the effect(s) then lets go over the real options on solutions many of which are nicely listed above.   I was starting some work on this but have not completed my thoughts. What we have from above.  Raise DC\u2019s USDC-A and ETH-A  (done) We raised USDC-A SF.   (done) PSM proposal (being discussed) Request compound governance exclude DAI from comp rewards (being discussed)  What we have not discussed.  Or are in beginnings of discussion  Maker governance minting DAI and purchasing assets with it - directly injecting DAI into markets by buying assets Possibly increasing wBTC DC Lowering fees on USDC and wBTC to elicit and measure increased use of facility or not. onboarding assets that might generate more use that may be sizable. negative rates. use of MKR in governance (i.e. new DSChief rewrite) allowing MKR deposited in the governance contract to mint DAI based on some reasonable assumptions i.e. to allow MKR in governace to be used like a vault.   This has significant implications but we depend on MKR to deal with shortfalls in the system why not use part of the marketcap to allow for DAI PEG operations by MKR holders but only through MKR deposited in governance. Anything I have NOT thought of in this list?  Additionally I have not seen any discussion regarding how much DAI might be required to drop the PEG to $1.   Lev and I think this number might be quite large (at least 100M DAI and possibly up to 500M DAI).    While this whole comp thing gives a stress test on the system regarding PEG managability generally I think looking at the effects and driving a general response that we can implement and use reasonably quickly is important.   Use the tools we have, increase liquidity, add new ones with some testing methodology and work on others that may require longer term discussion and work. So we really need to fall back on a measurement system and means of testing what we have done regarding effects (positive or negative) on the goal (PEG management). I think raising the DC\u2019s is the right move.  Increasing the USDC-A SF as a RP has not added more DAI.  3 and 4 above are still being discussed and (4) is not a general solution as there is no reason compound has to DO anything here at Maker request.    The rest are all ideas still needing vetting and discussion. ",

How much becomes a question how much would DAI have to grow to accomodate what is driving PEG off curently to maintain PEG of 1 is wholly open. My own analysis So if you look a this from a marketcap DAI perspective it is either 1/3 or less cap, (or over 3x more or less of current cap).  so 50-500M.   I loosened this personally to 100-500M because most minds I have spoken with on the issue say it \u2018could\u2019 be that large,  also that 50M might be enough - at least 50M would be a good start as an \u2018experiment\u2019.    So the above is \u2018how\u2019 I arrived at the numbers - independant of Lev. But generally discussed. The idea of how much DAI there has to be to keep PEG at 1 when we get drivers like 29%yr/yr return on 1B cap (may now be 10-15%).  Let put what we are dealing with in perspective.  Literally what compound was offering or IS is a 1yr payout 2x what the total DAI outstanding is (about 200-300M USD) and then making it so that current the comp farming game is slanted towards DAI.   How much DAI do we have to throw to sop up this problem.   100-500M - yeah maybe\u2026 ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ve been reading a lot of content here, and although I do not have the experience nor a full understanding of the system, I want to give my point of view of how I understand the situation (which might correspond to how others understand the situation, whether it is a correct understanding or not). Right now I have 32 ETH and 4000 USDC.  I can lend my 4000 USDC @1.78% and use them to borrow 2900 DAI @-2.30% NET APY is -0.50% + whatever value is earned in COMP (let\u2019s say anything >= 0), can be rounded to 20 USD / year. Now go on http://curve.fi and trade my 2900 DAI for 2950 USDC. I put those 2950 USDC is whatever lending platform gives me a decent APY but with the possibility of widthrawing them when I need. From there different things can happen : When DAI peg is back to 1.00 (ie: PSM is implemented), I widthdraw my 2950 USDC, exchange them for 2950 DAI on http://curve.fi, give back the borrowed 2900 DAI to Compound. I still made 50-20 = 30 DAI profit if it takes a year for DAI to be back to 1.00. At this point since I\u2019m not using my lent USDC as collateral anymore, I can go ahead and buy DAI at the 1.00 rate if I like DAI and/or want to speculate on a future 1.02. BEST CASE : 1-2% instant profit selling the borrowed DAI if DAI gets back to its peg + whatever lending rate for cUSD + whatever new farming stuff is out during the year. IF new rates suddenly make it expensive to keep borrowing DAI on Compound (> 4% net APY), and PSM is not yet implemented, I open a CDP using my 2950 USDC (SF 4%), use the output DAI to reimburse what I borrowed on Compound, unlocking my cUSDC and allowing to put more in the CDP until I reimbursed all the DAI. In this scenario I need the peg to be back to 1.00 in less than 6 months so I can buy the DAI back and close the CDP. Otherwise I\u2019ll start loosing money through the Stability Fee of 4%. WORSE CASE : 1-2% instant profit but then stuck with a CDP costing 4% per year (for current rates) if DAI never gets back to its peg. I can also use my 32 ETH instead (0% SF) but need to manage the vault proactively. (in those examples, replace Compound by Aave, Curve, or whatever is yet to come and will trigger irrationnal behavior*) In all cases, right now, I personnally find it more interesting to borrow on Compound than opening a CDP, although I do have USDC and ETH.  So I feel like people who have USDC and think DAI will be back to it\u2019s peg in 6 months or less.  Will borrow a bunch of DAI from Compound using USDC, sell the DAI @1.02-1.05 for USDC from the market to make immediate \u201cprofit\u201d : 2a. (no PSM, back to peg) Will massively buy DAI back from the market @1.00 against their USDC. 2b. (PSM, back to peg) Will massively buy DAI back from PSM @1.00 against their USDC. 2c. (no PSM, DAI not back to peg, Compound interest rates > 4%) Will massively open a bunch of USDC-A or ETH-A CDPs.  Do you think those scenario are plausible ? If not, what am I missing ? If yes, what do you think the effets would be for DAI and MKR for 2b and 2c ? It looks like 2a. is a paradox, because a DAI back to its peg is a DAI people want to buy rather than borrow which means a DAI above 1.00 (demand > offer). It looks like 2b means a massive amount of USDC flowing into the PSM and most people keeping DAI (at least that what I would do. I like DAI. I want so many DAI). I am not sure to understand the consequences of 2c (if any). @befitsandpiper I would be interested to know about your projections about the but it is likely to ultimately destroy them. Although I would intuitively agree with you, I think it would be productive to imagine the actual scenario of how that could happen. In the stock markets, a famous saying is that The market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent!. Since I don\u2019t think the crypto market is more rational than the stock market, with what degree of certainty do you think the current situation is temporary ? And what type of information/experience apart from intuition do you use for that statement ? Just trying to understand things here. ",

This would require lots of external capital entering COMP which is possible but it would be irrational since it would be like buying a bond with a large double digit negative rate. The liquidity entering Compound right now also is not going to stay after rates normalize, since actors in the defi space are fickle and will just move on to the next platform offering the best rates. The incredible thing to me is that anyone is buying COMP at all, but I guess that speaks to \u201cThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d. ",

Then wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to wonder if this next platform will allow to borrow DAI for a net yearly fee < 4% ? Because as far as I understand one of the aspects of the problem, if I have only USDC right now I borrow DAI in Compound cheaper than I can mint them with Oasis. Even Avlend is still competitive if you lend USDC and borrow DAI. Or is the fact that people won\u2019t mint on Oasis anymore irrelevant ? ",

This is the crux of the issue and I believe MKR holders need to address it face-on instead of hoping the problem blows over eventually. My suggestion is that Maker decides to compete with Compound (and soon to be Aave and the other Ethereum lending protocols) by sweetening the pot by offering some MKR tokens with loans. I am not sure how Maker can survive in the long run without keeping its existing customers and adding new ones. How much will MKR be worth in the scenario where rates are pegged at zero and vaults dwindle over time, not to mention the peg issue which just gets more and more severe if that happens?

All of them add some risks of course, but keeping those for 1 - 2 weeks shouldn\u2019t be that big of an issue. If we manage to solve the issues surrounding TUSD, specially after the good response received from TrustToken in https://forum.makerdao.com/t/tusd-update-trusttoken-response-to-implementation-concerns/3407/11 plus onboarding others stablecoins as collateral, we could reduce the risk of having only USDC  for this  10x leverage process (which is IMO, the best process in existence to keep the 1:1 PEG).

Having a more diverse set of stablecoins would make >50% stablecoin supply a little easier to stomach. We\u2019re already at ~23% total supply and these are important questions we need to start asking ourselves. There\u2019s no price risk vulnerability in usdc like with eth for the Debt ceiling, so we should decide what percent of total supply in usdc we\u2019re willing to stomach, and just raise the debt ceiling all the way to that level. We can bundle in raising other debt ceilings on collateral types so that the next time we have to raise usdc, we will have a little more room still. ",

                    "content": "I am trying to think about this situation a little more holistically. Obviously there is massive demand in the Ethereum ecosystem for stable coins. There is near $13B in stable coins issued on blockchains, and the vast majority of that is on Ethereum. Even though DAI is a relatively small part of that, it is arguably the most in demand. Money markets have significantly higher interest rates for DAI compared to other stable coin and it is considered safer than fiat backed coins due to its decentralized nature. People seem willing to pay a 2-3% premium for this and no other widespread stable coin fetches a premium (in fact the largest one is consistently traded at a discount). DeFi systems are incentivizing DAI as collateral over other stable coins and are consuming more than 90% of the supply just as collateral, even though there is a premium. Despite the amount of DAI that is being minted recently, very little of this is going into normal circulation, so it is doing little to help stabilize the peg. Interesting to me is that of course these DeFi systems have full access to ETH as collateral as well. And while they do use this to some small degrees, there is apparently not much borrow demand for it, so it is not incentivized as collateral. There is obviously work required to create a system to convert ETH value -> USD and maintain that system. Then there is ongoing risk due to volatility, etc. All this means that these systems are willing to pay a premium for Maker to supply this conversion for them so that they can focus on the finance aspect of the business. This is great for Maker long term. In an ideal environment, we would be charging a stability fee for the risks Maker is taking. And we are for some assets, but not for our primary asset ETH because we are trying to scale the supply side faster. But the simple fact is that we are not meeting the demand for DAI, and likely are not even close to doing so since it is probably a number somewhere in the billions. This is a cautious approach since we are more focused on mitigating risk than supplying product, which I think is fair given the nature of the system in its immature state. If we mis-judge the risk, the system can quickly become insolvent and worthless. I would encourage people to think about this from a different direction though. Hypothetically, lets say we were to completely remove all the debt ceilings tomorrow. What risk parameters would we want in place in order to do this? Debt ceilings are the training wheels in our system - we are using them to ensure that any mistakes we make are limited. It is a smart move for a new system. However, we need to move in a direction where the risk parameters and the demand from the market are the determining factors in how much DAI is in circulation. IMO these parameters are clearly not set correctly for most of our assets and we are instead relying on the debt ceilings to manage risk. However, until we can remove the debt ceilings and allow the market to work, the peg will never fully stabilize. ",
