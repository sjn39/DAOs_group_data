                    "content": " MIP49: Staking Rewards  Preamble MIP#: 49 Title: Staking Rewards Author(s): Payton Rose (@prose11), Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut) Contributors:@LongForWisdom, @juan, @Elihu Type: General Status: Rejected Date Proposed: 2021-02-03 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: Replaces:   References  The initial idea for Staking Rewards can be found in this forum post    Sentence Summary MIP49 proposes the creation of Staking Rewards that would allow the Maker community to reward MKR holders for locking their MKR tokens in Governance.  Paragraph Summary This MIP covers the creation of a Staking Rewards process for MKR token holders, designed to distribute DAI as a percentage of protocol profits. MIP49 would entitle MKR holders to a share of this percentage based on the weight of their MKR staked in the Governance Contract. The implementation method is intentionally left open so that the protocol can adopt a more efficient method of distributing rewards, should one be developed.  Component Summary MIP49c1: Staking Rewards Structure Defines the scope of Staking Rewards. MIP49c2: Adjusting the Staking Reward Percentage Parameter Clarifies how changes may be made to the Stake Reward Percentage parameter. MIP49c3: Potential Risks Defines potential avenues for abuse that should be considered if Staking Rewards are enabled.  Motivation The main motivation for this proposal is to help secure the MakerDAO Protocol. The amount of MKR available to borrow on the open market remains a security concern. MKR token borrowers do not have economically aligned incentives with the Maker Protocol, and represent a danger even if there is not enough MKR available on the lending markets to pass a malicious action. By offering incentives to MKR holders who lock their MKR tokens in Governance, this proposal hopes to encourage MKR holders to participate in securing the protocol. The following outcomes are also expected:  It should provide a more direct value accrual mechanism compared to the burner by distributing assets to MKR holders engaged in Governance. It should encourage more members to participate in the governance process, as the opportunity cost from locking MKR tokens is reduced. It should act as a partial subsidy to the gas cost of participating in Maker Governance.   Specification / Proposal Details MIP49c1 - Staking Rewards Structure Staking Rewards will be \u201copt-in\u201d. Users locking their MKR tokens in governance will be able to choose to either receive Staking Rewards or not. The Staking Rewards will be distributed in DAI. The amount of DAI distributed as Staking Rewards will be directly tied to the MKR burn, with a portion of DAI that would have been used to buyback and burn MKR being diverted to Staking Rewards. The percentage of funds redirected will be controlled by Governance and referred to as the Stake Reward Percentage parameter. Proceeds from the Stake Reward Percentage will be split among opted-in holders, based on their relative weight in the Governance Contract. Note: MKR holders should be aware of any tax and legal implications in their jurisdiction relevant to opting-in to Staking Rewards before electing to do so. MIP49c2: Adjusting the Staking Reward Percentage Parameter The Stake Reward Percentage parameter will be expressed a percentage, between 0 and 100, and will dictate what percentage of funds otherwise destined for the flapper (surplus auction) will be instead spent on Staking Rewards. For example, if Governance were to set Stake Reward Percentage to 25%, for every 100 DAI the protocol generates when the Surplus Buffer is full, 25 DAI would be diverted to reward MKR tokens staked in the Governance Contract. Adjustments to the Stake Reward Percentage parameter may be made through the Weekly Governance Cycle, allowing for the community to respond quickly to changing market conditions. MIP49c3 - Potential Risks Directly rewarding locked MKR in the governance contract introduces risks to the Maker Protocol that have the potential to result in a protocol shutdown or a fork in certain scenarios. At the time of writing, actively-voting MKR comes to at most 10% of the total vote weight. The introduction of voting rewards encourages more MKR to be locked in the governance contract, which in turn reduces the barrier for that MKR to vote. If enough MKR becomes active in governance solely due to the staking reward incentive, this introduces the risk of successful proposals that increase the staking reward beyond what is beneficial for the Maker Protocol in pursuit of immediate, short-term gain for MKR Holders. This outcome could happen gradually or more quickly, and could take a number of forms. It is strongly recommended that MKR Holders that wish to ensure the long term growth and stability of the Maker Protocol view the following types of proposal with skepticism:  Proposals that increase the percentage of surplus revenue that is diverted from MKR burn to Staking Rewards. Proposals that seek to detach Staking Rewards from the surplus revenue generated by the MKR Protocol. Proposals that mint MKR for distribution as Staking Rewards. Proposals that by other means increase Staking Rewards in an inflationary way.  It is essential that the Staking Reward mechanism maintains the incentive alignment between MKR Holders receiving the reward, passive MKR Holders and the Maker Protocol as a whole. ",

There are a lot of potential implications so I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of myself and start throwing out numbers that may or may not make sense by the time we are able to implement them. With that said, the general discussion has been around utilizing something like the Keg to stream rewards based on a percent of the \u201cprofit\u201d (really excess revenue to operational actions) that would otherwise be headed to the Flapper. With the intention that the rate is proportional to the amount of MKR on the borrow markets. That way when the Hat is potentially vulnerable (ie there\u2019s a lot of MKR out there to borrow from) MKR holders are fiscally encouraged to deposit their tokens in governance, and that incentive would decrease as the MKR on the borrow markets dried up. All just hypothetical at this point, but I thought that was a good question and that it might inform votes to know how this is being thought of in terms of utilization. ",

Are these paid by MakerDAO? Is this really scalable? One of the reasons for the MKR-burning mechanism was gas efficiency\u2026  Tax-efficiency. As you observe, there are some countries where these rewards could be taxed (more than the MKR burning mechanism). It seems kind of unfair to design rewards if we know from the beginning that they will not be very valuable in certain countries.  Regarding both (1) and (2): might it be possible, instead, to give MKR-holders other types of incentives (and not streamed DAI?) One thing that @SebVentures has proposed a few times (in a different context) are, e.g., MKR CALL options (e.g., \"MakerDAO gives you the possibility of buying 1MKR for 1600usd in the next 24 months). These CALL options might be redeemable by the user (so that they pay the fees, not MakerDAO) so this would fix problem (1). Question for our american friends (@flipflopflapdelegate): how would this Call Options distribution work tax-wise (point 2)? Thanks again! ",

Nevertheless, the proposal is well written and might solve the problem without modifying a core component of Maker which is always a good thing.

I kind of agree with this, honestly. Now even setting up a wallet for voting costs >300usd in gas fees. Crazy. Something that could be done cheaply in the short term is an initiative (just like Sourcecred) of the following type:  Governance devotes a certain amount of DAI/month to incentives The DAIs are periodically (e.g., once/month, just like SourceCred now) manually sent to the addresses of the MKR holders in the form a xDAI (i.e., on the xDAI chain).  Gas fees on xDAI or in the order of 0.00001 usd. ",

To me, this is a proposal about keeping the protocol safer and allowing reasonable incentivizes to aid to that end. With that said, I would like to move this MIP forward as soon as possible provided the community thinks it will add to the security of the protocol. So are there parts of this MIP that you think need to be edited to safeguard  the protocol? Are there changes I can make that could ease the perceived tax burden of the Rewards? Basically I would like to put this MIP forward in the next monthly Governance cycle and I\u2019m wondering if there are edits I could make to improve it during its RFC period, or perhaps some changes that would make the MIP more palatable for those unsure. Either way would love some feedback, so thanks for the engagement! ",

NikKunkel:  I really disagree in general with the intent to push through this half-baked idea without the community having reached any consensus on the specifics of the implementation. This proposal needs A LOT of work before it should be inserted into the governance cycle. There\u2019s basically no details at all and just some hand-wavy stuff about governance rewards.   The idea has been discussed for over a month. The MIP lays out the structure of the rewards fairly clearly:  Governance Rewards will be \u201copt-in\u201d. Users locking their MKR tokens in governance will be able to choose to either receive Governance Rewards or not. The Governance Rewards will be distributed in DAI.   \u2026a portion of DAI that would have been used to buyback and burn MKR being diverted to Governance Rewards. It will be up to Maker Governance to determine the percentage of surplus revenue to be set for rewards\u2026  The MIP should be more explicit on how those rewards are divided between \u2018opt-ins\u2019. I think the default assumption is \u2018pro rata based on the MKR amount\u2019. But it would be good to state that. This MIP could be accompanied by a technical MIP which defines an implementation, but there is some question over whether that is necessary in this case, it is not a core part of the Maker Protocol, and would pose no technical risk to the protocol beyond a loss of the funds governance diverts to it (so we would obviously start with a test amount). The diversion of FLAP funds is covered by the FlapTap contract defined in the Keg MIPs. My understanding is that @hexonaut has written / adapted a contract to handle the actual distribution of funds based on staked IOU tokens. Saying \u2018this needs a lot of work\u2019 and accusing the author of \u2018the intent to push through this half-baked idea\u2019 when they just opted not to formally submit it for March and then providing no feedback on the content is unlikely to lead to constructive discussion. I feel like you could have presented your point more diplomatically. If you have input over what we should be doing differently to incentivise MKR Holders to secure the Maker Protocol and participate in governance, I\u2019d love to hear it. ",

Incentivized voting does not work well in either field, and the problem only grows worse as complexity is ratcheted up. The reward from voting is too low to incentivize someone who was not previously interested to spend the time to learn about the issues, and the reward doesn\u2019t require it. You just have to vote. It\u2019s as easy as pulling a lever. The voter\u2019s paradox (Paradox of voting - Wikipedia) could also be discussed here, as the issue is similar in nature. An informed vote takes work, and paying someone to vote will not result in more informed votes, but rather just more votes. If the goal is just more votes then I guess it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re dumb votes. However, this problem actually gets worse. These uninformed voters will simply take the path of least resistance by following friends or thought leaders. Half the reason the ethereum community goes with whatever Vitalik says is because 95% of ethereum users can\u2019t understand any of the concepts he\u2019s discussing. They know he is smart and will follow him, right or wrong. I\u2019d prefer not to introduce this issue into the MakerDAO community. All of that is to say, this makes the complicated MakerDAO system perhaps the worst place for this. I would highly recommend pursuing a different path to get more MKR in the voting contract. Top of the mind suggestions would be board of director elections, voting proxies, and the ability to vote from my mobile wallet for the MKR that\u2019s on my hardware wallet. As an aside, I had my MKR in during 2017 or 2018, when the bug was discovered in the contract. I decided since then that my sub 100 MKR would never matter in votes and the risk of smart contract bugs was too great for no reward. A few hundred bucks is not going to change that calculus if you truly believe in the potential of MakerDAO. ",

Those who don\u2019t know enough, or have not enough time to follow, should just delegate their MKR to other more active voters, and be rewarded for such delegation.

I would highly recommend pursuing a different path to get more MKR in the voting contract.   I mostly agree, but it\u2019s important to understand that this proposal is not paying people to vote, it\u2019s paying people to have MKR in the governance contract. They do not need to vote to get the rewards. A nice side-effect is that people who do vote can cover some of their gas costs, but we\u2019d be providing the reward regardless of whether people vote.     Replenish2030:  That being said, a simple voting rewards solution that takes a small % of burn and helps incentivize voting directly or delegating like what is being proposed here - seems like an easy win.   Again, it\u2019s really important to understand that we aren\u2019t incentivising voting. We are subsiding voting (rewards will subsidise gas costs for those that choose to vote), but voting is not a requirement to get the rewards under the proposed structure.  I 100% agree that delegation is the key to long-term improvements in governance. That is planned in the form of DssGov, and once we get closer to the release, GovAlpha will share more of our thoughts on how to ensure that delegation is as effective as it can be. ",

I will spend some time conceptualizing a framework that could incentivize better voting, although it sounds like I was off the mark in understanding this proposal, as further discussed below. Perhaps it\u2019s not needed anyways. Regarding the proposal not being about voting: we should make this clear then. It\u2019s not a \u201cgovernance reward\u201d but rather a \u201cstaking reward.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar enough concept in crypto, as we all know. Plus it\u2019s trendy. Maybe MakerDAO will get on one of those cool DeFi yield farm leaderboards next to the sushi thing and pancake stack. Since the contract is being overhauled regardless, I wonder if some of this yield could also come from sources beyond the dai stability fee. Could the millions of dollars worth of MKR just chilling in the contract be deposited into a special Aave contract that allows no borrowing of the MKR (thereby mitigating the risk this proposal is intended to address), but enables the MKR governance contract to take out a small loan to generate returns staking stablecoins on Curve? I know that\u2019s not a fair or light ask of the devs, but I thought I would suggest it since we discussing options. Overall, the fact that voting is not being incentivized makes me less worried about this proposal, although I do wonder what level of income would be needed to have a meaningful reduction in the amount of MKR being loaned out. I also worry that there will be an increase in uninformed voters regardless. It\u2019s also worth pointing out this entire thread seems to have been confused on what action is being rewarded here. Thanks everyone for your time and hard work. This is why this community is so great. ",

Some considerations:  The current MKR burning model was conceived as a ethereum-fees efficient way to provide dividends to the MKR holders. With L2 solutions coming to fruition, this burning model might become not necessary anymore. We could just distribute DAIs directly (I am not saying we necessarily should, but its a possibility that was not available 1 year ago). Similarly, we might decide to only reward MKR-holders who deposit their MKR in the voting contract (voting is not necessary). Only these MKR holders are given dividends. Everybody is free receive the dividends, or lend/use their MKR elsewhere. Currently MakerDAO makes >100m USD/year in profits. Let\u2019s even assume 80m USD/year are used for salaries/growth. This leaves 20m DAI for dividends/year. Currently only about 25% of all MKR are deposited in the voting contract. I think there is ample space for interesting dividend schemes to be done here.  Just for reference: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ko/dividend-history MakerDAO can do even better than CocaCola, but it is also growing like crazy. ",

                    "content": "Curious to get people\u2019s thoughts here as to the benefit of adding a proposal to be paired with this MIP. As stated, this MIP was written based off of @hexonaut\u2019s awesome work on this forum post. I\u2019m toying with the idea of a subproposal, or at least accompanying plan being posted along the MIP. Would be especially valuable to hear from people like @NikKunkel that felt this draft is lacking specificity. Basically this MIP was designed to lay a few ground rules and ultimately let the community decide what the best way of distributing Governance Rewards is from an informed prospective. Fundamentally, this is more about the security of the protocol than paying dividends. If there is a less contentious way of motivating more MKR to enter governance I\u2019m happy to pursue that. But I will say the reason I like the idea of this MIP (especially paired with Sam\u2019s implementation) is that it offers incentives to protect the protocol while naturally encouraging users to engage with Governance. In this way the implementation has the opportunity to better secure the hat while beginning to address the \u201cfree-rider\u201d issue of MKR governance. My main issue at this point is I still don\u2019t know what changes would be worthwhile to this MIP, as much of the objections ring true no matter what method we use to incentivize placing MKR into Governance. So if anyone interested in this thread has the time to address some of the following questions it would help me out a lot:  Would adding subproposal/linked forum post explaining how Sam\u2019s DssGovRewards could be utilized with this MIP make it better? What ways could we reduce the implied tax burden of such incentives to most jurisdictions? How specifically should earning rewards proportions be discussed? (It was my view that being vague here was best as it would offer the community the ability to decide between a wide array of options from Savings Lottery type distributions to direct proportional accrual, does the community want options in the future?) Are there community members that would be interested in having a workshop session to discuss potential edits (real-time or de-sync)?  ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ve been following the Maker governance for weeks now.This proposal is very interesting because it finally strives to move away from the Buyback & Burn model for MKR, which works well in theory (over decades maybe) and awful in practice. Maker has one of the most astounding money generating tools in DeFi, yet somehow its token is teribly aligned with growth. MKR burning does nothing to improve the price, because the project is far from having critical mass and global adoption. At the scae in the next several years the burning may decrease the supply by 2-5% per year at best. This is quite negligible and does not have the desired supply/demand effect for the long-term MKR holders. For short term (6 months to a year) it does not matter at all. And if it does not matter in a raging bull market, ask yourself how it will be in the upcoming bear market. In my view a Buyback and Stake model would work much better. Take a look at Aave tokenomics for reference. The governance rewards the holders for safe-keeping the protocol. MKR holders already incur this risk. But are they rewarded? Theoretically through burning, but practically not. The stability fees provide almost insignificant practical incentives for active governance and protocol safe-keeping. The people who have been participating actively so far without direct payment are truly deserving of better treatment and I applaud the professionalism and due diligence in keeping DAI stable. With a Buyback and Stake model, MKR would be bought on Uniswap and other DEXes at a higher market price, by 5-10% higher. The acquired MKR would then be distributed to MKR governance who stake MKR and actively participate in governance. Thus no inflation occurs and at the same time it creates positive price feedback loops in the markets if done at regular intervals, for example once every 2 weeks. Traders will expect this buying pressure and will sell rather to the protocol at higher prices than to one another as they do now. At about 120 million DAI annualized even 5 million DAI worth of buybacks every 2 weeks will push the price upwards in a healthy way. The sentiment around MKR will change significantly in a positive way. In the last few years it has been horrendous and it is not much better now, being so utterly undervalued at 2 billion DAY marketcap. And if you worry about your local taxes, well what is better - to receive most of the rewards or nothing at all? ",

I assume you are referring to the price of MKR which has not kept pace with the success of the Maker ecosystem. The price of MKR, as with all things traded freely, is determined by supply and demand. I will assume you are aware of the term supply/demand balance. In the case of Maker we are in a bit of a pinch at the moment. Due to concerns about regulations and how/if these will impact Maker, the foundation that up until now has governed Maker never did any marketing of the MKR token. There were never any marketing, ICO, airdrops, incentive period - nothing. Only a low number of sales through channels you had to work at how to find, later a pioneering dex. End result is that the MKR token is largely unknown to crypto outside of the circle of stablecoin enthusiasts. And the supply? The basic problem was that starting DeFi summer some of the largest holders decided Maker was boring compared to LP tokens and NFTs. So they started selling just as the crypto market started booming. According to some estimates about 20% of total supply was sold starting in August 2020. The resulting supply/demand balance for MKR is then a high number of tokens sold into a market that does not have widespread knowledge or incentive to buy. While this goes on airdrops, LPs and degen financing steals all attention. The net result is what you see reflected in the poor price of MKR, which has a Price/Earnings ratio of a mediocre real world tech company, completely ignoring the explosive pace of growth. This is partly the reason to be cautious about any MKR minting program as you would just add supply to a market with very limited demand. Moving to a Buyback & Stake model (or any other model) will not fix this. What will fix it is waving goodbye to the foundation, start governing as a community and telling the whole world of the string of successes achieved. Just spreading knowledge of the pace of DAI growth will interest anyone with even a normal sense of greed. This fixes the demand side. The supply side fixes itself as whales eventually run out of MKR to sell. ",

                    "content": "I generally agree with your post @mahu_victor. The burning model makes a lot of rational sense in the very long term, but this does not mean it is efficient now. For instance, we haven\u2019t been burning for months now, and we plan not to burn for several more (due to the surplus buffer increase, which is a good move). I agree in particular with:     mahu_victor:  And if you worry about your local taxes, well what is better - to receive most of the rewards or nothing at all?   I frankly think these tax consideration should be ignored in governance. First, the taxation is different in many countries. For example, in several EU countries, DAI dividends and/or crypto (including stablecoins) trading are not taxed; what is taxed is only the \u2018final\u2019 event of selling for FIAT. In Malta, crypto is not taxed at all. Second, MakerDAO is an international (since decentralised) organisation, it should not make critical strategic decisions only based on the laws of a given country (even if this country is of critical importance, like the USA). Third, as always proposed, the DAI-rewards would be opt-in. So everybody is free to make their own calculations and evaluate between DAI rewards and other options (e.g., Aave, collateral for farming, just hold, etc).     Planet_X:  Moving to a Buyback & Stake model (or any other model) will not fix this. What will fix it is waving goodbye to the foundation, start governing as a community and telling the whole world of the string of successes achieved.   I agree with this too. But I personally would be even happier if, in conjunction with what you said, I could receive a daily stream of DAI from staking my MKR. ",

The short update is that a new draft will be published (shooting for this coming Monday). The name will be changed to \u201cStaking Rewards\u201d and I\u2019ll likely be making a new thread to discuss the latest version. Huge thanks to @hexonaut who has been sitting on the DssGovRewards code for a while and has been patiently waiting and working with me to get this MIP into formal submission. The main difference with the forthcoming draft (besides the rebranding) will be giving governance a parameter to set that determines what percentage of the funds otherwise going to the flapper (MKR buyback/burn) will be directed to Staking Rewards. Any last calls for tweaks to make this more tax efficient/ better defined  would be welcomed! ",

This has two pluses.  People who are delegates and/or active in the forums are encouraged to sign up for SC rewards (or opt out) Bundling DAI payments into a monthly stream.  Some ideas to consider for the future  coupling governance rewards with SC payments on a monthly schedule might be warranted from a main net fee standpoint. Having a payout opting in to receive these say on (L2/sidechain) might generally save on distribution costs. Having an option on this compensation to receive in DAI (on L2/sidechain), MKR, or ETH on mainnet as well as a means to set a payment schedule(monthly, quarterly, yearly, or on signal) might be useful as well.  As to call options - if these are under market it is cap/gain or income.  If the strike is above price I think only tax consequences are if they are exercised because the options are not \u2018free money\u2019.   But I am not a tax expert. Be nice if these DAI payouts could be streamed to the debt owed in a vault (reducing the interest - unclear to me whether these are considered payments then or simply interest reduction). I would love to hear about some tax delayed option but being one who is paying taxes on DAI revenue from last year it is a whatever.   You know these rewards could also be \u2018donated\u2019 into some kind of fund that could be used by a \u2018governance group\u2019 to persue governance interests\u2026 All off the top of my head here. Something I like is that these rewards come from DAI that would be sent to burn MKR to keep interests aligned.  IMO.  I think some of the key times to have governance participation is when the protocol is losing money or stressed.   This to me indicates a suggestion to taking some small % of the surplus change and setting it aside in a governance rewards buffer and adjusting rewards upward when burn occurs, and downward to some minimum when it doesn\u2019t and just making sure this has funds to operate.

Sam wrote the code for implementing the rewards based on Uni\u2019s reward program, which does allow users to claim their tokens at their discretion. However, worth noting that depending on your tax jurisdiction, this may not help with taxes, as you have the ability to claim at anytime.   W/ staking rewards, voting on something in particular is not what\u2019s being rewarded, so I would expect the opposite to be the concerning vector. Basically since people are incentivized to lock their tokens in governance (doesn\u2019t matter which hat), they could leave them there unattended, making it harder to pass new execs. But IMO, we already have a problem with that (just take a scroll through old hats on vote.makerdao.com), and it is unlikely staking rewards would increase that problem by a meaningful magnitude. To the extent that it might, we are also in the process of sorting out delegation (which would hopefully come together not long after Staking Rewards, if the community were to support both) and thus ease the worries of idle MKR causing difficulty with passing new execs.   Let me know if that doesn\u2019t cover what you wanted it to, happy to give more detail or explain my reasoning further! ",

So I definitely like the idea of time locking, and it is possible this would circumvent some tax liability in certain jurisdictions. However, I think there would be some Governance concerns to doing so. In particular upgrading the Governance contract, and preventing people from being able to call an emergency shutdown when needed come to mind.

I believe I\u2019m explaining that correctly, but will go ahead and tag @LongForWisdom to make sure. Essentially, from a Governance prospective we would be ready to start with any plan that doesn\u2019t change the protocol code. I just tried to be explicit in the drafting (with linking the post) and discussion that Sam\u2019s code would be the one we use at the start, without making this a technical MIP since it does not rely on changing any protocol code.

The DSR is a different animal though \u2013 no pooling,  no custody,  no fractionalized lending and no other behavior that draws regulatory ire. The naming \u2013 Dai SAVINGS Rate \u2013 is unfortunate because of its banking connotation but perhaps a rebrand would be in order,  though I acknowledge how difficult that would be on the marketing side. Then again it doesn\u2019t matter all that much given Dai demand. But I believe it can be a major differentiator vis-a-vis competitors down the road. ",

Not all of the world follows US-rules. As Rune said in the chat a few times, we should keep diversifying our offer(s) in several countries/legislations. ",
