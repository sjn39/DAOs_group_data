Paragraph Summary MIP90 onboards a DAI 600MM RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 600MM of diversified, AAA (or equivalent) rated Structured Credit and Money Market Funds. All investments will be sourced on the open market in arms-length, competitive processes through investment banks and/or broker-dealers. At the end of every quarter, the vault will remit collected interest proceeds to MakerDAO to provide current cash flow to bolster the Surplus Buffer. Principal proceeds generated from AAA Structured Credit positions will be reinvested, until Maker governance has passed an executive vote to trigger a liquidation of the portfolio. The portfolio will maintain an opportunistic balance of short duration fixed rate Structured Credit, floating rate Structured Credit, and Money Market Funds to ensure that the collective portfolio strikes the right balance of yield generation and liquidity.  Component Summary MIP90c1: Summary of Terms & Transaction Details MIP90c2: Collateral Overview MIP90c3: Legal & Transactional Structure MIP90c4: Technical & Onboarding Considerations  Motivation MIP90 achieves the following goals for Maker:  Generates interest income and principal gains to grow Maker\u2019s Surplus Buffer. Provide a liquid, diversified investment profile well aligned with Maker\u2019s liquidity needs. Diversify Maker\u2019s existing base of fixed income holdings with floating and fixed rate Structured Credit. Establish the operational and legal infrastructure required to successfully integrate with the liquid fixed income ecosystem.   BlockTower Credit BlockTower Credit (\u201cBT\u201d) is an institutional investment fund, applying the skills of professional underwriting, structuring and investing at the intersection of real-world credit (a strong but anachronistic traditional industry) and crypto. BlockTower Credit is the credit franchise of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital asset and blockchain investment firm founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO). The firm manages well over half a billion dollars and draws from decades of combined experience across professional investing and trading, early-stage venture capital, and credit. BlockTower Credit principals, Kevin Miao and Jack Carlisle, have a deep history of investing in Structured Credit. Kevin ran a Structured Credit trading division as a Vice President at Citigroup, managing a ~$2bn combined book across all asset classes. Jack previously covered secondary trading in Asset Backed Securities, CLOs, Agency CMBS securities, and Legacy CDOs as a Senior Investment Analyst and Trader at Hildene Capital Management. Together with BlockTower, we bring decades worth of experience in Structured Credit markets.

MIP90c2.1: Structured Credit The total outstanding size of the Structured Finance Market is $13.8 trillion today. Structured Credit represents the slice of the pie that sits away from government sponsored entities.  779\u00d7318 58.5 KB  *SIFMA  MIP90c2.1.1: Structured Credit - AAA Overview Structured Credit creates the financial backbone for the consumer, residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, and sub-investment grade corporate finance industries. Unlike a Fortune 500 business, a single consumer loan or mortgage is hard to analyze and exposed to certain binary risks. A large pool of loans, however, creates diversification benefits that eliminate binary risks and allows for statistical analysis. Structured products leverage the predictability that comes with scale and create debt tranches that distill the loan pool into different risk / reward slices to meet the wants and needs of various capital market participants (banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, etc.). Simply put, Structured Credit takes raw loans with no liquidity, combines them into a vehicle with bespoke risk tranching, and creates new securities with greater liquidity than the original underlying loans. Each corner of Structured Credit has different nuances and loss protections tailored to effectively insulate the AAA, and other senior tranches, from potential losses. As a rule, though, cashflows generated by underlying assets are applied sequentially (paying down the most senior tranches first) and losses are borne in reverse sequential order (bottom tranches take losses first).  894\u00d7370 50.8 KB  For a slightly deeper dive on the allocation of cashflows, the following are key protections available for the benefit of senior tranches:  Overcollateralization: Junior tranches provide first-loss protection for underlying credit losses. Excess Spread: The interest proceeds generated by loans is typically more than what is needed to pay the interest on debt tranches in a securitization. The spread between the two is used to repay principal on the AAA tranche in the event of underlying loan deterioration. Liquidation: If underlying performance deteriorates beyond a structure\u2019s pre-determined loss limits, a senior tranche maintains the right to liquidate the underlying loans and sell them on the open market. Proceeds from the loan sales are used to redeem the AAA position.  Existing protections have been tested through multiple cycles and have consistently offered ample buffer to downside scenarios. CLOs, for instance, first entered the market in the 1990\u2019s and no CLO AAA has ever taken a principal loss. Indicative Structured Credit AAA Return Profile: Below are spreads and all in yields observed in recent market conditions:  Source: Bloomberg, TRACE a/o 10/13/22 Liquidity Profile: AAA Structured Credit Roughly ~$430bn (FINRA, TRACE) Structured Credit bonds trade on the secondary market every year. The total outstanding amount of Structured Credit bonds today is roughly ~$2.9tln (SIMFA). The AAA segment of the capital structure is the most liquid part of the capital structure with a wide range of market participants (banks, insurance companies, asset managers, etc.) actively buying and selling risk. The short duration risk remote nature of AAA securities provides relative insulation from mark-to-market volatility; investors have appetite for this risk profile across different market conditions.  MIP90c2.1.2: Example Structured Credit Investment - CLO AAA CLOs, short for Collateralized Loan Obligations, are Structured Credit vehicles that pool together senior secured loans issued by sub-investment grade American corporations. CLOs were first issued in 1994; there has have been over $500 billion in total issuance volume since inception. Of the total issuance to date, less than 1% of all deals have ever entered an Event of Default. A differentiating feature of CLOs is that they are actively managed vehicles. Teams of professional asset managers oversee the underlying loan portfolio and actively trade underlying loans to protect the interests of investors. Both underlying loans and rated AAA tranches are floating rate, which significantly limits interest rate risk and mark-to-market risk for investors. Should interest rates rise, so too does the monthly interest rate that an investor receives on his/her position. Please see here to read more about CLOs. For an in-depth example of CLO AAA investments, see here.  MIP90c2.1.3: Example Structured Credit Investment \u2013 Prime Auto ABS AAA Prime Auto ABS securitizations pool together consumer auto loans backed by high quality, prime credit American consumers. The typical auto loan is five years in term, fully amortizing, and collateralized by an automobile. Unlike CLOs, Auto ABS deals are unmanaged and there is no option to trade underlying loans or reinvest loan proceeds upon repayment. This profile makes for short duration, fully amortizing AAA positions. For an in-depth example of Prime Auto ABS AAA investments, see here.  MIP90c2.2: Money Market Funds Money Market Funds are fixed income mutual funds that invest in short duration debt securities with minimal credit risk. Money Market Funds typically invest in a mix of US treasuries, Certificates of Deposit, Commercial Paper, Banker\u2019s Acceptances, and Repurchase Agreements. Money Market Funds are risk remote with minimal mark-to-market volatility. Today, most Money Market funds yield between 2.5% and 3.25%.  MIP90c3: Legal & Transactional Structure BlockTower as an arranger has engaged seasoned and trustworthy legal counsel and Maker core contributors to understand the regulatory landscape and establish legal structure to enable and protect Maker in real-world asset transactions. We will also be leveraging lessons from our Arranger proposals and existing deals, like MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale and MIP6: Huntingdon Valley Bank, in finalizing our legal structure. The exact legal structure to implement MIP90 will be determined and shared after the initial approval of this MIP.  MIP90c4: Technical & Onboarding Considerations The technical implementation will follow specifications defined in MIP21. The smart contracts have been used in prior transactions. We will work with Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001) and the community to ensure best practices around wallet security and separation, transparency, and auditability are followed in the implementation of MIP90.

For added context here, this proposal is a response to both MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent \u2013 Invest in short-term bonds and related conversations with the Maker community. BlockTower is focused on investing in safe, short duration credit to help diversify the PSM and generate yield for the surplus buffer. Below are our responses the questions that you listed above.   This proposal is only contemplating the purchase of extremely safe, short duration structured products securities. This low risk/return profile is optimal for Maker\u2019s risk and liquidity needs, but the risk/return profile is too safe for BlockTower LPs.   We address this in the above post, please refer to this link to better understand CLO downside protection and this link to better understand auto ABS downside protection. Auto ABS and CLOs have been through recessionary environments in the past and AAA tranches have continually proven to be well insulated from credit losses.   While we believe that these investment profiles have ample protected, the roll of actively managing investments does not require \u201cno action.\u201d Because this vault will be actively investing in short duration securities, BlockTower will constantly need to reinvest repaid proceeds into new securities. The job of sourcing, monitoring, and actively managing a large portfolio of AAA securities requires diligence, active trading, professionalism, and constant focus.   In general, we will be avoiding mortgage securitizations in this proposal. Monetalis recently proposed MIP88: Monetalis/Redwood Friesan. In an effort to best diversify Maker\u2019s PSM, we are looking to avoid redundancy. Target assets are short duration ABS and floating rate structured credit, like CLOs.   Structured products optimize for geographic diversity. The auto ABS transaction referenced above, for instance, has balanced geographic exposure. The top two exposures in the portfolio are Texas and California. Respectively, these two exposures account for 11% and 8.5% of the total loan portfolio. Unsurprisingly, these are also the two most populous states in the United States.   Please let us know if these responses answered your questions. Thanks. ",

Most borrowers never know who the end buyer of their loan is (nor that it changes hands). Side note: that\u2019s part of why we at BTCR believe in this technology\u2026hopefully this becomes something borrowers can control more in the future. On the public securitizations that we are considering here, the assets are being serviced by the same lender (i.e. the borrower makes payments using the same servicer / channel / bank account / etc. during the life of their loan). Feel free to DM if I can make any of this clearer! ",

I want to know how liquid this collateral design is. How long will it take it settle the fund back to the maker contract if emergency need arises?   There is no lock-up period. Liquidity will become available immediately upon Maker\u2019s request. Money market funds can be returned right after Maker\u2019s request, though in the above proposal we have provided 7 days as an estimation to be conservative. The AAA portion of the portfolio is also very liquid, though slightly less so than the money market fund. We would begin selling positions as soon as notified by Maker. To be conservative, we have provided for a 14 day window for AAA sales.   You mentioned about \u201ca 4% stability fee\u201d in your arranger proposal. Will you provide a bound for the return aside from the expectation in MIP90c1?   Since this arrangement will be a direct investment into the underlying Money Market Funds and Structured Credit, facilitated by BlockTower, we will not be providing a bound for the return. The return profile is dictated by the price that Structured Credit AAAs can be sourced in public markets. A reasonable return expectation for these instruments today is between 4 - 6% blended.   What will be the maximum drawdown and have you simulated how a crash will affect the inventory?   Given the high-level seniority (AAA represents the highest rated tranche) and other critical protections, such as over-collateralization and excess spread of these Structured Credit AAAs, we reasonably expect principal losses to be zero. Similarly for Money Market Funds. Given these instruments have not taken losses over several market regimes, simulating a principal loss within this portfolio would imply an unprecedented global financial meltdown. In addition, mark-to-market volatility in this deeply liquid sector is significantly reduced by purchasing floating rate and/or short duration AAA structured credit.   What is the total fee you are charging? I am understanding that it is a flat fee of 1% AUM, but are you taking a cut in interest distribution?   As a servicer, we will only be charging the flat 1% of AUM fee and will not be taking any portion of the interest distribution.   Would you be open to a lower base transaction fee and return carry based compensation?   Due to the nature of the transaction and, more importantly, the complexity of the legal structuring and protections for Maker, we intend to maintain our flat fee described above and not consider any carry.

                    "content": "This is a summary of the proposal and its effects upon ratification from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  This is a valid proposal, eligible to enter the January 2023 Governance Cycle. This MIP takes on MakerDAO\u2019s intent to invest in short-term bonds as formally expressed in MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-Term Bonds. This proposal aims to onboard and activate a 600MM Dai RWA vault for the purpose of acquiring USDC via the PSM, and obtain 600MM USD of diversified, AAA (or equivalent) rated Structured Credit and Money Market Funds. The vault will remit quarterly collected interest to the Surplus Buffer. The proceeds generated from AAA Structured Credit positions will be reinvested, until Maker Governance passes an executive vote to trigger a liquidation of the portfolio. The portfolio will consist of:  70% or less AAA Structured Credit with a 6% target gross return. 30% or more of Money Market Funds with a 3% target gross return.   The exact legal structure to implement MIP90 will be determined and shared after the initial approval of this MIP. Technical implementation does not require the development of new smart contracts with appropriate permissions and security to enable this lending structure. CES-001 will participate in the implementation process. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

                    "content": "At first I thought that this was a joke post, since \u201cAAA\u201d rated structured products was what caused the 2008 financial crisis \u2026 and led to the creation of the entire crypto industry in the first place, as governments had to bail out banks, insurers, entire economies, etc. Maker, with its vision of a decentralized currency that does not discriminate, open to all, is a light to the world. How, then, can something built on such noble ideas even consider putting its treasury into this darkest of black boxes? I guess that having a large treasury (by crypto standards) is a honeypot that attracts these kind of proposals. Setting aside the morality of this proposal, it is mis-priced. This company offers 3-5% after fees, before transaction costs. The lock-up period proposed is 14 days, so it is obviously highly illiquid. Yet, you can get >4% in US Treasuries, as you can see on the screen here. Anyone with a Bloomberg and brokerage account (there must be many MKR holders and core team who have this) can trade. It takes less than 14 minutes (not days) start to finish to execute. Smaller trades in Treasuries take like 14 seconds. The market depth is about $50 trillion. For sure this proposed risk will not be AAA, as naive investors discovered in 2008. As another person posted above, many structured credit products lose money. I doubt any of us can really make a good evaluation of these structured product risks. Lehman Brothers showed pretty clearly that the \u201cexperts\u201d certainly have no idea of the risk involved. I think that as a community we need to stop asking what Maker can do for us, and start thinking of what we can do to make this the most exciting and important place to be in all of crypto.
