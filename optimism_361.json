USDC contract : 0x7f5c764cbc14f9669b88837ca1490cca17c31607  photo_6082251102700549015_y1280\u00d7720 32.8 KB  Here is his original twitter post.  twitter.com    Mr.rug @thabakanjj  1/ I lost 100,000$ on the big bad day!! due to an incorrect way of money transfer in the crypto world. Recently, CEX has a lot of bad news. So it's the best to keep the coin in your own wallet.  Today, I would like to share my own experiences from this past event.#USDC #Circle   3:40 PM - 27 Nov 2022           260                410            Previously, we already contacted Optimism team in Discord, the moderator informed us that tokens transferred to the contract address are not returnable. Next, we contacted The Circle thru e-mail and their reply is also the same. Once the transaction has been made, they cannot be reversed. On etherum mainnet, there is a USDC Funds Recovery Process form, that after fill up the form, there are a team that will help recover the fund.   centre.io    Centre Consortium Announces Release of USD Coin Version 2.1 Centre Consortium Announces Release of USD Coin Version 2.1      However, in my friend\u2019s case, it\u2019s on Optimism. How we wish there are an easy solution as etherum mainnet. Have any of you got into similar situations? Can anyone suggest us what should we do next? Whom should we contact? This is a big sum of money. My friend is so devastated. All advices are very much appreciated. Thank you. ",
