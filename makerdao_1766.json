New contract: 0x38f7C166B5B22906f04D8471E241151BA45d97Af This contract is verified on Etherscan and matches the code from commit c755fd62f876f0b25a93028392dc850c0dc49f6e for the DssProxyActionsCropper.sol  Details: As part of the system shutdown operation, DAI can be redeemed for collateral. This includes calling End.cash and GemJoin.exit. Such operations are grouped together in the dedicated end-proxy-actions permissionless contracts. With regards to collateral that use the Cropper contract, the sequence is more complicated and includes additional steps. One of these steps is passing claim rights to the redeemer, so it can get rewards from the 3rd party (aka tacking). This step was missing from the DssProxyActionsCropper contract and has now been added. This omission was detected as part of PECU emergency shutdown simulations. ",
