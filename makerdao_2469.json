Expectation here is that vault holders will skew any signal so this is just an informal poll to re-engage the community on the topic. I have never put up a poll so may end up editing this a few times so bear with me. From Vault Compensation Plan Approval Poll - Google Docs  Review The Vault Compensation Plan was discussed in the Forums and presented on the June 25 Maker Governance and Risk Call. Voters are encouraged to review the plan document and discussion to inform their position before voting. If you vote \u201cNo,\u201d it would be of great help if you could post in this thread to explain why you do not support the plan and suggest improvements.  Next Steps If this poll is decided as \u201cYes\u201d then Maker governance will proceed with the series of votes and steps laid out in the Plan document, beginning with Phase 1. If the poll is decided as \u201cNo\u201d then additional discussion can take place in the forums to determine what changes are necessary to gain community support.
