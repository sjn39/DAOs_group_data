Overall, no critical issue was found but the contractual documents might deviate significantly from what one could have understood last year. We want to have a law firm review those contracts but this might take a while. Therefore, here is a preliminary assessment to provide early answers. Some definitions for this document: Delaware trust = the Trust, RWA Senior Lending Trust Cayman entity = RWA International Ltd, Tax Favorable Entity (TFE), Trust Sponsor, Depositor Trustee = WSFS, Wilmington Savings Fund Society  On the power of the Trustee The Trust Model assumes that the trust is managed by a respectable and regulated trustee which acts as a third party. In this case, it is WSFS. This is mitigated by the fact that the Trustee (on behalf of the trust) doesn\u2019t sign a lot of the contract and doesn\u2019t get notice of much of what is happening anyway. Actually, the Cayman entity is running the Trust and making the calls.  image992\u00d7357 63.9 KB  While presented as a purely administrative piece of the proposed project and of no importance, the study of the documents shows that the Cayman Entity is the centerpiece of the whole scheme. The Cayman Entity is the beneficiary of the Delaware Trust and makes most decisions of the Delaware Trust. Most (all?) Trust contracts are signed by the Cayman Entity as the Trust Sponsor. More specifically, all powers fall on a person called \u201cMaarten\u201d, which is presented as @maarten  977\u00d7447 63.7 KB  It is unclear at this stage what would happen if Maarten disappears. It is unclear if the Cayman Entity owners (Crestbridge Cayman Limited) would accept directions from anyone and specifically from MakerDAO. And if they would accept direction from a third party, what is the limitation of the directions they would accept from this person? It should be noted as well that the Trust Sponsor can be changed by MakerDAO, but that seems to require an act of the Trust Sponsor.  Secure conduit Per MIP21, a secure conduit is created on the blockchain that funnels the DAIs from the Maker Vault to the Delaware Trust. The secure conduit has one hop to an address owned by the Tax Favorable Entity (in Cayman Island). The process is gated so the DAI can\u2019t go outside of the conduit at this step. This was called the secure conduit which was on-chain.  696\u00d7487 29.5 KB  This is no longer the case after inspection of the contracts provided. Indeed, there is now an Escrow agreement between the Cayman entity and the Delaware trust. Genesis (the DAI<->USD broker) will transfer the converted DAI to the escrow account of the Cayman entity located at WSFS. The Cayman Entity is needed to trigger the money movement. MakerDAO has no control over this entity.  972\u00d7145 50.8 KB  While it seems unlikely at this stage that the money can be transferred to another third party, the money might get stuck in this escrow account if the Cayman Entity fails to act.  Maker representatives There was a signal request to set up a group of Maker Representatives. They had some special rights and a duty to monitor the lending, described as follow:  No trace of those Maker Representatives exists in the documents. Those actions will probably not be done by the Trustee but by the Cayman Entity and, more specifically, \u201cMaarten\u201d. During the risk assessment, we agreed with Matthew on the following part.  700\u00d7184 10.9 KB  Notice that there is no need to have documentation for that. If there is a breach or no willingness to satisfy it, the Maker Governance can simply shut down the vault. Alternatively, @mrabino1 appointed @g_dip  RWA Co. to do the reporting. Unsure at this stage if it\u2019s a replacement or addition. RWF can\u2019t monitor something without having access to underlying information and should not be expected to if this is the case.  Preliminary conclusions It seems to the author that there are more similarities than not between the Trust Model and the Centrifuge Model. In the Centrifuge model, the SPV is managed by the asset originator This can cause a conflict of interest, which is why we have a legal audit and will add Independent Directors. The financial audit is done by the RWF Core Unit off-chain (using an audit right letter). The Tinlake pool enforces the flow of money. In this Trust model implementation, the Trust is managed by the Trust Sponsor which is chosen by the Asset Originator. The Trustee is some kind of guardrail. The Maker Representatives will have some audit rights (while no contract is signed, Maker can shut down the vault). The escrow account and the verification agent enforce the flow of money.  1360\u00d7802 47.8 KB  ",

While the first part was serious but not critical (if you trust Maarten), those ones could be criticals taken together.  Complicit breach of duty from the Trustees The Cayman Trust is acting for the benefit of charities. But in reality, it works for the benefit of MakerDAO (something @g_dip even made clear in the Deleware Trust Agreement). This would lead to a complicit breach of duty from the Cayman Trust Trustees. This fact is even worse as the documents are public. The charities will most likely be aware of it at some point.  The irrevocable transfer instruction might not be irrevocable There is a Irrevocable Transfer Instructions for the Genesis account. But there seems to be no reason the Cayman Company couldn\u2019t change the instructions.  Assessment If correct, taken together, the risk is critical as charities could be able to force the Cayman Trust to funnel the cashflows to them. This is even more so as MakerDAO is not lending to the Cayman Company but making a contribution, so there are no obligations regarding the protocol to start with. @g_dip @mrabino1 ",
