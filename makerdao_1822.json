                    "content": "This notice is to acknowledge and explain a discrepancy between a polled change and a change that will be included in the forthcoming Executive Vote following the recent vote on Collateral Auction risk parameters. While crafting the Goerli test spell for the upcoming Executive Vote, the PE team noted a discrepancy between a polled change to the ETH-B Max Auction Duration (tail). The poll proposed a reduction from 5,400 seconds to 4,800 seconds. However, the actual on-chain value for the ETH-B tail is 8,400 seconds. This error stemmed from a typo in the initial post that was also missed by GovAlpha during poll creation. @Primoz has confirmed that the Risk Core Unit\u2019s intention was to decrease the ETH-B tail from 8,400 seconds to 4,800 seconds. I am happy that there is no need to re-poll on this issue for 3 reasons:  The proposed \u201cnew\u201d parameter is still the same, the error was in the identification of the \u201ccurrent\u201d on-chain value. It is within the Risk Core Unit\u2019s mandate to propose parameter changes for inclusion in an Executive Vote as per MIP16c1. Leaving tail and adjusting other parameters for ETH-B may cause unwanted consequences.  The change from 8,400 seconds to 4,800 seconds for the ETH-B tail will therefore be included in the forthcoming Executive Vote. ",
