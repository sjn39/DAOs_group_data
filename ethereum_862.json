Perhaps we could create a general program and take advantage of any time and space available throughout the week. I believe that MetaCartel Demo Day in particular would like to have some UX-related sessions.  Aug 19 MetaCartel Demo Day https://www.metacartel.org/demoday-2019   Aug 19-21 Web3 Summit https://twitter.com/web3summit Note: the Web3 Summit is 40 min away from the Demo Day venue by shuttle, which means that on Aug 19 Magicians should take care to plan sessions accordingly.   Aug 21-23 DappCon https://twitter.com/dappcon_berlin   Aug 23-25 ETHBerlin https://twitter.com/ETHBerlin  If you know the situation on the ground at any of these events, and if it will conducive to having some space for work sessions, please list them below!  Update: Please fill out this Call for Rings form to let the organizers know what topics / EIPs you\u2019d like to discuss, and if you\u2019d like to organize a Ring. We will work on an agenda so people can know where Rings and Councils are gathering throughout the week. ",

It will be pretty busy overall but if we can lock some time and space and commit to it that might work. I know that dgov is running a node on Web3Summit (that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be mostly), maybe another node for magicians? Dappcon might be more appropriate for the gathering IMO and @mariapaulafn might have more info regarding the space. Looking at the dates we won\u2019t have a free day in the week so the rings will need to fit somewhere \u201cin between\u201d. If I can help anyway with organisation please let me know. ",

Operations of Magicians are collecting the topics and would love to put up a list of proposed Topics / EIPs soon. We will be more than happy if you would add the one that you would love to discuss about. But on a plan is to have a short session for \u201cspontaneous proposals\u201d too.  We also want to be able to help any Ring meet on the sidelines of any event in Berlin during the \u201cconference week\u201d ie Aug 19 - Aug 25.  In the meantime we are working on getting a space for this year\u2019s Council of Berlin. Possible dates for a Berlin Council 2019 are Aug 20 and Aug 21. I will announce Topics of discussion/ EIPs and exact date and venue soon   ",
