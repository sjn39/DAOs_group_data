Key Mainnet Stats  $40 Billion in AUM 92,000 Safes created 752,000 Safe transactions 67 apps integrated to Safe App store  Key Optimism Stats   TVL of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation 3,500 Safes created 15,170 Safe transactions 17 apps integrated to Safe App store  Safe App Store on Optimism  1600\u00d7777 159 KB  Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): The Optimism Collective rewards those who create or sustain public goods. The Safe itself is building a public good, multi-sig account that enables users to control their digital assets with granular permissions. Our aim is to unlock new opportunities for ownership across individuals, DAOs and collectives; and we\u2019ve been building this out on Optimism since our official deployment took place back in December 2021. We chose to deploy to OP because we are aligned on our decentralization values and vision for Ethereum\u2019s path to scalability. Our decision to deploy here was made back in Q2 2021. We are in for the long haul and we want our ecosystem on Optimism to scale and innovate in a sustainable way. We request additional funds to help further bootstrap this effort. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): We are requesting these funds primarily for two reasons:  To be funded for our continued operation on Optimism To incentivize further growth within the Optimism ecosystem, boosting the number of dedicated Safe integrations / projects. This will be done via grants to research and build new features, Safe Apps, social recovery modules and interfaces.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? The 500k OP tokens will be allocated to the SafeDAO, which will focus the distribution building on the Optimism Ecosystem. The distribution would need to go through a governance vote, but the following distribution has been proposed via grants:  30% OP will be distributed to projects on Optimism that build new Safe-based UIs that leverage our core sdk. 20% $OP will be distributed to R&D efforts e.g. improving cross-chain UX with smart contract wallets on OP. 15% $OP will be distributed to dapps integrating as Optimism Safe Apps 15% $OP will be distributed to the R&D of OP Safe modules/guards which build on top of the Safe\u2019s access control and enable use cases such as Social Recovery. 20% allocation to SafeDAO (retroactive reward and software maintenance cost)  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? With these grant distributions - Defi apps, NFT projects, DAO tooling, core infra and R&D collectives will be incentivized to build and collaborate further with Safe on Optimism. The building will vastly improve our Optimism UX, incentivising usage, and scaling both projects. Creating a vibrant Safe <> OP ecosystem. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The Safe solution on Optimism already holds a TVL of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation. Moreover, we envision this TVL, along with our core usage stats, to continue increasing due to:  Safe\u2019s usability and security on OP improving with more features, research and tooling. Additional Safe Apps in the Safe UI create more demand from individuals, DAOs and collectives. Onboarding new users to the app store, and in parallel, creating a portal for OP dapp discovery.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? 12 to 24 months How much will your project match in co-incentives? Once SafeDAO is live, it will be allocated a Safe grants budget, which should help match the allocated rewards for builders and researchers. ",

Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 Grant category: Governance Fund Phase 1 Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. This proposal falls under the Tooling/Infrastructure committee. At the time of writing, the formation of this committee is being voted on. And the relevant information about this committee can be found here:  [DRAFT] S02 Committee Proposal: Tooling Governance Committee  Governance  Project Overview Project description (please explain how your project works): Safe is a programmable account that enables users to control their digital assets with granular permissions. Safe stores >40 billion USD worth of digital assets today. Its flagship solution is a multi-sig based smart contract wallet that requires a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions to prevent unauthorized access to the assets stored: www.gnosis-safe.io. But it is also widely used as an open source protocol in other ecosystem solutions like Utopia labs, Prysm, Coinshift, Parcel, Radicle etc. for a variety of use cases for DAOs, institutions, retail and individuals. Project links:  App: \u200b\u200bSafe  Website: https://gnosis-safe.io/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/safe  Discord/Discourse/Community: Safe Discord  Please include all other relevant links below:  Github: Safe Github  Docs: Developer Docs (all audits here)    Additional team member info (please link): Founders Lukas Schor (Ecosystem) Christoph Simmchen (Governance & Operations) Tobias Schubotz (Product & Operations) Richard Meissner (Tech Lead) Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: The Safe Foundation is an independent, non-profit organisation that contributes to the development of the Safe ecosystem and SafeDAO. The Safe solution itself has become the de-facto account of choice for DAOs and many crypto projects. The contracts are battle-tested as there have been no critical security incidents since Safe was deployed in 2018. Our project aim is to unlock new opportunities for ownership across individuals, DAOs and collectives; and we\u2019ve been building this out on Optimism since our official deployment took place back in December 2021. We chose to deploy to OP because we are aligned on our decentralization values and vision for Ethereum\u2019s path to scalability. Our decision to deploy here was made back in Q2 2021. We are in for the long haul and we want our ecosystem on Optimism to scale and innovate in a sustainable way. We request additional funds to help further bootstrap this effort. Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Key Mainnet Stats  $40 Billion in AUM 94,000 Safes created 771,000 Safe transactions 67 apps integrated to Safe App store  Key Optimism Stats   TVL of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation 3,800 Safes created 17,131 Safe transactions 17 apps integrated to Safe App store  Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Safe\u2019s relevant competitors are alternative crypto wallets and other methods of digital asset custody. These range from popular EOA based solutions like MetaMask to large custodians like Fireblocks. Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes. Github link here. Optimism native?: No (Ethereum native) Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Optimism support launched in December of 2021. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A  Value Add Ecosystem Value Proposition: Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) is the foremost multisig solution in crypto, securing nearly $40B worth of assets. Multisigs have become a critical piece of infrastructure for facilitating trustless collaboration for asset management and smart contract management alike. From L2 bridges, investment DAOs, multi-billion dollar DeFi protocols, and individuals like Vitalik Buterin and Punk 6529; multisig wallets are a foundational component that serious chains cannot do without. For Optimism to continue to attract high quality/value projects and individuals, its wallet infrastructure needs to be secure, robust and continually innovating with new standards. Right now, the Safe solution on Optimism already secures a TVL of ~$1.4 billion based on current OP valuation, with 3800 Safes created. We envision this TVL and deployment statistic to continually increase through more projects spawning and migrating to Optimism. That said, Safe\u2019s usability and security on OP needs to be improved to keep up with new L2 messaging/bridging developments and consistently evolving standards. More features, research and tooling is needed for this. Additionally, more Safe Apps within our Safe UI is needed to improve OP dapp discovery and dapp <> multi-sig compatibility. Current Safe App Store on Optimism  1600\u00d7777 159 KB  How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): We cannot officially commit to co-incentives right now, as our Safe token and DAO has not officially launched yet. That said, post-launch, the core team will publish a proposal to our newly established DAO to match our potential OP allocation with SAFE incentives.  Proposal for token distribution: We are requesting these funds primarily for two reasons:  To be funded for our continued operation on Optimism To incentivize further growth within the Optimism ecosystem, boosting the number of users, dedicated Safe integrations and projects built on Safe. This will be done via user incentives, grants, research, newly deployed features, Safe Apps, social recovery modules and interfaces.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? The 500k OP tokens will be allocated to the SafeDAO, which will focus the distribution building on the Optimism Ecosystem. The following distribution has been proposed:  25% OP will be distributed to projects on Optimism that build new Safe-based UIs that leverage our core sdk 20% $OP will be distributed to R&D efforts improving cross-chain UX, and Social Recovery, on OP using Safe 20% $OP will be distributed to dapps integrating as Optimism Safe Apps 20% allocation to SafeDAO (retroactive reward and software maintenance cost) 15% $OP will be distributed directly to users transacting with Safe on OP  Why 20% to the DAO? (addressing a comment) Retroactive reward and software maintenance of the following components:  Hosting the Optimism version of the Safe UI Running the Optimism Safe transaction service  Maintaining the Optimism Safe App Store Providing 24/7 user support on Safe <> OP Deploying new contract versions to Optimism  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? With these distributions - Defi apps, NFT projects, DAO tooling, core infra, R&D projects and users will be incentivized to build and collaborate further with Safe on Optimism. The building will vastly improve our Optimism UX, incentivising usage, and scaling both projects. Creating a vibrant Safe <> OP ecosystem. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? 12 to 24 months How much will your project match in co-incentives? Once SafeDAO is live, it will be allocated a Safe grants budget, which should help match the allocated rewards for builders and researchers. ",

As a user who likes SAFE, I have a suggestion that may help the sustainable development of the SAFE DAO. You can see or not see it: it is recommended that the air drop of ETH chain users and other EVM chain users be issued at the same time, which helps everyone form a consensus. All users are fair. The use chain is different only because everyone has different use habits, Of course, I will always support SAFE and introduce the benefits of using SAFE to my friends, including security and the substitutability of hardware wallets.

It was easy for Den to quickly onboard Safe users on Optimism because of the open, accessible infrastructure Safe has created. This means a better experience for all types of Safe users because builders can create custom experiences for different use cases. Dedicating funding to make this infrastructure more resilient and easier to use will benefit all Optimism users. ",

Excuse the lack of deadline there, but it\u2019s early DAO days for us compared to Optimism. As @OPUser mentioned, the foundation outlined that dev funding is within the guidelines, and the team reached out to us directly to make this proposal. Given the amount of TVL we currently secure (over $1.1 billion) on OP, we believe it\u2019s fair to request funding (0.01%) for future maintenance of the Safe services in the coming years. We\u2019re happy to get allocated less in RGDF as a result, in order to get budget clarity on our OP services in the future. Seeing as we still need to run the following:  Host Optimism version of the Safe UI Run the Optimism Safe transaction service   Maintain the Optimism Safe App Store Provide 24/7 user support on Safe <> OP Deploy new contract versions to Optimism  ",

Presentation  We are an officially recognized Tooling Governance Committee, responsible for assessing proposals related to tooling and infrastructure (wallets, bridges etc.).  2- About the project  The Gnosis Safe is the most popular multi-signature smart contract wallet that allows users to define a list of owner/signer accounts and a threshold number of signers required to confirm a transaction. Once the threshold of owner accounts have confirmed a transaction, the Safe transaction can be executed. There is not much to explain gnosis is one of the most used and well known applications in the ecosystem.  3- About the following  First [Draft] of the Safe proposal was received in the previous season, and later they updated to the current proposal. After received the appropiate proposal to this current cycle.  4- About the proposal valuation    Added Value: good. Gnosis Safe is fundamental to the ecosystem. There are currently no competitors that have achieved Safe\u2019s adoption and usability.  Impact or expected usage: high. it\u2019s an important tool for the Optimism ecosystem to develop. Both users and dapps and DAOs make constant use of Gnosis Safe.  Current Status: ready. Gnosis has a long history and is a consolidated product. which is now at a stage where it needs to build around it.  Expenditure plan and distribution: appropiate. We need to discuss about funds for development and allocation for DAO (40 and 20). Also, more explanation about distribution for dApps.  Amount requested: medium. The requested amount is 500k OP tokens, which is a reasonable amount and in line with its distribution plan.   5. KPIs and impact tracking To the current plan and distribution, we believe that to make the appropiate following of this proposals, these points will need to be required:  Number of dApps succesfully adopting Safe on its UI. Number of dApps integrating as Optimism Safe Apps, focusing on the most populars according to Optimism Dune Analytics. Executing a correct distribution criteria for OP distribution for Safe users.   6. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes.   We apologize for the delays during this cycle. Our work was mostly done on time but we had delays with the final confirmation from each member to properly publish our recommendations with the proper consensus (this was due to devcon week, but we recognize this is not an excuse). We promise that this situation will not happen again and we will carry out the respective improvements of the process and we will share our learnings received during this cycle. Thank you for patience. ",
