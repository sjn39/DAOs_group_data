I want to take some of my thinking on this subject from this post and use them to seed a separate discussion on this topic.  Caveat Emptor Before reading this post, please know that these are just my opinions. I am one node in the Gitcoin DAO network. These proposed KPIs are designed to share my sense-making, sharpen my own thinking, and to cross-pollinate ideas to/from others.  Others should propose their KPIs and/or their most important thing . If you disagree with my thinking, you should fork & extend my thinking!  The 3 KPIs As an engineer, I think a lot about optimization problems.  In computer science and economics, an optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions.  It\u2019s the process of finding a global maxima by traversing a design space. These are the three big optimization problems I think Gitcoin/GitcoinDAO could focus on to achieve its mission.  1. Ecosystem Impact. How much positive ecosystem impact are we having? Basically, how many builders are we supporting?  How many builders have we helped find new earning, learning, connection opportunities in the Open Internet?  How many builders have quit their corporate jobs to work on open source?  How many are staying in the ecosystem because they are partially or fully supported by Gitcoin? I think of this like a funnel,  How many developers can we source new opportunities for? How many can we help select an opportunity that is a fit for them? How can we help funding opportunities sell themselves to developers?  How can we help developers sell their work to funders? How can we onboard them into ecosystems to produce positive impact? Once they are earning in these ecosystems, how can we retain them?   Screen Shot 2021-08-10 at 10.24.03 AM922\u00d7810 21.2 KB   2. Interconnectedness I am a big believer that It\u2019s all coordination.  That as human beings , we are interconnected and interdependent on each other for survival.  How can we align our incentives better?  How can we deepen our ability to coordinate?  Surely if we can solve this, we can get closer to achieving our mission. As a way of aligning incentives and truly deepening our ecosystem impact, I envision a DAO of DAOs - a mesh network of interconnected projects that all rise and fall in utility together.  This DAO of DAOs would deeply interoperate with each other from a software/culture and perhaps even by swapping governance rights with each other.  Screen Shot 2021-08-10 at 10.29.38 AM1180\u00d7984 74 KB   3. Decentralization I am extremely proud that when Gitcoin launched in 2017, we were focused on our core mission of economically empowering software engineers to build/fund public goods.  We ignored the trend of the time, which was to write a lengthy whitepaper and do an ICO. As a result, we have had a ton of positive impact on the world.  It was an amazing feeling at EthCC to have 2 dozen hackers from across the ecosystem come up to me to shake my hand and say \u201chey Gitcoin had an impact on my life, awesome.\u201d.   It feels great to have helped facilitate the delivery of $26mm to OSS devs across the world. But, the negative result of the 2017 tradeoff is that Gitcoin has some centralization debt.  In the 2017-2020 market cycle we swept decentralization under the rug to focus on impact. Given that Gitcoin has now had a positive impact, there is now actually something to govern.  We want to adhere to ecosystem best practices  Antifragility - Would Gitcoin\u2019s impact and mission endure if Kevin got hit by a bus? Credible Neutrality - Are Gitcoin\u2019s software & governance systems credibly neutral - eg are the mechanisms provably fair to all parties?  Right now the answer to these questions is no.  So I believe that now it is time to pay down that decentralization debt and make Gitcoin more credibly neutral and antifragile. That means finding practical and regulatorily compliant ways of decentralizing the governance of the network, computation of the network, development of the network, and the economics of the network.

In my mind \u201cEcosystem Impact\u201d in your framework is the one that is most amenable to quantifying. Since the DAO is not in charge of the hackathon and Kernel business lines, we should restrict this to Grants, with an increasing focus on dGrants. \u201cInterconnectedness\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what metrics this would correspond to. \u201cDecentralization\u201d \u2014 not sure what metrics this would correspond to. These strike me as operational values, not KPIs \u2014 we know we\u2019re only doing things right if we satisfy interconnected decentralization in the process. With this in mind I\u2019d like to put forward the following high level KPIs that all projects should be aiming to work on. In order to facilitate this, we\u2019ll need support from Gitcoin core product team as well as the dGrants team. CCing @phutchins. Grants ecosystem impact KPIs  $ Matching funds raised Number of matching pool contributors / funder\u2019s league members Number of individual contributors Average contribution per project Average contribution per contributor  These are high level enough to be broken down into subKPIs that different workstreams/orgs can be responsible for. If we want to expand the mandate here, we might include something like  Number of individual developers who were able to work on OSS tech full time because of Gitcoin.  Looking for feedback on this!

Obviously, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be fair to measure most projects like that (not all successful projects require additional funding or need to be turned into a company), but there are some proxy measures for figuring out traction. For us, it was a combination of understanding the median total amount contributed (including the CLR match) cross referenced with social popularity. The CLR match amount takes into account (to some extent), the number of contributors, so that information is rolled up. From there we can choose to categorize into specifics - what the median looks like for dApps, NFT-related projects, etc. Cross-referenced with some grant owner interviews, we can put together a picture of how much funding is necessary to really help \u201cmove\u201d project, and set threshold baselines. Then it\u2019s just a simple query to categorize projects as a start and see how we can best help them move the line. ",

                    "content": "Agree that the KPIs mentioned by @Toby are important. Is there a way to rework the KPIs suggested so they fall under broader headings that are more focused on grant round performance and ecosystem impact? To measure ecosystem impact, the core KPIs should focus on measuring the impact that grant rounds have on participants. From a participant\u2019s point of view, a grant round does three things:  Boosts project discoverability; Provides an opportunity for the community to donate to a project; and Provides matching through quadratic funding;  What actually matters is the impact of the round itself in terms of boosting the discoverability of projects and giving the community the opportunity to donate (vote) for projects. This, in turn, allows the quadratic funding mechanism to function as well as possible. In my mind, if the focus is on the impact of grant rounds, there are three main areas of importance:  Impact of Discoverability; Impact of Community Donations; and Impact of Matching.  Impact of Discoverability might include things like:  Average contribution per project Website analytics: bounce rate, views per page, add to cart, projects per transaction Social media growth of projects e.g. Twitter growth before and after round Impact of connection/exposure to new team/community/funders  Impact of Community Donations might include things like:  Number of individual contributors Average contribution amount Number of grants contributed to Grant fraud tax rate Interviews with participants Participant surveys  Impact of Matching might include things like:  $ matching funds raised $ matching distributed based on size of teams Number of Funders League contributors Funder surveys  Having broader focus areas would make it easier to capture both quantitative data and qualitative narratives. Ecosystem impact can\u2019t be measured by the number of donations in a round or the corresponding matching distribution. Success is about understanding the impact of the money and the impact of Gitcoin grants rounds on participants and the wider ecosystem. The easiest way of doing this might be to view the many data points available from a Grants Round within these three areas. This approach then allows the Public Goods workstream to optimize efforts and allocate funding in a way that will have the most enduring impact within the ecosystem. ",

This could be done with polls. One of my concerns is that for someone to quit the traditional job and work full time on open source software these things could happen:  The subject has a contract or is sponsored (similar to a traditional job, the subjects has a salary), The subject gets suddenly wealthy with its OSS project The subject trusts in the community and is sure contributions will keep coming in the future.  The last of these is my concern, an engineer that has been working full-time for 5 years and has a lifestyle, could get a grant but the time to full employment without salary could take long unless it receives a lot of support. For this I think the way grants work should be different, there should be some sort of security into the future a cover or fail-safe because future contributions seem arbitrary.  I suppose the way this is working right now is that grant by grant the builder gets more confident on future support and after many grants, support has grown, and quitting becomes an option for the builder. I want to check if this is the real experience builders are having. I want to think of ways to improve upon this. I would call this the builder security KPI its equivalence from the traditional job market could be Employee satisfaction A poll could bring this data How confident are you in getting a future grant 0 to 100% How does not having a total warranty of future contributions affect your project? What could improve your experience? A possible solution (if you agree there is a problem), add the patron or subscription model to the grants system. ",

It absolutely has powerful impact than other\u2019s viewpoint. Sometimes it could fix other ppl\u2019s thinking. For example, we know that Ethereum is not just for Vitalik. But we consider Vitalik as the main owner of Ethereum. Because everybody knows that this genius guy initially founded Ethereum.

What if he decided to believe other main net system and work for it? I\u2019m just curious about fully anonymous posting and/or voting system on DAO.

According to your like, (I like it too) seems we could propose a new feature for snapshot.  github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot     \t      [new] hide existing voting results to non-voted members.            opened 02:05AM - 15 Nov 21 UTC               bobjiang                 **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** If a new mem\u2026ber (aka. non-voted member) see the voting results, which could/would lead the [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias).    **Describe the solution you'd like** Hide the voting results for any non-voted members (or non signed in, or guest)  **Describe alternatives you've considered** no.  **Additional context** I would like we would ONLY support this option, not 2 options for the space could choose, because it makes sense for any proposals, otherwise it will loose the meanings for votings. (maybe only delegation is okay for the following votes)       ",
