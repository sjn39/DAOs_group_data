With the Bedrock release approaching, the first ever protocol upgrade is within reach. We\u2019re super excited. While the Goerli testnet upgrade is already scheduled for Thursday, any Mainnet upgrade needs to go through the Token House. This is a call for feedback on the type of information the Token House would like included in the default protocol upgrade proposal type. We\u2019ve put together a starting point for consideration below. We\u2019d love to hear any and all thoughts from the community on what other info would be good to include.    Executive Summary  In short, what is this upgrade? Impacted stakeholders & expected outcomes Why the Collective should upgrade    Technical Summary  Overview of architectural changes Link to all protocol/API/tech specifications Overview of ongoing security considerations incl. all audits and findings    Impact Summary  Changes in performance characteristics, economics, \u2026 Time-of-upgrade considerations (downtime, etc) Links to exhaustive upgrade documentation for impacted stakeholders    Action Plan  Upgrade Timing, Staging, & Go-live Contingency plans in case of last-minute bugs or issues Links to any orchestration code used specifically at the time of migration    ",

Optimism is an optimistic rollup, so that means it uses a fault (formerly called \u201cfraud\u201d) proof system. From what I understand, Bedrock makes architectural changes that are more modular. In the future, if Optimism wants to migrate to a zk proving system, Bedrock\u2019s architecture allows for a more simple swap between proving components without impacting the rest of the system. I believe when zk tech is more battle tested, this system will eventually replace fault proofs on optimism. It should be noted that Optimism\u2019s proving system, Cannon, will not be live with Bedrock, but will come in a later release. I believe it\u2019s one action on the user\u2019s end, but I\u2019m not 100% sure. There is a week long challenge period. If a user is trying to break the rules, a fault proof can be submitted to block the malicious activity. I think if that period passes then you have your withdraw on L1 without further action required. More info high-level rollup protocol and technical withdraw specification.  ",

About impact summary, I would like to see two specific clarifications and then relevant notes: 1. how this update would affect the active protocols in Optimism, such as due to changes in blocktime, timestamps? and any other one that entails that the protocols have to update or deprecate of their deployed contracts, if  applicable. The idea here is to have a complete prevention picture that should be resolved before any update; so if there are relevant conditions like this, I would explicitly like to know about it. And 2. metrics and analytics pertaining specifically to Bedrock\u2019s performance at Goerli, and let us know if you need help with things like stress testing with the community. Additional questions: any procedure in case of severe delays during the update and the fact that said downtime affects time-sensitive smart contracts? from contacting teams to avoid risks to allocation for compensation, if applicable. That\u2019s all for now. Thank you. ",
