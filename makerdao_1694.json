                    "content": "Wanted to make a post to pin and ping @Recognized-Delegates that there has been an update to one of the active Greenlights, with voting ending on September 19th. Earlier today, @PaperImperium noted that he believed there had been an error in the greenlight poll for [UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application. As indicated in the title of the request and as maintained in the Collateral Status Index by @collateral-core-unit, this asset was titled [UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC]. With CES taking responsibility for the collateral onboarding process, we are more inclined to go with how they label assets to be polled, and waited for their input before altering a live poll. In many cases, the collateral looking to be borrowed against is different than the specific token being deposited at Maker. That is even further complicated by assets that are still in development or otherwise waiting to hear back from Maker before spinning up an implementation. I apologize if this change (and previous titling) causes any confusion, but with nearly the full two weeks left in voting we plan to honor the result of the poll. In the future, we will confirm asset names before greenlights begin, as the likely cause of this was a mismatched assumption on both sides (we assumed the listing of the asset was intentional and how it was designed to be polled, and I suspect CES assumed we would be going off of the thread for any titling decisions). Happy to elaborate further, but suggest anyone still unclear check out the back-and-forth that promoted this post in #gov-alpha-public. ",
