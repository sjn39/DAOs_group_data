                    "content": " End of 2021 Review It has been quite a journey! We started with seven FTE, and now we are ten FTE, with the new addition of @Youss , as our new Chief of Operations. In the last seven years, Youssef built his experience around startups and strategy consulting. He worked for two years in a NY-based food tech startup leading its growth before joining consulting for four years, where he worked at Bain & Company as Case Team Leader. He then left consulting to launch in France one of the leading quick-commerce players in Europe (+\u20ac200M of funds raised) that he scaled to +200 employees in its first ten months of operations. He recently joined us as he is very interested in crypto and its business applications and keen to take on the challenge to help scale Maker to 100x.  Highlights of the last eight months (that\u2019s the age of our CU):  We helped to increase DAI supply through two initiatives:   Institutional vaults: Although we are still releasing the IV product (hopefully at the end of January), IV has been helping us initiate conversations with companies with large crypto treasuries to explain what\u2019s happening with Maker. It\u2019s easy for them not to pay that much attention, get distracted by the rewards other protocols offer, and not be aware of the lowest stability fees and opportunities Maker has. Thanks to IV and the one to one conversations we had with these companies, they increased their positions by:   Nexo passed from a 200m DAI position to a 1.5B DAI position. Celcius went from 38m DAI to 476m DAI   Collateral as partners: Thanks to the conversations we had with these companies/projects, we also helped them to increase their positions in Maker, and in some cases, like the PSM-collaterals, we worked in agreements to also increase DAI demand through an integration with their channels:   Paxos partners are using the PSM-USDP to mint 497m DAI Polygon minted 20m DAI Decentraland minted 6m DAI    IV product: As mentioned, IV opened us various opportunities with institutions, which helped us to understand what they are looking for and what Maker needs to provide to them:  We worked with @Protocol-Engineering , @Risk-Core-Unit , @Real-World-Finance and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit  to define the process for IV and the product, and thanks to the future users of the vault, we have been through a series of iterations of the \u201cagreement\u201d. We worked with our legal firm to explain to these institutions\u2019 compliance and legal teams how to interact with MakerDAO. We defined our differentiators from other lending protocols and how the KYC and AML processes apply in our case. Besides Nexo, we have three other companies in our pipeline for an IV.    We were coordinating with other CU in the launching of a new product. As Growth, we want to help PECU and @collateral-core-unit  launch a new product within the protocol, which is usually related to the onboarding or offboarding of collaterals. For that, we work on increasing the awareness of our partners and the market.    Challenges.   Dai liquidity to support the multichain strategy  We are working with various MM to find alternative solutions, depending on this, PECU would be thinking of an alternative to generate DAI liquidity by ourselves.    Define how institutions can make agreements with MakerDAO without an entity in the middle  This takes time because we have to talk with each institution wanting to use the protocol.     Progression of our pipeline. The general outline of our traditional cycle consists of the following phases: Outreach \u2192 Initial conversations \u2192 Project formalization and commitment \u2192 Activation support (technical or marketing support) \u2192 Pre-launch growth \u2192 The partner Launch (close deals) \u2192 Maintenance and growth. During Q1 (May-June-July) we closed 33 integrations and during Q2 (August-September-October) we closed 41 integrations.  722\u00d7436 11.8 KB  Currently, we have 134 opportunities in the latest stages of the Growth Process cycle, before closing the integration (Project Formalization, Activation support, and pre-launch)  724\u00d7436 8.26 KB   B2B Activations. \u200b\u200bActions that were planned together with the partners where we discuss how to reach their target audience with an action that can be interesting while keeping the costs adjusted to Tier Level.

Institutional vaults. We will be onboarding new institutions (crypto-institutions) into the Institutional Vaults product to increase the number of crypto-vaults with more than 200m DAI.   Multichain strategy. We will continue to include Dai in other chains and increase its utilization through new projects on those chains integrating and incentivizing Dai usage. Also, we will follow the protocol progress in terms of bridges and deployment in other chains to support its adoption and growth.   PSM and other collaterals. We will work with other projects/companies to develop partnerships when onboarding their token as collateral. The idea of these partnerships is to guarantee a long-term relationship and an agreement that benefits both parties.   Grants program. We want to promote the development of the Ecosystem, supporting and funding projects committed to innovating using the Maker Protocol as a medium. We want to motivate them to run projects that build technology or resources on the Maker Protocol. To support this initiative, we will be running an ongoing grants program and also partnering with ETHGlobal Hackathons.   Message Propagation. During the following months, we will look for different ways to propagate Maker\u2019s voice through developing partnerships that will help us communicate Maker\u2019s message.   Happy holidays to everyone!!!  ",
