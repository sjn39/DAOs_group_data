For details on opting in, see Opting in to Sourcecred/Wth is SourceCred?. Announcements In this distribution, the tithe of %5 Cred to SourceCred has been temporarily disabled due to volatility in SourceCred\u2019s percentage of the DAI payout. tldr; in the first week the tithe was on, SourceCred received 527 DAI, which was in line with expectations, as SourceCred was owed ~4 weeks of \u201ccatchup\u201d payments (it should settle after a couple weeks to around 5% of DAI payouts, or 250 DAI/week). However, due to unique properties of Maker\u2019s instance and the recent spike in forum activity, we are not seeing SourceCred\u2019s percentage decrease as fast as expected. Therefore, while we debug the tithe feature to make SourceCred\u2019s DAI payouts more predictable, we have disabled the tithe. For the last two payouts (the weeks ending 5/2 and 5/9), SourceCred has not received payouts from the tithe. We will instead receive 5% of the DAI payouts (250 DAI) directly from Maker (GovAlpha CU) until we can resolve the issue. Note that this equates to a 5% increase in payouts to contributors, reversing the effective 5% decrease when SourceCred turned on the tithe.  (standard)  WARNING:  Cred scores and payouts may see volatility in the coming weeks and months as we tweak the algorithm and payout parameters. We still have a lot of work to do before the system is optimized enough to \u201cossify\u201d, producing predictable payouts. Payouts This week $5,000 worth of DAI was distributed to 97 contributors.
