The intention of this report is to provide the users with a detailed understanding of treasury health, monthly spending and emissions of GTC.  Gitcoin DAO - August 2022 Financial Report   Find above the Gitcoin DAO treasury report for August 2022. As with previous months, the statements are split into transactions denoted in the governance token $GTC and separate transactions in stablecoins. We have included a consolidated profit/(loss) account that translates the GTC transactions into $USD to allow for comparison in a denomination that can easily be relatable to many reading the report. Highlights  Total $ value of contributor rewards is down 19% MoM, which is a direct result of timing differences in payment made to contributors from differing workstreams, coupled with a depreciation of GTC token price at month end. We anticipate a slight increase in contributor spend with the inclusion of the new workstream: Gitcoin Product Collective.

However the stablecoin treasury holding has increased as a result of diversification efforts.
