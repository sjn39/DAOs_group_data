If developers get a small share of all the fees generated by users interacting with their smart contracts, it will potentially solve the aforementioned problem. In addition, it will provide huge incentives for developers to choose Ethereum over other platforms for their applications. I\u2019ve already submitted EIP-3279 here: eip-draft-smartcontract-fee-share: Transaction fee share by smart contract deployers by tarekskr \u00b7 Pull Request #3279 \u00b7 ethereum/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub Would really appreciate it if someone is able to help me formalize the technical side of this EIP (specification, security considerations, etc.)  ",
