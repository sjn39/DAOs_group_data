THEY SHOULD THEREFORE BE TWO DISTINCT PROPOSALS. We, as a community, should be VERY wary of proposals including changes that are NOT core to the main proposal.

Unfortunately you can\u2019t \u201cyes\u2026but\u201d the structure of a DAO governance vehicle. What would you propose? Undelegating Dharma and Gauntlet\u2019s vote? DAOs, in principle, exist precisely to prevent that kind of manipulation. It appears that you have 2 issues that are far more important to discuss.  The design and process of the voting mechanism. The choice of UNI voters to delegate to the twin evil empires  Honestly guys. You have lots of energy that is being misspent here. In order to justify your claims, you are trying to characterize the Dharma proposal as a disingenuous unethical cash grab. Do you have proof of that? Have you considered that Dharma has nothing more than the good will of their users to gain? Have you also considered that your mischaracterization is bordering on slander towards a great project that is servicing consumers with a much needed mobile product? (in full disclosure, i used them once or twice to try it out - i have nothing to gain from this proposal however). I understand the psychology. You feel passionate about your position, and you will create whatever fictional narrative you can summon to justify your position. In this case, characterizing @nadav_dharma as an evil despot looking to make a getaway with a paltry few UNI tokens, is factually incorrect. He is a servant leader trying to build a community. He is extremely respectful, considers both sides, and always solicits the opinions of those who don\u2019t agree in order to engage in productive dialog. You should talk to him directly, instead of making loud appeals to the UNI community to filibuster this vote. Btw, the goal is singular. It is a proposal designed to \u201cmake the voting mechanism usable and coherent\u201d. At some point in the future you will appreciate this, especially when much needed reforms are able to leverage the newly designed constraints. ",

Must there be evil intent simply because you disagree or harbour fantastical narratives about an elaborately concocted attempt to overthrow UNI governance? The simplest answer is the most logical. @nadav_dharma is just trying to do the right thing. Maybe if you read his posts you\u2019ll reconsider your position. ",

In this case that means that if 97% of the other UNI holders don\u2019t vote or don\u2019t care about the governance As of now I think Dharma has 15.5 Million UNI votes, and Gaunlet 13.7 Million UNI. Together they have majority power to pass a proposal at 4% or 3% Quorum regardless; I guess is more a matter of  the remaining (current supply) 156 Million UNI holders actively participating or not.

It\u2019s also a very fair way of distributing tokens to more people, because we know that there is very likely one single address per real user.

If it looks like Dharma is doing anything that is misaligned with the UNI community\u2019s best interests, that delegation will be removed, and Dharma will have absolutely no ability to propose or pass anything \u2013 regardless of whether the threshold decreases significantly. I think there\u2019s a more realistic concern about whether large exchanges may acquire enough UNI to affect proposals - for example, a large exchange like Binance. But I think the current proposal is conservative enough to avoid that scenario. My argument for passing the proposal is that I think we should prove that UNI governance can work, in the same way that Compound governance has proven to work and be effective. Dharma played a large role in Compound\u2019s governance so far, which has been positive in terms of showing that it is a decentralized protocol. I believe proving that the token can create effective governance should be a priority for the community, and to show that it isn\u2019t just the UNI team, or elite investors, who control the protocol. Dharma is neither of those things, and retroactive distribution brings more people into the community of token holders. So I view it as a perfect opportunity to show how well decentralized governance can work. ",

What proof do you have of this or is it just an \u2018opinion\u2019? Have you reached out to Dharma directly to ask for an equally direct response to your claim? If this is a takeover attempt, what do you believe the goal is? All takeover attempts that require this much investment in time and energy have an ideological foundation. Do you think Dharma is trying to financially benefit? Perhaps they are doing it as a part of an elaborate social experiment? Or maybe there are esoteric plans afoot that we aren\u2019t aware of but should guard against? Have you considered that maybe the ideological foundation is quite ethical and interested in benefiting the UNI community? A rational mind would exhaust both possibilities before attempting to put pen to their thoughts. Finally, what do you have to gain from filibustering and getting the proposal to fail? Have you been transparent with your motivations in doing so? How would the UNI community gain from a failed proposal? Do you have an alternative to the proposal? Listening to people complain about stuff but doing nothing to offer alternatives leaves a certain distaste that is true of any human social interaction.  Look, the point is that conspiracy theories are fun to elaborate on. It fulfills our inner sense of value and how we perceive the world. However, they rarely have any substance. Here\u2019s what i recommend. Create a post and ask your questions directly to @nadav_dharma and @gauntlet. Get it from the horse\u2019s mouth. If you are unwilling to challenge them in person, then they have no choice but to treat your accusations in the same light. ",

To be able to push their Proxy airdrop proposal through, and anything else they might want to do.     rabbidfly:  What proof do you have of this?   Proof that this is what is happening is all over this thread. It also makes logical sense.        rabbidfly:  If this is a takeover attempt, what do you believe the goal is?   Dharma has a lot to gain from supplying their users with this money. It buys good-will, something very valuable in business as you probably know. It\u2019s also a very good look for them in the sense that it creates precedence for multiple proxy airdrops for Dharma users. Dharma is not Uniswap dependent. \u2026 Also a takeover attempt of a community treasury is inherently bad, regardless of the goal.     rabbidfly:  Have you considered that maybe the ideological foundation is quite ethical and interested in benefiting the UNI community?   A takeover of a community fund to buy goodwill from your users is not ethical, and I don\u2019t believe it benefits the UNI community.        rabbidfly:  what do you have to gain from filibustering and getting the proposal to fail?   It is impossible to filibuster this? This is just a community discussion.     rabbidfly:  How would the UNI community gain from a failed proposal?   Having actual governance and not dictatorship is, I believe, a good thing. Getting to actually have a fair vote on the proxy proposal is a good thing.     rabbidfly:  Do you have an alternative to the proposal?   Did you read this post? SPLIT IT UP.     rabbidfly:  Create a post and ask your questions directly to @nadav_dharma   I have tagged @nadav_dharma @Tarun several times. Both here and on the main proposal discussion.

                    "content": "Listened to the discussion. Thanks for adding value to the community through open discourse. I\u2019ll share my thoughts if anyone wants to geek out on philosophy, anthro-complexity, economics, etc. Be warned TLDR: humans are complex social beings and we are far better served finding ways to achieve working compromise, than to demonize each other simply because our values differ. If Dharma refuses to engage in this dialog, then we have no choice but to assume they are complicit by absence. If however, they choose to collaborate on a solution but we continue to vacillate in our refusal to empathize, we are complicit by choice and have undermined our right to an objective opinion.    The assumption that a \u2018for profit\u2019 organization has nothing but self-interest in mind is extremely problematic. The core polarity fallacy that if it\u2019s not black, it must be white, is central here. Just because you are \u2018for profit\u2019, does not mean that your corporate value system focuses solely on driving revenue to sate the maniacal appetites of their shareholders. This is a blessedly na\u00efve perspective of the world. Dharma is definitely fighting to establish a viable business model, but can we seriously kangaroo-court them into a \u2018corporation\u2019 stigma, and by association, assume arbitrarily that their actions should all be examined through the lens of \u2018evil centralized interests\u2019? We are acting precisely in the manner with which we are accusing them, but standing behind our value system as justification. Centralized vs decentralized. Representation vs Plutocracy. Polarities are fallacies, because most of life is lived in the middle - a spectrum.   The romanticism around decentralized permissionless governance is quaint, but they don\u2019t address human nature and what we know of behavioural economics. Humans are hierarchical. Even as hunter gatherers we operated within a social hierarchy - if not a power hierarchy. Whether it is a token, or fiat, or social recognition, or kudos, all systems migrate towards autopoietic balance - or centralized control. If i can buy, or take, or trick others into giving me that item of intrinsic value, then i will do whatever is necessary to acquire it. The incentive is far too enticing to avoid for long. Eventually, power consolidates, or social influence consolidates into a systemic balance. Maybe technology can overcome this, but not for a very long time - our cognition is not wired for that degree of critical thought. Dharma is utilizing whatever means they have within the rules to achieve their \u2018noble\u2019 outcome. Everyone\u2019s version of nobility differs of course, but we cannot immediately assume that a substantial delegate in the system went through all that trouble only to undermine the same system. If they are truly a \u2018for-profit\u2019 organization, there are far better and more effective ways to establish your brand presence, than to mount a \u2018take-over\u2019 campaign like we were trapped in a Sun Tzu essay 1000s of years after it was written. That is soo 90s corporate. Today, boardrooms are grappling with complexity - not the \u2018competition\u2019.   The one token - one vote is incredibly short-sighted, which you guys recognized. The ancient greeks made it work in a village town square where the numbers never exceeded 100s, and where decisions had existential consequences. When the Romans capitulated into an Empire, democracy died with it. That was a long time ago. Today, decentralizing decision making on a planet of 6 Billion is riddled with issues. The assumptions that you are forced to adopt includes a knowledgeable, conscientious voter who has the greater interests of the group in mind. If you cannot assure that, then you are left with adopting a delegate model, because like Plato\u2019s philosopher king, the decision making is then given to a trusted person that has earned the right. In our case, delegates have to use social influence to acquire tokens, which renders them as no better than a politician. This is a horribly broken system. The solutions, sadly, are emergent. We simply don\u2019t know because humanity has never been here before. I can suggest one thing however. Systems that adapt successfully are those that can change as quickly as the underlying context. This is the basis of Complexity Science and what it has taught us. Experimenting with different forms of governance, and yes, failing forward, will get us closer to an emergent solution that works \u2018better\u2019. I\u2019m sure political scientists and marcro economists are busy writing papers about this as we speak. If however, we don\u2019t have a fast feedback loop in our governance structure, then whether through voter apathy or highly restrictive governance constraints, the absence of a self-healing mechanism will not allow Uniswap to evolve quickly enough to avoid it\u2019s own demise (all systems fight entropy in their own way - eventually most fail - look at the turnover of the fortune 500 for proof of this mechanism). This only leads towards one outcome. I like the idea of autonomous proposals to help solve that!   We are the trail blazers here, but we are fighting the most challenging of all possible challenges - humanity. In some ways, we are inquiring into human psychology and attempting to version it socially. Not an easy task, but who knows, with recent development in epi-genetics, it could work!  I don\u2019t have answers, but I do know one thing. Demonizing people or entities autonomically because of a perceived difference in ideologies, will get us nowhere. We may as well crawl back into that cave and we\u2019ll get exactly what we deserve - crypto or otherwise. There are lots of upcoming disruptive technologies that will make crypto seem like solving a rubik\u2019s cube (AGI for example). If however, we enter into open dialog where the intent is to achieve, NOT consensus, but something better as a result of the collaboration. Something unique, perhaps innovative, then we have unlocked the human potential for endless creativity. What I have objected to all along on this thread is not whether Dharma gets or does not get an opportunity to reward their poor idle, and mostly completely oblivious users who\u2019ll never know that they can \u2018claim\u2019 any UNI. It was always about the knee-jerk reaction that many of us tend towards because of the perceived assault on our value system and our beliefs. The variety in values will always be there, unless we are condoning a 1984-like conditioning campaign. Finding ways to achieve effective compromise is the only way forward. What will happen when the world figures us out and massive fiat starts getting pumped into the system?  The lobsters will very quickly sort out their hierarchy. Our biology dictates it. Can we sort out the technology to solve this inevitability? I doubt it, but it\u2019s definitely worth the attempt. p.s. I\u2019m still a bit of a crypto neophyte, but why can\u2019t we have a 1-wallet address 1-vote system? The address is weighted slightly by tenure of stake and size of stake, but only to incentivize good behaviour. KYC seems to be the only hiccup, because otherwise I\u2019d just create bots to mount a sybill-like attack. What if KYC established uniqueness of your identity but without centrally hosting those details? I\u2019m sure there is something like this out there. Anyway, just thinking out loud. ",

There\u2019s a lot of misinformation surfacing in the forums and media, and misinformation is bad for governance. So let me share these assertions:  Dharma itself does not get UNI from its proposal for retroactive distribution. It\u2019s the users of multiple wallets (Dharma, Argent, etc.) who will receive the UNI, for trading on Uniswap via meta-transactions. This is in alignment with the goals of the initial UNI distribution. Dharma is not a UNI \u201cbagholder\u201d, and there is no chance of Dharma \u201ccontrolling Uniswap\u201d. This is something that was incorrectly argued by blockchain media company Decrypt. Some investors, who are not invested in Dharma, have delegated to Dharma, and this is a vote of trust. If the Uniswap Governance parameters remain the way they are (40m UNI), it\u2019s unlikely that any decentralized UNI governance could happen this year. Either voter participation or share of delegation needs to increase significantly for it to be viable. Further discussion: I believe UNI community should prioritize proving that decentralized can governance work. The retroactive distribution proposal is fair and lower risk than the initial distribution, since we know there is a 1:1 user:address relationship. It\u2019s a great step.\".  ",

The proposal will pass or fail on whether it reaches quorum, so rather than persuading people to vote no, its more a case of persuading them to not vote yes (and not delegating to those who may). I\u2019m a soft no to this proposal, because as the OP points out, its two different things and should be seperated and its also too soon to start making very significant governance changes proposed by a high level holder which gives them additional power. I dont see anything necessarily nefarious in it, but I\u2019m very aware that blockchain governance is in its infancy and my concern is that it may transpire that there is no way to reverse it, as it becomes easier for large holder to shut down reversal routes. There is a low level awareness among ordinary uni holders (and for many of them, this will be the first time that they have held a governance token) about their responsibilities. Even although I have some familiarity with governance, I dont know how to delegate my votes responsibly, because I dont really have a feel for the ethos and values of those who I may delegate to, and the gas fees for voting directly with such a small holding are an inhibitory factor ",

                    "content": "Good job, @uni0, on defending the Uniswap governance.   Fundamentally, there is no reason to lower the quorum threshold.  You already only need 21% of the current supply to vote yes - and it will come down to 4% eventually. I don\u2019t think that many voting decisions need to be passed during the first few months of Uniswap governance. We simply don\u2019t have the safety practices in place yet. No teams to develop proposals, no audit teams to verify that the proposals are solid.  When it comes to the Dharma & Gauntlet group of interest, we can identify a couple of things about them.  The goal: they want to get another UNI airdrop. a) When it comes to UNI airdrop itself, I see no reason for it to be done. It is somewhat clear now that airdropping UNI is not an efficient way to build the community to govern the protocol. There are a lot of better ways. Just think about it: 251k addresses received free UNI, and most topics on the governance forum don\u2019t reach 1k views. b) How much UNI do they want to get airdropped on them exactly? If they already have 30m votes, how much more will they gain from this airdrop? What percentage of the supply do we find reasonable for this group of interest to have? Keep in mind that it\u2019s much easier to act as a single entity. You could view one vote from a single entity as 2 or 3 votes from not mobilized voters. So, Dharma & Gauntlet group of interest want to:  Lower the quorum so that they can reach it without community support. Lowering the quorum is harmful to the protocol in its early governance stages. Effectively send themselves the UNI from the governance treasury, which in turn means giving themselves more voting rights.  The method: delegates use deceptive tactics.  The rider problem has been mentioned a lot here already. The justification for lowering the quorum threshold is highly speculative. The analysis is made in a way that would fit the desired outcome.  Let\u2019s take a close look at this post. It looks smart. All that code in it makes it look nifty. The code is not understood by most people who read it, but it creates a reputational signal. There\u2019s code, graphs, Nansen, PGP signatures. But there is no essence to it. Creating a model based on the assumption that Binance will always have 25m UNI tokens just doesn\u2019t make sense. And there is no disclosure in this post of how the proposed changes benefit the Dharma & Gauntlet group of interest. The real analysis of the implications of lowering the quorum threshold would be about how it would feed into Dharma & Gauntle\u2019s ability to distribute the governance treasury towards themselves. That is a much more real and apparent issue. And make no mistake, by \u201cthemselves,\u201d I mean the whole group of interest and not just its representatives. This group has an interest in getting free UNI. And by getting free UNI, it will get more control over governance decisions in the future. I\u2019m not sure why anyone other than people who directly benefit from it would ever get behind this proposal. I also don\u2019t see the value in distributing UNI towards the group that wants to distribute free UNI towards itself. How exactly can an increase in this group\u2019s voting power benefit the Uniswap protocol\u2019s development? If these goals and this method don\u2019t qualify this group of interest as a bad actor, what does? a) They want to have quorum without even a slight support of the rest of the Uniswap community. And it happens in the time when the governance is at its most vulnerable point. b) They want to distribute UNI from the governance treasury towards themselves for free at the expense of everyone else.

Now we\u2019ll remove 29.14 Million from Gauntlet and Dharma and we have\u2026 1,515,106 FOR and 633,960 AGAINST Unless i miscalculated or missed something obvious, we are left with 2 choices:  We expand the conspiracy to additional delegates to extend our confirmation bias around the \u201ctake-over Uniswap\u201d narrative/meme We acknowledge that the majority of Uniswap is voting FOR this proposal  #2 is the most likely outcome, because like most conspiracies, #1 takes a ridiculous amount of effort to pull off, and we can\u2019t even credibly articulate \u2018why\u2019 they would even bother doing so. In any case, it seems to highlight that the Uniswap governance structure is broken in its current form. If we can\u2019t establish the quorum threshold of 40 Million across all votes (for and against), then what are we arguing about? The case against Dharma is secondary to a more pressing issue, which irrespective of the source, this proposal attempts to solve. Are we convinced that we can reach quorum easily for beneficial proposals that have unilateral support? To abstain is to say \u2018no\u2019 minus the gas fee? Not sure that is a safe assumption to make. ",

My greater point has nothing to do with Dharma. It can be summarized as:  This is all new and we have no idea what will work, but we have ideas! Create a governance meta-structure that allows us to experiment and adapt quickly in a tight feedback loop as we race toward \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 in our system  Making proposal and quorum constraints prohibitively high diminishes our ability to achieve #2, and our ability to maintain coherence in the rapidly moving world of crypto and it\u2019s inherent complexity.

The torrid pace of innovation, in both tech and governance, is required to survive. So, we can politely disagree on this point. From what we have learned through the science of complex adaptive systems, staying at that edge of discomfort is an existential requirement. Seeking stability, caution, restrictive constraints, makes Uniswap highly prone to entropy. At this point, it doesn\u2019t take the \u2018next\u2019 uniswap much energy to replace what\u2019s there with a better service. From what i can see as a consumer, if you can nail the following, Uniswap should do well:  a better and more intuitive user experience to draw in a wider consumer base and accelerate adoption improved trust through some sort of decentralized governance that makes it \u2018safer\u2019 to invest - we are still in the wild west here and that scares the majority of consumers and institutions an institutional grade of financial instruments to ensure scalability, economy of use (gas fees!), security, and insurance. as long as \u2018rug pull\u2019 remains the dominant narrative amongst CT, good luck trying to draw in more capital. looking at DeFi charts in the last 2 months plainly demonstrates that we hit a glass ceiling.  The added layer of governance will help, and i would argue, is necessary to navigate the obstacles we know are ahead. ",

And they try to take advantage of the way UNI is distributed while they can. As I said earlier, it only makes sense to support what Dharma & Gauntlet do for people who are direct beneficiaries of the airdrop they try to push through. They can only do that in the very early stages . As later, more percentage of the supply will go to Liquidity providers, the team & investors, who have no interest in making said airdrop. And airdrop is a euphemism, by the way. The initial airdrop was an airdrop, and the team had reasons to do it the way they did. Dharma\u2019s \u2018airdrop\u2019 is closer to sending UNI from the governance treasury towards your addresses without doing anything useful to earn that. The adequate word would be stealing, as it comes at the expense of all other network participants. It has nothing to do with Uniswap protocol development. It is just an attempt to get free money & more voting rights. And to get this free money, this group of interest is willing to compromise the protocol\u2019s governance procedure. ",

I kinda happen to fall in that category from time to time. Graeme and Rabbidfly, you guys surely understand why some of us uni holders could be pretty worried, and fear the worst in this scenario\u2026 our token started off great, tons of air drops, alot of people like myself bought in investing a decent about 5 to 10k. The token went it $8 which was awesome. And then the wierd stuff started happening. Uni starts falling on its face literally, get se bad world news, bitmax gets introuble, people thinking uniswap could be next, and then volume completely dissappers.  It\u2019s been a rough month to say the least. Governace was alright there was some good talks and awesome ideas\u2026getting the airdrop to darma and the other was spoken of, alot of us were for it as I understood. I hear alot of ideas about what to do to build uni more, what we could do to attract users, I personally was pushing for uni holders to earn rewards on their uni tokens(which by the way, no rewards or earning by owning a uni is probably the single biggest deterrent, and reason why alot of people just aren\u2019t interested. Saying uni will never get back to $8, it\u2019s a scam, so on so fourth\u2026 fml right.  Good talk\u2026 Proposal day was getting closer, and we were actually seeing the price increase a wee bit. For a sec hope was building. Then darmas proposal came in. I was hearing some stuff about what binance could possibly do(wasn\u2019t good news), but now darma was in the spotlight for a conspiracy of whatever. And it was everywhere and if someone was thinking about buying they were glad they didn\u2019t now for sure. So yet again shot in the other leg, we not attracting new customers, at least people that are buying I do think? Is this community going to consist of majority owners being airdropped their unis. So a how bunch of people used uniswap, gets free tokens. Sounds great, except it doesn\u2019t look great, and smells like bulls**t, lol. Im not saying that you guys havnt made a decent arguements in this discussion, honestly I want to believe you. But truthfully, and unfortunately both sides in this argument are speaking only based on opinion, and speculation. Here we were talking about things we could change to prevent whales from doing whale things and it does look like out governace was just over ran buy a whale. When I got on to vote, I knew right away there was no way in hell to compete with that, and apparently I was right. Obviously any one holding uni can still vote if they choose to, but after this are we even going to have a say. It just doesn\u2019t seem like it, and again bad talk about uni, price is sucky, and it\u2019s all out there for everyone to see. I guess if everyone doesn\u2019t sell and unis price does turn around and exceed expectations then I will tell you both you were right\u2026 but like I said, if it looks like poo it usually is. ",

Even if 30M accounted for Dharma and co (Based on proof this figured actually ended up being less than 30M) there are currently still more than 9M Uni more voted by the people. Anyway these are all numbers the important thing is improving the system going forward if it needs fixing but at the current rate it would look like the majority dont mind the idea of lowering the Proposal and Quorum levels which would sugguest that it\u2019s a minority worried about this proposal rather than the majority even though it was attempted to be portrayed as the other way round. My hope is just that people respect the vote if it passes or not but I feel like there will continue to be drag on the topic long past when this vote is over in 2 ish days time for weeks, months and years from now ",

Here is what i propose:  rewrite the governance contract - not tweak it  Proposals  allow autonomous proposals like Compound https://defirate.com/compound-autonomous-proposals/#:~:text=Compound%20\u2013%20the%20leading%20US%20lending,to%20create%20a%20Governance%20Proposal.&text=Autonomous%20Proposals%20are%20a%20new,to%20submit%20a%20governance%20draft.  Process of vote  make voting results hidden so that we don\u2019t dissolve the process into a daytime soap-opera on these forums  Quorum threshold  Quorum as a static number does not make sense Make quorum threshold a product of delegated votes  Long-term fairness between short-term and long-term interests  implement \u2018tenure voting\u2019 which is currently being tested at the LTSE (eric reis innovation) https://ltse.com/team/   How it works?  to properly balance the interests of long-term vs short-term token holders, you create a system that slowly moves power away from a plutocracy and into the hands of those who have an interest in the long-term health of Uniswap so for example, holding 1000 tokens after 1 year might increase to 1.5x in voting power if you don\u2019t like the direction Uniswap is taking you can walk with your feet and sell your UNI (bye)  Ok, so there\u2019s a quick stab at ideas from the seat of my pants.

The quorum constraint we have now is a factor of available UNI governance tokens, NOT \u2018delegated\u2019 tokens. This is highly problematic, especially in the beginning when the delegates have fewer votes. Confusion around \u2018self-delegation\u2019 and \u2018timelocked snapshots\u2019 made this worse. A good strategy to mitigate \u2018highly organized minorities\u2019 is to give tenured voting power to UNI holders. As an example, 1000 UNI that has 1 year of tenure in a wallet address may represent 1500 votes, and possibly 2000 after 2 years. I\u2019m sure the curve wouldn\u2019t be linear, but you get the point. This balances the long-term interests of all token holders with the short-termed interests of investors who may have poor intent. The abstain vote should be reserved for those who don\u2019t agree to the need to vote on a given proposal. This should be a thoughtful and precise decision. Unfortunately, because we have transparent voting metrics for the duration, it turns into a slovenly display of politicking, story weaving of the most elaborate fantasies, and unnecessary drama. Instead, let\u2019s have a \u2018proposal baking\u2019 period of 6 days, where we can debate its merits without the added weight of a vote-count leaderboard. Then, on the last day we engage in a \u2018hidden\u2019 vote. Those who normally abstain because they want to save on gas fees, or because they realize the vote will fail quorum, are now forced to cast their vote. Put your money where your mouth is. If you don\u2019t have skin in the game, you should sell your UNI and buy meme instead. I mean that sincerely. Governance is not a joke.

Curve has experimented with time-locking CRV to achieve a similar \u201ctenured\u201d affect, although I believe their system gives a weight boost immediately on lock (ie, you lock for 4 years, you get the full 2.5(?)x boost immediately). If technically feasible, duration in a given wallet address would seem to be a better metric to me; or a soft \u201clock\u201d that allows \u201cvote weight vesting\u201d that only applies the weight as it is earned through tenure. I think that\u2019s a better system than giving the weighted voting power out immediately, but I\u2019m not a game theorist. To respond to your other points re: a 6-day voting period, and a hidden vote: I understand the concerns around unnecessary dramatics. We\u2019ve seen in play out here and in other threads around Uniswap\u2019s first handful of proposed proposals. However, \u201cpoliticking\u201d could be better reframed as coordination. Dependent on our governance parameters for a proposal minimum vote count, and a quorum, and proposal passage, we might arrive at a \u201cbetter\u201d solution that needs less coordination and politics to move the needle, but the status quo demands delegation and coordination of multiple delegated blocs to achieve anything. For representative democracy of this style, I think we need the radical transparency to incentivize honest behavior on the part of the delegates. It does come down to the details; how does one do a truly \u201chidden\u201d vote? Will the \u201cvoting record\u201d for delegates be visible after the fact? Public coordination, again, contingent on our selected parameter set, may still be a necessary component, so we\u2019d likely see delegations coordinating both publicly and privately, but now without oversight from the delegators. In a hidden vote, how does one \u201crealize\u201d that a vote will fail quorum? I\u2019m not sure I understand. That\u2019s part of why I think a degree of transparency is necessary. In practice on other platforms, we\u2019ve seen blocs (even where delegation was off-chain/informal amongst a private syndicate) flip votes at the last minute of voting. Your proposal of a \u201chidden\u201d vote is in effect the same thing as asking everyone to vote in that last minute. I agree that we need a system that incentivizes participation for folks with skin in the game. Governance is no joke. I\u2019m just not sure that a hidden vote (again, contingent on other parameters) is a panacea. ",

So, you see, i\u2019m not necessarily married to my ideas. They are just ideas for the sake of learning if they work or not.

It\u2019s how the physics works. Hidden, not-hidden, quorum threshold, radical transparency. These are all levers that trigger the butterfly effect in systems. Let\u2019s pull them and see what happens. If my assumption that the \u2018delegates\u2019 are faithful actors intending to improve the system is true, then we can afford to move quickly.

There\u2019s not necessarily a blueprint for how a DAO should work, but mechanism design is more broadly the area I\u2019ve been reading up on. Organizational behavior is another fascinating lens to look at this through. Mechanism design is full of oddball edge cases that leave me apprehensive about too aggressive an approach in radical experimentation. That said, I appreciate the go-getter mindset. I\u2019ll highlight one additional area of your response: DELEGATES are likely to be good-faith actors. They only derive their power through the consent of the governed, as it were. Whales, particularly exchanges and the like, are not such good actors. They are self-interested rather than organizationally interested. I think stagnation is less of an existential threat to Uniswap than you do; while in a broad sense, staying nimble and uncomfortable can be organizationally healthy, I\u2019d emphasize that we need to do so safely. Particularly with respect to governance, we don\u2019t have a particularly robust risk analysis framework yet to know what changes are going to break this and, in all likelihood, do so irreversibly. In this vein, I appreciated @tarun\u2019s in-depth analysis of threat vectors to governance. (Proposal: Reduce amount of UNIs required to submit governance proposal) for those who missed it earlier). Some of our problems can be solved with engineering solutions; others, as you suggest, will go through iterative development through rapid experimentation. As an aside, I always look forward to reading your posts, @rabbidfly.

The foundation of my claim comes from  cybernetics and \u2018law of requisite variety\u2019. Essentially, it says \u201cthe internal complexity of the system (uniswap) must match the external complexity it confronts\u201d. Trying to predict all outcomes in a threat analysis is important, but you can\u2019t stop there. This is the difference between being robust and resilient. Robust systems end up failing because they cannot possibly keep up with all the threat types and frequency. Resilient systems focus on \u2018rapid response\u2019 mechanisms to address the threat when it happens. I can\u2019t believe i\u2019m saying this, but Uniswap needs to take a page out of Google\u2019s resiliency engineering handbook (we have some former google employees here). Google faces hundreds, if not thousands, of threats per day. The user never notices. Why? Because instead of focusing on robustness (threat modeling every possible type of threat), they instead focus on resiliency (isolate, identify, repair, CICD that sucker in seconds, and get it out the door into production before anyone blinks). This is why i\u2019m insisting on governance progress biasing resiliency and rapid response, rather than the opposite. When a true threat arrives, we will have lost the operational resiliency to address it quickly. That\u2019s my fear in a nutshell. As for specifics of governance, i don\u2019t care as much. I only care that we move progressively towards a resilient state, and will object to governance proposals that would constrain this essential attribute of all complex adaptive modern organizations. The irony among crypto-natives is that the best template for navigating change is still outside our domain. What is mechanism design? ",

In essence, mechanism design is tokenomics crossed with game theory.  I\u2019m essentially a creature of the Santa Fe complexity group. In full disclosure, my philosophical biases are heavily influenced by the belief that complex adaptive systems cannot be measured through mechanistic designs. This is an a priori argument for me, and makes it difficult to evaluate such systems. To be clear, it is not a criticism, but simply the issuance of a point of view, but also helps us understand where we may disagree. (i read through your link btw - thanks!) The core premise behind much of complexity based research is the evaluation around ontology, or causality. Where many see a mechanistic, Newtonian world that can be understood given enough study and investigation, others, like myself, see only probabilities and dispositionality. These probabilities are distinctly non-predictive in complex systems. The world-view models can be differentiated between \u2018deterministic and reductionist\u2019 and \u2018non-deterministic\u2019. I\u2019m squarely in the latter camp. It doesn\u2019t mean that Mechanism Design doesn\u2019t have utility, only that i recognize limitations in how effective its modeling can be in predicting outcomes. For instance, the mathematical notation used to measure a system\u2019s utility and the desire that it exceeds the cost is very troublesome. (in the embedded paper attached to your article link)   This doesn\u2019t account for hierarchical benefits through multiple systems. A system can never be evaluated within itself, but only in the system harbouring it. A car for example, is a system. It has a goal however, which can \u2018never\u2019 be determined by reductively examining a car. Only when you zoom out to scan transportation systems, supply/demand, commuting, freedom of travel, do you being to understand what a car truly represents. Measurement of this network effect is impossible in a complex system. Humans make everything \u2018complex\u2019, even in a DAO with immutability built into it. This forum, governance discussion around the first proposal, is proof of that. If you widen the system to include economic modeling, threat modeling (SEC coming in and poking around), viability of the crypto-anarchist world view given current political environment, utility of DeFi, general prosperity of crypto natives and non-natives, etc\u2026 The point of this list is its length. You begin to see that variables contributing to outcomes are non-deterministic. The problem with attempting to place too much value on modeling is that you restrict the possible outcomes to the number of variables the model can account for.  This is my fundamental issue with these approaches. Many will claim success when they find a \u2018use case\u2019 to demonstrate that a certain type of modeling worked, but this is when i will fondly recall George Box\u2019s quote (famed statistician)\u2026 \u201call models are wrong. some are simply more useful than others\u201d. How i interpret this is to concede that modeling the universe or human behaviour is impossible. Worthwhile? Yes! But only when you recognize the limits. As a panacea it becomes a blunt weapon that dulls understanding.  I thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt with     jumnhy:  Your in-depth posts across the forum bely the notion that this is all you\u2019re saying   When i said i didn\u2019t care about the \u2018specific\u2019 governance changes, it is only because i care far more about the \u2018governance engine\u2019 itself. I\u2019m always zooming out to evaluate double-loop thinking, or problem dissolution - not resolution. Dissolution is when you \u2018reframe\u2019 the system to ensure the problem never returns. In other words, i am challenging the DAO foundation, and privileging that concern over the individual proposals that operate on top of that framework. So, hopefully you now see elevated concern where you may have seen a lack of it earlier. I agree with your suggestion to marry the methods of inquiry together (mechanism design with complexity). If i knew exactly how i would be writing papers about it. This helps reveal that what we are doing is fundamentally \u2018experimental\u2019 in nature. Humans simply have never successfully implemented this type of social organization before. If we maintain that perspective on \u2018experimentation\u2019, we are likely to be surprised by \u2018beneficial\u2019 outcomes. However, if we remain mired in trying to make the existing framework function, we limit the variation in responses, and almost ensure our demise. So, a round-a-bout way to answer your question     jumnhy:  In that sense: concretely, what does cultivating resilience look like in our community here?   It\u2019s a mindset first and foremost. To accept that we cannot possibly predict outcomes through design, only \u2018nudge\u2019 towards our north star (goals). Once you accept the interminability of outcomes, then we can skillfully use \u2018mechanism design\u2019 to tinker with the gears and pulleys to catalyze change. Finally, most people are unaware that evolution (nature\u2019s mechanism for adaptation) works mostly through exaptation, which is impossible to model. For example, the wings of a bird are an exaptation. The reason is that feathers were initially evolved to provide warmth - not flight. The subsequent adaptation to flight would only have happened if feathers had evolved a utility for that species. Most of evolution works in this manner. An experiment is not strictly useful because it proves or disproves a hypothesis. An experiment in complexity-based science, is useful because it catalyzes non-predictive changes, many of which may result in a beneficial adaptation. Trying to \u2018stabilize\u2019 Uniswap governance is the equivalent of slowing adaption and removing any possibility of a beneficial exaptation. In my philosophical model, this is deadly. (we should create a separate post to continue the discussion - i fear we are going well beyond the OPs intent - in Meta-Governance? really enjoy the honest dialog) ",

The answer is what we\u2019ve been saying all along:  cryptoeconomics . Cryptoeconomics is fundamentally about the use of economic incentives together with cryptography to design and secure different kinds of systems and applications, including consensus protocols. The goal is simple: to be able to measure the security of a system (that is, the cost of breaking the system or causing it to violate certain guarantees) in dollars. Traditionally, the security of systems often depends on  social  trust assumptions: the system works if 2 of 3 of Alice, Bob and Charlie are honest, and we trust Alice, Bob and Charlie to be honest because I know Alice and she\u2019s a nice girl, Bob registered with FINCEN and has a money transmitter license, and Charlie has run a successful business for three years and wears a suit. Social trust assumptions can work well in many contexts, but they are difficult to universalize; what is trusted in one country or one company or one political tribe may not be trusted in others. They are also difficult to quantify; how much money does it take to manipulate social media to favor some particular delegate in a vote? Social trust assumptions seem secure and controllable, in the sense that \u201cpeople\u201d are in charge, but in reality they can be manipulated by economic incentives in all sorts of ways. Cryptoeconomics is about trying to reduce social trust assumptions by creating systems where we introduce explicit economic incentives for good behavior and economic penalties for ban behavior, and making mathematical proofs of the form \u201cin order for guarantee X to be violated, at least these people need to misbehave in this way, which means the minimum amount of penalties or foregone revenue that the participants suffer is Y\u201d. Casper is designed to accomplish precisely this objective in the context of proof of stake consensus. Yes, this does mean that you can\u2019t create a \u201cblockchain\u201d by concentrating the consensus validation into 20 uber-powerful \u201csupernodes\u201d and you have to actually think to make a design that intelligently breaks through and navigates existing tradeoffs and achieves massive scalability in a still-decentralized network. But the reward is that you don\u2019t get a network that\u2019s constantly liable to breaking in half or becoming economically captured by unpredictable political forces. ",

Cryptoeconomics is not the answer for governance. It can\u2019t be. The structure for human social advancement cannot be solved via the lens of economic constraint. in the end i offer no alternative except to encourage frequent experimentation, frequent failure, because the fuel for emergence is change. if agents in the system have the common good in mind, then i remain confident that we will incentivize beneficial adaptations. the essential question is and remains, how to incentivize this behaviour? we need something new. perhaps cryptoanthroeconomics. the intersection of cryptography, humanity, and economics is likely to offer clues. cryptoeconomics was devised to \u2018avoid\u2019 human tendencies. it has limitations because, unfortunately, you can\u2019t design the human out of the system.

I do think the discussion on cryptoeconomics is productive, but I also think we should take a few practical steps to get the threshold vote re-voted on and passed.  Until then Uniswap governance is at a standstill. It seems like one of the initial reasons people voted NO against lowering the thresholds is that the \u2018quorum threshold\u2019 and \u2018proposal threshold\u2019 should be two separate votes. Furthermore,  \u2018Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop \u2014 Phase One\u2019 has now failed to pass (which seemed to be a major topic of discussion / fear of many in this thread) Is there a process to re-submit \u2018quorum threshold\u2019 and \u2018proposal threshold\u2019  as two separate votes?

                    "content": "Holy shit, I just happened across this post today again, and I missed a HUGE point: You said this, but I\u2019m reiterating for my and anyone else\u2019s benefit: Quorum is % of total supply, but only votes that have been delegated prior to any proposal being submitted (self-delegated, or to someone else) can participate. This is akin to bullshit voter registration requirements, and even more bullshit party registration requirements, in the United States. Not to mention that delegation incurs a gas fee (not a substantial one, but still\u2026 we\u2019re already solidly in the plutocratic sphere by making 1 $-denominated shared = 1 vote, so it\u2019s kind of insult to injury). On the flipside, you do want some sort of threshold of the total supply to be involved in the governance process. But functionally, you have scenarios where it is mathematically impossible to achieve quorum based on the levels of \u201cvoter registration\u201d. A couple thoughts on this:  Make the quorum threshold a function of the number of delegated votes In tandem with 1.), require some minimum number of delegated votes required for any proposal to be proposed in the first place. Delegation has a sunset provision, ie, lasts only for a given number of votes or a given period of time (I lean towards number of votes)  I\u2019m not super thrilled about point 2, but I\u2019m picturing something with a delegation threshold that was proportional to the amount of votes delegated, ie, if a bunch of votes are delegated, the quorum threshold is high, if not, the quorum threshold is low, with a system minimum established based on the required delegation count. Could borrow from Vitalik\u2019s quadratic voting to temper some of the edge cases (ie, get the bare minimum votes delegated to propose, keep the voter participation super low to be able to pass something easily). I\u2019m not so sure. From our previous conversations, I think I know what complexity would tell us about this: you can\u2019t control every edge case. You can\u2019t mitigate every governance risk. Be adaptable instead. And I agree with that, fundamentally, but making quorum a function of the total supply, while large chunks of the supply are locked up, and participation is limited to delegated votes (so some fraction of the fraction)\u2026 that limits our ability to adapt substantially.
