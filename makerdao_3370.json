I\u2019m very happy to have Bancor and its team with us. I\u2019m also joined by a bunch of enthusiasts of Maker. Mark, do you want to tell us a bit who you are and your role in Bancor? Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   Bancor  [BNT] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application   Mark Richardson, Nate Hindman, Asaf Shachaf, Yudi  Presentation 00:35  01:41 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: For those who don\u2019t know Bancor, could you describe it in a couple of paragraphs?   1920\u00d71080 59.7 KB   1920\u00d71080 100 KB   1920\u00d71080 106 KB   11:41 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I was wondering: if BNT is going down and potentially Bancor is minting more tokens to subsidize this impermanent loss \u2014 wouldn\u2019t that create a spiral in which BNT keeps going down and then you need to mint even more?   1920\u00d71080 70.5 KB   1920\u00d71080 62.5 KB   1920\u00d71080 110 KB   1920\u00d71080 98.7 KB   1920\u00d71080 57.8 KB   1920\u00d71080 95.5 KB   1920\u00d71080 114 KB   1920\u00d71080 92.4 KB   1920\u00d71080 92.8 KB   1920\u00d71080 93.2 KB   1920\u00d71080 109 KB   1920\u00d71080 105 KB   1920\u00d71080 72.9 KB   1920\u00d71080 104 KB   1920\u00d71080 97.6 KB   1920\u00d71080 94.6 KB   1920\u00d71080 74.6 KB   1920\u00d71080 105 KB   1920\u00d71080 198 KB   Discussion  38:32 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I was wondering: usually our Risk team has to do an evaluation and propose what we call the debt ceiling, which is the maximum amount of Dai that can be minted out of a specific token for any kind of given reasons. Would you propose any figure or is there any number that you\u2019re ambitious to start at?   40:26 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: The use case is quite interesting. Do you think that any user that\u2019s going through this process is mainly to do leverage on their position or is it some other use case that you envision?   43:30 - Payton Prose: I was curious if you knew how many other protocols or platforms have integrated BNT already in terms of borrowing or lending?   45:43 - Frank Cruz (in the chat): In our market, what would be an approximate yield for Dai assuming it would drift downwards? Also, does Bancor support dual-sided liquidity for pools with rewards?   48:11 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: A question maybe a bit more technical for the Smart Contracts team: is BNT a standard ERC20 token? Is it upgradable? Is there anything they should look for?   49:33 - Payton Prose: In Maker we are exploring Optimism and other L2 solutions. I\u2019m curious if you on your end have been looking into any of that in terms of helping with the gas fees?   52:54 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Going back a little bit to the market, if I remember correctly you said that there was 1.7 billion TVL. So, that divided by two would be the amount of tokens that are BNT. And you said that around 30% was kind of free. That\u2019s 255 million. I was trying to size the market\u2026   Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 55:07  We\u2019re reaching the top of the hour. Where can people learn more about Bancor and potentially reach you? (55:14). Thank you, Mark, Nate, Asaf, Yudi. Thanks for coming and presenting   Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
