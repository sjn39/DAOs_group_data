                    "content": "I was reading through the Charting a Path For RWAs - The Case For Continuity post (a very detailed, informative, and well-written piece btw) and saw that the underlying message is a call for patience and trust.  I thought it was a great overarching vision that was presented of the future of MKR.  But in thinking more about it, I realized I wanted to add a little perspective to perhaps why there is a little bit of impatience in some of the proposals and the process of onboarding RWA.  I initially wrote this as a reply but it started to get a little off topic so I\u2019m going to start a new topic on it.  1. Shifting Directions Maker got started on the back of investors who saw potential in using crypto native assets as collateral.  The promise was that smart contracts put in place would be able to create a super efficient lending system.  Profits would then be returned to token holders using the buyback and burn model.  This efficient lending system had some issues but it is largely in place with more safety measures having been added over time.  However, the return of capital to token holders has been done away with in the name of growth.  The argument for growth is understandable but it does represent a large shift in what was originally presented.  At the start, there was no surplus buffer.  Later the surplus buffer was meant to be used as a measure to reduce risk.  Now it is used to support growth.  All these changes may be understandable changes but there were plenty of controversies and for those who may not have been onboard as they were approved, there is a feeling of promises broken and frustration.  2. Unsustainable Rise in Operating Expenses Though real world assets certainly present a large opportunity, it also comes at the cost of a massive increase in operating expenses.  As has been stated, these transactions are messy and much more complicated than dealing with on chain collateral.  Because of this, core units are now justified to tack on huge legal costs, professional services, and increasing head counts to deal with these complexities.  These expenses are felt immediately and very visible in the sharp surplus buffer drops seen each month.  Because there is no global budget cap, it\u2019s not clear how high these expenses will spiral to.  What\u2019s clear is that current revenues are not keeping up with the expense increases.  Because there is no timeline for actual realization of revenue growth, what you are left with is impatience and a desire to onboard every collateral application in sight.  Everyone understands that each RWA transaction takes a lot of work and time to realize any value but frustration sets in when months pass with multiple RWA proposals stuck in RFC mode for various reasons.  Of course, not all proposals are made equal and particular attention will naturally be given to those that seem more promising.  If actual progress is made and highlighted, I believe much of this frustration will be alleviated.  3. Growing Perception of Greed and Waste There are four ways protocol profits flow.  Either to core units/delegates, dai holders through mechanisms like the DSR, building the surplus buffer, or back to MKR investors in the form of a buyback.  The aggressive growth strategy advocated for building a larger SB to increase tolerance for risk and ability to experiment.  Ok, for those who bought in, the desire is now to see the SB increase.  But as expenses increase, this can create a sense that core units are monopolizing the profits.  Beyond all the reasons of healthcare, inflation, competitive wages, the salaries and benefits just look high.  The travel, the admin expenses, the happiness perks.  They don\u2019t have a look of frugality to them.  Every expense seems justified in the name of growth but taken together, it feels lavish.  Core units are not confronted with the question of what expense to prioritize.  They\u2019re incentivized to cover all the bases and even build buffers for themselves in case of uncertainty.  I do believe there\u2019s plenty of work being done and teams feel they still need more help but is it being done efficiently?  Is the right work being done?  Or does more manpower just result in more conflicts and arguments over who\u2019s right and what we should be doing?  4. Centralized Voting Power How decentralized is MKR\u2019s governance really?  Only 11.2% MKR or 109k MKR are being delegated.  Breaking things down further, we see 15.6k comes from one address, 15k from another, 10k from another, 8k from another, and 3k from 3 others.  That\u2019s about 50k MKR delegated from 7 addresses.  Almost half of the voting power.  I have not even looked at all the delegates or added quite a few addresses delegating 1k MKR .  Additionally, we have 5.7k MKR vesting to core units annually which have the most incentive and savvy to put those MKR right to work and delegate to people who are on their side.  With such concentration of power, it\u2019s understandable that your average MKR holder might feel disenfranchised.  I often read of an argument being made that if MKR holders don\u2019t like the CUs decisions, they can vote them out.  But really, it\u2019s the opinion of those seven MKR whales that matters. Edit: I may not understand how this works.  What I was looking at was this recognized delegates page. But I was directed to this link for MKR locked in governance which shows an even greater concentration of voting power.  5. CU Influence and Power Core units have a lot of power because they are paid to spend their time analyzing and crafting opinion pieces for their positions.  They have more time and a bigger voice to influence public opinion. They can support their own positions and crowd out critical opinions.  Those who lose faith drop out of the community and slowly the opposing voices fade away. Like it or not, from a general investor\u2019s perspective holding MKR perhaps on an exchange, all these developments make it feel like there\u2019s an us vs them mentality.  Without concrete deadlines, CUs could drag things out to their own benefit and even if we see growth\u2026will that growth actually benefit a MKR holder?  Or does it just keep getting \u201creinvested\u201d back into the protocol?  People generally have some kind of expectation for when results should be seen and if that expectation is not met, you will get frustration. This isn\u2019t a post to criticize any of the RWA efforts.  The vision is a big one that I think many would be onboard with.  The question is whether MKR is headed in the right direction to accomplish it.  I truly believe there are very intelligent and passionate people working for this protocol and I don\u2019t think anyone is trying to actively sabotage it.  I simply want the CUs to understand why patience is hard and hope this promotes efforts for more transparency, clarity, and accountability, ultimately to bring more trust between alienated MKR holders and CUs.

I got involved in this project as a small MKR holder and I understand exactly where you are coming from. Fortunately you are not alone in having these thoughts, and I think you are going to see changes going forward. Since I started as a delegate back in November there has been a lot of talk about growth but so far the only growth I have seen is in expenses. That growth has been monumental though. This is clearly unsustainable and needs to be changed. This governance cycle have several budget proposals coming up. My prediction is that several of those are going to fail.     Traster_Tray:  All these changes may be understandable changes but there were plenty of controversies and for those who may not have been onboard as they were approved, there is a feeling of promises broken and frustration.   Another fight that has caused a lot of people to give up on the protocol is the slow strangulation of the burn mechanic. I can fully understand people losing faith that Maker will ever get that going giving how cavalier it has been treated by the community. It represents a easily understandable way to ensure MKR holders are getting their piece of the pie from the value generated by the protocol. Of course there are several other ways this can be achieved but all of those require engineering resources. I think the negative impact on people\u2019s perception of broken promises has been underestimated by the community at large. Staying true to ones word means a tremendous amount in a world that is as mutable as crypto. ",

I know it\u2019s a delicate issue, but the last thing we should be doing is pushing away talent. Granted, we\u2019re all pretty freshly burned by what unfolded with the CPCU. No one wants to repeat that, and I understand. But otherwise, ya\u2026 not diverting any revenue towards a burn, or some kind of revenue distribution model\u2026 ",

I can\u2019t say enough how much I appreciate the idea behind all the work that has been and continues to be done on this protocol.  I see the potential and the vision.  I see how this can transform, for the better, a very imperfect world.  And the fact that I could even learn enough to write this post and be allowed to write it shows there is a considerable amount of transparency and openness already here. My intent is mainly to present this case so that as decisions are made, those who have more power and influence can be cognizant of some of these issues causing frustration.  The best businesses take care of all stakeholders - customers, investors, employees.  Everyone grows and succeeds together.  The decision to pursue growth through a larger surplus buffer has been made and whether we agree or disagree, we should all move on together.  I just want to be kept abreast of how things are going so I can stay on the same page.  With the buy and burn model, it was easy to see MKR\u2019s supply going down.  It was almost a real time status on how the protocol was performing.  We know that startup costs with RWAs are high and this will take time.  If actual deadlines are impossible, how can CUs help token holders see progress on growth initiatives as they wait for revenue streams to be actualized? To be fair, I\u2019ve been encouraged by recent reports and status updates such as Off-Chain MIPs Collateral Update: What\u2019s Going On or Clarification on PECU Initiatives & Priorities.  I think we could use some consolidation as it\u2019s hard to read all the updates from all the different core units and get a good picture of what actually matters, how much it matters, when it will matter.  But I have come to understand a little better all that is going on and at this point, I\u2019m willing to be a little more patient. There are still issues to be addressed but I don\u2019t pretend to have the solutions.  I think the centralized voting power is a big one that needs to be resolved at some point (maybe some way to convince exchanges to make a way to delegate).  I think a global budget cap would help force hard but necessary decisions to be made.  But I haven\u2019t really thought through these things and I believe the community can come up with a good plan as long as these issues are acknowledged. ",

The promise was that smart contracts put in place would be able to create a super efficient lending system. Profits would then be returned to token holders using the buyback and burn model.   Thank you for sharing this thoughtful post. The section quoted above kind of surprised me because I never heard the origin story put quite this way in all my years of following the project since inception, and much more so since becoming a Recognized Delegate in December 2021 (including IRL conversations with early DAO members at ETHDenver). I thought the organizing purpose of MakerDAO was to provide a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin to the world at a time when others were offering centralized asset backed (or reserve backed) solutions. Even today, the makerdao.com website boasts: A better, smarter currency | Dai can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Admittedly, the precise function of MKR the token and incentives for the token holders in the ecosystem had always been a bit mysterious and opaque from an outsider perspective. That said, your comments shed quite a bit of light for me on the sentiments around buyback and burn. Can you say more about where the mission of providing DAI as a currency fits in with the original promises that feel broken today? In theory, would the OG crew support a different mechanism that could do more to fulfill a vision where DAI is an essential and significant DeFi infrastructure asset in the coming phase of worldwide adoption - real world, tradfi, degens and all (too widely distributed, too decentralized, too dominant to fail!)? Whether there is such a better mechanism is currently up for debate, but I think here is the rub. In my mind, as we realize such a grand vision there\u2019s no scenario where MKR number does NOT go up! It\u2019s a very different investment thesis than where things started it seems. Is it possible to consider change without feeling that promises are broken and frustrated? It is a DAO after all. And by golly, look at the world today vs 2017! The only thing certain is change. ",

I completely left out the stablecoin aspect because honestly, what interested me most from the start as an investor was the fact that stability fees and liquidations get funneled back into the MKR token\u2019s value.  Perhaps that was a narrowly focused way of viewing things but that was where I and I believe many other investors saw the most value.  It certainly wasn\u2019t governance and based on participation levels, I\u2019d venture to say it still isn\u2019t.  Even now, for me, the value of the token is found in the hope that after a growth period, much greater future profits will one day be returned to token holders.  I\u2019m open to being wrong\u2026where do you find value in the MKR token? To answer your question as to where DAI fits in, I\u2019m happy that a product of all this is a decentralized token pegged to the dollar.  I watch with intrigue as all the defi applications continue to develop and grow.  This certainly has been a success.  But if this was the goal, couldn\u2019t you do away with the MKR token and simply have DAI backed with collateral with fees going to a surplus buffer which becomes the backstop for unexpected losses?  Well, I guess this has been the goal because it is actually almost exactly what we have right now. Without the buyback, MKR\u2019s main function is for decentralized governance of the protocol - a function that is not properly in effect and is centralized to a small group of actors.  It also acts as a final last resort option to recoup value if the surplus buffer is exhausted.  So why would one invest in a token where you get only downside risk and seemingly ineffective voting power?  Only if you were convinced into believing it represented the value of the protocol - that if the protocol\u2019s cash flow grows, your cash flow (either present or future) will grow.  But if there\u2019s no present return or trustworthy promise of a future return, then your token is now disconnected from the value of the protocol and there\u2019s no financial reason to hold it.

Without growth you run the risk of oblivion, and I think most people share that thought, which is why there wouldn\u2019t be this drive to grow much more aggressively in the past, the protocol has great products but seems to be struggling to attract enough users, no Marketing and Communication CU, Growth CU is currently doing most of the work, which is good. I think the transparency of some CU is very good, but unfortunately there are no hard facts on how much added value each CU brings to the protocol. I think it is important to identify bad CU and get rid of them in time. Like for example CU Offboarding I don\u2019t want to imply that there are more bad CU, but that the evaluation is so important for each CU. And CU should not lock themselves in, if more people are needed they should hire more people, I think the more people work for the DAO the better, because they automatically become members and are interested in sustainable continuity. You don\u2019t have to promise thousands of MKRs right away - you can start with an internship, which is a great way to get started. CU should not feel that control is necessary all the time, that\u2019s what the facilitators are for, and CU should not feel that they have to beg for money, it\u2019s a healthy debate how much budget is needed in the end, if it\u2019s necessary it will prevail. This also brings us to the critical point of governance, as you also mentioned, there is little incentive at the moment to participate in the voting process so that the DAO is not corrupted by bad CUs and too high costs, even though there are many proposals to improve the system, there are unfortunately no deadlines for many CUs. I think we should put forward a proposal for a redesign of tokenomics and governance with a deadline, because there are few results on these open questions. There have been many proposals for a redesign of tokenomics but nothing is happening, in a vote we can determine which of these proposals is best or a combination of different proposals could be a solution for example.

There are many specific comments in this thread, some of which are paraphrased:  There is a perception that expenses are ballooning out of pace with growth Governance is either centralized or apathetic or both Core Units benefit from information asymmetry to conceal inefficiency and have no formal responsibility towards DAO token holders  I will try and summarize as many of the above as I can in trying to answer the below question:  What should the fundamental goal of a DAO be? My own framework for how I believe DAO work should be conducted speaks to some of the above concerns and is summarized in this post as  Rule 1: The goal of a DAO is to maximize long-term token holder value.  I contend \u201cthe goal of a DAO is to maximize long-term token holder value\u201d is the clearest framing for a guiding principle for every core unit collaborator. Why?  The DAO exists and serves exclusively at the pleasure of its token holders To the extent that token holders represent at the very least governance power: Imagine all the holders sold and a hostile takeover took place. The new single holder would control the budget, multisigs, etc and could terminate all the core units and redistribute the surplus buffer to itself. At time of writing the market price of ca. $1900 per token buys equivalent book value of ca. $80 per token, so this redistribution would be horrifically unprofitable. This might not always be the case, and should anyway be the token holder\u2019s prerogative. In practice, therefore, the DAO exists thanks to its token holders.     Traster_Tray:  So why would one invest in a token where you get only downside risk and seemingly ineffective voting power? Only if you were convinced into believing it represented the value of the protocol - that if the protocol\u2019s cash flow grows, your cash flow (either present or future) will grow. But if there\u2019s no present return or trustworthy promise of a future return, then your token is now disconnected from the value of the protocol and there\u2019s no financial reason to hold it.   How do we as CUs answer @Traster_Tray 's concern?  As CU workers we owe a primary ethical responsibility to serve the interests of our token holders DAOs have many advantages to traditional organizations. However, they lack formal structures for fiduciary responsibility and corporate governance. Many of the transactions in the DAO are governed by explicit contracts. These are enforceable in some respect. Either a smart contract executes under given parameters or a governance MIP gets implemented. The challenge for token holders is that their contracts are almost entirely implicit. Tokens have voting rights and the power to appoint delegates. However, delegates (and token holders they represent) are at an informational disadvantage relative to Core Units. Token holders do not have an explicit contract framing their right to participate in price appreciation. However, the heat of the discussions on the forum suggests that many, if not most, token holders are implicitly holding MKR primarily on the expectation it will eventually increase in value. I would be interested to hear from token holders who don\u2019t have this expectation, to ask what level of price drawdown they would be comfortable with, provided another  goal was achieved. To the extent token holders implicitly hold MKR for this reason, the ethical responsibility of the DAO should therefore be to help them achieve this aim. You can frame this as a moral obligation to protect the most junior claim on the surplus buffer return waterfall. In the absence of an explicit contract guiding our work, faced with conflicting decisions or choices on what to do, how fast to do it, or how much to focus on it, to succeed as a DAO we should aim to always respect the implicit contract the token holders have with the DAO. We should therefore aim at every turn to maximize the long-term value to token holders.  If Core Units are empowered by token holders to work against a mandate, they should be trusted until they are not The flipside is that Core Units, as mandated agents on behalf of token holder principals, should be able to execute without micromanagement. Delegates and active token holders can help add value to the protocol within the limitations of their roles. @Doo_StableLab summarized some thoughts, that I echo, in his delegate platform post:    Doo Delegate Platform   \"Good Director knows they only have two jobs:  Hire and compensate the right CEO. Approve the budget and strategic plan.  Bad Director thinks their main job is to provide good ideas. They think the board\u2019s job is to micro-manage the CEO.\" Which can be translated as onboard and compensate the right CUs and approve the budget and strategic plan. \"Good Director trusts the CEO completely until they don\u2019t. Once they don\u2019t, it is time to make a change. There\u2019s no in between. Bad Director constantly tests and scrutinizes the CEO, making them feel insecure in their role and always on the brink of being fired.\" I am probably guilty of it. Will try to be less scrutinizing. \"Good Director knows that management can only focus on 1-2 things at once. Bad Director forwards an article they read with the subject line: \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t We Doing THIS?!?!\u201d\" Come to think of it, I think many of us make this mistake to CUs. \"Good Director always remembers that they are a fiduciary of all shareholders. Bad Director looks at every decision as: \u201cWhat is in it for my firm/pocketbook?\u201d\" Very true that delegates should make decisions that ultimately support the Maker system and MKR holders.   Token holders entrust CUs to execute a mandate. They should trust them to execute faithfully against this mandate and should be able to believe they will aim to maximize the long-term value of the token. They should also understand that it is an impractical expectation for everything to be done at the same time. To manage the expectation, CUs would help themselves by communicating about blocks and barriers and see whether token holders are able to help to remove these. Furthermore, there are support functions that add more value than they cost the protocol through efficiency to operations, while not being immediately evident or monetizable. This is worth keeping in mind as we examine budget requests. To the extent trust is lost in a CU, they should be offboarded. It helps nobody to live under a constant state of paranoia. But the token holder really needs to be sure the alternative will help them achieve long-term token holder value better or faster.  What does this mean day-to-day? CUs should act like and show that they are permanently obsessed with the goal of maximizing long-term token holder value, for whatever mission it is that MKR token holders choose to pursue. The flipside is that token holders should trust that CUs are working towards maximizing long-term value. Token holders should provide constructive feedback or find ways to help remove barriers or blocks to progress. If CUs are not satisfied with the pressure from overbearing token holders or feel they are costing more value than they add: they have a duty to their token holders and to themselves to resign and find another working arrangement that meets their goals. If token holders are permanently unsatisfied with CEO/CU performance: they have a duty to themselves to offboard them, find a suitable alternative, or propose to step in themselves to meet their objectives.  In summary: Principal-agent problems make organizations work across us vs them lines. Managing implicit contracts through an ethical framing makes it clear that it is really an us+us vs the market. We should therefore aim at every turn to maximize the long-term value to token holders. ",

I am not suggesting this in isolation. I am referring to the dearth of explicit rules that are creating this confusion. With or without clarity on these rules, CUs should feel responsible first and foremost for the token holder. Without the token holder there is no DAO. In return the token holder can be expected also to look after their own interests if they feel their interests are being violated. I think we misunderstand each other and are pointing at the same thing. Governance concentration is a second order effect and I agree that smaller token holders are even further down in the returns waterfall than larger token holders (given their comparative inability to influence events). Therefore merit attention also on behalf of larger tokenholders, who should care for the interests of all MKR holders. What do we do?

It really is ultimately up to the token holders to decide what alternative serves their objectives in the best way. I encourage you to vote or delegate your tokens to make sure your voice, however small, is correctly represented. I\u2019m happy to help to the extent I can if it means the protocol will work better, faster and deliver more value to token holders. ",

Overall, I just don\u2019t see the logic in subscribing to some kind of disaster narrative about the state of Maker. DAI has the most integrations of any decentralised stablecoin across DeFi (and the total supply has 7xed or something in 12 months). There has never been a serious hack or fault in the protocol\u2019s architecture. The protocol is genuinely run by a decentralised collection of contributors (not the sham decentralisation on display in many other projects). And of course, Maker is actually profitable (a rare sight indeed in crypto). By almost every metric, Maker is an unlikely success story. Of course, tokenholders should be careful and diligent when evaluating CU budget requests. But I don\u2019t think there is much actual evidence of an \u201cunsustainable\u201d or exponential rise in costs or waste. Similarly, while I agree there\u2019s new thinking about the protocol and how it should develop in the future, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s plausible to argue that CUs are imposing any kind of new approach unilaterally. The forum is absolutely full of proposals, plans and strategies that are put to the community for input (including signal votes that you don\u2019t need a large MKR stash in order to have a meaningful vote in). Finally, I struggle with the notion that Maker changing focus or direction - in itself - is a problem. This is a relatively old protocol operating in an incredibly dynamic, fluid space. Both delegates and CUs would be doing a disservice to Maker if they weren\u2019t constantly re-evaluating and reassessing in light of changes in the wider ecosystem. I completely agree that there should be open discussion and transparency around these big questions (like what to do with the MKR burn), but that\u2019s exactly what I see: Against the burn, stkMKR: Maker Staking and Tokenomics Revision - #54 by ACREinvest, etc. ",

This would also be a real big win for Maker and Governance in general simply because it should attract much more MKR into the governance contract. And yes, you may not win every vote, particularly at the start - but you may start to get your voice heard more and more each week - voting against the status quo, and voicing why you\u2019re doing so - and hopefully having this voice amplified through the large and growing number of smallholders that delegate to this \u2018SmallHolder Delegate\u2019.

It is interesting to see all the different threads of ideas.  Here are a few more thoughts.  On encouraging small token holders to delegate I think the biggest barrier here is the discomfort many have in leaving the centralized exchanges.  Whether because of fear of hacks, laziness, apathy, or lack of knowledge, exchanges are the easiest way to buy and hold mkr.  Even if there is motivation to be involved, 15-20 MKR is no small sum to the average holder.  Leaving an exchange presents risk and feels like unexplored territory with scary uncertainties.  When you see another account with 70k+ MKR being delegated, it is very demotivating to do the work and pay the fees to transfer out of an exchange.  I believe the greatest source of enablement would be if exchanges implemented delegation.  I don\u2019t know how to incentivize them to do that.  On growth and the surplus buffer. Some people are stuck on the fact that we currently have no buyback and burn and others are arguing passionately about growth.  I want to reframe the conversation by saying this isn\u2019t about whether we should reinstate buyback or whether we should focus on growth.  It\u2019s clear we are headed in the direction of growth and most are onboard with this.  Investors often have a short term focus but those that do have probably already sold their MKR.  This is about trust that growth will actually result in greater future return of capital.  The present value of the token can actually increase if future prospects are visibly bright.  But token holders must trust that there will be a day when capital will be returned.  On the sustainability of rising expenses. Part of this is the appreciation for MKR\u2019s profitability.  Many businesses in growth mode run at a loss and perhaps this is where MKR is headed.  What contributes to the perception of unsustainability is how rapidly these expenses have risen while revenues have been stuck or decreasing.  What contributes to perception of waste is the lack of value or potential found in the details of said expenditures. As you go from being highly profitable to unprofitable, it is natural to feel angst as profitability is often central to an investment theses.  As long as you stay profitable, you have time to experiment without risk of solvency.  Of course, profitability needs to be balanced with competitive pressures, so the question now becomes how effective your spending is.  It is encouraging to see some of the delegates questioning budgets and seeking more fiscal discipline.  For MKR, where we\u2019ve actually tied our growth to the SB (I guess we\u2019re calling it SS now?), expenses hit doubly hard as a decreasing SB would impact growth prospects.  On changes in focus/direction I agree that change can be good and necessary and as I stated before, I\u2019m now totally onboard with focus on growth.  What\u2019s important is how change is communicated and how it is done.  The shift from burning to growth was very controversial and could have been better.  People were onboard with implementing the SB to reduce risk and then onboard with increasing the limit further to reduce risk.  These requests were voted on with stated intention to reduce risk but there was always an end in sight and as the cap continued to be lifted, it grew more controversial.  Then there was a compromise of partial burning that ended with the 250 million cap that was approved quickly because of the recent liquidation problem.  Finally, burning is now indefinitely on hold as focus has shifted to growth.  These changes in policy were done successively and often when the end for SB building was in sight and anticipation for the burn was building.  If we had simply argued for stopping the burn from the get go for growth purposes and that path was rationally discussed/chosen by the community, the sense of moving goal posts or ulterior motives would not be as strong.  You couple this with an unexpected rise in operating expenses which is in direct competition with the burn or potential for a burn, and you can see how many, who had the burn as part of their central investment theses, felt misled. I promised to move on from this but I think recognition of what happened is helpful in rebuilding trust. ",

Any advice and any guidance will be truly appreciated. That being said, i believe that the project should adress this growth matter, this level of expense may become a problem in the near future. On the other hand i feel the CU\u2019s are a necessity, but maybe the project is moving too fast, and there\u2019s is no need to create so many new CU\u2019s at the moment (as it has been proposed recently), at least not before the expense matter has been adressed.

I am here to represent and vote in accordance with the best interests of the DAO as a whole. What does that mean? It\u2019s part getting to know the community and as best as possible vote according to consensus as it emerges. The other part, however, is taking a personally informed opinion on how the whole best thrives through a series of micro-decisions. I vote according to my own mind at the end of the day. If it displeases any MKR holders, they will not delegate to ACREinvest. So, it doesn\u2019t matter how small the token delegation. The reason to do it would be if you like the way a certain delegate thinks, approaches governance and feel they will do a better job keeping track and engaging on your behalf. My observation is that your Recognized Delegates have the utmost integrity, honor and sincerity in how they approach this responsibility. No one is being \u201cbought\u201d to force outcomes on behalf of shadow private interests. ",

Perhaps some are unfamiliar with the SF Core Unit or our work, but we post expense and financial reports for the DAO, every month in a concise report to provide visibility. Search \u201cexpense-reporting\u201d on the forums and you will see every month\u2019s report since we started in September. Expenses having certainly increased since then, but we\u2019ve nearly doubled the number of Core Units as well and have almost certainly doubled headcount. What will drive the long-term success of this project more than anything is the human capital that works for it - whether that\u2019s on a full-time, part-time, or even as a casual DAO member, everyone can contribute. To bring on the best talent, they need to be compensated and motivated to perform. The MKR compensation plan(s) aren\u2019t perfect, but they ensure CUs have \u2018skin in the game\u2019 and are motivated to act in the best interests of MKR holders (since they are one). Should there be a performance component or modifier? IMO, yes, but it has been extremely difficult for the DAO to find consensus on anything involving MKR comp (see the myriad of different plans and resistance to standardize). Back to the spend - I\u2019ve seen misinformation being spread recently regarding expenses, unprofitability, and rising expenses, but the reality is that our burn rate has actually been decreasing recently. Our annualized DAI burn rate was $54.9M in December, $42M in January, and $41.4M in February, largely driven by a reduction in forecasted Oracle expenses. Over the past month, our SF revenue has been floating between $75-85M, giving us roughly 50% operating margin. To benchmark this, Nasdaq companies collectively had operating and net margins of ~24% and 20% last year. Those companies would kill for our margins. Yes, we are a nascent business and our revenue streams are highly volatile, but we are not in the dire straits some have intimated. Here\u2019s a cash flow scenario analysis we performed last month which breaks out the drivers and different scenarios which could lead to breakeven or negative income (drawing from the surplus buffer).  image1387\u00d7959 268 KB  Even so, I agree with the premise that we must be prudent on spend and that it\u2019s unclear what value is being created by some Core Units. This is why I\u2019ve pushed hard for CU performance evaluations and believe they are critical to scaling the DAO long-term. There is already an inordinate amount of Governance overhead and frankly impossible to keep up with everything even as a full-time member of the DAO. Lastly, I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I joined the DAO as a small MKR holder and even officially represented the small MKR holders in the first MKR compensation working group. I was disenfranchised at times and also frustrated by the lack of transparency around spend. So, I started working on tracking spend part-time and started building and iterating on more and more financial reports to improve transparency, culminating in full-time commitment to this project. I\u2019ll close by saying that I deeply encourage you to stay involved and become more involved in the DAO. You\u2019ve got a pulse on how many are feeling and don\u2019t sell yourself short on what you can achieve. \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world\u201d ",

                    "content": "Hi, thank you for bringing specific numbers to the discussion.  I had never seen your reports before but I will be on the lookout from now on.  Part of the misconception may be that mkrburn shows an incredibly high run rate based on what\u2019s being taken out of the SB.  As you point out, this may not be accurate because of things like the 9 million DAI repayment/payment for oracle expenses.  I also see that an 8 million buffer has been created. In any case, I\u2019m going to focus on the recurring workforce expenses since that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been referring to.  Based on your reports we went from 13.2 million in July to 17.3 million September to 36.3 million forecasted for March.  I totally acknowledge your point that from December to March there has actually been a slight decrease (39.3 mil \u2192 36.3 mil).  If you zoom out to July or September, there has been a significant increase and I think maybe some of this sentiment comes from that runup the back half of last year.  The expense for Oracles is a wildcard.  I know MKR vesting doesn\u2019t directly affect the SB but if you add that in, you start getting close to that 75-85 mil number. What we have gotten for these increases are the SES, CES, Tech Ops, Deco Fixed Rate, DUX, ImmuneFi Security, Sidestream Auction Services, Strategic Finance, Data Insights, Starknet, Strategic Happiness, CUs (while offloading Content Production), and I think Maker Talent.  SES is currently still incubating Legal and Transaction, Maker Academy, Chaos Labs, Lending Incubator, and Lending Oversight.  So the question maybe isn\u2019t as much whether things are okay now but how things will end up.  50% operating margin is great if it\u2019s increasing.  It\u2019s not as great if it\u2019s decreasing. Stability fees have fluctuated from under 50 mil all the way up to 150 mil and now back down to the 75-85 mil we\u2019re at now.  Hopefully they\u2019re headed upward but we seem to be very dependent on the macro environment right now and things are tightening a bit.  But even if you get the revenue growth you want to maintain your margins, isn\u2019t it a good idea to keep it flowing to the SB in order to provide more room for growth in debt ceilings and RWA ventures?  Maybe the extra income in the SB actually accelerates growth more than some CUs.  Anyway, I don\u2019t want to insinuate anything about any particular CU.  There are many needs that do need to be fulfilled.  I only hope for more judicious thought to be taken when onboarding or increasing headcount.  I think this thought is taking place right now. Btw, why did you take the revenue and income portion out of your report after September?  I\u2019d love to see those numbers for context sake. ",

Financial Report 2022-03 Strategic Finance   Financial Report 2022-03 Hello all, new mixtape from @strat-fin-core-unit dropping. The financial report for March 2022 is available here.  Please let us know your thoughts and comments on these pages.   Summary Overall Net Protocol Income was 2.7M DAI, -44% from February and -69% from March 2021. Annualized ROE has held stable at around 90%.  Volatility is high in this market. To weather it, we need to nurture and grow our whales, increase the frequency with which the DAO\u2019s makes revenue-gener\u2026     We ping the CUs every month for an itemized breakdown of all the expenses and publish expense transparency reports thereafter. We\u2019re seeing a lot of month on month underspend relative to budgets. We do not consider budgeted but unspent expenses to have \u2018left\u2019 the system and we actually add Dai sitting in wallets to a total surplus buffer figure. We are assuming CU wallets are junior to the surplus buffer in the event of a serious drawdown. Regarding margin maintenance, there is a case for temporarily reduced margins given ongoing investments in growth. The difference with the blockchain accounting universe is it is impractical to break-out capex vs opex, or even in many instances accrual vs cash accounting. So it all looks like it\u2019s hitting the surplus buffer immediately, although the benefits may be some way away that would \u2018artificially\u2019 pump the margin. Please bear this whiplash effect in mind as you review month-on-month figures. For this reason we take a 6mo rolling average window to calculate ROE or it would be nonsensical. ",

We need to make MKR attractive for the average investor! I say this because one of the main points of @Traster_Tray (see the title) was to highlight the perceived detachment between MKR holders (not actively involved) and the CUs.

Regarding underspend, there\u2019s a phenomenon in government (called use it or lose it budgets) where at the end of each fiscal year, agencies rush to spend as much as they can in order to use up the budget they\u2019re allocated.  This often turns into wasteful spend.  It also turns into unnecessarily large budgets being passed every year.  People know that if they don\u2019t spend their entire budget, they lose justification for a similarly large budget the next time around.  I\u2019m curious if initial underspend gets turned into overspend as budget deadlines near. I understand growth may necessitate margin compression.  Is there a target for margin during growth mode?  Is the intent to at least stay profitable? ",

Rather, it is the other circumstances that cause frustration among small holders, such as the lack of measurable production efficiency, the temporary loss of income due to market and internal processes, and the cost increase - together with the suspension of burning.  The dilemma is that our concerns may discourage CU members and take valuable time away from their already stretched timeframe to defend their ideas, which may be flawless, but we cannot see it. The other is that we need to ask questions, because without questions there will be no answers. Coming back to costs, let\u2019s not forget that one very important cost element is not currently claiming its share of the pie: marketing. While Maker is a strong brand in the marketplace among those who know it, its current recognition is due to its longstanding status as a trusted name in DEFI. There is currently no all-encompassing marketingCU. If there is, it will be very expensive and will account for a significant part of our costs, as is the case with other protocols. ",

                    "content": "The average investor doesn\u2019t see the impact of increased spending from onboarding a dozen new CUs. Chances are that smaller holders are crypto users that want to see new products. But how many new collaterals have we released in that time, two? At least Wormhole launch will help but L2 vaults still won\u2019t come until much later. There\u2019s the idea that Maker is moving away from retail users/investors. Growth plans focus on RWA and institutions, but that moves slowly nor can the smaller MKR holder interact with it. So two issues are that users can\u2019t afford to use the protocol and holders don\u2019t value/can\u2019t keep up with governance. The first solution is to provide low-cost vault options for smaller borrowers. The second is in the works with improving marcomms but adding a delegate as the voice of the commonfolk is a good step as well. ",
