U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  \u201cWhile building a cryptocurrency platform that profited him millions of dollars, Arthur Hayes willfully defied U.S. law that requires businesses to do their part to help in preventing crime and corruption.  He intentionally failed to implement and maintain even basic anti-money laundering policies, which allowed BitMEX to operate as a platform in the shadows of the financial markets. This Office will continue to vigorously enforce United States law intended to prevent money laundering through financial institutions, including cryptocurrency platforms.\u201d BitMEX  had a U.S.-based operation and served thousands of U.S. customers, notwithstanding alleged false representations to the contrary by the company.  From at least September 2015, and continuing at least through the time of the Indictment in September 2020, Hayes willfully caused BitMEX to fail to establish and maintain an AML program, including a program for verifying the identify of BitMEX\u2019s customers (a \u201cKYC\u201d program).   Allegedly, in May 2018, Hayes was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack but neither Hayes nor the company filed a suspicious activity report thereafter, nor did they implement an AML or KYC program in response. This is not a new case and really preceded Biden\u2019s executive order as to crypto.    justice.gov \u2013 20 May 22    Founder And CEO Of Off-Shore Cryptocurrency Derivatives Platform Sentenced...
