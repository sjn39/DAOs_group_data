It is currently #1 lending protocols on Arbitrum and #4 lending protocols on BSC by TVL. USX is an over-collateralized stablecoin implementing both Pool model and Vault model. USX can be minted through Vault (single collateral & risk-isolated), or via borrowing from supported lending protocols (pool-based & multi-collateral & market-driven rates) directly. Powered by liquidity modules, USX can effectively combat liquidity shortage by adding or removing liquidity from supported lending protocols in response to market demands, and generate profits from multiple sources for DF holders. USX and dForce lending protocols have undergone extensive code reviews and security audits by Trail of Bits, ConsenSys Diligence, CertiK, Certora (formal verification), with a bug bounty launched through Immunefi. We have withstood a number of market downturn and are battle-tested with more than three years of operation on-chain. dForce is thrilled to join the Optimism ecosystem and service its users with secure and reliable DeFi products. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): Distribute OP tokens to incentivize users, developers, partners who can help grow dForce on Optimism. How will the OP tokens be distributed? Distribution of OP will be decided by DF holders through governance, with the following distribution schedule proposed:  50% for users who use dForce protocols on Optimism through liquidity mining 30% for developers who build on dForce protocols 20% for marketing campaigns (Optimism focused events)  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, BSC, with a couple of others underway. We have reached a TVL of $255m, according to DeFiLlama. Most of the OP tokens will be used to educate market participants on how to use dForce on Optimism and ultimately returned to dForce users on Optimism through liquidity mining. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? 20% of the OP tokens will be allocated to marketing campaigns which help users get to know Optimism, and 50% of the OP tokens will be returned to users who actually contribute TVL to the Optimism ecosystem. Once they migrate to Optimism and are accustomed to the ecosystem, there is a good chance for them to become regular users and reside on Optimism. We also plan to use the remaining OP tokens to reward developers who innovate and build on dForce protocols to explore more interesting use cases which is beneficial to Optimism in the long run. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We anticipate that these incentives will be distributed over a 6-24 months\u2019 time frame. How much will your project match in co-incentives? dForce DAO already has DF token allocation to facilitate the expansion on L2, which will be utilized to reward participants on Optimism. ",

We plan to provide developers with incentives for integrating with dForce protocols or developing interesting use cases on top of dForce protocols, creating financial services and products for end-users in a transparent, efficient, and creative manner. Example ideas would be DEX integrating with dForce Lending as a yielding venue for users to earn rewards from multiple sources (LP fee, deposit interest, and possibly dual mining rewards), or integrating with USX to facilitate derivative trading, etc. Anyone can propose interesting idears on how to further grow dForce on Optimism (yes, the grants will be distributed developers building protocols with dForce as a base layer on Optimism ONLY)! We believe this will benefit the adoption of Optimism significantly in the long run. dForce resides on Ethereum, BSC (#2 lending protocol), Arbitrum (#2 DeFi protocol), Optimism, Avalance, KAVA with a TVL of $243 million. Marketing campaigns will be carried out in different formats, including but not restricted to (subject to dForce DAO\u2019s approval):   With a multi-chain deployment strategy, dForce makes it easier for users to enter the Optimism ecosystem: for example, you can borrow $USX against $ETH on Ethereum, and bridge $USX to Optimism at near-to-zero cost through dForce Bridge. Then you can borrow $OP against $USX to participate in more DeFi activities. We can use $OP rewards to incentivize users to borrow $OP and other stablecoins from dForce Lending on Optimism.   Fund other Optimism focused events.   ",

With a multi-chain strategy, dForce makes it easy for users from different worlds to tap into the Optimism ecosystem. For example, you can borrow $USX against $ETH on Ethereum, and bridge $USX to Optimism at near-to-zero cost through dForce Bridge. Then you can borrow $OP against $USX to participate in more DeFi activities with much lower gas costs. USX is also powered protocol liquidity modules (Protocol-Direct-Liquidity-Provision & Protocol-Owned-Operator). The former is similar to the D3M module MakerDAO deploys with Aave, utilizing a bound-range interest rate to adjust USX\u2019s supply on secondary markets (lending protocols, pool-based bridge, stable swaps with minimized impermanent loss) in response to market demands. The latter aims to take over USX\u2019s liquidity on DEXes - once they become protocol-owned liquidity, it will permanently reside in the Optimism ecosystem.   Yes. The grants will be distributed to developers building protocols with dForce as a base layer on Optimism ONLY.   The remaining 20% (50% through liquidity mining, 30% for developers, totaling 100%)   Yes. We aim to match the $OP rewards on a 1:1 basis, but this has to be voted and jointly decided by $DF holders through governance.   As captioned in #1 & #3, cross-chain liquidity conduit, protocol-owned liquidity, developer grants, together with liquidity mining, we believe will greatly enhance the use of dForce on Optimism with a win-win outcome.

Overall, the proposal is a bit broad and long-term stickiness of basic LM/marketing incentives is somewhat questionable but we\u2019re giving the benefit of the doubt here and look forward to the concrete incentive design - hopefully incl. sticky, long-term, effective incentives (maybe incl.

Stablecoins have proven to be speculative. While USX is deemed to be fully collateralized, it is an algorithmic stablecoin.
