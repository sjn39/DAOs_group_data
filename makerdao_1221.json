Thank you for joining session #12 of Know Your MIP. Today we have a special guest, a recognized delegate, Tim Black. He will be discussing the Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments that he has been working on collaboratively with many members across the DAO. Please feel free to ask any questions that you have throughout the presentation. We will happily take breaks in the action to have them addressed in real-time. For other episodes of KYM, please check the forum.

Have you put any thought into if the interim facilitator that is picked is not supported by the contributors in the CU? And has there been any alternative work where the facilitator is not necessarily the one that needs to be replaced; it is more the team that supports it. 23:42 - David Utrobin: Why would it not be someone from inside the team that would be nominated? 23:51 - Retro: Can anyone nominate someone for the role? 26:53 - Retro: It might be good to jump back to the flow chart and walk through that in more detail to generate some questions. 28:54 - Retro: What time frame are we talking about for the interim facilitator to have their vote? 30:00 -Joshua: What were the cases for facilitators we want to avoid again? 32:00 - Retro: Are there other ways to increase compensation? 32:38 - Payton Rose: What aspect of the revisions are you most worried about/seeking more critical eyes? Is there anything supporting parties can do to help push this proposal forward? 33:38 - Retro: What were your thoughts on a zoom poll or the forums, do you want it transparent to show who is supporting it or keep it a little bit more obscured? 36:01 - Retro: Would an offboarding pursue a different path than an unplanned interim facilitator? 38:36 - Retro: Can you comment on some of the next evolution you may be seeing or thoughts about that future state?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 40:04  I appreciate this call today. The effort that is gone into this and the improvements are very evident, but to talk through those changes and appreciate the amount of thought that has gone into it is definitely something that I hope continues improving existing MIPs and drafting some more impactful MIPs for the future here at MakerDAO. We will wrap up. The conversation is still ongoing on the forums, and there are opportunities to contribute. Pick up the conversation at forum.makerdao.com. We will see everybody at the next session.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
