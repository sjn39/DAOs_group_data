There is however an aave reward program on polygon and avelanche, however i thought d3m was something universal. Are there other reasons I have not found for the low usage?  image1154\u00d7705 53.6 KB  ",

                    "content": "There are several reasons why rates have fallen. As you note, Aave removed rewards so yield-seeking users may have moved to other protocols (or Aave on other chains like Avalanche); crypto prices have fallen leading people to pay back loans to avoid liquidation, reducing demand for loans; rising real-world interest rates may be attracting people back to fiat. There are undoubtedly other reasons I\u2019ve missed. So for now, the target borrow rate of the D3M of 3.50% is above the market rate so no DAI is being generated. The current executive which will execute tomorrow will decrease this to 2.75%. According to this tool developed by the Risk CU, this should lead to about 50 million DAI being deposited to Aave through the D3M which will yield an annualized 750,000 DAI  income to Maker. ",
