I want to be able to keep using the Maker platform to borrow against my WBTC\u2026 but am struggling to find a place to wrap my BTC in a cost effective way. Any suggestions out there? Bonus points: It would be great if Maker had an ability on the platform to wrap BTC for its clients someday. ",

Really the best option seems to be to use Ren protocol and get RenBTC which you can also create a vault or exchange it for WBTC on curve. ",
