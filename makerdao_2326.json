As such, in order to better serve a wide audience, we are seeking some feedback via a brief survey.  - it should not take more than 10 minutes to complete and your feedback will help to shape the future of the Maker product experience! Thank you. Jordan ",

But what with people who did neither or did both? this shoud be decoupled into three questions I believe \u201cHave You ever owned DAI?\u201d \u201cHave You ever borrowed DAI (by CDP or secondary lending platform)?\u201d \u201cHave You ever bought DAI?\u201d Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but question Do you currently own or have you ever bought crypto currency? Could be simplified to: Have you ever own cryptocurrency? Unless You want to specifically exclude people who has been given cryptocurrency (not bought it) and had lost it And last question \u201cDo you currently have DAI that you created or have you ever created DAI by depositing collateral?\u201d I believe is little more clear asked this way: \u201cDo You currently have any opened DAI loan (by CDP or secondary lending platform)?\u201d Hope this will help ",
