The combination of the above has pushed us past the deadline for this week. In order to ensure a safe spell deployment, there are outstanding tests to be run and as such we intend to complete this spell crafting on Monday. A preview of the intended changes can be viewed on the MakerDAO Community Github. ",

I want to take responsibility for the fact that we during this week changed our plans from just delivering a part of the test spell to also delivering part of the mainnet spell. We did so because the CES team is very eager to learn and contribute. We did this however without having a clear handover process in place between CES and PE, which led to some miscommunication. This caused some handover issues that took some time to deal with, that contributed to this delay. We have done some internal review of what we can do to improve this process of working on the spell in parallel in the future, which I\u2019m happy to discuss with you Derek. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the last time we will face challenges, as it is a novel thing to have two teams work on the same spell, but on a positive note, I will say that learning from these challenges will help us build even more robust processes that allow for parallelization of work and greater decentralization.
