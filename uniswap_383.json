                    "content": "Context  Why: Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users (e.g. Dharma, Matcha, etc.)  How: Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps]  Code: https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users   Preface  We have compiled sets of users excluded from the retrospective airdrop due to the proxy contract issue from projects integrated into Uniswap, and validated programmatically that their submitted users were indeed unfairly excluded due to technincal oversight. In summary, there are two rough cohorts of project-types who are affected: application integrations, and DEX aggregators.  Given that these two cohorts have very different sizes and vey different end-user characteristics, we are separating our proposal into two sequential phases \u2014 first for the application integrations, second for the DEX aggregators We divide these cohorts on the basis of how easy it is to programmatically hook a trading bot into them, as this is a proxy for what portion of these cohorts risk representing multiple addresses per end-user.  If an application is clearly tailored towards programmatic usage (i.e. it exposes an API on its landing page), it falls in the DEX aggregator camp.  If it does not, it falls in the application integrations camp.  Our personal opinion is that both cohorts were likely unintentionally excluded and ought to be compensated by this proposal; however, we recognize that the two cohorts engender very different debates around whether or not they ought to be compensated, with quite different magnitudes of impact on UNI holders.  We do not want to conflate the two into a singular vote, and risk jeopardizing both on account of the other.   Phases PHASE ONE: Application Integrations \u2014 12,600 accounts Project      \tAccounts Argent      \t3418  (27.13%) DeFi Saver  \t890   (7.06%) Dharma      \t2833  (22.48%) eidoo       \t301   (2.39%) FURUCOMBO   \t57    (0.45%) MEW         \t4278  (33.95%) Nuo         \t740   (5.87%) Opyn        \t79    (0.63%) rebalance   \t4     (0.03%)  PHASE TWO: DEX Aggregators \u2014 26,598 accounts Project      \tAccounts (overlapping %'s) 0x          \t1772  (6.66%) 1inch       \t4924  (18.51%) DEXAG       \t465   (1.75%) Kyber       \t23933 (89.98%) Totle       \t718   (2.70%)  What Happens Now  We have deployed a MerkleDistributor contract that commits to the Phase One cohort.   https://etherscan.io/address/0x6a9929d29b7488517d383358a847c95a5d1d6d76#code  The proposal we want to submit would look as follows:  * targets:  `[ \"0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F9841\" ]`  (UNI) * values:  `[ 0 ]` * signatures:  `[ \"approve(address,uint256)\" ]` * calldatas:  `[0x0000000000000000000000006a9929D29b7488517D383358a847c95a5D1d6d76000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042b42f28d278eee000000]`  (address:  `0x6a9929D29b7488517D383358a847c95a5D1d6d76`  (phase one merkle dropper, amount: 5.04M UNI)   In summary, it would be granting 5.04m UNI approval from the community treasury to the MerkleDistributor contract for Phase 1. If this proposal passes (and no subsequent proposal nullifies it), on October 17th any third party will be able to transfer 5.04m UNI into the MerkleDistributor contract.  At this point, users in the Phase 1 cohort will be able to withdraw 400 UNI each from the MerkleDistributor contract.   We now need to amass at least 10M UNI delegated to an address in order to submit a proposal to vote.  There are two ways we can make this happen:   Delegate to Dharma at 0x7e4A8391C728fEd9069B2962699AB416628B19Fa.  We are very active participants in Compound\u2019s governance, have sufficient technical acumen and resources to develop proposals securely, and have basically our entire business on the line as \u201cskin in the game\u201d.  We think we\u2019re a great party to delegate to    Perhaps most efficient & quick would be if supportive UNI holders delegate to the Univalent delegation (yuni.finance), and request they put the proposal to a vote. I would not recommend users do this until we receive assurance that the Univalent delegation would be interested in putting the proposal up for a vote.  Note that proposing != voting for \u2014 Univalent could kindly help us get this proposal live and vote against it if they so pleased!  Can folks please help get in touch with Andre, Tarun, Kain, and Stani to see if they\u2019re interested?. We can likely help push them over the 10M line.  I expect aspects of this proposal to be contentious, so I\u2019ll leave the community with a last note, copy-pasta\u2019d from the original post I shared in this forum:  I will note to the community that this vote sets a cultural precedent as to how the protocol treats not only its direct users but also developers who take entrepreneurial bets building on Uniswap.  The status quo has unfortunately punished our users and eroded our reputation with them \u2014 future builders will heed the signal and precedent set by how the Uniswap community addresses this.  Let the discussion begin! -N ",

Uniswap is a great project and has been extremely generous in rewarding its community members! This is extremely positive for the project to have all these great developers of the DeFi space taking active part in the discussions and hope this will continue to be the shape of things going forward, not just for the Airdrop for their individual community members, but for all governance issues of Uniswap going forward. I see a bright future ahead for Uniswap and UNI with this kind of participation! We can never see this happening in real life. Can you ever imagine executives and top shareholders of GOOG.

The moment price goes to shit, the community leaves and everyone loses interest. I\u2019m not saying we should speculate, but distributing 40M USD worth of $UNI today may have a much bigger (negative) price impact rather than it was distributed on a day one, because of reduced volumes. If it was the voting slip for you, you\u2019d be providing liquidity on Uniswap already and getting the free UNI. I don\u2019t see a reason why arbitrage addresses should get free UNI, etc. Moreover, I don\u2019t think a developer needs to have more tokens because he\u2019s building products on UNI. I treat UNI like stock - it gives us voting power, and I wouldn\u2019t want people who have received large quantities of free UNI tokens to vote for decisions that benefit them (or don\u2019t make sense), where I, who put hundreds of thousands of dollars into UNI should pay for it. It is my understanding, that as long as you bought or sold on UNI prior to Sept 1, you should have received the tokens. If you provided liquidity other than in Uniswap, you didn\u2019t get free UNI tokens, and it\u2019s your own fault that you didn\u2019t provide directly with Uniswap. What\u2019s the issue? ",

On my situation (and I guess it\u2019s the most common here): I used Uniswap through Monolith (so through Paraswap) in August, because I like having a wallet with my private key on my smartphone, I think it\u2019s an important vector for Ethereum economy. Then, I used Uniswap directly the 3rd september. But I feel like I could be a member of the UniSwap community as I used it (through a proxy) before. On the Monolith app, I choose to use UniSwap for swapping tokens, so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t choose Uniswap, I wasn\u2019t ever aware of this proxy thing or Paraswap existence but I known that UniSwap was here. So I think it should be the right thing, we are not that much, so the impact shouldn\u2019t be that bad. And it\u2019s not even sure that every adresses on the list will claim their UNI. I think that you could reduce the list and amount of UNI used by letting the owners of addresses asking before the proposal if they are interested for \u201cclaiming\u201d their UNI by themself proving their interest without letting the app tell them \u201chey you maybe got UNI\u201d. Afterall, I\u2019m here, I bought and staked UNI After the 15th, I haven\u2019t be able to claim any UNI on my addresses, and one of my address is on the ParaSwap list. I think it\u2019s fair to users like me to receive some UNI coins. And as I said, you should let users claiming to be on a definitive list proposal if they are in one of the lists on the Github. So less UNI reserved, less UNI claimed, less impact on prices, more fairness in the distribution for member that could have the right to vote and would like to participate in UNI governance. ",

I don\u2019t think your story is really representative of the question being posed here. I think the community needs to consider the Kyber end user solely; just the way the proposal is layed out. Everything else is just along for the ride with what the community thinks happened with Kyber end users. Wouldn\u2019t really make sense in my view to assess the smaller aggregators and use that to make a decision when Kyber is 9/10th of the substance. I can be more sympathetic towards the application integrations where I think there would be less overlap,  but even then, not sure. Think the OP is making a big assumption that these cohorts were left out unintentionally. Think it\u2019s a very valid point that if you didn\u2019t use Uniswap directly you were primarily using some other service. Like lets say 1inch releases a governance token distribution to it\u2019s users, are Uniswap users conversely going to get rewarded for being used by 1inch? I think it\u2019s reasonable that the lines had to be drawn somewhere. ",

I was one of the lucky ones that used multiple addresses. Did I deserve to be rewarded over and above what I \u201cdeserved?\u201d NO! Because I didn\u2019t deserve anything. I also have multiple addresses I used on other platforms that now want an airdrop. Do I deserve to be rewarded even more? NO! I and thousands of other were lucky. LUCKY! That\u2019s all it is. LUCK. A decision was made by those who created Uniswap and their investors. No one is stopping the platforms that want UNI for their users from airdropping their own tokens. If they do you can bet they won\u2019t be rewarding Uniswap users and why should they? They can have their own airdrops with September 15th as the cutoff date, but guess what? There will be thousands of people saying it\u2019s unfair because everyone should get and airdrop up until the date of the announcement. You\u2019ll even have more unhappy people threatening not to use their platforms if they don\u2019t get what they want. Any airdrops by these platforms that want UNI will be full of people gaming the system that started to create multiple addresses on as many different platforms as possible after UNI announced their airdrop in anticipation of a copy cat airdrop like UNI\u2019s. Life isn\u2019t fair. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. No one deserves anything including me. ",

Additionally, Dharma is now the #1 delegate in terms of UNI and, with 15.4M UNI of backing, are able to deploy the first proposal as we please. The delegate distribution, however, is fairly concentrated amongst the top 3 delegates: Dharma, Gauntlet, and Univalent. Before we go and bring the proposal to a vote, we want to invite our colleagues at Gauntlet and Univalent to air any blocking concerns with this proposal in this thread. We\u2019d rather surface and address concerns in the open before the vote is started.  @tarun @andre.cronje Context The following links, in sequence, will give you the background, community discussion, and process we\u2019ve undertaken around the proposal thus far:  Why: Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users (e.g. Dharma, Matcha, etc.)   How: Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps]   Code: https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users    Why \u201cYes\u201d On Phase 1   The spirit of the airdrop: It\u2019s very clear that the intention of the airdrop was to retroactively reward early users of Uniswap with financial upside and skin-in-the-game in Uniswap\u2019s future. The omission of users who interacted with Uniswap via proxy contract interfaces \u2014 many of whom were simply not comfortable with the technical hurdle of using Metamask \u2014 seems incongruous with this intention  Precedent for developer-friendliness: Seamless composability is a core competence & value-prop for Uniswap \u2014 it is very much in the interest of UNI holders to have more and more interfaces and money legos built on top of Uniswap.  Excluding the users of products that took entrepreneurial bets building on Uniswap sets a sour precedent for the very builders Uniswap ought to court in the future.  As I\u2019ve previously written: the status quo has unfortunately punished our users and eroded our reputation with them \u2014 future builders will heed the signal and precedent set by how the Uniswap community addresses this.  Rectifying this omission will send the exact opposite, powerful precedent: Uniswap is a community that rewards builders & risk-takers.   Process rigor & community will: We have conducted the entire process of soliciting community discussion, compiling lists of affected user addresses, and verifying said addresses with maximal transparency.  We\u2019ve given ample room for the community to provide feedback, and a cursory read of the above threads will attest to our belief that the broad majority of the community is supportive of, at the very least, Phase 1.  Happy to answer any questions or comment on any philosophical / technical concerns you all may have! ",

But in my opinion it is not in the spirit of the original airdrop. Why airdrop to users that weren\u2019t aware they were using Uniswap? To quote from the UNI launch post:  Uniswap owes its success to the thousands of community members that have joined its journey over the past two years. These early community members will naturally serve as responsible stewards of Uniswap.  Trading through a proxy contract was not joining the Uniswap journey. It was using the Uniswap protocol without engaging with it. To proxy users, Uniswap itself was an inconvenience or a tool to partially route a larger trade. These users were not engaged with Uniswap in the same way as Uniswap app users. I would vote NO on this proposal, but would be interested for modifications and may be more willing to vote YES if the amount airdropped was reduced to reflect the alignment differences between app users and proxy users.

As I mentioned before, nobody here is saying that developers shouldn\u2019t be supported and rewarded.

I think using the age of an account to draw doubt upon someone\u2019s character should not be used a way to discriminate against someone. Yes it\u2019s very evident that some people are abusing the system and creating multiple accounts to bring a false sense to this forum but really it doesnt matter as what matters are the people who hold UNI who are the ones voting on it and really getting the final say on whether this goes through or not not the people making multiple accounts on the forum unless they are holding UNI in which cases they are as entitled to voice their opinion and vote as anyone else in this forum. Let\u2019s not descend this forum into some sort of dictatorship let\u2019s try to maintain open conversation and talk about the topic at hand so that people voting can have a clear idea on a whole view of the situation to vote on  To close my view is Future Airdrops in general = No Dharma Airdrop so long as they\u2019re within the terms = Yes ",

In terms of the list of addresses being included I think @nadav_dharma collected them in another post and included it somewhere before but again not sure if it was in this post or another but I\u2019m sure they should be able to produce a list again of all wallets as they will need it anyway to know who to allow to claim if this is passed.

                    "content": "Hi Shitcoingambler, I created an account to be able to share my opinion & use-case on this proposal. I haven\u2019t been active in UNI governance previously, but I have been following this topic on twitter and got introduced to this forum by navdav_dharma. I also separately bought about 300 UNI on Binance when it got listed (you\u2019re welcome for increasing the value of your free airdrop  ) I unfortunately don\u2019t have 500 addresses; I have been using 2 ETH addresses for many years (note, neither was in UNI airdrop, and only 1 would be included in this proposal), so I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing my address (would you share your bank account statements publicly on a forum if someone asked?) But I would be happy to share a bit more on my use-case / opinion on this matter. First of all, I am indeed a fairly new user to DEXs. I have been using centralized exchanges and centralized swaps like changelly and coinswitch for years. When I looked into DEXs years ago, the liquidity conditions were bad, and I had already had issues with order spread on centralized exchanges with low liquidity. On-top of that, I wanted to use stable coins for swapping to any pair, rather than first swapping to ETH (which would create issues with FIFO based taxes). Now that liquidity has improved on Uni, and the contracts have been used for longer, I felt comfortable using it. For my trade that is eligible for this proposal, I was looking to buy BAND with USD-C. I wanted to use Uniswap but realized I would have to swap USD-C -> ETH -> wETH -> BAND, which frankly felt intimidating and very time consuming (especially with fluctuating ETH gas prices). I looked into DEX aggregators that could handle this whole process for me rather than executing multiple trades, which brought me to KyberSwap, as they had integrated Uniswap, and could handle all these separate exchanges through Uniswap. Again, Uniswap was the only reason I used Kyber - but also keep in mind, that if Kyber didn\u2019t exist, I possibly would have never gone through with the trade (aka Kyber brings uniswap users & liquidity on top of trade fees). Also, besides for trading bots - which I understand the concern-, I am unclear why it would be an issue if a user had only had a few trades on Uni through a DEX aggregator? I am assuming lot\u2019s of people that used Uniswap only had 1-3 trades total, who still were still valid for the airdrop? I understand you don\u2019t want the value of your free UNI tokens to deflate, but if this is a fair governance program & was introduced to decentralize the exchange and increase use of the tokens / exchange, why would anyone using a proxy contract on Uniswap be any less entitled to the airdrop you also received for using Uniswap for the same exact purposes? Again, to me, I feel I have been cheated out of the airdrop because of technicalities. Anyone reading my case may take it as they wish, and they are welcome to protect the value of their tokens purely out of self interest (which most of the negative feedback feels like to me), but to me this retroactive proxy contract airdrop proposal feels only fair.

I don\u2019t expect all of them to receive the airdrop, so I wanted to see the final list of addresses.  To: Dewp Uniswap allows straight conversion from USD-C to BAND, automatically taking care of ETH, wETH conversion, etc. You made the decision to end up using Kyberswap for your trading needs - all of which because of \u201chigher time savings\u201d. I don\u2019t see why you should be rewarded with the airdop, if you didn\u2019t intend on using Uniswap. The airdrop that happened originally was fair - it rewarded anyone who used the DEX directly.

It would be unfortunate if those users who chose to use value added solutions with better UX were punished for some reason.   It was all free money, designed to reward early users of Uniswap. It would be unfortunate if suddenly everyone who got a free airdrop wanted to exclude others because they already got theirs.   I think not punishing developers who build on top of Uniswap builds goodwill and works to benefit Uniswap long-term, far more than the $ value of this airdrop.   For these reasons, I support this proposal. ",

By not offering UNI rewards to users of the products which have integrated Uniswap, you are sending a message that Uniswap values users who use protocol integrations less. I believe Uniswap users who used a different interface were mistakenly overlooked in the airdrop. These protocol integrations have advertised that they use Uniswap. The punishment in this sense is treating the users of protocols who build on Uniswap as lesser than people who use it directly. By not rewarding the users, you are not rewarding the devs, who took a chance to build on your protocol, and helped validate it by bringing more users and volume. If Uniswap is to succeed it will be by integrating the most protocols, I think it is a good long term business strategy to give every incentive for developers to integrate Uniswap into their systems. By turning away users of these protocols for the UNI airdrop, it doesn\u2019t build up good will with its earliest adopters which will ultimately harm the Uniswap brand in the long term. Also, in regards to your list of protocols. If you go back to the first post on this topic, you see that all of the protocols sufficiently demonstrated they had publicly advertised Uniswap integrations and was the basis for qualification for this airdrop.

Every single one of those projects it\u2019s a well funded, for profit company. Most of them can be considered competitors, some even tried to persuade liquidity providers to move to their platforms instead of Uniswap. They are now pushing for a \u201cone big DeFi family\u201d just because this proposal allows them to gift millions of dollars to their users without spending a single dime. The primary beneficiaries of this proposal are the Uniswap competitors, in two main ways: a) Their users got rewarded for using their app, this increases loyalty to their brand, for most users Dharma/1Inch/Kyber will be the ones that gave them \u201cfree money\u201d. These users can expect these companies to keep doing the same. b) Most of these companies are VC backed, so they have a very strong pressure to show ever growing numbers. Wouldn\u2019t be surprising to find hundreds or thousands of fake accounts owned by the team, these account would enable these companies to effectively highjack Uniswap governance.  In my opinion, for a proposal like this one to make sense, these companies have to offer something of similar value to UNI holders / Uniswap liquidity providers. Most of these companies have tokens, offering to airdrop / gift a similar amount of their tokens to Uniswap would demonstrate that they have good intentions, and this is not just a cash grab. ",

So dex aggregators are entitled to Uniswap, but Uniswap it\u2019s not entitled to dex aggregator tokens? That\u2019s really convenient for dex aggregators. Without Uniswap liquidity providers all of those companies wouldn\u2019t been able to provider their dex aggregator service, in any case, lps are more entitled to get something from them than the other way around.

This may be late in the process, but I\u2019d like to voice a concern\u2013I see that my address is listed both under Argent and through Kyber. This, of course, makes sense\u2013I swapped tokens on Kyber using Uniswap liquidity with the front-end provided by Argent. That said, my understanding was that these lists of accounts should be mutually exclusive; I believe Argent specified that their list was intended to be only unique, non-duplicative accounts, ie, accounts not already included on Kyber\u2019s list. I\u2019m not a developer. I don\u2019t have the technical wherewithal to audit the queries, simple though they may be, that generated these lists. I may be a sample size of one, but my account is absolutely duplicated across these two eligibility lists. @nadav_dharma, you have stated that your team was well suited to lead this proposal due to your technical expertise. Can you give us some assurance, in light of the above, of how the expanded distribution will work? I\u2019m not familiar with the exact mechanism, but I\u2019d like to know that it won\u2019t be as simple as \u201cevery address on all these projects\u2019 lists gets 400 UNI\u201d without any sort of error-checking, particularly with the 2-phase structure proposed for the distribution. My Argent wallet could/would get 400 UNI in phase 1\u2013what\u2019s to stop it from getting 400 UNI in phase 2? @itamar_argent.xyz would love to hear y\u2019all\u2019s takes on this as well. Again, I\u2019m not intending to disparage the effort everyone has made on this proposal. However, if we want this to work, it\u2019s got to go off as flawlessly as the initial drop. Re-visiting a one-time drop and making it a (potentially) three-time drop invites enough criticisms around bad precedent\u2013any hint of a potential issue needs to be clearly and transparently addressed. Thank you for your help, and I look forward to your replies. ",

In particular, single accounts end up interacting with multiple DEXes somewhat frequently. (It\u2019s less common for user applications, where you find distinct smart wallets rather than EOA\u2019s \u2014 for instance, there were no duplicate accounts between the Dharma address set and those of any other projects.) That being said, each account is only included once in the final airdrop merkle root, even if it occurs in multiple projects, and phase two specifically excludes any accounts in phase one (just as both phases specifically exclude accounts that were part of the initial airdrop). I strongly encourage verification of this claim via inspection of the included accounts themselves! ",

I think most were in agreement with the choice that devs made to distribute UNI evenly to Uniswap users. Some positives with this approach include:  An even distribution of UNI, ideal for governance purposes. Increased engagement from users who had little understanding of how DAOs and protocols work, and even less understanding of their place in the ecosystem. Fairness. Users are the lifeblood of every protocol, and in the UNI airdrop they were duly rewarded for their usage.  The UNI airdrop expanded the Uniswap community, and increased awareness of the possibilities around permissionless, decentralised protocols. So why is this airdrop different? It\u2019s not. If anything, this airdrop would bring in a brand new swathe of participation, people who are even more green around the ears and have even more to learn. Crypto is about empowering individuals with the tools to take ownership over their lives, but if we play the protectionist card then that ambition will be left unfulfilled. My two cents. ",

Since \u2018fairness\u2019, \u2018not burning bridges\u2019, and building \u2018good faith\u2019 within the community (specifically in reference to third party devs) was brought up earlier, I feel this same point should be acknowledged for those in the community supporting the project monetarily, whether individually or in a group.   The difference between proxy users and direct users may indicate the need for a difference in the airdrops, were this proposal to go through.   The best thing would have been for this to have all been accounted for in the beginning, so that it would have been a clean launch. Unfortunately this reminds me of the ETH fiasco that spawned ETH Classic. I think no matter what happens, unity is the most important thing, and that means considering the consequences for all sides, not just developers. ",

All voices of opinion are good her but this conversation has got waylaid to the point of ridiculousness. I re-quote the original post posted by @nadav_dharma     nadav_dharma:  Context  Why: Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users (e.g. Dharma, Matcha, etc.)   How: Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps]   Code: https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users    Preface  We have compiled sets of users excluded from the retrospective airdrop due to the proxy contract issue from projects integrated into Uniswap, and validated programmatically that their submitted users were indeed unfairly excluded due to technincal oversight. In summary, there are two rough cohorts of project-types who are affected: application integrations , and DEX aggregators . Given that these two cohorts have very different sizes and vey different end-user characteristics, we are separating our proposal into two sequential phases \u2014 first for the application integrations, second for the DEX aggregators We divide these cohorts on the basis of how easy it is to programmatically hook a trading bot into them, as this is a proxy for what portion of these cohorts risk representing multiple addresses per end-user. If an application is clearly tailored towards programmatic usage (i.e. it exposes an API on its landing page), it falls in the DEX aggregator camp . If it does not, it falls in the application integrations camp.  Our personal opinion is that both cohorts were likely unintentionally excluded and ought to be compensated by this proposal; however, we recognize that the two cohorts engender very different debates around whether or not they ought to be compensated, with quite different magnitudes of impact on UNI holders. We do not want to conflate the two into a singular vote, and risk jeopardizing both on account of the other.   Phases PHASE ONE: Application Integrations \u2014 12,600 accounts Project      \tAccounts Argent      \t3418  (27.13%) DeFi Saver  \t890   (7.06%) Dharma      \t2833  (22.48%) eidoo       \t301   (2.39%) FURUCOMBO   \t57    (0.45%) MEW         \t4278  (33.95%) Nuo         \t740   (5.87%) Opyn        \t79    (0.63%) rebalance   \t4     (0.03%)  PHASE TWO: DEX Aggregators \u2014 26,598 accounts Project      \tAccounts (overlapping %'s) 0x          \t1772  (6.66%) 1inch       \t4924  (18.51%) DEXAG       \t465   (1.75%) Kyber       \t23933 (89.98%) Totle       \t718   (2.70%)  What Happens Now  We have deployed a MerkleDistributor contract that commits to the Phase One cohort. https://etherscan.io/address/0x6a9929d29b7488517d383358a847c95a5d1d6d76#code   The proposal we want to submit would look as follows:  * targets:  `[ \"0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F9841\" ]`  (UNI) * values:  `[ 0 ]` * signatures:  `[ \"approve(address,uint256)\" ]` * calldatas:  `[0x0000000000000000000000006a9929D29b7488517D383358a847c95a5D1d6d76000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042b42f28d278eee000000]`  (address:  `0x6a9929D29b7488517D383358a847c95a5D1d6d76`  (phase one merkle dropper, amount: 5.04M UNI)   In summary, it would be granting 5.04m UNI approval from the community treasury to the MerkleDistributor contract for Phase 1. If this proposal passes (and no subsequent proposal nullifies it), on October 17th any third party will be able to transfer 5.04m UNI into the MerkleDistributor contract. At this point, users in the Phase 1 cohort will be able to withdraw 400 UNI each from the MerkleDistributor contract.   We now need to amass at least 10M UNI delegated to an address in order to submit a proposal to vote. There are two ways we can make this happen:   Delegate to Dharma at 0x7e4A8391C728fEd9069B2962699AB416628B19Fa . We are very active participants in Compound\u2019s governance, have sufficient technical acumen and resources to develop proposals securely, and have basically our entire business on the line as \u201cskin in the game\u201d. We think we\u2019re a great party to delegate to    Perhaps most efficient & quick would be if supportive UNI holders delegate to the Univalent delegation (yuni.finance), and request they put the proposal to a vote. I would not recommend users do this until we receive assurance that the Univalent delegation would be interested in putting the proposal up for a vote. Note that proposing != voting for \u2014 Univalent could kindly help us get this proposal live and vote against it if they so pleased! Can folks please help get in touch with Andre, Tarun, Kain, and Stani to see if they\u2019re interested? . We can likely help push them over the 10M line.  I expect aspects of this proposal to be contentious, so I\u2019ll leave the community with a last note, copy-pasta\u2019d from the original post I shared in this forum:  I will note to the community that this vote sets a cultural precedent as to how the protocol treats not only its direct users but also developers who take entrepreneurial bets building on Uniswap. The status quo has unfortunately punished our users and eroded our reputation with them \u2014 future builders will heed the signal and precedent set by how the Uniswap community addresses this.  Let the discussion begin! -N   so the question is if this were just a governance token representing Voting Shares would you disagree to a second airdrop and for more people to be able to vote or would you limit it to just a small handful as I see it to be right now. As mentioned so well by @Rainbow  Crypto is about empowering individuals with the tools to take ownership over their lives, but if we play the protectionist card then that ambition will be left unfulfilled.

Why would the discussion of another token happen on another companies Governance forums those discussions would be happening on those companies discussion forums surely? I think personally in my opinion better to have more people who bring value to the platform be allowed to have a say and be allowed to vote on any prospective changes rather than just a select few. There are also some big CEX that have a lot of Uni tokens right now so keeping the circle closed could actually end up causing more damage than one would think where as opening it could potentially be the difference to offsetting these big CEX from voting in something that could ideally ruin Uniswap and help the CEX\u2019s So in my opinion airdropping tokens to people who have used and brought value to the platform in the past both directly/indirectly in my opinion will open up the process and in the end show fairer decision making.

Edit: This post has been hided for being \u201coff-topic\u201d, I don\u2019t think this is off-topic, a 3rd party company is giving the appearance of being an \u201cUniswap friend\u201d using deceptive techniques, this is direct evidence of that ",

Everything me, you or anyone says is just guessing really the only way to know is to have friendly, calm discussion and maybe even poll in here followed by a follow up vote on the Snapshot page where only token holders can vote to see the consensus before finally possibly putting it forward for the real vote on the vote page of app.uniswap.org Also this is not a general forum price discussion is more general discussion than governance discussion and should really be put in the Uniswap discord (think admins would agree) ",

As for the snapshot, it is less than 50k votes, around 0.1% of currently delegated UNI or 0.3% compared to those delegated to dharma who presumably support the proposal, suggesting that it is a useful gauge of opinion is ridiculous. Personally I am for the phase 1 distribution but not phase 2, integrations of uniswap in apps provide volume, fees and ultimately extra value to Uniswap and this is a relatively cheap way to heavily encourage that. I think it is worth noting that users in app integrations may be more \u2018loyal\u2019 than those using uniswap through a browser when new competitors appear since they tend to value convenience over minimal fees or other perks and the use of the platform may be abstracted anyway. I do not support a drop to DEXs such as Kyber or 1inch however as there is no risk of them not implementing uniswap integration (it is in their own interest to do so) , they simply go where the liquidity is and their added volume is incidental. Disclosure: I hold/have purchased UNI and would benefit from this proposal on 1 address in P1 and 2 addresses on P2 ",

I think the opposite, if an Uniswap competitor appears any of the app integrations can switch backend without their users even noticing, they are using \u201cDharma\u201d or \u201cMEW\u201d, not really Uniswap, if suddenly Dharma offers them better rates, why bother changing wallets?

If there ever was a snapshot done already, I see no point in using it as an argument here. It was certainly not publicly promoted and it was surely not participated in by a huge part of the UNI holders and certainly not by some of the larges current delegates - Dharma and Yuni.finance. The argument that Dharma updated their website in order to influence the voting for this proposal honestly does not make sense. They integrated Uniswap and trading in general only months ago (July, iirc) and it is only natural that they are gradually updating their landing pages and marketing as they keep adding new features built around Uniswap. For example, they introduced limit orders via Uniswap yesterday, a feature that is not available with the Uniswap frontend. How one can see these developments as non-beneficial for the core Uniswap protocol is beyond me. More importantly, though, another thing that appears to be overlooked by most arguing against a follow-up airdrop for proxied users is that these UNI would go to actual end users. Not to Dharma and not to DeFi Saver (whose users I\u2019m representing here for the most part, though some have joined the discussion, too) and not to any other team\u2019s account - but specifically to end users. In terms of DeFi Saver, the Uniswap integration went live in July 2019, at a time when DEXes were still not that popular and were certainly not enjoying the spotlight that they do now. Users like those from DeFi Saver made millions upon millions of volume and helped the Uniswap protocol grow and reach the success it\u2019s enjoying today. I fail to see how including these users in the proposed airdrop is against the original idea of the UNI aidrop that aimed to include everyone who helped Uniswap protocol attain its current status, but I am following this thread for any arguments that oppose that.

Airdropping more to end users of these companies, when the token is publicly traded, is a disgrace as you are exposing people to potential loss of value.    You may not know this, but many users of apps that are not the Uniswap default frontend have already received the UNI airdrop. Would you say that those should not have received the airdrop either? Because the fact that they did signals that the goal of the airdrop was to reach all the accounts that interacted with Uniswap protocol, disregarding the end interface used. Additionally, three of DeFi Saver smart contracts received the original UNI airdrop. We are almost absolutely certain that the goal there was to reach the end accounts whose funds were actually being swapped via Uniswap (and whose addresses we submitted for this proposal) but the technical solution that was used to prepare a list of accounts was not adjusted to skip through these proxy contracts that some of the apps utilizing Uniswap have in place.     Buckerino:  I find the snapshot a valuable piece of evidence as you can see the power of the small UNI holders who actually have skin in the game.   What would be \u201cskin in the game\u201d in this case? Usage of the Uniswap protocol? Because in that case there\u2019s no difference between accounts that already received the UNI airdrop and those that are being proposed to receive it here. I believe you are trying to argue that users of Uniswap = users of the app.uniswap.org frontend which I don\u2019t consider to be valid, in the light of previously mentioned included accounts that used Uniswap protocol outside of it and, ultimately, the actual concept of decentralized exchanges which are meant to be accessible through a number of means and not a singular website.     Buckerino:  Airdropping more to end users of these companies   The \u201cend users of these companies\u201d as you call them are users of decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance protocols that decided to use a different UI to interact with Uniswap. If we\u2019re looking at DeFi Saver, those are for example users who prefer to use our one app for quicker, more convenient leverage management instead of using the Oasis app and Uniswap separately. Their goal is to interact with these protocols in the way they find preferrable. I would argue that they are ultimately and consciously primarily users of the underlying protocols.     Buckerino:  you are exposing people to potential loss of value.   It sounds like you are suggesting that the primary idea of the original aidrop was to provide participants with monetary value, whereas I would argue that the goal was to distribute voting power and help kick-start a decentralized governance for the Uniswap protocol. However, I naturally cannot speak on behalf of the Uniswap team and stand to be corrected by any one of them. ",

Surprised the vote closed would be interested to know who and what controls how long a vote on the snapshot page is open for is it decided by the creator or is it automatic.     Jay-Prime:  It sounds like you are suggesting that the primary idea of the original aidrop was to provide participants with monetary value, whereas I would argue that the goal was to distribute voting power and help kick-start a decentralized governance for the Uniswap protocol.   I suggested the same thing above and have similar thoughts as you good to see someone else on a similar thought pattern to me it\u2019s a governance token yet a lot of people seemed to assume it was for monetary value or for farming which was not at all suggested anywhere on the original announcement page (https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) I quote this from the Uni announcement page  Community-led Growth Since its inception, the Uniswap Protocol (\u201dUniswap\u201d) has served as trustless and highly decentralized financial infrastructure. Inspired by Ethereum\u2019s vision, we have long committed to the ideals of permissionless access, security, and immutability, all indespensable components for a future where anyone in the world can access financial services without fear of discrimination or counterparty risk. Now rivaling centralized incumbents on daily volume, Uniswap\u2019s success to date \u2014 achieved without involvement of the core development team since deployment \u2014 indicates that there is considerable demand for permissionless financial services. In less than two years, the protocol has:  Supported over  $20bn  volume ($270k of which was socks!) traded by over  250,000  unique addresses across  8,484  unique assets Secured over  $1bn  liquidity deposited by over  49,000  unique liquidity providers (LPs), earning  $56m  fees in the process Emerged as foundational DeFi infrastructure, with integrations across  hundreds  of interfaces and applications  Having proven product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently,  Uniswap is now particularly well positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability . The introduction of UNI (ERC-20) serves this purpose, enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future. Uniswap has always embraced the tenets of  neutrality and trust minimization  : it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. With this in mind, the Uniswap governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader Uniswap ecosystem. In doing so,  UNI officially enshrines Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities .  Nowhere in that do they mention money or Farming but they do mention that all important word Governance As mentioned before hopefully Dharma will answer any questions put to them they feel reasonable to answer and things can be cleared up so the conversation can continue past its current stuck state ",

Also a good vesting program will align their incentives, they would be invested on Uniswap during the whole length of the vesting program.   Sorry, I missed this suggestion previously, as there\u2019s been a lot of back and forth and overall noise in the thread. Forcing a vesting period on this potential new airdrop would in a way be marking and making these users/accounts covered by the proposal less worthy of the original airdrop than those that already received it, which I don\u2019t believe would be the fair approach.

I believe your restaurant analogy is flawed. In a restaurant you wouldn\u2019t have a clue where any of the ingredients are coming from. With these apps you know that Uniswap is there in the backend. Perhaps a better analogy would be how my ASRock B450 motherboard for using an AMD CPU has AMD and Ryzen logos on the box, similar to how DeFi Saver, a tool for interacting with defi protocols including  Uniswap, has the Uniswap logo on its homepage. You know that Uniswap is one of the ingredients.     Pipo-Mandarina:    If this is the case every company that benefits from the airdrop should first sign an exclusivity contract with Uniswap.    You are once again saying that companies are benefiting from the airdrop which is simply not true. The proposed airdrop would be going straight to the affected accounts. And I have to once again highlight that users of some apps already received aidrops without ever using app.uniswap.org or the previous uniswap.exchange frontends at any point. Finally, the exclusivity contract idea just goes against everything DeFi stands for and I don\u2019t think any further comments are needed. ",

Folks are entitled to vigorous debate and I think there are reasonable arguments against this proposal; please let\u2019s keep ad hominems at a minimum and try to stay high-signal in this discussion. In trying to sift through the above, I\u2019ve picked out a few misconceptions I just want to clarify.  If I\u2019m missing any questions that I\u2019ve not answered, please ping me more directly and I\u2019m happy to answer. First \u2014 the proposal is technically not dilutive to UNI holders any more than the status quo. The UNI would be taken out of the community treasury in which UNI is vesting for purposes of investing in the Uniswap ecosystem and its success.   There is a fair argument to be had over whether this proposal meets the community treasury\u2019s mandate, but it is not accurate to say that this is dilutive (i.e. no more UNI would be in existence in the world where this proposal fails than if this proposal passes) Re: @Pipo-Mandarina concerns on whether or not the Dharma web-page made reference to Uniswap prior to the date of the UNI drop \u2014 I feel a little silly entertaining this assertion, as I\u2019m not sure to what extent it should even matter whether or not the word Uniswap was on our website, but it seems to have spooked some folks, so let me be clear: this is false.  We deploy our website very frequently and part of the deploy script re-uploads images.  The copy screenshotted has been on our website since we launched the feature, and, more concretely, the app itself made pretty explicit, visual reference to its sourcing liquidity from Uniswap well-before this time. Happy to answer any more questions as need be \u2014 please keep discussion civil, and assume positive intent. On a more practical note\u2026 Vote Proposal Update It appears that the Univalent delegation has its sole priority set on lowering the delegation thresholds required for proposal submission / quorum, and is not comfortable voting on matters unrelated to that.  We at Dharma are supportive of lowering the delegation thresholds and empathize with Univalent\u2019s desire to abstain from involvement in unrelated proposals. Given that we will not be able to reach the 40m quorum without the UNI delegated to Univalent in active participation on the vote, we will need to wait for the Univalent delegation to submit their proposal and pass it through governance before we move this proposal forward. We are supportive of their proposal at a conceptual level (pending the proposed threshold numbers) and will likely be casting a vote in a favor. TL;DR \u2014 it will be quite difficult to pass anything through governance until the quorum / proposal thresholds are lowered, so we\u2019re shifting our attention to supporting the Univalent delegation in their efforts before we move forward with this proposal.

Shared this in the UNI/ETH thread but it should be here as well. Hey Everyone, I wanted to share some thoughts on the two main proposals being discussed within this governance channel, and why I think we should be championing a UNI/ETH farming pool before any retroactive airdrop that @nadav_dharma and the rest of the Dharma team have been proposing. This proposal is in no way questioning the merits of the retroactive airdrop. As an analyst working in this space I have my own opinions on it, but it will ultimately come down to governance to decide what to do. That is what is nice about governance tokens, my opinion doesn\u2019t matter. To discuss why I think a UNI/ETH rewards pool should come before any retroactive airdrop, I want to take a high level look at what has worked over the past few months in during the yield craze. To me the what has surprised me the most has not been the amount of capital going into farming (You can see growth in TVL here: https://defipulse.com/) but the speed at which this capital has been rotating to different assets. There is no other asset class where billions of dollars can rotate investments in a few clicks at 3am on a Sunday night  But to me this makes it clear that these new assets have no investible moat. That has lead me to ask what does have a moat, and what else is benefiting from this trend when looking at how to invest. To me this is pretty clear, it is the underlying assets that are used to earn yield in almost all new farming projects. This is your YFI\u2019s, SNX\u2019s, LEND\u2019s, and LINK\u2019s. These have all been assets used to farm in multiple farming projects from YAM to Kimchi, and all saw increases in price because of it. I see this because of two reasons. The first being it locks up a significant percentage of the circulating supply causing a liquidity crisis on the buyside. With high yields, more people look to buy the underlying asset to capture that yield, causing a recursive feedback loop to the upside. The second and more important is that it gives an additional use case to a governance token. The token is  making people money rather than just a say in governance  I discussed this more in another thread about whether the fee switch should be a dividend or a token burn.(Message 47, [POLL] How Would We Structure a Fee Reward? ) Alittle different, but apply the same line of thinking here. Turning towards a UNI/ETH pool. By having UNI as an underlying asset to earn more UNI we would accomplish both of the two things outlined above. We would lock up a significant chunk of UNI and holders of UNI would make money/earn yield rather than just a say in governance, and ultimately help end the sell pressure that UNI has been seeing. It would also begin pulling UNI off of centralized exchanges, which I think is everyone\u2019s goal. This should be done before any vote on either retroactive airdrop proposal because it will provide a way for the new UNI holders to make more money instead of just seeing 400 UNI offers across all exchanges. I believe a UNI/ETH rewards pool will have a significant impact on slowing down any dilution in the form of retroactive airdrops as well as begin building a price floor for UNI overall, and would love to see this proposal up for a vote and active before any retroactive airdrop proposals. I am happy to answer any questions or concerns to what I have outlined above. Long UNI ",

Uniswap is benefiting from Dharma. nadav_dharma is an unselfish leader in this space campaigning on behalf of his users to promote both his product and Uniswap. His interest is in achieving fairness in the intent behind the distribution of UNI tokens.This distribution was not meant to exclude active users of the Uniswap platform.

Your claim that you understand the \u2018spirit\u2019 of the Uniswap system is also interesting. I believe this will be understood once the proposal is completed. That\u2019s the nature of a DAO.

The users of Dharma used Dharma a third-party to interact with the Uniswap platform and did not make the effort or have the skill to go to the uniswap.exchange. They neither earned nor qualified for the airdrop.   I think you are failing to recognize that Dharma users would have received the original UNI airdrop if the Uniswap integration at Dharma was only slightly different. This has happened with other apps where the integration wasn\u2019t going via a proxy contract (which allows developers more freedom/agility with how the integration can be used). There are already accounts out there that received the UNI without ever using the actual default Uniswap.org frontend. I\u2019m sorry, but I think your argument (also mentioned by others) that the airdrop should remain exclusive to users of the actual Uniswap frontend simply does not work, since the original UNI airdrop already included users and accounts of many different apps. If you need confirmation for this, you can look at Argent and Instadapp, for example, who both published guides for their users how to claim and withdraw UNI from their smart contract wallet accounts at those apps.

The Argent case was different, the users that used wallet connect to interact with Uniswap received their airdrop just fine, that\u2019s because they opened https://uniswap.exchange/ and did the trade there, Argent was just a wallet in that sense, they are Uniswap users. On the contrary some users traded using the Argent \u201cexchange\u201d integration, those users are Argent users and they didn\u2019t interacted with Uniswap directly, they didn\u2019t received the airdrop.

                    "content": "There has been a lot of discussion about how Dharma\u2019s retroactive airdrop proposal is not dilutive because it would come out of treasury tokens that unlock on the 18th.  TLDR, it is a lot more nuanced than that. First, lets look at what the tokens in the community treasury are meant for: \" The governance treasury will retain 43% [430,000,000 UNI] of UNI supply to distribute on an ongoing basis through  contributor grants, community initiatives, liquidity mining , and other programs.\"  Lets start with liquidity mining. Though liquidity mining is dilutive in nature as users sell UNI to capture the yield, this dilution is predictable and distributed over time. Additionally, as I mention above in this thread (message 170/179) we can remove some of that sell pressure by introducing a UNI/ETH rewards pool, something I think should be a priority before any retroactive airdrop proposals.  Further more, at current UNI coming to market per day, it is highly unlikely that all of the Y1 community treasury will come to market in the first year.  Now looking at grants, again by looking at amount of money going towards grants from other projects such as ANT or GNO, there is no way the full Y1 community treasury will be distributed throughout the year, additionally grant holders are directly incentivized to hold onto excess UNI over expenses as their work should lead to a material impact on the UNI price if grants are distributed correctly.  Even more importantly than that, and why it is so important to turn on the fee switch is that by holding onto the UNI, they will earn a portion of Uniswap\u2019s revenues that will likely cover expenses and lead to less sell pressure.  IMO both of these distributions lead to less dilution and directly benefit UNI holders as it either brings in more Uniswap users leading to higher trading fees through farming and improves overall infrastructure through R&D with grants. Now changing the focus to the retroactive airdrop proposal, we already have an example of how recipients interact with their airdropped UNI from the initial airdrop. 1167\u00d7488 49.4 KB We saw a huge amount of 400 UNI offers across DEX\u2019s and centralized exchanges after the initial airdrop, and expect the same thing with any retroactive airdrop.  This is not to argue for or against the retroactive airdrop proposal, we have our own opinions and will vote in any retroactive proposals.  However, it is to say that arguing that a retroactive airdrop is not dilutive is not nuanced, and comparing yield farming and grants vs the airdrop lead to two very different types of dilution, and different benefits for Uniswap and UNI token holders. Happy to discuss more! ",

There\u2019s a lot of misinformation surfacing in the forums and media, and misinformation is bad for governance. So let me share these assertions:  Dharma itself does not get UNI from its proposal for retroactive distribution. It\u2019s the users of multiple wallets (Dharma, Argent, etc.) who will receive the UNI, for trading on Uniswap via meta-transactions. This is in alignment with the goals of the initial UNI distribution. Dharma is not a UNI \u201cbagholder\u201d, and there is no chance of Dharma \u201ccontrolling Uniswap\u201d. This is something that was incorrectly argued by blockchain media company Decrypt. Some investors, who are not invested in Dharma, have delegated to Dharma, and this is a vote of trust. If the Uniswap Governance parameters remain the way they are (40m UNI), it\u2019s unlikely that any decentralized UNI governance could happen this year. Either voter participation or share of delegation needs to increase significantly for it to be viable. Further discussion: I believe UNI community should prioritize proving that decentralized can governance work. The retroactive distribution proposal is fair and lower risk than the initial distribution, since we know there is a 1:1 user:address relationship. It\u2019s a great step.\"\u2026  ",

By the way, idk for Dharma, but apps like MEW or Monolith, the user could read exactly \u201cUniswap\u201d or better, can CHOOSE to use Uniswap and not something else, and we talk about decentralization technology. So, there should be no reason to discriminate users using Uniswap directly from the website, or directly from a third app on their smartphone. And in someway these apps have help Uniswap to become popular, I heard about it on apps, before using it directly myself (but post-1st september, like the 3rd or 4th), so I continue to find unfair in the way I choose to use it BEFORE the 1st september, and didn\u2019t be rewarded because I didn\u2019t use a centralized point, but used some proxy through third apps. It\u2019s not replay the game, it\u2019s just be more into it, it\u2019s not because you reward people with it, that people will run and selling it, maybe some will keep their UNI and participate into governance, or use it as liquidity/\u2026 So yeah, you can choose to vote against this, but I think we should vote, it\u2019s not changing the rule of the game by letting the vote decide, the vote define the rules.

Until that bug is fixed, I\u2019m pasting the description here: Context  Why: Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users)  How: Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps]  Phase 1 Details: [Proposal] Excluded Proxy Contract Airdrop \u2014 Phase 1  Intention-to-Submit Announcement: Announcing Dharma\u2019s Intention to Propose the Retroactive UNI Distribution  Code: https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users  Contract: RetroactiveMerkleDistributorPhaseOne  Merkle Root and claims: phase-one-merkle-root-and-claims.json   Description This proposal brings to a formal vote the Retroactive Distribution, discussed at length in the above links. This proposal retroactively distributes 400 UNI to 12,619 distinct addresses who interacted with Uniswap via a proxy contract. These 12,619 users are \u201cPhase 1\u201d of the Retroactive Distribution, encompassing users of application-integrations. All of these 12619 addresses were excluded from the original airdrop. The Phase determination was made based on how easy it is to programmatically hook a trading bot into them, as this is a proxy for what portion of these cohorts risk representing multiple addresses per end-user. Phase 1 is the less programmatically accessible cohort, indicating a lower likelihood of multiple addresses per end-user. Specifically, this proposal distributes 5,047,600 UNI in total in 400-UNI increments to accounts held by users of the following projects:     Project Accounts % of total     Argent 3418 27.09%   DeFi Saver 890 7.05%   Dharma 2833 22.45%   eidoo 301 2.39%   FURUCOMBO 57 0.45%   MEW 4278 33.90%   Monolith 19 0.15%   Nuo 740 5.86%   Opyn 79 0.63%   rebalance 4 0.03%    Additional Considerations 1. No Repeat Fund Recovery Proposals Dharma is committed to carrying out the Retroactive Airdrop proposal. This includes proposing Phase 1, and, if Phase 1 is successful, proposing Phase 2. If either Phase fails, we will accept that as the final determination of the Uniswap community. Should both Phases pass, we will not vote in favor of any further retroactive airdops. 2. Dharma\u2019s Commitments to Uniswap Governance Dharma is committed to being an active, engaged member of Uniswap governance, just as we have been in the Compound community. As a signal of this commitment, if this proposal passes, we will commit to:  Giving Dharma users the ability to delegate their UNI holdings for voting, as well as to vote directly with their UNI holdings. Participating in the development of a Uniswap Improvement Proposal (UIP) Process in collaboration with other engaged community members.  ",

I used directly Uniswap post-1st septembre (3rd september actually), and believed I had already used it before\u2026 So after looking through my apps (MEW, Monolith, \u2026) I discovered that I was in the Monolith (so going through ParaSwap) adresses. I choose Uniswap, cause Uniswap looked more trustable than others\u2026 On my apps, it was more displayed than only a logo, and Dharma isn\u2019t even the more respresentative of the phase 1 list. So I delegate my ~41 UNI (40 that I bought + 1 I claimed from UNI pool rewards) to Dharma, cause I support this proposal, and I will do the same for the phase 2. I will not convince you, because everyone seems stuck on their positions here, but everything I can say is that voting is governing, go against if you want, or support the proposal if you want. At the end, if this proposal is accepted, some Dharma/MEW/\u2026 users will have the choice to claim, to sell, to hold, \u2026 their UNI, like had the first UNI holders. I think it\u2019s about fairness, at the initial drop some had able to claim the drop on multiples adresses, was it fair? no, but it couldn\u2019t be avoided. Here, for many users this could be more fair if this approval is accepted. Maybe some will say \u201clife is unfair\u201d, yes it could be, more or less, but when you living under a dictatorship government, you don\u2019t vote, it seems unfair. Here we can vote, even if we don\u2019t have the same weight in the vote, so I don\u2019t think I would vote to make things more unfair even for the small weight I represent. ",

                    "content": "Before the initial airdrop I think most of Uniswap users looked at UniSwap like a tool, not like a community, the community has been made by the airdrop and the UNI token creation. This proposal concern users with a transaction BEFORE there was any community (before the 1st september, as did the initial airdrop). Indeed 1 Dharma user isn\u2019t 1 Uniswap user, and this will not be change by this proposal. As I said I\u2019m a MEW user (without Uniswap transaction before 1st september on this one, so no reward on my MEW address) and a Monolith user (with one transaction on this side), so I don\u2019t know exactly how works Dharma, but the rules of the airdrop as I understand it are stricts enough to keep this another airdrop in the spirit of the initial airdrop:  at least one transaction before the 1st september. the unicity is the end-user address, not the proxy<->end-user transaction, \u2026 So end-user address can only claim once 400 UNI.  Before 1st september, people was using UniSwap because they needed to exchange some token without centralization\u2026 (yield farming, DeFi, \u2026), I used it with Monolith cause they encourage their TKN token to avoid fees using their cards, and Uniswap was conveniently here (and back at these time I wasn\u2019t a big user of Metamask). I wouldn\u2019t trust someone telling that using Uniswap before 1st september was the act of joining a community (especially counting the failed transactions). If Dharma valid transactions in this proposal look like my Monolith transaction ( https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4fbbedb9308aad2c9fe67f420fb2ef23289d68de94d6d861f6351e4a3282e9ac ), it\u2019s doesn\u2019t look against the initial airdrop spirit. (and if I quote TokenBrice from Monolith project on another thread of this proposal ( Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps] ) about how much end-user could profit from this proposal \u201cThe current estimation is around 200\u201d). So yeah with ParaSwap and for Dharma/\u2026 there is much more end-user concerned by this\u2026 But it look fair enough to be supported, even if some deserve it maybe more than other\u2026 Because I think it\u2019s better to handle this once for all than doing a proposal for each plateform later during months (and as the UNI amount required to be able to do a proposal isn\u2019t small, it\u2019s more fair for small project to be in this proposal than alone for making it\u2019s own proposal). It\u2019s the second proposal on vote, and I\u2019m not sure who is on the greedy side, some are against because this could make the price lower and prefer keeping the \u201cinitial community\u201d closed, after some weeks only\u2026 Some probably want it just because 400 UNI free money and they will sell it as soon they claim it. But there is wide more profiles than those 2 extremism, and I guess this could be benefict for the community to make it grow (it\u2019s not because I support this proposal that I will sell my soul to Dharma or MEW or Monolith\u2026 And I could vote against their future proposals if I disagree with\u2026) What would be the worst case? Dharma telling SOME of their customers \u201chey you got 400 UNI thanks to us, go claim them\u201d? Even in this situation every users will not sell them directly after. I guess most of them will sell a part, and keep the other one to become part of the community and vote\u2026 ",

But we can say without doubt that this did not apply to 100.00% of Dharma users.   Yes and that is why not 100% of Dharma users are getting the airdrop, only those who were users of UniSwap are included in this. Same with every other wallet included in the list shared by @nadav_dharm If every single Dharma user was due to get UNI then I could sympathise with you and agree that\u2019s not right, however you can do a quick check on their app store page and see they have well over 10,000 users of their Android application alone and not including their iOS application user numbers. Dharma doesn\u2019t even have the most amount of UniSwap users who will benefit from this proposal, as you can see from the table below, the most amount of users to benefit would be those who used UniSwap via MEW.     Project Accounts % of total     MEW 4278 33.90%   Argent 3418 27.09%   Dharma 2833 22.45%        UniT:  This is not in the spirit of the UNI launch post   Here\u2019s a couple of key vital extracts from that post.  15% of UNI  150,000,000 UNI  can immediately be claimed by  historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders  based on a snapshot ending September 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC.  There\u2019s nothing explicit there saying that the end users must be aware they are using the UniSwap protocol and quite frankly, I doubt the UniSwap team care if they are aware, at the end of the day it\u2019s more impressive KPI numbers for them and those are the numbers make UNI increase in value which is what we all want as UNI holders right?  400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes  ~12,000  addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions \u2014 love you guys.  Have all of the users in this proposals called the UniSwap v1 or v2 contracts? YES.

If they don\u2019t, I think the vote should stand and (crucially) the display error should be fixed before the next (unrelated) proposal. I would note the commitment made from Dharma to incorporate Uniswap governance voting into their app if the proposal were to pass. This would have provided another avenue to vote, and maybe one with the time remaining displayed correctly! Uniswap should be eager to promote a diverse multitude of UIs to offset the failure of any one. Can I just say as a retrospective: to see a proposal once again get overwhelming support but fail by virtue of not reaching quorum is disheartening. Personally I am disinclined to continue to participate in Uniswap governance and I have little faith in the process as it stands. My causes for concern:  Despite the design of the initial airdrop, voting power is highly concentrated. People actually involved in discussion on this forum seem to make up a tiny fraction of voting power. Large delegates aren\u2019t actively involved in discussion and abstain from voting. In some cases, for instance Gauntlet\u2019s position, they have chosen to abstain supposedly to encourage a fairer vote. I think this is a red flag if large delegates feel like they must actually restrict themselves from voting. Quadratic voting anyone? An additional problem with delegates not voting is the timing of their declaration to abstain, if there is a declaration at all. Delegators should know in advance of their Delegates abstaining. Generally there is an unhealthy preoccupation with the short term price movement of UNI in governance proposals, and not a lot of consideration toward how to improve governance itself. Both proposals so far have been failed by the process.  A huge amount of effort went into this proposal from both sides of the debate, over the course of many weeks. Thank you to Dharma for putting forward the proposal and to all the projects that submitted their list of unique users, you fought for the interests of your users admirably. Thanks also go to those who took the time to oppose the proposal with thoughtful discussion. ",
