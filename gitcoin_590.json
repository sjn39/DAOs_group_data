Summary The MMM workstream should engage in discussions with Commonwealth on potentially migrating from Discourse to Commonwealth. Motivation Discourse can\u2019t accommodate a lot of the governance tooling that Gitcoin is working on is working on, such as the steward report cards, and seasonal POAPs for contributors, etc. In that sense, I think it makes sense to explore Commonwealth forums as a replacement for Discourse. Commonwealth as a tl;dr is Discourse but better since it\u2019s crypto native. We already have dYdX and Edgeware on the platform. Here is a 1 pager that goes more into detail: Notion \u2013 The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. Pros:  Explore migration to a platform that is more crypto-native and can better integrate with Gitcoin  Cons:  Nothing  ",

Can you describe a specific example of how MMM (or other workstreams) would directly benefit from moving from Discourse to this platform? You mention the Steward Report Cards, how would these be improved? For clarity: The MMM-Workstream is using Notion and Discord to coordinate. Discourse is used by the MMM-Workstream to post proposals and as a way to signal the release of GitcoinDAO-wide tools, like the Steward Report Cards. ",

I think the MMM workstream should be in charge of deciding the viability since they\u2019re developing the tools that would most benefit from this migration from Discourse to Commonwealth. An interesting thing that could be developed is say I hover over a steward\u2019s profile pic in the Commonwealth forum, and I\u2019m able to see a mini steward report card. ",
