Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP#2 adds the MKR Incentive Plan budget for Core Unit DUX-001: Development and UX. It contains:  Total MKR Expenditure Cap Estimated MKR Expenditure (based on the current team) Escrow Wallet mechanism  The DUX Core Unit supports the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) and Oracles Oracles Core Unit (ORA-001) proposal for MKR Vesting. MKR incentives have been determined based on the Program discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with 1-year cliff vest. The DUX core unit has been working under the incubation program of the SES since June of 2021. The members of this core unit will take that as the start date for the vesting schedule.  Total MKR Expenditure Cap The total MKR Expenditure will not exceed 1982.87 MKR. This covers the entire 3 years plan for 6 FTEs.  Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess of how much MKR will be used with the current team configuration. Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  A raise for a member of the team New hires Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the case of bear market  Price floor: -30%. If any Contributor chose to reprice their program, they could do it at a maximum of -30% from the set MKR price.  Permanent Team Forecast For the permanent team, assuming the team configuration remains the same as today, this would result in the vesting schedule below.     Vesting Date MKR Amount     December 31, 2021 0 MKR   June 1, 2022 366.35 MKR   December 31, 2022 183.18 MKR   June 1, 2023 183.18 MKR   December 31, 2023 183.18 MKR   June 1, 2024 183.18 MKR   Total 1099.05 MKR    This covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the current 6 FTEs. On average, this yields 61.05 MKR per FTE per year. Any changes to these amounts will be reported and reviewed by our budget auditors.  Parameters     Parameter Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6 month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $2,303.81 (12/3/20 - 06/1/21)   MKR Price Floor -30% ($1.613)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR amount   Vesting Interval 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes     Payment Implementation This payment implementation is based on the SES MKR budget proposal  Payment of the MKR tokens will follow the same flow as described in the original DUX budget MIP    payment_flow2860\u00d7970 145 KB   As defined above and in the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages:  Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less, will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the DUX Auditors Wallet, which then acts as an escrow wallet. Following the MKR vesting schedule, after review and approval by the auditors, any MKR that is vesting in 3 months or less, will be included in the monthly top-up transaction that moves funds from the DUX Auditors Wallet to the DUX Permanent Team Operational Wallet. When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor, either directly or through an intermediate payment processor.   Any excess MKR in the DUX Auditors Wallet or the DUX Permanent Team Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions.  This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the DUX Auditors Wallet and the DUX Permanent Team Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. DUX may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team. ",

Vision Our vision is to provide the best governance user experience following key governing principles such as accessibility, neutrality, and transparency. We want to do so by:  Facilitating an optimal decision-making process, allowing routine decisions to be executed in a fast and frictionless manner, while complex or controversial decisions are thoughtfully deliberated.  Providing easy access to information for governance users by helping them find what they need, when they need it by creating informative data analytics, uncovering insights, and highlighting the impact of voter\u2019s decisions. Surfacing the available options by facilitating discussion and collaboration. Creating a frictionless user experience with simple, fast, available, and intuitive user interfaces.   Ensuring security not just for the user and their assets, but most importantly, security for the protocol, avoiding governance manipulation and attacks.  Ensuring availability of the governance UIs and the required blockchain data. Real-time monitoring of the health and safety of the system. Encouraging safe behavior through the user experience. Encouraging participation to secure the majority of MKR tokens.   Bringing governance within the industry forward by nurturing a community of Maker enthusiasts and inspiring the broader DeFi space.   Strategy DUX is a product design & development team that builds and maintains products and tools for the Maker ecosystem, with a focus on governance. Users and builders alike use our tools, such as the Governance Portal, to participate in the governance process of Maker. As an agile product team, our process is based on design thinking and agile methodologies. Through a continuous iterative looping process, putting the community at the heart of what we do, we will work through five stages:  Discover Define Design & Develop Deliver Analyse & Reflect  This process allows us to diverge when uncovering problems to solve and discovering new opportunities, and to converge when implementing a possible solution.  DUX_Strategy_Diagram_04_08_2880\u00d71664 369 KB   1. Discover The core unit will pro-actively research, ideate, and continuously gather insights from different internal and external sources such as: Internal Sources: Quantitative Research  Analyzing user metrics data Running surveys  Qualitative Research  Internal meetings with a focus on feature discovery 1:1 interviews with MKR Holders  External Sources:  Trends and developments happening in the DeFi space at large Feedback from MakerDAO\u2019s forum Direct input from governance facilitators and other core unit members Feedback collected through public communication channels such as our Discord or Maker\u2019s Rocketchat. Input from other existing governance solutions both within and outside of the crypto industry  Ideation  Internal & External Ideation workshops using FigJam Rapid Prototyping Visual explorations  Ideas, requests, and features will be publicly maintained on our Idea Board, which can be reached here. Our Idea Board allows for anyone to submit ideas, report bugs and vote on existing initiatives. It serves as one of the inputs for prioritizing our development backlog.  2. Define Plan The research output, ideas generated, and insights collected will be used to create product backlog items. Higher-priority items will be split up and detailed for inclusion in a sprint. More abstract features will be represented in a roadmap as epics. Analysis of tasks will require studying the state of the art of other governance UIs, understanding different tools and systems that are standard of the web3 technology or that are emerging, drafting technical diagrams, and high-fidelity UI/UX prototypes. These high-fidelity prototypes will allow us to validate our assumptions with the community. Progress will be shared on our Discord accordingly. Pivot or persevere Solutions will be discarded or tested at this stage. Once validated by the community and the team is confident with the available solutions at our disposal we will draft the technical specs and the respective user experience flows. Prioritize We will prioritize tasks that contribute to our mission and vision. The various factors that determine this may include:  Impact on the users and user experience Feedback from the community & governance facilitators Alignment with principles of decentralization   3. Design & Develop As a part of our efforts to deliver best-in-class governance applications, the team will design interfaces and develop software using the industry best practices such as:  Working in a cadence that leverages agile methodologies Collaborative, real-time, and online design tools such as Figma Following web3 standards for dApps development Peer-reviewed code Unit and integration testing   4. Deliver New releases will be announced on our #announcements channel in Discord, the #governance-and-risk channel in Maker Rocketchat, and a dedicated update on our releases page in Notion. New releases will be composed of:  UX & Design improvements New features Bug fixes Documentation  Automated delivery with continuous integration systems In our day-to-day, we introduce unit and integration tests that are automated in our continuous integration pipeline. This includes maintaining and upgrading the automated test suite on the governance portal and tools, ensuring they keep working seamlessly, and providing high uptime and availability of the application. User Testing & QA The team will use various staging environments for performing QA on new features and running targeted user tests. Additionally, the team will keep a list of unresolved bugs visible on a dedicated section of our Idea Board. Open Source The code will be released as open-source, hosted in the repositories that are already maintained by this core unit. These repositories include but are not limited to:  https://github.com/makerdao/governance-portal-v2/ https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js https://github.com/makerdao/dai-ui https://github.com/makerdao/testchain  Documentation The team will commit itself to creating and continually improving technical documentation related to Maker governance. As an example, the team recently created a new diagram to help illustrate how the vote delegation feature works: View diagram  5. Analyse & Reflect After delivering a new product or feature, we will perform usage analytics, run A/B tests, and collect feedback from the users, ensuring that our solutions are in line with our mission and vision.   Team The team is composed of 6 permanent members:  4 Senior Software Engineers 1 Senior UX/UI Designer 1 Product Manager  These team members have a wide range of experience across many different software projects, including frontend, backend, web3, and mobile applications. The majority of the team members have previously worked for the Maker Foundation on various projects including the governance portal, liquidations portal, migration portal, and more.  Current Efforts Since joining the SES Incubation Program in June, the team has already delivered a number of new features and functionality for the governance portal and other projects related to it. Most recently, the team launched the Vote Delegation UI. Other deliveries also include:  Polling & Executive creator UIs Dark mode Dai.js package updates Testchain package updates ENS name resolver Miscellaneous bug fixes   Future Enhancements As part of our current work, we have identified several areas of improvement for the current governance portal. These are ideas that still need to be further iterated on according to the framework described above.  Increasing the availability of the portal and services providing information to it Including analytics and meaningful data visualizations in the current governance portal facilitating transparency and information gathering Allowing for more interactions between users, proposals, and opinions Improving the accessibility of the governance portal Upgrading the testing infrastructure which will enhance the security and resilience of the portal  All of this will be available on our public Idea Board.

Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP#1 adds the budget for Core Unit DUX-001: Development and UX. It contains:  Total Budget Cap: The hard limit voted on by Governance First-month forecast: The actual first month estimated expenses Breakdown of Permanent Team for the expected first payment (October)   Specification  Motivation Based on the nature of the work done by the Development and UX Core Unit (DUX), the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39c2. This is summarized in, but not limited to:  Improving Governance User experience Democratizing access to the voting process and facilitating information flow. Maintaining tools and systems for the governance UIs and frontend tools of the protocol.   Core Unit ID DUX-001  Budget Implementation The DUX budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the core unit Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  Funding an initial 3 month budget for DUX A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism    Team Summary for 2021     Team members Amount     Senior Software Engineers 4   Designer / UX Specialist 1   Product Manager 1   Team Total 6     Budget Cap Breakdown  Dai Expenditure We\u2019re asking for a Total Budget Cap of $483,575 DAI, spanning a 3-month runway. The budget cap differs from the actual expenses of the core unit. The cap refers to the maximum that the core unit can request for operating and it includes room for unforeseen circumstances.  Contributor Compensation:     Type Monthly Cost Quarterly     Grand Total $91,667 $275,000     Budget Breakdown:     Summary Monthly Cost Quarterly     Contributor compensation $91,667 $275,000   Travel & Conferences $4,500 $13,500   IT & Subscriptions $9,000 $27,000   Gas Costs $1,000 $3,000   Professional & Legal Services $12,000 $36,000   Contractor Services (Audits, DevOps) $15,000 $45,000   One time costs - $21,000 (6 new members one time cost)   Total $133,167 $420,500   + Contigency Buffer (15%) $153,142 $483,575     Budget Details: Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items: Contributor Compensation: The initial team has 4 full-time senior software engineers, 1 full-time product manager, 1 full-time designer/UX specialist (for a total of 6 permanent members). The total cost of an employee includes only compensations as a contractor. Contractors have to take care of their health insurance and other expenses. Travel and Conferences (*): The team may travel to present at industry events, attend conferences or participate in a team offsite. Hardware / Welcome Package: An allocation of $3,500 per new team member. (New members only, one-time cost). This includes tools needed for testing features (hardware wallets, devices), and laptop/working setup. IT & Subscriptions (*): We anticipate a variety of costs related to software subscriptions, cloud services, analytics, and tooling. Our infrastructure costs are around $9,000 per month coming from the previous costs that the team\u2019s applications have incurred. We will work to lower these expenses to a reasonable amount by optimizing network usage. However, this cost can spike if we have spikes in traffic. Gas Costs (*): The gas cost assumes testing of voting features on mainnet. $1,000 per month is allocated for this purpose. This will allow for testing of all the features on mainnet with each release. Professional & Legal Services (*): Coverage for legal services, financial services, and payment processor fees. Contractor Services (*): The core unit may occasionally need to hire additional contractors, other core units, or professional services (DevOps, security auditing, quality assurance, etc). Contingency Buffer (*): Approximately 15% of the total cap costs added in case of additional urgent expenses, such:  Increased cost on systems and tools due to high usage demand (Infura, Alchemy, etc) Spikes in gas prices Need to defend the CU legally/financially Error in budget planning  (*) = These are estimated values. The team will generate financial reports and return the excess capital at the end of the working year. Any changes to these amounts will be reported in the transparency reports and reviewed by our budget auditors.  This reporting framework and the monthly top-up mechanism are adopted from the SES. Thank you to SES for their incubation program and guidance.   Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, DUX will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:   Budget Forecast - The amount of Dai that is required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team based on available information  Previous Month Actuals - The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended  MKR Vesting Overview - a schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount for the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway Any excess DAI amount that will be returned to the Auditors Wallet    The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found in this GitHub repository.  Monthly Top-Up Cycle  Seeding the Auditors Wallet In preparation for the monthly top-up cycle, the Auditors Wallet first needs to be seeded with the total budget cap from the surplus buffer. This seeding transaction will be included in the executive vote on the initial DUX Core Unit MIPs.  Monthly Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first 5 days of the month, DUX submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditors Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.  Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, DUX submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditors Wallet signers to sign:   DAI Top-up Transactions \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that has a balance below the 3-month runway forecast. The top-up transaction adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish this runway.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 DUX creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to governance:   Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for the Operational Wallet if there is a balance above the 3-month runway forecast.    Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditors Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. They check that the transaction request amounts are the ones mentioned in the report and that they make sense. If there are any irregularities or other questions or comments, they discuss this with DUX and allow for resubmission if any corrections are required.  Transaction Approvals \u2013 Three of the Auditor\u2019s Wallet signers sign the submitted transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallet. DUX can now use the funds for expenses.  Auditors Wallet Top-Up \u2013 In the next executive vote, DUX submits a PR to top-up the Auditors Wallet to the Total Budget Cap. The cycle can now start again from step 1.    Transfers Seed Transfer   What: Initial transfer of the total budget cap for the 3-month runway.
