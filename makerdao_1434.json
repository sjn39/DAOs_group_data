                    "content": "Since cryptocurrencies were created there has always been a kind of dogma that dictated \u201cCryptocurrencies will serve as a refuge against inflation\u201d this has been dictated since I have identified an economic void, which decreases the quality of nearly everybody\u2019s financial situation \u2014 inflation. Inflation is a natural part of the market, without it we have a balance (which is almost impossible) or we have deflation that would cause the economy to stagnate, as long as there are no consumers, but this is where I asked myself the question, inflation is the actor Why will cryptocurrencies be adopted? Or will there be another fundamental actor? History repeats itself, it always repeats itself and more so if we talk about the economy, then reviewing history we can see that in the most critical moments people take refuge in different means that are much safer than paper money  Now if we go back to the first known crisis that can be seen in the metric above, we know that it happened there with President Nixon and the gold-dollar de-pegging, people being able to change their paper money into valuables For example, the gas:  Price Gas History820\u00d7542 194 KB  Or even oil:  Price Oil History1030\u00d7611 98.4 KB  Or wheat:  Price Wheat History1080\u00d7712 115 KB  And the one who could not miss:  Price History Gold1080\u00d7708 136 KB  These are quite obvious examples of moving your money to a kind of \u201cshelter\u201d and thus not being part of the radical depression that surrounds a crisis, let\u2019s see other examples The CPI didn\u2019t calm down from 1973 to 1979 with the first and second oil shocks and this is where again if we look at the chart the same assets are back at great value but there are several unresolved issues here there will still be people who at that time did not know what was happening or did not have enough education, we can avoid that problem, but what happens to the person who did know but did not have the opportunity to acquire those products or most of them? Now, let\u2019s ignore the 2008 crisis that we all know happened later, we saw Bitcoin being born and there an economic revolution, but here comes the most important part of all, I was only referring to the CPI of the most powerful economic country in the world, which happened with the other countries? Spoiler: several took advantage of this boom, others sheltered and others lost, but now the unknown can be answered Does Inflation Really Help Cryptocurrency Adoption? Let\u2019s take a look  Place the example of these 4 countries for the simple fact of:  Own currency International Unused Currency Similar governments at an economic/political behavioral level Same public exposure to cryptocurrencies (with minimal differences between countries)  If we start with the first country we can take the living example of how the majority of citizens out of necessity had to adopt cryptocurrencies to breathe and escape a little from the abrupt and exaggerated inflation that took the country in 2017, which is my case, Now, as people in particular entered this world, it was simple, the salary at that time was not appropriate (it still is not).    WSJ    Venezuela Says Inflation Rose to 180.9% in 2015 Venezuela\u2019s central bank said inflation last year surged to 180.9% and the economy contracted by 5.7%, reflecting the country\u2019s deep economic crisis.         Time    Why Venezuelans Are Carrying Backpacks of Cash on the Streets Terrible hyperinflation is ruining the country's economy, and could mean the end of Chavizista socialism in upcoming elections      The inflation was so exaggerated that the elimination of the 0 to the denomination in bolivars was the daily bread, but this made the nation look for alternatives and Surbitcoin and Localbitcoin were the salvation    CNN \u2013 2 Mar 18    Maduro aumenta el salario m\u00ednimo en Venezuela en un 58%, pero vale menos que... Aunque los venezolanos tuvieron un aumento de 58% en el salario y un aumento en el subsidio de alimentos del 68%, el aumento real equivale a unos 6 d\u00f3lares. | Latinoam\u00e9rica | CNN  Est. reading time: 2 minutos        If we go to the statistics, we can see that Venezuela has improved and gone from hyperinflation to inflation, it is not good, but it is less bad, and since 2018 (a year later) of the exaggerated increase in the CPI in Venezuela it is observed that there is more liquidity input to buy BTC  Inflaci\u00f3n Venezuela1080\u00d71177 97.6 KB  We know that at that time the stablecoins were not booming as they are now, but we can see that Venezuela was part of the adoption of Bitcoin in the world, now is the Bol\u00edvar still kept as currency? Yes of course, do you buy things with BTC? Of course, there are regulations? For now they are studying it and even want to add 20% per currency or cryptocurrency transaction although it is not working  IMG_20220714_1311551080\u00d71410 310 KB  After hyperinflation, the adoption of BTC and the rise of stable currencies, now in Venezuela it is daily to trade through P2P and proudly be the third country that trades the most BTC today  paises-mayor-adopcion-criptomonedas999\u00d7542 92.5 KB  With Venezuela we can conclude that bad administration, an abrupt and exaggerated economic crisis was necessary to adopt cryptocurrencies, and after the adoption, minor merchants made ventures that helped the economy to recover little by little. Colombia, despite handling less volume than its neighboring Latin American countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, is also going through the adoption of cryptocurrencies, inflation has begun but has not reached limited exorbitants such as Argentina or Venezuela  IMG_20220714_1329071080\u00d71165 204 KB  But if we look at inflation, it is not as notable as that of Argentina and Venezuela, and therefore the exposure to cryptocurrencies en masse is not as notable in the coffee country as in the Argentine or Venezuelan country.    Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo \u2013 12 Jul 22    Las criptomonedas mueven $70.000 millones en transacciones en Colombia       The case of Argentina is much easier to understand, as stablecoins were involved to help smaller traders escape inflation, there was an exaggerated increase in P2P transactions on Binance and despite being only the Localbitcoin metrics and being in a down season, the trading volumes are quite high  Comrade @TRUEMAKER  made a good summary with outstanding news of what happened in Argentina.     Argentines seek USD exposure via stablecoins amid surging inflation Latin America       DAI\u2019s use case for LATAM inflation hedges remains strong. Exchanges were closed during the weekend, when the resignation was announced, while crypto markets were opened  and allowed Argentines to save a portion of their savings.    \u201cFollowing Guzman\u2019s resignation, the peso depreciated about 15% against the stablecoins DAI and tether on several leading local exchanges\u2019 platforms\u201d    \u201cAccording to the corporation, \u201cmany people\u201d used their DAI as collateral to secure loans in Argentine pesos and bu\u2026      IMG_20220714_1331561080\u00d71532 170 KB  Now if we observe the inflation of Argentina is also exaggerated compared to the Colombian, finally the exposure of cryptocurrencies is more notable in the Argentine country In order not to include Latin American countries in the statistics, we also add Turkey, which is one of the most affected countries post-Covid  IMG_20220714_1335031080\u00d71181 210 KB     the Guardian \u2013 4 Jul 22    Turkey hit with soaring prices as inflation nears 80% Growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in June, but real rate could be double official figure      A high volume of trade can be noted after the announcement of the roaring inflation The exposure of the Turks has been quite high for years but not falling as in other European countries  With this we can arrive at several hypotheses, currency exchanges in the old days, even in recent times, were quite difficult, exchanging bolivars, farts in authorized exchange houses was a process and paperwork, when any news arrives controversy as it happened in Argentina would make it difficult to change those pesos to dollars in a matter of minutes, with cryptocurrencies and stable currencies that changed Compared to previous crises, oil, wheat, gas do not play an important role in retail investors, since obtaining them is difficult or impossible and they opt for cryptocurrencies A country with mild inflation will not have a rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies like Colombia, even if its president is pro-bitcoin Inflation is something that will follow us for the rest of our lives, cryptocurrencies are an alternative to facilitate protecting the asset or the local currency in times of crisis. And the most important conclusion is: Hyperinflation helps the adoption of cryptocurrencies quickly and efficiently. ",

A few other key factors that increase cryptocurrency adoption pace are restrictive financial services such as limited FX market, dollar availability, cash exit and import tax and remittance costs. All these factors lead to the creation of  \u201cblack\u201d markets for trading local currency to foreign currency (usually dollars) which reflects the actual FX rate. Today, the only way to eliminate these \u201cadditional\u201d costs and limitations is through crypto. ",
