                    "content": "I was the facilitator & scribe. Here\u2019s the HackMD. A lot of the discussion ended up revolving around Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) inter-operating with EIPs. Action items are at the bottom, to be turned into Github issues in relevant repos.  ?? Brazil  Genisis Block VC fund university  Sam / Aion  AIP process modeled on EIPs  Chelsea  open source Spankchain \u2013 community education newcomers be a part of the process, non tech have a voice EIPs going somewhere  Chaals  work for EEA long background in W3C  Thor Bryant  freelancer helping clients understand technology Vyper EVM languages education through EthSecDevs  Brooke  open source \u2013 distributed systems and FP generally a big fan of specs specs are even better than open source  Dan  standards team at Pegasys like Chaals, active in W3C, and some at the IETF  Cyrus  work at Splyt autonomous teams / organizations and scaling them part of the open source community \u2013 excited to bring my skills, and scaling to this space  James  New Zealand blockchain economics think  Alex  Consensus Working with EEA getting people using open model interested in open source model  MP  work at Golem working towards an indsitution of incluseion  Amber  Clovyr dev tools permissioned and public chains involved  Bob  been involved with ETH for 3.5 years at EF, Consensus  Gary  crypto 5 years EF in Switzerland interested  EEA Amber  Ethereum Enterprise Alliance Heavy focus on permissioned Also bridging to public Everything around using in business \u2013 throughput, privacy, etc. Common industry providers  Alex  not much was produced initially other than discussions reformed industry groups \u2013 use cases, happenings, create requirements in addition to requirements to clients \u2013 message formats, and specs how called Special Interest Groups (SIGs) on the other side is tech focused groups \u2013 what are some baseline things we need to figure out, identity, off-chain trusted execution Technical Specification Working Group Main product towards a specification of what an Ethereum client must be capable of doing to be considered Enterprise grade, and then on top industry specific \u2013 e.g. healthcare might need encryption whole goal is an entire spec \u2013 everyone is focused on the spec  Chaals  client spec v1 open source the specs layer we will have a version 2 of the spec will have a spec for offchain trusted computing \u2013 taskforce has Golem, iExec, Intel, IBM, etc. need a process for building the spec we had a starting point \u2013 then revisions pushed out consensus based process \u2013 find a bit of the spec that is rubbish / sub optimal \u2013 make a proposal \u2013 proposals get shopped around a working group when they get consensus \u2013 EEA has a formal voting system \u2013 if you have to have a vote spec on private Github except when published specs  Amber  discussion about tech specs \u2013 supposed to be default to be open technical discussion to be more public?  Chaals  will keep pushing for it to be open various things connected to member organizations EEA is trying to push ahead with things that are important want to base this stuff on Ethereum \u2013 base it on public Ethereum \u2013 get engineer in, they already know it from the open compatability has business value some of those extensions are things that will never get into public Ethereum people will want to have a number of things in public ethereum, permissioning figuring out how we work in a way, that change will be in public ethereum much better than public world going in one way, and EEA another direction \u2013 want to converge how do we do that? various ideas \u2013 we should do this an EIP  Alex  did biz dev for Consensus serious lack of education people think Enterprise Ethereum is a thing \u2013 rather than interoperability Quorum is rushing to take improvements from Geth, etc. Enterprise should be participating been in these conversations  Chaals  Pantheon / Pegasys at Consensys \u2013 Java Based Public first and then go Enterprise  Chelsea  close everything and better solutions  ??  why not better closed rather than open?  Bob  Vice Chair on Tech Committee everything on technical should be public \u2013 but went the other way  Amber  Amber was arguing concern is that if you want them to make EIP if people don\u2019t feel incentivized  Describe EIPs / ERCs Process Boris  describes  Alex  not timebound?  Brooke  EIPs vs. ERCs ERCs are simple \u2013 as the author, can make FINAL CALL Then ACCEPTED If no one implements, too bad As the author, can make it as ACCEPTED EIPs \u2013 even if accepted, needs to be implemented  Bryant  with ERCs less people involved EIPs have more editors  Chaals  AllCoreDevs \u2013 all clients active? how many?  60 EIPs vs ERCs? Will look for real data 54 core Boris  EIPs / ERCs  ABI Spec Vyper compiler Non standard proposals JSON RPC AMber  Mainnet connects? Maybe 2 or 3 Dozen clients \u2013 Enterprise ethereum  Chaals  our interest to have a standard  Don  speak to protections against patent trolls one of the reasons for being a member of EEA is for patent protection  Boris  not aware of anything  Chelsea  isn\u2019t patents trolling?  Chaals  enterprise would prefer no patents  Boris  explain  Brooke  Apache has a patent covenant Outputs of this ring Should there be a license that applies?  Thor  wondering, if EEA members worry that it isn\u2019t accepted? I don\u2019t think we need new licenses \u2013 doesn\u2019t exist in the web sphere?  Chaals  W3C went through a process of developing a patent license through their prose built a patent policy \u2013 was controversial if you want to put something in the spec, you can\u2019t patent (patent covenant)  Chaals  work out how to make a proposal possibility is you submit an EIP, do it in parallel discussions in private and public  Amber  legitimate concerns any proposal from enterprise may add bloat concern that they will die in EIP then you end with ego looks like they failed  Chaals  is a real issue won\u2019t do it because they\u2019re nervous my company has this idea, submitted it, get yelled at by public people strong disincentive for individuals who are afraid AFAIK no one has taken a proposal and put it in as an EIP  Bob  something comes both ways talked to Hudson (EF AllCoreDevs project manager) have a process, can have specs that are better  Amber  \u201cnot our problem\u201d --> not just enterprise should have funds not two teams  Alex  vision for Ethereum? expression of vision hand slapped around \u201cwe\u201d  Chelsea  for eons open source has done emotional labour that have been co-opted then people have to pay  Boris  long answer to there is no \u201cwe\u201d  Amber  tried to push through EIPs approached by EF and tried to push it out the process didn\u2019t go forward, lots of people fighting meritocracy is an illusion  Alex  point of EIPs is that it needs to be deployed on public net?  Bryant  if community believe that it adds to the use cases  Brooke  there are people who want nothing to do with corporation  James  moving at lightning speed maybe code isn\u2019t being put in (specs) blockchain POCs are 80% failing  Chaals  if it looks irrelevant to public chain \u2013 no point doing standards work is expensive don\u2019t do it if there is no value we believe there is a real use case for mainnet if proposed contributor believed that if EEA was running a mainnet process and a private process counter-example: lots of requirements for mainnet clients \u2013 don\u2019t need to do PoW turns out lots do \u2013 that aspire to run on mainnet \u2013 making it a requirement  MP  no core devs here is this political? if enterprise has an EIP, nothing happens, because you have to pull strings, there might be other actors also because it takes dev into a political maybe we need to think about other ways to have representatives  Brooke  we\u2019re doing lots of analysis of why nobody trusts each other? what\u2019s a next step  Jason  working with large enterprise change that is incentives when considering interoperability the point is to have the same access \u2013 whoever they are additional changes to EIPs, then needs will grow exponently shouldn\u2019t think about enterprise in a way that benefits them  Chaals  biggest enterprise are very big \u2013 the smallest are quite small politics happens when you put people together optimize for getting work done concrete things have a look through enterprise issues \u2013 can ask other members let\u2019s pick out which might be an EIP I would like to see EIP process \u2013 figure out a patent policy  Alex  curious to enterprise to articulate what more could get on to mainnet  ??  what is the size of the gap? what is cool?  Amber  maturing some of the privacy pieces precompiles for zkSNARKS  Chaals  permissions are smart contracts on network what does it take to decide to work on mainnet  Chelsea  nothing optimizes for politics as opacity and closed systems  Dan  implementing part of the community that have talked privatey will be either beneficial to mainnet or not no more or less important than other members  Amber  non controversial piece is privacy EEA has enough contentious on the inside \u2013 it\u2019s just as hard on the inside as bringing it to public more and more questions about who benefits from improvements  Chaals  also the case, because it\u2019s an individual act will be a pain \u2013 let individuals  Amber  literally as a corporate employee the EEA as whole could publish  Chaals  could get a rough list  Alex  if orgs or individuals make contributions then EEA could be a proxy hire some on the EIP process \u2013 owner to help push forward  ??  Would be great to share not all lists rather than rejecting or accepting the whole list  Topics Review and examination of EIP process EIPs (things that clients must implement) vs ERCs (standards and templates such as ERC20) DISCUSSED TO DO  canonical reference, or perhaps a companion HOW-TO in the Scrolls Wiki or ETHhub? Could do with more promotion \u2013 why should you EIP, why you should track EIPs, etc. etc  Do we need more editors? What should editor do and what not? How do we help ensure that people who submit EIPs get feedback? Many EIPs vs. limited EIPs (AKA Boris vs. Nick) How can we better identify and sort EIPs based on their content i.e. if you have an interest in following Wallet specific EIPs, how can you find all of them and track their progress? See this thread from a current discussion. Should we decentralize a EIP process? as proposed in this thread and in this thread? How does the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) or other groups inter-operate with the EIP process? How do EIPs / the Ethereum ecosystem interoperate with other standards processes? (W3C? BIPs or other pan-crypto standards? etc.) PARTICIPATE IN THE OPEN Action Items Document New License / Contributor Agreement for EIPs for Patent Protection Needs to go beyond CC0 and add protection against patent trolls EEA interest in this topic Need to file this as an issue (probably in EIP repo) and see who might take this on JSON-RPC as EEA test case, working together Connections TBD, @boris will take this on, further discussion during DevCon session Infura might be able to support EEA test case List to be shared with public Chaals to look at getting an EEA list of top items that might make it into EIPs Problems outside YellowPaper Various things that are under specified to be identified (eg JSON-RPC from above) ",
