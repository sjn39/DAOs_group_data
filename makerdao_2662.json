Community Development       With the recent ETH-A vault debt ceiling increase we are within striking distance of 500 million DAI (and the half-Billy club!).  Take a break from responsible governance with some harmless speculation:  When 500 Million DAI? poll Poll will close when 500 Million DAI is reached.  Winners will receive my admiration    I missed out on the 500M version of this but since everyone since the very beginning was eying 1B DAI I figured to put up the next poll. When 1Billion DAI!?     0-1 month 1-2 months 2-3 months 3-4 months 4-5 months 5-6 months 6-8 months 8-10 months 10-12 months 2-2.5 years 2.5-3 years     0 voters     I think another interesting poll is when will 50K MKR be worth 1B     0-3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months 12-16 months 16-20 months 20-24 months 2-2.5 years 2.5-3 years     0 voters     ",

I really want to redo that second poll to have a longer timeline because of my math mistake since that one might just take some time and it would be interesting to see what the community thinks on that one as well.   Maybe make it When MKR price hits 10,000 US. and just do 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, more than 10 years. When I think about this if all goes well MKR could hit 10K/ in less than 2 years but could take as many as 5.   Anything after 10 years and USD inflation could make a loaf of bread cost $10-20 so 10K MKR in 20 years is like 1K MKR now. ",

So the 2-3month folks with the most votes predicted this.  Now I guess we can go for a $5B poll and MKR with a 5B cap.! RWA and some other big ideas and some critical problems solved PEG, DAI liquidity expansion/contraction, community organization/growth to drive this, along with adoptions and we could be there pretty quickly.   I would hazard this is a make or break and Maker needs to get to PEG situated for adoption to drive hard to $5B in the next 3 or so years or maybe lose out to more nimble players/projects (new or old).  As to 5B cap this should come when Maker starts making $50-100M/year revene which also could come in 3-5 years. Cheers everyone and great job MakerDAO and Maker finally hit $1B today seems like such a long hard road to get here and still a lot of work ahead.
