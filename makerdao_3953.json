                    "content": "TL;DR Maker is fundamentally less unstable than all other major stablecoins, because the temptation of capital controls (especially imperfect ones) is not available to us. This not only gives us the differentiation of relying solely upon free market mechanisms to maintain our peg, it also means we will never be able to attempt at scale to control both our monetary base and maintain a fixed peg to the USD. The trade off, of course, is that Maker is largely held hostage to the whims of capital flows when it comes to increasing or decreasing the size of the DAI supply. NB: This has significant implications as to the long-run safety of competing stablecoins, and a well-accepted underpinning of monetary theory as to why we should be regulated less vigorously. Background One of the core challenges for MakerDAO is to maintain the par value of 1 DAI = 1 USD on the open market. While several tools have been developed to maintain the fixed exchange rate on both sides of the peg \u2013 notably the DSR and the PSM \u2013 there is still a need to find methods of stabilization that can reduce reliance upon the DSR in the event of regulatory or solvency limitations, and that can allow the PSM to be used more as a trowel for fine-tuning and less as a dump truck that has to move large loads. The main reason to avoid reliance upon the PSM alone is the composition of Maker\u2019s \u201cforeign reserves.\u201d A major challenge is that while the market currently believes MakerDAO\u2019s commitment to the peg to be credible, thereby lowering the costs of maintaining it, extreme market volatility and congestion on Ethereum can cause large swings that have to be absorbed in real time by the PSM. To date, this has worked well, but has resulted in the PSM holding more than it needs to buffer against short-run volatility. Additionally, without a blockchain presence of actual USD, this leaves the Maker Protocol with the extra intermediary currency of USDC, which has a non-zero credit risk. Maker Has No Capital Controls \u2013 Other Stablecoins Do One of the reasons Maker is so unique in the stablecoin world is that it is a survivor of a difficult start-up test for coins that cannot use capital controls. Our fellow large-cap stablecoins are backed by redeemability, and also often contain the ability to blacklist or otherwise impair the flow of capital. This is why they can change the size of their monetary base, because if their own peg becomes endangered, they can \u2013 to varying degrees of success for varying amounts of time \u2013 utilize capital controls to prevent flight back to USD. This means that they are able to both maintain their 1:1 peg with the USD and enact monetary policy to alter the size of their monetary base. It should be noted that the imperfect nature of the capital controls of Tether, USDC, Paxos, et al, means that they are in the long run very risky propositions. Redemptions can be halted, wallets blacklisted, in some cases the coins can be burned. But the robust offering of secondary marketplaces means that there will always be a true \u201cfree market\u201d exchange rate somewhere in DeFi for easy reference. This means that there is the temptation of these entities to simultaneously attempt to control the size of their monetary base, utilize capital controls, and maintain a 1:1 peg with the USD. Historically, these always end in collapse, as the balance-of-payments between the currencies becomes unsustainable. It is pure conjecture at the moment, but we may be witnessing Tether grappling with this problem right now \u2013 they cannot both control the size of their monetary base and maintain the 1:1 peg indefinitely without the use of capital controls. For Tether in particular, shrinkage of their monetary base means a potential liquidity crisis since they cannot conjure money from thin air when the peg is under downward pressure. Examples in the past of this kind of crisis are the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s and Argentina in the 2000s. There are also algorithmic stablecoins, which attempt to influence market price through a variety of mechanisms. We don\u2019t need to discuss the merits or demerits of them here, but they amount to capital controls as well, impairing or subsidizing flows of capital by holders of their coin. Maker stands alone as a true \u201cfree market\u201d stablecoin that has survived to scale. The maintenance of the fixed exchange rate, coupled with a purposeful lack of ability to enact capital controls on holders of DAI \u2013 no halts of redemptions for fiat, no blacklisting, no taxes/subsidies to alter velocity in the open market to maintain peg \u2013 means that Maker has no real control over the speed at which DAI grows. At least, not through the changing of parameters \u2013 this is why the Growth CU is so important in opening up new sources of demand. Maker has had the fortunate historical accident of experiencing balance-of-payments with USD that makes Maker a source of \u201cdirect foreign investment\u201d in dollar-denominated assets. If Maker was a nation, this would be equivalent to its citizens loaning money to the dollarized world, as opposed to a nation that was a net debtor. With the PSM (or any other passive open market operation), this means that the demand for DAI required the purchase of foreign reserves. Lacking an actual way to access USD, we currently use USDC. It is important to note that there is no way to unwind the PSM on purpose, at least in aggregate across all PSMs (of which we only have one at the moment). We can alter the composition of these \u201cforeign reserves,\u201d but cannot alter the quantity without causing problems for the peg. Our monetary base will move in a one-to-one correspondence with our \u201cforeign reserves\u201d of dollars, dollar-denominated assets, and dollar-equivalents. Intuitively, this should give the reader two main reactions: One of relief that our reserves are such a large part of the monetary base that the peg is very safe. And one of nervousness that we will have to rely on stimulating organic demand for DAI via low vault rates/high DSR rates should our reserves ever become too depleted to defend the fixed exchange rate. Looking forward With regards to all of our competitors, no algorithmic coins have managed to gain much traction. If they do, they will be similarly hobbled as fiat-backed coins. Tether, USDC, and other redeemable coins will ultimately have to either institute capital controls or take a passive view of managing the size of their monetary base. Alternatively, they can abandon their peg and float a free market exchange rate. Given the imperfect nature of the controls available to different stablecoins, those controls may have limited effectiveness or limited durations of effectiveness. If those managing each of those coins does not realize this early, they run the risk of a collapse and then forced devaluation to restore a free market equilibrium. Maker, by contrast, is forced by design to rely upon free market mechanisms to maintain its peg. This removes the temptation for us to attempt to use capital controls, which is good. It means at least some avenues of monetary policy are unavailable to us that are likely to lead to collapse. ",

Tether on the other hand? If there were more Tether on Aave, we could literally deposit (a bit more than half of) our USDC, borrow Tether, ask to redeem, and they would have to halt redemptions. Good luck with the peg then. They disclosed ~3% actual cash reserves, so the only thing saving them is that no one can borrow $2b in Tether to short it, apparently. It actually doesn\u2019t even matter whether their commercial paper is going bad or not \u2013 that\u2019s a solvency issue. From a liquidity standpoint, they\u2019re really susceptible to speculators. Presumably the reason this hasn\u2019t happened yet is that no one wants to be the first one to stick their head out to short heavily in this method in case they actually are incredibly solvent and can borrow against those assets to defend their peg. They do hold some Treasuries, but that their reverse repo notes are nearly equivalent to their cash position in the May disclosure suggests that their cash came from borrowing against most of their Treasuries already. Tether looks to be in a very precarious position financially, even all of their underlying assets are 100% safe and sound. I would be surprised if they do not have to halt or delay redemptions or some other action in the next 6 to 12 months. Whether that will cause a devaluation is, of course, not assured. It is notable that Maker is not able to get into this position because we never mint unbacked DAI and we cannot institute capital controls. Our commitment to the fixed dollar peg pretty much ties our hands and makes us be responsible. Other stablecoins rely upon financial repression or good management. The latter never lasts forever. ",

Even the fed funds rate is really a distribution of rates throughout the day, and with much less automation than an automated facility like the PSM. In the case of redeemable coins, very few offer instantaneous flows, and that\u2019s probably not a problem. The likeliest place they will run into problems is that they seem to think \u2013 judging from the recent CNBC interview \u2013 that 24 hours of redemption liquidity is sufficient and even worth boasting about.
