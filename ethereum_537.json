Charter ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Constrained-Resource-Client-Ring  How to join  Add yourself to the \u201cFounding Participant\u201d section in the charter wiki. Subscribe to notifications for the Constrained Resource Clients category (the little circle on the top-right).  I\u2019ll be posting updates and meeting notes to the category. If you\u2019re on the founding participant list, I\u2019ll put in make extra effort to make sure you don\u2019t miss out on relevant discussions.  Background I\u2019ve been working on Vipnode (an economic incentive for running Ethereum full nodes that serve light clients). While exploring integration opportunities, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of speaking with various teams who are trying to on-board Ethereum users to mobile and in-browser clients beyond simply using Infura\u2019s centralized APIs. I noticed that many teams have their own separate efforts that are largely incompatible with each other, and many of them don\u2019t know about each other at all. Some examples: Geth LES/ULC, Parity PIP, Slock.it Incubed, MetaMask Mustekala This ring strives to raise awareness of these separate efforts, and hopes to reach some standards of compatibility across them. Any other relevant projects we\u2019re missing here? Any suggestions? ",
