As described in the previous post, I took liberties to create the MakerDAO Talent Branch . Below\u2019s a recap of what talent branches are and how they can help hire and generate additional revenue for the DAO:  Talent Branches - community specific talent pools Every talent branch is a talent pool of referred talent accessible for its select members e.g. hiring parties in MakerDAO - Usually Core Unit facilitators. It is sort of a double sided market with job-seekers and potential employers getting access to vetted, high quality candidates. The currency is the bounty value. The most exciting part though is this: by adding a community managed two-way valve between talent branches we can defragment the current hiring market massively reliant on hiring agencies. Talent can now be available locally and globally increasing trust factor of the entire talent ecosystem as members of talent branches are coming from trusted communities.  1662\u00d71246 178 KB   Hiring trusted talent faster, without intermediaries In this scenario, the hiring parties within the DAO or a portfolio of its projects are able to fill vacancies faster through setting up their talent branch and/or setting up job-specific bounties for talent to get recommended to. By referring and applying to generic jobs, candidates become readily available to the invited hiring parties in MakerDAO or its ecosystem. This way, it is much easier for larger communities to successfully map their community members with available jobs while the value in for of bounty reward stays in the ecosystem. Since Techtree aims to create an ecosystem, where talent can flow across the IT/Web3 space - MakerDAO talent branch would not only hold talent referred directly there, but also coming from other talent branches - web3 communities, DAOs, VCs and their portfolio companies. This increases chances of hiring and makes the whole hiring market much less fragmented. Needless to say, no middlemen are needed to match talent and jobs any more.  Inviting Core Unit Facilitators to join the Talent Branch as employers I will send invitations to @Core-Facilitators within the next couple of days as we fill it in with vetted candidates from wider Techtree mycelium network. Sign-up as employer is also possible with this link . Naturally, all sign-ups undergo verification process.  Turning community into a revenue stream for the DAO We are also experimenting with another interesting scenario. Here we assume every community is a talent pool. Even with bear market, many companies, communities and ecosystems are looking to hire and people are looking into extra job opportunities. When a talent branch is created, DAO can invite their community members to join the talent branch. This is possible through applying directly or referring others to generic roles, that the community can customize to fit most represented roles in the ecosystem. Talent can be matched with a job in the community itself or can be made available to other communities allowing DAO to generate revenue stream from bounties. It is a two-way process with talent flowing across different ecosystems as we\u2019re striving to create sort of mycelium network of talent across the Web3 space. We believe a wider network of talent not only increases chances of hire, but can also build fundament for collaboration across communities and ecosystems. It is up to the DAO to decide whether to take advantage of this scenario.  Revenue Flow Candidates enter the talent branch by getting referred or through direct application. Most candidates across our talent pools are direct applicants, hence leaving almost entire bounty to the talent branch owner (DAO). An example with bounty size of 5000 $ is used.  image alt665\u00d71181 68.6 KB   Vetting and credentials Vetting is now performed manually by Techtree team based on a number of objective factors - CV, GitHub activity, past experience, individual recommendations etc. but as time goes, we will steer the product increasingly towards self-sustainability through automated reputation scoring system. We currently have a vetting scale of 1-5 with 5 being the top score.  Next Steps   First, I would appreciate community feedback on the MakerDAO talent branch look itself. The current role-set has been sourced from MakerDAO Recruitee page combined with a set of Web3 generic roles to extend the talent pool. Wink towards @manomad here.   I will invite @Core-Facilitators  to the talent branch as employers so whenever you need to hire, there should already be a selection of vetted candidates readily available   Currently I am the owner of the talent branch, but I believe, since it involves potential flow of bounty rewards for the DAO, another CU-based branch owner should be selected as per community decision   We\u2019ll do a drop of vetted talent from other talent branches including Polychain and Inflection to be readily available for hire in MakerDAO   If anything I\u2019m always available to present the idea in more detail during one of the community calls as needed.
