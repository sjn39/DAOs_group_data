We had the duration set at 24 hours before Black Thursday March 12-13. Is it time to go back to a 24 hour delay? A shorter delay allows for governance votes to cast faster. However, it also allows a shorter timeframe to defend against governance attacks. The 4 hour delay was helpful during the market collapse when the ETH price was fluctuating wildly. A longer delay helps protect the protocol against governance attacks. There is simply more time allotted to respond to adverse governance actions. During the market collapse, the 24 hour delay presented a risk as the mitigating changes we used to stabilize the protocol could not be applied with urgency. The most recent change to the delay occurred in the thread, Signal Request: Calibrating GSM delay in light of recent market events     Keep unchanged at 12 hours Increase to 24 hours     0 voters     After two weeks, if there is support for a 24 hour delay then this matter can proceed to an on-chain poll.

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  That said, some sort of emergency notification procedure is a sensible idea, and will need to be implemented in the future.   Absolutely needed is a kind of Maker operational alarm system that anyone can opt into to receive alarm updates (where they can even manage a subset of all available alarm types).   I wondered if someone could put up a new executive for vote and who would notice when.  I see the bot posting a new executive in rocketchat but does this work if someone else tries to put up an executive themselves? As to the GSM.  Personally I really want to revisit what are the actions that wait for the GSM and ones that don\u2019t as we now have certain actions that DO NOT need to wait for the GSM delay. Because we don\u2019t have a formal Maker operational alarm system, we don\u2019t have emergency response tests (to determine how fast X amount of MKR could be mustered for an emergency) to measure MKR governance emergency response times. All of this needs to be factored into this whole GSM and emergency response measures. Something I never got to was the whole analysis of when to use an ES and how it affects the community.  I have come to the conclusion that unless the system already has lost more than 1/4-1/2 of its value will an ES be used and even then the protocol will have lost so much value that no-one will pull the trigger on the 50K MKR required to pull the ES trigger here. There is a lot to consider vs. just the GSM delay time here but really we are back to re-analyzing what we have in terms of governance security (or not) and what should or should not have a delay.   I think we covered most of the discussion regarding the need for a GSM, but I still don\u2019t think we have settled on a delay time and this is mostly in relation to the fact that we never do \u2018test emergencies\u2019 out of the blue and at odd times/days to measure what the community emergency response IS.  Until we get at least a baseline measurement of this response personally I have no clue what we need to set the GSM to. ",
