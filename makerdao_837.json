                    "content": "AAVE\u2019s stETH collateral has seen a pretty massive increase, eclipsing the value in our wstETH vaults (wstETH converted to equivalent stETH in the chart):  Screen Shot 2022-03-17 at 12.53.42 PM1968\u00d7518 72.2 KB  If we consider market share to be the total value of wstETH in Maker vaults vs the total value of stETH/wstETH stored as collateral in lending protocols in general (currently only Maker and AAVE), Maker\u2019s market share has dropped from 100% to 29% quickly. However, this is not an apples to apples comparison, as it is possible to borrow volatile tokens (including ETH) on AAVE, whereas it is only possible to borrow DAI on Maker. We decided to dig into this to see how much of the stETH activity on AAVE is addressable - what is the amount we could potentially bring over to Maker. We found that, of the $991M of stETH on AAVE, approximately $847M is used to borrow $574M of ETH against:  Screen Shot 2022-03-17 at 1.23.33 PM952\u00d7564 87.5 KB  This leads us to a more apples to apples comparison of the two stETH lending markets (ignoring about $1M of wstETH in Maker vaults with no DAI drawn against):  Screen Shot 2022-03-17 at 1.23.46 PM944\u00d7556 80.6 KB  Using this comparison, by value of collateral, Maker market share is truly 77.6%. By value of stablecoin loans drawn against stETH/wstETH collateral, Maker market share is 73.1%. If we could capture all $41M of AAVE stablecoin loans against stETH, we would have to do so with a stability fee of at least 1.83% to break even (vs our current loan exposure @ 2.5%). 1.83% is worse than current rates on AAVE (although this is very subject to change), and on top of this, liquidation parameters (both level & penalty) are more favorable on AAVE, so it is unlikely we would be able to do this. Conclusion: Approximately $132M of stETH collateral on AAVE and $41M of stablecoin loans drawn against that could potentially be moved over to Maker if the end users so desired. There are levers we could pull in the future (adjusting stability fees and/or minimum collateral ratios) to try to take back some market share, but it is not really worthwhile now as the addressable market today is not substantial. . . . Assumptions: Latest prices of WETH and stETH in prices.table on dune.xyz at the time of data pull (earlier today) were used:  ETH: $2812.31 stETH: $2803.22  Stablecoin value was assumed to be exactly $1 Latest stETH/wstETH ratio (1.0648294558) was used to determine current wstETH value: $2,984.95 ",
