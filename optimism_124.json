                    "content": "My first post, trying to become more active in the Optimism Collective.  Earlier today, a Quixotic smart contract was exploited to the tune of ~214k OP. At the current price of OP as quoted by CMC (at the time of writing, Jul 1 2022), this is ~$100k USD. Quixotic has committed to refunding users the full amount, which I think is very admirable. Even though Quixotic has committed to refunding users, I would like to make a proposal: use some of the funds currently managed by Collective governance to help Quixotic cover some of the amount being refunded. Why? To me, the Optimism Collective stands for the power of collective action. Members of this Collective should work together to create a better future for the Optimism ecosystem as a whole. Quixotic has been the only major NFT marketplace on Optimism and has dedicated a huge amount of time towards driving forward Optimism\u2019s NFT ecosystem. Quixotic is the only service that provides an NFT API on Optimism. Quixotic also has an NFT launchpad that makes the process of creating new NFTs on Optimism very easy. I think it is very obvious that Quixotic has had a large positive impact on the Optimism ecosystem and is strongly aligned with Optimism\u2019s vision. I think this is a great opportunity for the Optimism community to show what makes Optimism different. We\u2019re there for each other when things get tough. Although $100k may not seem like much for the Optimism Collective as a whole, it might be a lot for a small company like Quixotic. This is the sort of collective action that will make Optimism stand out as a strong and supportive community when someone is trying to pick where to deploy their next application. Plus, it would also show the appreciation that the Optimism community has for Quixotic and the work that they have done. Thank you for reading my proposal, optimist ",

Kudos to them for open and transparent about the attack and doing the refund proactively. But we should not reimburse them, as a user we know the risk involve when we interact with Smart contract.  Quixotic has been the only major NFT marketplace on Optimism  To me this means, they need competition. I will rather support another nft platform on optimism than to reimburse them. ",

Also really like the intent of the original post here as in essence I think the focus is generosity here\u2026but at the same time Optimism is in a critical phase of its beginnings and to support bad development practices with $ from the OP treasury or any of the dedicated OP funding accounts is not a good precedent from my perspective. I do think a quick web app could be spun up with a \u201cDonate Here\u201d button though\u2026? I would contribute a bit myself for sure personally just because it pains me to see exploit after exploit\u2026but this type of solution feels more like the right approach here. ",

This would encourage complacency from protocols because they know there\u2019s an L2 safety net to bail them out. Can\u2019t do it. Encouraging an insurance market on optimism is a better way to prevent this in the future. We can even use OP to fund new entrants here ",
