Unfortunately there are theoretical situations where a negative rate will be the only way to avoid an emergency shutdown. In current circumstances it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re there, though, since there should still be plenty of new collateral to onboard in order to grow supply. To clarify: It is possible to impose negative rates on ALL outstanding Dai, not just Dai in DSR. However it would require the ecosystem to upgrade their UIs, and obviously would be a huge shock to users, so it\u2019s unlikely to ever be used as anything other than a last resort if there\u2019s no other way to avoid an ES.

A negative DSR (or SF) is just a means to achieve the peg. The peg is more important than anything else (including decentralization as we see with USDC). I agree with @rune that a negative rate could be the only way to avoid the ES. The ES could cause a huge selling pressure on ETH causing DAI users to lose much more than what they\u2019d lose with a negative rate. The negative rate would be a temporary measure while the ES could mean the end of (trust in) DAI. I also agree with @LongForWisdom that now it\u2019s not a right time for a signalling thread if we still think that the current measures are working. The situation might be different in a week or two though. ",

This is a surprise to me. I vaguely recall a chat session where at least one Foundation engineer told me it\u2019s not possible with the current deployment. Do you mean through smart contract upgrades? Or some other mechanism? I also think we\u2019re conflating things in this thread. (cc @bit).   A negative DSR would mean that those who left money in the DSR would permanently lose some. I previously wrote that besides a breach of trust and bad PR, it would also probably be ineffective in affecting the peg though liquidity. Though I could be wrong, a secondary effect could be that those holders completely exit Dai. But who knows, there may be many passive depositors.   If we talk something like TRFM (which is AFAIK not part of MCD), it\u2019s not really a negative interest rate, rather a temporary devaluation (unless it\u2019s used as a recurring, permanent reduction in the target rate). Compared to the other things discussed here, it\u2019s a much more desirable way of restoring the peg, e.g. lowering the TR and then raising it back as soon as it\u2019s deemed appropriate.   Negative SF is yet another different mechanism, probably with different effects.   ",
