                    "content": "EUROPE REGION Q3 FORUM UPDATE After the disruptive Q2 for crypto markets, Q3 felt like a moment for industry wide reflection to find stability and course correct. In Europe , in spite of the August holiday period, the events circuit saw the MakerGrowth team active with EthCC in Paris in July where we hosted a very productive Partner dinner ( with the likes of Binance, Centrifuge, SG-Forge, Gnosis \u2026 ) and then with the smaller EthWarsaw event in September where we participated in a number of panels and with the MakerDao booth. HIGHLIGHTS  DAI Marketing Campaign with Argent Wallet  Argent Wallet ran a DAI Educational and L2 ( zkSync ) onramp campaign during the first two weeks of August which saw ~300k of DAI purchased via the Argent wallet and their Onramp partner RAMP. We had the opportunity to create a template for future partner campaigns and also survey the user base for their thoughts on DAI which provided some great insight.  SG-Forge Vault Deployment  In August, after many months of effort from both MakerDao & SG-Forge teams we also saw the onboarding of the SG-Forge RWA vault. Although the actual DAI drawdown from the vault has been delayed to Q4 , the deployment is a milestone that has provided many valuable lessons in working with larger regulated institutions.  Monetalis MIP65  As we get closer to the deployment of MIP65 , we have been preparing the PR story for this reference transaction and look forward to leveraging it to introduce MakerDao to a new market segment of TradFi players. MARKET OVERVIEW  Regulatory Landscape  Hard to keep up in the regulatory space, everyone is well aware of the additional regulatory scrutiny in all jurisdictions. That said, some positives do seem to be emerging from the UK market where the government is proactively engaging the crypto ecosystem as it looks to position the UK as a leading crypto hub - in fact we are even starting to see Members of Parliament appear to speak at Crypto Events in London !  1082\u00d7372 104 KB  One of the initiatives that we are tracking closely is from the UK Law commission who are looking into the regulatory and legal framework for the operation of DAO\u2019s ( Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) | Law Commission )  Changing DeFi Participants  Clear shift of activity from retail focused platforms to institutions who have ramped up their digital asset teams and are looking to experiment with DeFi infrastructure. Q4 STRATEGY OVERVIEW  GNO / rETH collateral onboardings  Both these new collateral types are expected to go to EV in Q4 and we are in discussions with both groups for go to market support once deployed.  DAI Campaigns  Taking the learnings from the Argent DAI campaign, we are reviewing with other wallet providers to do something similar and further increase our end user reach through partner distribution platforms.  RWA Reference cases  A few new RWA use cases in early phases of discussion that we will continue to support with a view to them submitting proposals to the forum in Q4.

Got a question, due the recent market pushing the euro and british pound down, you think people in Europe will give more importance to USD peg stablecoins like DAI? If so, we could take advantage of this by creating more campaigns over there as the one with Argent right? Thanks! ",

Even though the USD/EUR peg has recently majorly suffered, we must keep in mind that EUR is still the currency that people living in Europe earn as income and spend in. Any kind of increased DAI investment would be very shortsighted as an on-boarding tactic. This does not mean it would not work, but just pointing this out. ",

Bear in mind, unlike many Emerging Market countries where its quite difficult to get a USD denominated bank account, its more easily available in UK/EU through multi-currency account offerings. It is an angle though that will definitely be exploring as part of the campaigns we are discussing with partners. ",
