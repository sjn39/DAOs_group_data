Advantages  Lets us react more strongly to changing market conditions if necessary, without having to trigger an exceptional poll in an emergency. Lets us do small scale tweaking if we want to try to find the lowest stability fee setting that maintains the peg, as some MKR holders seem to have voted for recently. Lets MKR holders fix the .5% precision \u2018problem\u2019, if they want to.  Disadvantages  It prevents us from making more precise changes in a single poll. If we wanted to make a specific change for say 3%, this would take two polls under the proposed system.  The following options would capture doveish/hawkish sentiment in both directions with a minimum of polling options: +8% +4% +2% +1% +0.5% No change -0.5% -1% -2% -4% -8%     Yes, we should do this.

I see lowest fee of 0.5 percent as low enough and we could lower it later if necessary. Historically mkr holders raised fee too slow (from 0.5 percent to 19.5 percent) and did not use 4 percent increases (even when they could). Regarding t-bone\u2019s argument about the limiting max range because of the danger of \u201cunchecked whales\u201d. It sounds like \u201ccensoring\u201d options for mkr holder to vote on. I am not saying i am against it, but it does open some interesting questions about governance (which were likely already discussed, so i probably should not say open). Maybe giving largest mkr holders more opportunity to game the system, would give new information about the robustness of the system or maybe also force other holders to also vote? Anyway, this questions are for other topic. ",

To be honest I don\u2019t see the whale argument as a particularly valid reason not to have +/-8%. Whales own MKR, they are valid governance participants. As Jernejml said, there are multiple dimensions to this. Can we try to come to a consensus on an \u2018acceptable\u2019 outcome rather than a perfect outcome? Remember that we can poll for a second change in stepping at a later date if we decide that the options are not fit for purpose. With the new polling dashboard, having multiple options is less invasive. Can we come to consensus on one of the following? You can vote for multiple options in this poll. Please vote for all options you would prefer to the current linear steps we are using.     0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8% (plus and minus) 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8% (plus and minus) 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4% (plus and minus) 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4% (plus and minus) All of these are unacceptable, we should stick with the current system     0 voters     Lets try to find a consensus and hopefully get to a point where we can move this to an on-chain vote.

I think we need to look at other ways to spur activity: Keeping the thread active? Bringing it up more in meetings? General recruiting for governance bodies? I was hoping to see more compromise on this thread, to me this feels like a fairly non-controversial QoL change. It doesn\u2019t matter hugely to me which version of this we take, but others seem to disagree. There are currently six people that are voting for one of the top two options but not the other. Are any of you willing to compromise further? The difference is having an 8% option in the poll. This poll does not commit us to ever use the 8%, ultimately MKR vote will decide the stability fee, as it does now. Not having an 8% option doesn\u2019t secure the system in any appreciable way. If whales want to jack up the SF, they are going to do it under whichever stepping we end up with. I have trouble seeing the 8% option as a sticking point.

I assume that fixed limit ranges are currently the only possibility however imo it would be a good idea with an option that is double the previous change whatever that change was. So if we for example reach +/-8% then the next poll should include +/-16% options. This should then of course be reversed at some point when appropriate. Br. ",

I believe variable stepping ranges would be possible, but I think it adds a level of complexity that isn\u2019t entirely necessary. We are already adding complexity by potentially moving from fixed steps to exponential steps. We should try to move one step at a time here, I think. If we can get exponential stepping agreed and passing an on-chain vote and it turns out to be useful, then we can consider further improvements. ",

We are currently voting in the poll here. This poll allows you to vote for multiple options. You should vote for any option that you would vote for in an on-chain poll. For each option pretend the choice is between that option and remaining with the current fixed rate stepping system for stability fee polls. It feels like there should be more compromise here, no one has voted for the option that we should remain with the current system, so each of the 16 people that have voted want to see a change, however, until we can get a higher degree of consensus and more participants it\u2019s difficult to justify moving to an on-chain poll. I would suggest that we are looking for at least a 75% consensus around one option, and that it would be great to see at least 20 participants total to vote in the poll. If we can reach this level of agreement, I\u2019ll start pushing for this poll to move on-chain. ",

This poll will determine what the on-chain poll looks like, my hope is that eventually we can set enough of a precedent that this won\u2019t be necessary every time.      #1 Create an on-chain poll in the form: \u2018Consensus Option, yes or no?\u2019 - We implement the consensus option if Yes > No  #2 Create an on-chain poll in the form: \u2018Which one of these suggested options do you want implemented (includes a status quo option)?\u2019 - We implement the highest scoring (unless status quo wins, in which case we do nothing.)  #3 Create multiple on-chain polls, one for each option in the last poll, each has a yes/no option. - We implement the outcome with the highest \u2018score\u2019 so long as that \u2018score\u2019 is positive.  #4 This is not ready to go to an on-chain poll.  #5 I just want to see the results.     0 voters     Here are some of my thoughts on the above:  On #1: The consensus option is \u20180.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4\u2019, This is fixed from this point, everyone has had time to signal if they were inclined to do so. I will be closing the previous polls. If we go with #1 we are allowing 1-person 1-vote to control which proposal makes it on-chain. This is putting a layer of democracy over our plutocracy. I would argue this is good, but others may not feel the same way.  #2 is plurality voting. It can result in splitting the vote, allowing status quo to win even though there is more consensus for some change, even if the flavour of that change can\u2019t be agreed upon. I\u2019m very against this option.  #3 is similar to the asset ranking poll. Here \u2018score\u2019 = \u2018yes votes\u2019 - \u2018no votes\u2019. We would be ranking solutions. This might be overkill, we\u2019ve essentially done this already with 1-person 1-vote, but this way will give MKR holders the final say.  Based on suggestions that we need more calendar. I\u2019ve set this poll to expire 1 week from today. ",

Did the process take too long or do we simply take as long as we need? How much consensus to we require? 50%, 75% more? Is it dependent on the criticality of the change?

All-in-all, a pretty successful example of governance in action, thank you to everyone who participated. I\u2019ll schedule a new governance poll to start on Monday, September 23 at 4PM UTC. It will contain the questions as formatted above by @LongForWisdom. ",

In the past we used relative values in the polls, i.e. -4, -2, -1, etc., operating under the expectation that the Stability Fee executive would always be ratified before the Stability Fee poll started. It became apparent that wasn\u2019t always the case, so we had ambiguity in the system where people who vote early in a poll could be voting for a \u2018stale\u2019 SF if it changes during the week. We then moved to absolute values. i.e. 10%, 11%, 12%, etc. In the wording of the current poll:     LongForWisdom:  If this proposal passes, each regularly scheduled stability fee poll will have the following polling options only: -4%, -2%, -1%, -0.5%, -0.25%, No change, +0.25%, +0.5%, +1%, +2%, +4%\u2019   could imply that we are going back to relative. It is my understanding that we don\u2019t want to do that so, assuming that the current fee is 12.5%, the next poll would have the options: 8.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12, 12.25, 12.5, 12.75, 13, 13.5, 14.5, 16.5 Does everyone feel that this format is understood?

To clarify:  I didn\u2019t use absolute values in the polling question because it is a general change that extends past the current SF level. I should have specified that these values are \u201cRelative from the active stability fee, but absolute when described in each regular stability fee poll.\u201d And then provided an example.  Sorry for the confusion, I\u2019ll try to make sure everything is more precise in the future and has no room for misinterpretation. ",
