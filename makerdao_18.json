DC-IAM ttl and gap changes are not included in this table, see proposed changes below    Lending Market Overview DeFi lending rates are trending downwards for the second consecutive month and there is no reversal expected in the short term. Low rates are still maintained mostly by liquidity farming incentives. Additionally, potential rebalancing of investor portfolios into stablecoins and popularity of L2 lending have increased the supply of stablecoins on secondary lending platforms, pressuring rates lower.  Chart1200\u00d7742 99.9 KB  Source: Calculations by Monetsupply Similarly and as we have shown in the past month, rates on centralized venues have been also trending downward even before the recent price downturns. In the last week and after the two daily significant price drops, rates have only gone lower. At certain centralized venues perpetual funding rates even went negative, showing sentiment changed among traders.  Chart1200\u00d7742 34.5 KB  Source: Binance ETHUSDT Perpetual Swap (7d rolling annual funding rate) Another indicator of less bullish sentiment is increased supply of stablecoins as people rebalance their portfolios towards risk off allocation. Increase of PSM-USDC-A exposure is one indicator of this dynamic. Another is the increased supply of stablecoins after 19th of May.  1600\u00d7761 61.8 KB  1600\u00d7953 140 KB  Source: mkranalytics & coinmetrics  Proposed Changes  ETH-A:  Decrease SF from 5.5% to 3.5% Increase gap from 80m to 100m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  In order to lower USDC backing of DAI, maintain competitiveness and follow market rates lower, a decent cut to ETH-A rates is proposed. We are also increasing minting capacity which was too low on certain days in the past.  ETH-B:  Decrease SF from 10% to 9% Increase line from 50m to 300m Increase gap from 5m to 10m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  Smaller rate cut is proposed for ETH-B since we believe this vault type is still one of the most appealing leverage ETH products in DeFi currently. At the same time we are increasing debt exposure capacity after witnessing good performance in the new liquidations system. Minting capacity is therefore also increased, but still a bit conservative due to OSM delay risks (potentially we can reduce ttl further).  ETH-C:  Decrease SF from 3% to 1% Decrease ttlfrom 12h to 8h  Similarly as for ETH-A we are also proposing a bit more drastic cut for ETH-C vault type. We believe this vault type at 1% rate should be a nice boost to a much needed new DAI supply. Minting capacity is also increased, partially also to unify 8h DC-IAM parameters across all vault types.  WBTC-A  Decrease SF from 4.5% to 3.5% Increase gap from 15m to 30m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in minting capacity.  YFI-A  Decrease SF from 5.5% to 4.0% Increase line from 90m to 130m Increase gap from 5m to 7m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in minting capacity. YFI-A vault owners demonstrated a very healthy unwinding process at price crashes which was incorporated into risk models, revealing lower risk premiums. Therefore a lower rate and higher line can be introduced despite the expected debt exposure growth.  LINK-A  Decrease SF from 5.0% to 4.0% Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in minting capacity.  UNI-A  Decrease SF from 3.0% to 2.0% Increase gap from 3m to 5m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in minting capacity.

ZRX-A  Decrease line from 10m to 3m Decrease gap from 1m to 0.5m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  ZRX on-chain liquidity is still low and risk models are proposing lower debt exposure. For that reason DC-IAM minting capacity is also adjusted downward.  LRC-A  Decrease line from 5m to 3m Decrease gap from 1m to 0.5m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  LRC on-chain liquidity is still low and risk models are proposing lower debt exposure. For that reason DC-IAM minting capacity is also adjusted downward.  BAL-A  Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  Changes to DC-IAM minting capacity.  COMP-A  Decrease line from 30m to 20m Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  Risk models are proposing a bit lower debt exposure, again due to lower on-chain liquidity.

UNIV2DAIETH-A  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.5% Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in DC-IAM minting capacity.

Lower rates should also help retain Maker\u2019s UNI LP user base if Uniswap v3 triggers liquidity incentives.  UNIV2AAVEETH-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 3.0% Decrease ttl from 12h to 8h  General reduction in rates and improvement in DC-IAM minting capacity. Lower rates should also help retain Maker\u2019s UNI LP user base if Uniswap v3 triggers liquidity incentives.  Revenue Effect Proposed rate changes would lower annual rate income from 123m to 81m, ceteris paribus. There is some upside expected from higher demand because of lower fees and higher DC on ETH-B, which could be negated by potential refinancing of ETH-A vaults to ETH-C.  Other Recommendations  As risk is becoming undercompensated at lower fees for particular vault types, @Risk-Core-Unit recommends to maintain Surplus Buffer at minimum 3% of risk assets (currently this would be above 70m). This means less MKR is burning is preferred in the next months, which is to some extent already implied by the current setting of Surplus Buffer lerp module. Increasing ETH-B exposure carries higher auction risks, therefore shorter auction duration and more aggressive auction curve is recommended. It is also recommended to increase ilk.hole auction throughput parameter for ETH vault types, most specifically for ETH-B and ETH-C where growing debt exposure is expected. Post about proposed auction parameter changes is following soon.   Final Note Proposed SFs will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on June 7, 2021, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on June 11, 2021. ",

Apart from vault types where the situation with liquidity or collateralization ratio distribution got worse and risk compensation would be hardly achieved if rates went lower (example such as ZRX and LRC). I think you are referring to the net loss of these two collaterals based on oracle costs? I think this needs a separate topic that deals with potential off-boarding of collaterals that have low usage versus oracle costs. Because we can\u2019t predict whether a 1% rate cut will bring enough additional demand to finally offset these costs. Proposal is based on risk and competitive grounds, fixed costs would be another input. ",

Lending Market Overview During the past month, Aave began a liquidity incentive program covering primary stablecoins, WBTC, and ETH. This has lead to a substantial decrease in borrowing rates on Aave v2 and has pushed down the overall competitive rate landscape Despite the bullishness surrounding ETH, rates on centralized lending or trading venues seem to be trending downward as share of leveraged long positions was overtaken by increasing net short positions in ETH at Bitmex. Similarly data from Binance show that funding for ETH perpetuals decreased recently, suggesting that leveraged long ETH positions have lost some steam.  1600\u00d7719 99 KB  Source: Bitmex ETH longs  833\u00d7497 45.2 KB  Source: Binance ETHUSDT Perpetual Swap (annual funding rate)  Proposed Changes  ETH-C:  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 3%  Although risk metrics on ETH vaults improved in general with increased collateralization ratio metrics, lower on-chain slippage and Liq 2.0 implementation, we still want to promote higher usage of safer ETH-C vaults as overall exposure to ETH in Maker\u2019s portfolio is growing.  KNC-A  Increase SF from 2% to 5% Decrease line from 5 MM to 0 MM  KyberDAO is currently in a migration process from the current KNC-token to a new one. The liquidity for the KNC will very likely dry out at some point and we don\u2019t see any reason to wait any longer, so we suggest pushing for the vault-owners to unwind their positions now. Note that there are only 11 vaults remaining having approximately 50.000 DAI debt in total. Please note, that there is also a Signal Request about the future of KNC-A.  TUSD-A + PAX-A  Increase SFs from 0% to 1% Decrease DC for PAX-A from 100 MM to 0    Utilization of TUSD-A hasn\u2019t changed a lot since the DC has been set to 0. For PAX-A - where liquidity is really low - we have seen a substantial increase in utilization in the last weeks as users tend to use PAX-A vault to farm with DAI since PAX on-chain farming is limited. We want to encourage vault-owners to close their position (which is essentially a free short position on DAI). Later on - with Liq 2.0 - we are able to liquidate these positions in a more controlled manner, so the threat of vault-owners abandoning their vaults is not existing anymore. In case vault owners don\u2019t unwind their positions, we may however accrue some fees from vaults going below 100% CR, but the amount estimated is small (max 25.000 DAI per month).  USDC-B  Decrease DC from 30 MM to 0   USDC-B was planned as a last resort when PSM is fully utilized and we see a liquidity crunch during liquidations. With Liq2.0 the risk of a lack of DAI-liquidity is a lot lower since a vault-liquidation can happen in a single TX thanks to flashloaning, so there is basically no need to keep this tool.  Others  ETH-A We considered raising the ETH-A SF by a small margin, since we believe users are very insensitive to small rate changes in the current environment. Additionally this would also further incentivize migration to ETH-C. However the decision was made not to make any changes, since we still have a substantial inflow of USDC into the PSM and still want to encourage further increase in DAI supply to meet increased demand.  ETH-B  We have seen a rather big liquidation on ETH-B last week which went pretty well and produced a nice income to the protocol. At a first glance this could be seen as an indicator that even with Liq 1.2 we are in a pretty safe spot. However, this liquidation did not happen during a big market drop and would probably have had a different outcome if this would have happened during a real market crash. We suggest playing it conservatively, so we decided against raising the line for ETH-B until we have some proof that Liq2.0 works significantly better than the current system. The currently running executive will move ETH-B to Liq 2.0 - if this passes we will hopefully have some more data at the next regular MOMC-Meeting in the beginning of June to revisit this topic.  UniLP tokens The APY for liquidity providers is still really high so we could easily increase the SFs - but since Uni V3 is about to launch tomorrow we decided to just wait how this evolved in the next weeks.  Final Note Proposed Parameter Changes will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-05-09T22:00:00Z, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on 2021-05-13T22:00:00Z. ",

I think it is fair to say that Maker has this enormous advantage when it comes to borrowing larger amounts. So even if rates are lower at Aave and Compound, Maker is still much more competitive on the loan availability side of things as there are no liquidity constraints for taking out a loan. Not to mention OSM feature, non-volatile rates, etc\u2026This is why I am personally not too worried if Aave or Compound are cheaper for 3 to 5% after liquidity incentive rewards. Especially in this market environment. ",

Lending Market Overview Will be delivered tomorrow  Proposed Changes  ETH-B: Decrease SF from 6.0% to 5.0%  The current SF on ETH-B is still pretty high compared to the rest of the market. As we haven\u2019t seen a lot of USDC unwinding from PSM-USDC-A we suggest lowering the rate a bit to encourage more DAI from non-USDC. Decreasing the SF will cut our revenues by ~ $340.000/y.  LRC-A: Decrease line from 3 MM to 1 MM  Liquidity for LRC has dropped a lot - even on Loopring itself - so the Modeled Debt Ceiling is lower than the current utilization. We suggest lowering the Maximum Debt Ceiling therefore. Note there is also an ongoing task for the mandated actors to make a plan on how to offboard LRC.  UNIV2ETHUSDT-A: Decrease line from 10 MM to 0  @Risk-Core-Unit proposed to offboard this ilk as the utilization has been really low and generates virtually zero income, whereas downside risks related to USDT are high considering available debt ceilings. We support this idea and therefore propose to change the line to 0 as a first step of offboarding.  UNIV2DAIUSDT-A: Decrease line from 10 MM to 0 @Risk-Core-Unit proposed to offboard this ilk as the utilization is at 0 and generates zero income, whereas downside risks related to USDT are high considering available debt ceilings. We support this idea and therefore propose to change the line to 0 as a first step of offboarding.  UNIV2DAIUSDC-A  We are not proposing any changes to this ilk but we support the outcome of the Signal Request dealing with the line change.  Final Note Proposed changes will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-08-01T22:00:00Z, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on 2021-08-05T22:00:00Z. ",

However, liquidity has declined significantly on Aave v1 and CREAM so beginning this month I will no longer be including these two defi lenders in the competitive rate calculations. We\u2019ve also found that rates on CeFi lenders tend to be much higher than Compound or Aave v2, which skews the competitive rate calculations. To account for this, their weight within the average has been reduced. Beginning this month onward, the average competitive rate value will be calculated with 1/3 weighting to Compound, 1/3 weighting to Aave v2/AMM market (depending on the collateral asset), and 1/9 weighting to each of Nexo, Celsius, and BlockFi. I believe this offers a more accurate view of the competitive landscape for crypto lending.  Lending Market Overview  image1318\u00d71144 89.5 KB  Source: Paperclip Labs Compound Dashboard Borrowing rates have continued to be relatively low across defi lenders. The chart above shows Compound\u2019s stablecoin borrow rates over the past month (including the effect of COMP subsidies but not including interest earned on collateral). Rates have begun to pick up in the past few days, but remain low by historical standards.  image1040\u00d7738 39.3 KB  Source: Coinalyze FTX ETH-Perp Chart Similarly, perpetual swap funding rates on CeFi exchange venues have been negative for most of the past month, but have recently begun to flip positive. If this bullish dynamic continues we may see growing demand for leverage against our crypto collateral vaults, potentially helping to reduce Maker\u2019s stablecoin exposure. ",

However, they are still well below levels seen during the bull market until May of this year. If the trend continues, there may be some scope to raise borrowing rates at the next OMC meeting while remaining competitive. Aave has also recently broadened their liquidity incentive program to include deposit subsidies for several collateral assets (including UNI, YFI, and BAL). While this reduces incentives available for borrowing stablecoins (increasing Maker\u2019s competitiveness in general), it also leads to lower effective borrowing costs for users of these collateral assets. This will increase competitive pressure on related Maker vault types.  1026\u00d7732 80.2 KB  Source: Coinalyze FTX ETH-Perp Chart In centralized trading venues, funding rates have increased markedly from last month, showing consistently positive borrowing costs for taking leverage on ETH.

In our view the covered parameters (stability fees, debt ceilings, and debt ceiling IAM metrics) are well positioned given current conditions.

Also with respect to competitiveness.     monet-supply:  Aave has also recently broadened their liquidity incentive program to include deposit subsidies for several collateral assets (including UNI, YFI, and BAL).

This will increase competitive pressure on related Maker vault types.   I keep coming back to Maker issuing a MKR-R reward token to reward borrowers of DAI with so Maker can actually compete using another value token which can be used for polling borrowers, in the future can be used to achieve negative rates, act as a delay valve so SF can be kept high while the protocol builds reserves before deciding to allocate some Buffer to buy and burn of MKR-R.    There are ideas that MKR-R could be vested and with polling and maybe some voting options convert into MKR proper that only have to be \u2018hinted\u2019 at along with the idea that some small amount of revenue would be allocated to buying and burning MKR-R at the discretion of MKR governance. I think this is a huge missed opportunity for Maker and agree this is not in the scope of OMC, risk but probably more in the growth CU domains\u2026   I mention it here because each time I see this \u2018competitivenees comment\u2019 being tossed out I am sure this one thing could bring in more deposits and increase DAI borrowed more dramatically than reduction of LRs proposed and passed by governance recently. BTW:  Wanted to say - nice report.  I like these things.   At some point I will have some ideas for new stuff to include but so far looks great @monet-supply ",

I completely agree with one part and disagree with the rest which will be obvious from my reply. Let\u2019s copy exactly what our competitors have done and make it sustainable, and long term.   I am absolutely convinced we can do just that btw.   The beauty of using a second token is that governance can connect MKR-R burn to revenues, basically keep the SF higher balancing this against the vault reward metrics to encourage deposit and more important DAI borrow growth.  Rewards can also be connected to CR maintenance, used as a polling metric, as well as creating its own value to the Maker ecosystem.  In the loosest sense a MKR-R is the perfect reward intermediary because it gives governance another tool over rates and a way to connect with borrowers that simply doesn\u2019t exist today.    To back a sustainable value governance only has to state an intention that some % (even 5% would be sufficient btw) of net positive revenue would be used to buy it back.   We could even take some of the MKR slated to burn and offer it via reverse auction for MKR-R. Using MKR as a reward has been a political hot potato.  Governance making a new token slated to be a reward imo shouldn\u2019t have as much political baggage - but ofc your idea nor mine has ever gotten any traction. ",

If Wells Fargo gave $1 of equity for every $1 of debt customers borrowed, they would surely gain massive market share. The problem is that it would end very badly because it is unsustainable. Also, giving MKR rewards would undo all of the (supposed) good of buyback and burn. ",

As a result we have concluded that the optimal course of action is to increase DAI supply (from non-PSM ilks). Even though we deem it unlikely to move all USDC off the balance sheet immediately from these changes - we think that as long as it shortens the time span till we can onboard better collateral it is a net positive. We have intentionally kept sufficient revenues in place so as to be able to continue to pay for our core units. MakerDAO continues to attract high quality clients who are borrowing at scale due to our significantly larger capital base than many other Defi protocols and centralized lenders. We believe that even in the presence of yield farming issuance from Defi competitors we can continue to grow the DAI supply for these reasons. We continue to be motivated to maintain proper System Surplus (i.e. Capital Ratios) so as to maintain MakerDAO\u2019s creditworthiness. The following policies are commensurate with our above stated views and analysis. Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates June 2021 Table Notes:   Risk premiums and Maximum debt ceilings are based on Liquidations 2.0 which is in rollout right now   Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards at Compound & Cream and due to rates and rewards accrued on deposited collateral   Lending products between secondary lenders and MakerDAO are not standardized and therefore rates can not be strictly compared.    Proposed Changes  ETH-A:  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.0%   ETH-B:  Decrease SF from 9.0% to 6.0%   ETH-C:  Decrease SF from 1.0% to 0.5%   WBTC-A  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.0%   LINK-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 1.0%   YFI-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 1.0%   UNI-A  Decrease SF from 2.0% to 1.0%   AAVE-A  Decrease SF from 2.0% to 1.0%   RENBTC-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 2.0%   COMP-A  Decrease SF from 3.0% to 1.0%   BAL-A  Decrease SF from 2.0% to 1.0%   UNIV2DAIETH-A  Decrease SF from 2.5% to 1.5%   UNIV2USDCETH-A  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.0%   UNIV2DAIUSDC-A  Decrease SF from 0.5% to 0.0%   UNIV2WBTCETH-A  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.0%   UNIV2UNIETH-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 2.0%   UNIV2ETHUSDT-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 2.0%   Final Note Proposed SFs will get included into this week\u2019s on-chain poll on June 28, 2021, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on July 2nd, 2021.

                    "content": "    Akiva:  The Open Market Committee has identified the concerns of the community around tail-risk with USDC as being a material discussion point on the topic of the longevity of MakerDAO. As a result we have concluded that the optimal course of action is to increase DAI supply (from non-PSM ilks).   and then the nailer to one of the many reasons I will vote against this proposal.     Akiva:  Even though we deem it unlikely to move all USDC off the balance sheet immediately from these changes - we think that as long as it shortens the time span till we can onboard better collateral it is a net positive.   and later     Akiva:  The OMC has identified moving the USDC off the books as a primary goal.   3B later and now this is a primary goal. Is there any evidence this radical rate move will achieve this goal? Also if you are just going to cut and paste the contents there is no reason to link to:     Akiva:  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates June 2021   I was expecting to see some actual analysis in the \u2018source\u2019 reference above. Example.   USDC on the books now is 3B or 60% collateral backing to all DAI.  Which means if the system was shutdown today everyone would get .6USDC for their 1 DAI. ~1.5B DAI is backed by ETH .25B DAI is backed by wBTC and .20B DAI is backed by everything else. First the market share of ALL the remaining ilks would have to increase by another 150% AND ALL that DAI would have to find a reason to buy USDC.   With no real incentive for this to happen it never will. Secondly what exactly is the evidence that making such a dramatic change to rates is going to even put a dent in this issue?   I second the following opinion on this:     Aes:  I\u2019m concerned we may be overshooting with rates in a market that\u2019s not super elastic. I would understand if we were dropping rates this low due to competitive reasons but I don\u2019t see that mentioned as a motivator in the OP. If USDC is blacklisted MKR is screwed even with these lower rates. We\u2019ve started to see a rebound in TVL in both USD and ETH terms since our prior rate drop so I\u2019d like to see smaller more frequent decreases and an analysis of how demand has changed since our prior rate change.   Which is another reason to do this move in steps - to gather data.   I stand against this proposal as it stands because of the sheer lack of critical analysis or data indicating Maker giving up on 1-2M DAI/month revenue is going to do anything to solve this problem.  I\u2019d rather put up a $1M bounty for solutions. Now lets go to what I feel are the peripheral issues.     Akiva:  Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards at Compound & Cream and due to rates and rewards accrued on deposited collateral   I have said this before and will say it again.  MKR-R for Maker Rewards - compete with your competition on equal footing and give yourself at least one tool to achieve negative rates.   MKR-R gives Maker expanded tools for rate management which if coupled with a feed back and vesting mechanism a way to expand governance participation. I also said a long time ago that what Maker should do is basically take it\u2019s own surplus DAI and roll it into these protocols to earn return and farm the rewards.  This lowers returns due to competition, allows the protocol to participate in governance, or at a minimum sell the farming tokens for DAI or MKR lowering the price further lowering the returns, and sends a signal Maker isn\u2019t going to stand still. It also allows the protocol to earn return on the growing surplus which then can be used to burn MKR and/or MKR-R formally.  I will be voting NO on this proposal as it stands until some amount of evidence or analysis is put forward indicating this move will address the problem, and that a move of this size is required at this moment. I am going to point out the reason why we are here is because so far there has been no movement on alternative PEG management mechanisms. Or what I consider to be the Maker Trilemma. Decentralization PEG maintenance Full $1 to $1DAI collateralization. ",

I wouldn\u2019t say that the current situation is necessarily reflective of the past. Looking at active vs historical vaults shows that there clearly used to be a lot more small-holder vaults in the older ilks. Those users probably were more price sensitive. Big institutions care about price, but not only price. Being a reliable partner for them is probably just as important. At the end of the day, though, we\u2019re speculating. Because we have made little to no effort to actually understand who our vault users are and why they use us. We can point to Nexo all day long and call them on the phone, but for most vaults, we have not a lot of insight into who they are or what they\u2019re doing with their DAI. We\u2019re at an ATH for DAI supply today. Where\u2019s that extra 180,000,000 DAI going? < shrug > I\u2019d feel less squeamish about drastic rate cuts if they were based on some data to let us understand the magnitude of demand at lower rates, and not just the direction. It all feels very\u2026 unscientific and like we\u2019re engaging in some magical thinking if we think our most price-sensitive customers are necessarily going to be the ones who make up the shortfall in revenue.

                    "content": "Parameter Proposal Group: MakerDAO Open Market Committee Authors: @Primoz @LongForWisdom, @Monet-supply, @SebVentures, @Akiva, @hexonaut, @ultraschuppi  image1817\u00d71007 297 KB  Source: Risk Premiums & Competitive Rates April 2021 Table Notes:   Risk premiums and Maximum debt ceilings are based on Liquidations 2.0 which should be implemented in next few weeks for all assets   Negative competitive rates are mostly due to liquidity mining rewards at Compound & Cream and due to rates and rewards accrued on deposited collateral   Lending products between secondary lenders and MakerDAO are not standardized and therefore rates can not be strictly compared.    Lending Market Overview Competition in the AMM backed lending space is beginning to heat up, with Aave\u2019s v2 AMM market going live over the past month. This joins the Cream money market as a MakerDAO competitor. General competition for stablecoins is also increasing, with Liquity protocol (focused on ETH based lending) and Fei protocol both launching recently. Inverse Finance\u2019s DOLA stablecoin is another notable upstart competitor. Greater competition in the stablecoin space could reduce DAI demand and increase Maker\u2019s cost of capital, although this does not appear to be an issue presently. Rates have remained high throughout the month of March, with Aave in particular seeing very high stablecoin borrowing rates. This was partly caused by poorly tuned stable rate parameters, which allowed certain users to borrow all of Aave\u2019s liquidity for below market rates. This in turn caused borrow rates for opening new positions to reach extremely high levels. Aave is addressing this by deactivating stable rates in Aave v1 via a governance proposal.  Compound DAI Borrow Rates  image885\u00d7533 65.3 KB   Aave DAI Borrow Rates (yellow)  image714\u00d7463 84.6 KB   Proposed Changes  ETH-A and WBTC-A We aren\u2019t proposing any rate changes for our largest vault types this month since we have recently seen a notable amount of USDC-A and PSMUSDC-A unwinding and we may want to keep momentum going. The newly calculated risk premiums that are based on Liquidations 2.0 are also showing lower figures for higher debt exposures, which makes us less worried about the pace of debt increase on ETH-A.  LINK-A  Increase SF from 3.5% to 5%   Higher debt utilization has increased LINK-A risk premium and we therefore recommend 5% SF, which is still lower than average competitive rate of 7.9%.  ETH-B  Increase SF from 9.0% to 10.0%   Despite increasing SFs in the last months, the utilization of ETH-B has not changed. We believe we can increase SF by additional 1% as ETH-B borrowers might be less rate sensitive than believed.  YFI-A  Increase line from 75 MM to 90 MM   The current executive is raising the line of YFI-A from 45m to 75m. However, risk metrics for YFI-A currently look very good because of high collateralization of largest vaults and therefore an even higher debt ceiling can be implemented. We may though recommend higher SF for this vault type next month if the newly set debt ceiling becomes heavily utilized again or vault collateralization metrics worsen.  ZRX-A  Increase SF from 2.0% to 4.0%   ZRX has one of the worst on-chain liquidity metrics that is an important factor under Liquidations 2.0 implementation. Risk premium therefore increased and we recommend higher SF, especially if debt exposure continues to grow with recently increased debt ceiling to 10m.  AAVE-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 3.0% Increase line from 25 MM to 50 MM Increase gap from 2 MM to 5 MM   The on-chain liquidity of AAVE and vault collateralization metrics are very good and we can safely decrease SF. Similarly we recommend a higher debt ceiling despite the low utilization.  BAT-A  Decrease SF from 6.0% to 5.0% Increase line from 3 MM to 7 MM   BAT also has improved metrics which lead to risk premium to decrease. It is still higher compared to other similar collateral assets because of a lower 150% liquidation ratio. Yet, we recommend the decrease of SF and increase of Debt Ceiling.  RENBTC-A  Increase line from 2 MM to 10 MM Increase gap from 0.5 MM to 1 MM   Utilization on RENBTC-A has increased in the last month and recent joint undertakings from Alameda and Ren team decreased some of the risks associated with the RenVM protocol. We therefore recommend a higher debt ceiling.  LRC-A  Increase SF from 3.0% to 4.0% Decrease line from 10 MM to 5 MM Decrease gap from 2 MM to 1 MM   LRC on-chain liquidity is mostly on the L2 which creates some risks for Liquidations 2.0. We therefore recommend higher SF and lower debt ceilings until vault and liquidity metrics improve.  MANA-A  Decrease SF from 4.0% to 3.0% Increase line from 2 MM to 5 MM Increase gap from 0.5 MM to 1 MM   NFT hype has improved MANA metrics and we recommend slightly favourable changes to both debt ceiling and stability fee.  BAL-A  Decrease SF from 3.5% to 2.0% Increase line from 5 MM to 30 MM Increase gap from 1 MM to 3 MM   BAL metrics improved - although the volumes are lower, the on-chain market depth metrics are very good. Despite the SF being already low, we can afford to lower it additionally and boost demand.  Stablecoin Vaults  Decrease USDT-A Debt Ceiling from 2.5 MM to 0 MM   We believe the USDT-A vault doesn\u2019t carry any business significance for Maker and we are recommending to \u201cdisable\u201d this vault type by setting the debt ceiling to 0. Once we have PSM implemented for other stablecoins, we will also suggest setting debt ceiling for other stablecoins vaults to 0 (PAXUSD-A, GUSD-A).  UNI LPs  UNIV2DAIETH-A  Increase SF from 3% to 3.5% Increase line from 30 MM to 50 MM   Because of 125% LR, this vault\u2019s risk profile is similar to ETH-A and higher SF should be implemented from a risk perspective. We though recommend a smaller increase compared to ETHUSDC pair since we prefer users favour DAI pair. Because of recent high demand after increased debt ceiling we are also recommending another increase to equal USDCETH LP pair debt ceiling.  UNIV2USDCETH-A  Increase SF from 3.5% to 4.5%   Similarly as mentioned above, this UNI LP pair should have higher SF from a risk perspective as ETH exposure in Maker is increasing. Because of a) higher APY for eth-stablecoin pairs and b) 5x max leverage and c) much higher competitive rates at Aave we believe such SF is still very tempting for users.  UNIV2DAIUSDC-A  Decrease SF from 3.0% to 1.0%   We may want to stimulate this pair as it has a similar risk profile for Maker as PSM but can be more yielding. APY for users at max 11x leverage and at 1% rate can reach over 50%.  UNIV2WBTCETH-A  Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  20 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 3 MM   With the upcoming implementation of Liquidations 2.0 we believe we can safely increase debt ceilings of other riskier UNI LPs. The recommended debt ceiling increase is still lower than what models suggest due to caution and expected delay of Liq 2.0 implementations for UNI LPs.  UNIV2UNIETH-A  Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  20 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 3 MM   Model suggests a higher available debt ceiling but we are increasing it with caution for reasons mentioned above.  UNIV2LINKETH-A  Decrease SF from 5.0% to 4.0% Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  20 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 2 MM   A smaller increase in debt ceiling is due to higher LINK debt utilization on LINK-A vaults and lower demand.  UNIV2AAVEETH-A  Decrease SF from 5% to 4% Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  20 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 2 MM   A smaller increase in debt ceiling is due to smaller UNIV2AAVEETH current pool size and lower demand. We are also recommending lower SF due to lower exposure and low pool APY.  UNIV2ETHUSDT-A  Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  10 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 2 MM   We are suggesting smaller increases for USDT related exposures due to various Tether related concerns that still haven\u2019t completely settled.  UNIV2DAIUSDT-A  Decrease SF from 4% to 3% Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  10 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 2 MM  We are suggesting smaller increases for USDT related exposures due to various Tether related concerns that still haven\u2019t completely settled. We are also recommending lower SF to stimulate demand as there is not usage, probably due to lower pool APY.  UNIV2WBTCDAI-A  Decrease SF from 2% to 0% Replace Debt Ceiling of 3 MM with line of  20 MM Enable DC-IAM and set ttl to 12h and gap to 3 MM   image1240\u00d7651 47.7 KB  This vault type is not seeing any demand even at 2% and we are suggesting 0% rate to boost demand. Increased liquidity in this pool would also help Maker with our overall WBTC exposure and WBTC liquidity risks.  Final Note Proposed Parameter Changes will get included into next week\u2019s on-chain poll on 2021-04-11T22:00:00Z, and if passed will be included in an executive vote on 2021-04-15T22:00:00Z. ",

We limited USDT exposure in total to 20m (actually 10m in if you count 50% exposure in both UNI LP pairs) which equals or is below current Surplus buffer. Stablecoin vaults are not usable anyway and we see more downside than upside of having USDT-A enabled at this point. Even PAXUSD-A and GUSD-A are not really usable now considering PSM, but we don\u2019t see that much downside having it enabled until we have PSM for more stablecoins.     Replenish2030:  I think raising rates further on ETH is very user hostile. Is our goal really to squeeze our users so much that they quit using the protocol? Its especially strange when the new liquidation upgrade is coming soon which should supposedly allow higher DC for high leverage collateral types   Well I wouldn\u2019t say it would be hostile considering the market wide rates going higher again and the spread between competition and Maker only growing. But you are right that Liq 2.0 decreases risk premiums and we are more relaxed towards growing exposure on ETH. This was one of the reasons we didn\u2019t propose to increase ETH and WBTC first this time after 4 months of continuous rate increases even though the exposure keeps growing with the similar pace. It is debatable whether ETH-B needed a 1% increase at this point, but we jointly decided that ETH-B users are not very rate sensitive and we could afford another increase. ETH-B is also one of the best ETH leveraged products in DeFi (because of OSM and low LR) and for those bullish on ETH in current environment, 10% rate shouldn\u2019t hopefully hurt considering competitive rates. Plus we wanted to have risk premium covered, calculated at 9.9%. I personally think a lot of users are very rate insensitive currently when we are talking about 2-3% spreads and the recent a bit slower than expected migration from ETH-A to ETH-C just confirmed this. In bullish environment, people care about LR mostly. ",

Right now these changes feel very arbitrary and \u201cwhatcha gonna do\u201d IMO i would prefer to frame these things the opposite way. If the calculated risk premium is 9.9%, then anything below that is subsidized risk. So really eth-b right now has a risk subsidy of 1% which you are proposing to remove. That\u2019s a much better way of framing it since this implies that this isn\u2019t just yet another random rate hike that will just keep coming until we have crushed the users so much they start quitting.

We could have notice that even during the down market, vault position didn\u2019t change much and that is very valuable. We didn\u2019t get much liquidation either. ",

As it will have a different type of user, the one who wants to sleep over night by giving them 12 hours to unwind. On our side it will also diversify the risk and remove the selling pressure by spreading the liquidation. @Primoz said once I think, there is not much different historicaly in max 1h drop vs max 1 day drop for Eth.

This might be a quite good idea risk-wise (at least it seems without too much thinking). For Liq2.0 I have some concerns that ETH-C liquidation will be treated equally that ETH-B and ETH-A (there are ways to incentivize a bit but unsure how this will work in real life). Having ETH-C liquidation kicking in 6 hours later would give more time to liquidate the most urgent ETH-A and ETH-B (less safety buffer). If there is a big crash it would take a day to liquidate all we need anyway (limited by hole that avoid having too much slippage). But @Primoz is better than me on Liq2.0. ",
