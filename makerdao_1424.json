As the crypto market grows in adoption and accelerates post-Merge, Maker must implement a thorough information digestion system to attenuate the amount of data and news that must be mentally sorted out by each member of the organization \u2013 especially as we are considering spinning off into more discrete groups. ( My comment below talks about the historical problems of overstimulation in the tech industry. ) MOOGLES Imagine a Maker where we have devised a network of impartial correspondents, each with their particular \u201cbeat\u201d or section of Maker that they track and provide summary for (for instance, a \u201cMoogle\u201d for every two or three metaDAOs). They could meet together monthly over Zoom, presenting an account of each section of the DAO, as a sort of public global check-in. In addition, they could be required to pen a forum summary for their \u201cbeat\u201d on a weekly basis, run some sort of Q&A, or generally be the go-to person for consultation about that part of the DAO. ( Moogle refers to the synthesis-service-providing creatures in Kingdom Hearts (also Final Fantasy), but could also mean \u201cMaker Google.\u201d  ) BENEFITS For example, a UI designer could confer with the \u201cDev/Oracle Moogle\u201d to find out how the end user would want to interact with a given product, so they can get to the actual designing much faster than if they had to become fairly knowledgeable about the inner workings of a product, just to make its interface. Or, a delegate could consult the same Moogle to learn more about what impact a particular vote would have on oracles, in lieu of abstaining or voting without certainty. Informational clarity would be at its peak, and across the board Maker could be making the most informed possible decisions, with the most efficient mental energy cost. ",

He points out that the use of amphetamines and Prozac that characterized the 90s was in decline when the crash happened, suggesting that the drugs were used in part to match the attention levels and \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d required of the markets at the time. In their absence, the industry could no longer maintain its pumped up state. If we can work out our communications systems, we can avoid this strain and provide even more stability for Maker, especially in an industry that\u2019s already overflowing with stimulation before mass adoption.

I think something like this, but on a smaller scale is achieved with the regular week-to-week uploaded summaries of MIPs, the forum, polls and governance processes that occur. While it could be a better way, I feel that it is a step towards being able to better condense all the block-by-block input that is generated in the forum and by Maker. ",

Implementation is always a challenge, but it seems like there could be cool ways to encourage competitive coverage between Moogles. I\u2019m curious if you have any ideas re: compensation and how the DAO would go about ensuring Moogles would be accurate and impartial. But as someone who occasionally speaks to researchers, I would imagine working with Moogles could be fairly frictionless. Generally am happy to schedule a short call to talk about the things the CU is doing and would be even more motivated to do so if I knew the other person would be spreading the world to the community about it.

We should be able to use this expected parity to some advantage. If the parameters of these reports are agreed upon for each CU ahead of time, an auditor Moogle could easily go through and look for any significant disparities. The auditor should be blind to which report is whose beforehand. Actually, any Moogle could audit any other two Moogle\u2019s reports. If everything is working as it should, they should basically just check off the reports, and it shouldn\u2019t matter which one gets published. It\u2019s a fairly organized affair but incentivizes removing spin from what\u2019s essentially a history of the organization. And if the auditing Moogle spots something and that leads to one of the reports changing, that could cut a portion of compensation for the Moogle whose report changed. Perhaps pay in DAI like a regular salary and then there\u2019s some vesting MKR as well, and that\u2019s the part that would diminish. ",
