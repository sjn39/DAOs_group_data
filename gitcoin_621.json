                    "content": "** This proposal has been edited to reflect the conversation in the comments section ** - 1:23pm MT 12/6/21  Summary  This proposal is to retroactively allocate an appropriate number of GTC tokens to Kevin Seagraves, the lead engineer and product manager for Gitcoin Grants V1. Gitcoin Grants has become core to the Gitcoin platform and a staple in the Ethereum ecosystem having distributed ~$16M to open source projects at the time of GTC creation. I was allocated and claimed ~327.778 GTC for the bounties I paid out while building out Gitcoin Grants, but I did not receive a stakeholder allocation for core contributors as mentioned in the article announcing the creation of GTC or a GMV allocation in the community airdrop for the work of actually building Gitcoin Grants.  Abstract  I am the 7th leading contributor to Gitcoin by lines of code, contributing 47,747 lines for Gitcoin Grants V1. Gitcoin Grants has emerged as one of the leading products in the Gitcoin portfolio and has distrubted $22.76m in funding to open source projects at the time of writing. Gitcoin\u2019s mission is to \u201cGrow Open Source\u201d and I believe my work has contributed significantly to executing on that mission.  Motivation  I LOVE Gitcoin. I was one of the first contributors to Gitcoin having co-authored the original Bounties smart contracts with Kevin Owocki, reviewing Kevin\u2019s never-released whitepaper, and reviewing the logo design and color palette back in 2017. I came back to Gitcoin and built an industry-leading product with Gitcoin Grants. I wrote the requirement for the beloved Bot Learning To Love meme. I would LOVE to have a stake and continue to contribute to the Gitcoin Community and DAO.  Heart Bot  image1280\u00d7853 156 KB  The Gitcoin team at DevCon 4 in Prague. I\u2019m in the Gitcoin Tree shirt, bottom left.  Specification  This proposal can be fulfilled via a transaction from the GitcoinDAO treasury or other appropriate store of funds to captnseagraves.eth based on the calculation below. GMV Allocation - Calculate a GMV allocation based on the funds I was paid to build Gitcoin Grants. The project was originally a bounty, but was so large in scope I was paid as a contract and not on the platform. Thus it was not calculated as part of the airdrop and I did not recieve tokens for this work done. Based on my tax returns, which I am happy to provide to select individuals if needed, I was paid a total of $29430 for my work on Gitcoin Grants. Based on the following equation and math: Formula: GMV per user / GMV Total * GMV Allocation Percent 29430 / 22,000,000 * 10,800,000 = 14447.4545455 I feel retroactive allocation of 14447.4545455 GTC would be appropriate.  Benefits  The Gitcoin ecosystem can uphold and ensure the integrity of its mission to \u201cGrow Open Source\u201d and appropriately reward one of its oldest and most prolific contributors. It can set a positive precedent to reward individuals who have added significant value to the ecosystem in the past and who were passed by earlier this year in the GTC creation event. The ecosystem will empower one of its biggest supporters to continue contributing in meaningful ways.  Drawbacks  These funds may come from the DAO Treasury rather than from the original token airdrop allocation.  Vote  This proposal consists of two votes (I would provide snapshot votes, but do not currently have enough GTC to submit a snapshot proposal):  The first is to approve the retroactive allocation of GTC to Kevin Seagraves the lead engineer of Gitcon Grants V1:     Approve retroactive allocation of 14447.4545455 GTC to Kevin Seagraves  Yes No     0 voters     Appreciation Beyond all this token business, I am so grateful to the Gitcoin team for their friendship and everything they have enabled me to do in my career. Thanks @owocki @vivekmsignh @ceresstation @Pixelant @octavioamu @thelostone-mc @frankchen07 @austingriffith, and everyone else in the gitcoin fam, for everything. Much Love   ",

Three pieces of context I feel that it\u2019d be appropriate to share.   Kevin Seagraves did contribute as a contractor to Gitcoin Grants in late 2018/early 2019.  In mid 2017   In the initial design, we did consider doing a retroactive distribution to all of the Github contributors to gitcoinco/web to https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/ but eventually that got cut.  If memory serves me   a. this was because we didnt have the product/engineering capacity to do it. b. I remember that instead of rewarding contributors 1 by 1 we did want to come up with a generalized & neutral distribution approach to reward them all in 1 fell swoop.      Do we have any idea how you were missed in the token allocation and if there are other core contributors in a similar circumstance?  The token allocation for the stakeholders did not include contractors who did not stay long enough to be on a 1 year cliff/4year vesting schedule.  All contributors in this stakeholder allocation were on a 1 year cliff/4 year vest. ",

                    "content": "@owocki Thanks for sharing that context. It is very helpful.   Confirming this is true.   This is helpful to hear how the GMV allocation method was arrived at as the core method for token distribution. Of course, no model was going to be perfect but does seem to be a flaw that a significant contributor to the code base was passed over. My argument to the community is that my contractor payments could have been processed on the Gitcoin platform, as the project was originally a bounty, and I would have received a GMV allocation more in line with the value I helped to create for the Gitcoin ecosystem. The scope of the project was so large I was brought on as a contractor, so was not paid via a bounty and thus not allocated tokens.   This is helpful context around stakeholder allocations as well. It sounds like I would not qualify for that allocation. I will revise the proposal to remove that option.   @owocki Follow-up question, can you confirm if this is the formula that was used to calculate GMV allocations? GMV per user / GMV Total * GMV Allocation Percent ",

It will calculate a token allocation based on the compensation previously paid out as if those funds were distributed via a Bounty or a Grant on the Gitcoin platform.

I think Gitcoin Grants are one of the \u201cCore Function\u201d of Gitcoin and many of us has had benefits from close or far either while having a Grant and receiving funding or in my case I was able to get some dRewards from the \u201cGrants Reviewing\u201d Squad with GitcoinDAO because I was working on the grants approval. I would like to personally say thank you because the grant system had a huge impact over the community and around Gitcoin ecosystems      captnseagraves:  I received feedback from a few stewards via direct messages that this proposal makes initial sense and is worth putting to a community vote.   I would like to see more comments from each Stewards in this post so we can debate around this request. My suggestion at this point would be to have an overlook at other participants or \u201cCore contributors\u201d from Commits \u00b7 gitcoinco/web \u00b7 GitHub + Contributors to gitcoinco/web (github.com) and from what I see there is a few that deserve some rewards or that have similar contributions. This post is similar to the artist behind moonshot bots. There is another option instead of digging into the treasury, we could either:  Chip-in 250$-500$ each, let\u2019s say you have 100 contributors this is 25-50K$ Witch is a nice bonus I think. You open a grant, and we contribute to your grant\u2026 Unknown amount of funding but it might be interesting  On the other side, it could be also interesting to know if you were a paid contractor at that moment, or simply contributing to open-source projects/software  If you did agree on a certain amount to build the grants system, then I think it\u2019s not appropriate to ask for more funding or rewards afterward.  If not, we might want to consider a retro-active airdrop for you or debate in the option mentioned above. This is only my own opinion and I would like to see more comments from other Stewards. ",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for stewards to have to be called to make a decision here, especially if it involves business of Gitcoin Holdings back in 2018. I think this should be discussed (1) in private with Gitcoin holdings and then if something is agreed (2) a proposal to the DAO that has the support of and a lot more details from Gitcoin holdings. Followup questions:  This could be considered an \u201cunpaid debt\u201d of Gitcoin holdings. Not the DAO. Why does Gitcoin DAO have to take it over? Are there any more such debts? As an active DAO participant and someone who wants to put the DAO\u2019s interests first I would really like to know the answer to the question.  @captnseagraves you appear to be #13 contributor to the gitcoin web repo with work carried out over 1 month. January to February 2019: Commits \u00b7 gitcoinco/web \u00b7 GitHub    2021-12-12_23-03980\u00d7446 35.6 KB  From what I understand this was paid work. Why do you feel you should receive 14447.4545455 GTC ($152131.69 by time of writing) for this one month of work on top of what you were paid to deliver? Have all of the people above you, people who seem to have contributed a lot more work ,and some still are, been also compensated in this manner? I mean even @androolloyd has more commits in the repo and over a longer period of time than you.  Again here I feel it unfair on the stewards and the DAO to have to deal with \u201cdirty laundry\u201d of Gitcoin holdings. If anything, anythign at all is decided here it should be for every single missed contributor. And then the tricky part (and what would be unfair to some) would be to figure out the actual value submitted. Lines of code, commits or anything like that is a silly and extremely easily gameable metric. The only person who would actually know the true value of each contributor would be the CTO. And again \u2026 this is why this should be solved between Gitcoin holdings and its former employees / contractors. ",

                    "content": "@lefterisjp Thank you for this thorough reply  It is very healthy and helpful for the conversation.     lefterisjp:  This could be considered an \u201cunpaid debt\u201d of Gitcoin holdings. Not the DAO. Why does Gitcoin DAO have to take it over? Are there any more such debts? As an active DAO participant and someone who wants to put the DAO\u2019s interests first I would really like to know the answer to the question.   I am not exactly sure how the token was architected so I may be wrong here, but my understanding is that the DAO ultimately allocated and issued GTC. In any case, the DAO now has full control over allocating GTC, so my request is to the DAO. Gitcoin Holdings did pay me out as a contractor, so there isn\u2019t an unpaid debt. I was a contractor paid to build Gitcoin Grants just like the thousands of other work-for-hire jobs found and paid out via Bounties and Grants, but unlike those other thousands of jobs done I was not allocated GTC in the airdrop because the value I was paid did not transact on Gitcoin. I built the platform that was used to allocate tokens but was not allocated tokens myself.     lefterisjp:  you appear to be #13 contributor to the gitcoin web repo with work carried out over 1 month. January to February 2019: Commits \u00b7 gitcoinco/web \u00b7 GitHub   I am the #7 contributor to Gitcoin by lines of code added at 44,747. You are looking at commits, which in my opinion is not as good of a measure of value-added. Commits can also be squashed and the number displayed can be lowered. That is in fact what happened a number of times with Gitcoin Grants to my recollection. Mark Beacom squashed commits to keep the record smaller. I can also change one character, create a commit, and push it to Github, manipulating this number. With lines of code, if there is a linter enforced, this cannot happen in a non-standardized way across all contributors.  This work was carried out over 6 months, from August 2018 to January 2019. Github only displays contributions to a repositories default branch. My changes, adding Gitcoin Grants directory to the Gitcoin Web repo, were not added to the master branch, the repo\u2019s default branch until January 2019.      lefterisjp:  From what I understand this was paid work. Why do you feel you should receive 14447.4545455 GTC ($152131.69 by time of writing) for this one month of work on top of what you were paid to deliver?   It was paid work, just like all of the other thousands of developers who were found and paid out for work via Gitcoin Bounties and Grants. All of those developers were allocated tokens in addition to the money they earned on Gitcoin. Surely, building Gitcoin Grants, the platform many of those individuals used and were allocated tokens for using, merits at least the same class of token allocation. As I shared above, it was 6 months of work.     lefterisjp:  Have all of the people above you, people who seem to have contributed a lot more work ,and some still are, been also compensated in this manner? I mean even @androolloyd has more commits in the repo and over a longer period of time than you.   Every person who has committed more lines of code than me (Owocki, thelostone-mc, mbeacom, octavioamu, danlipert, & gdixon) is or was a Gitcoin Core team member. If they had an agreement for equity and stayed for longer than a 1 year cliff, they would have a stakeholder allocation, and would (I hope) have a much larger allocation than I am requesting. In response to your point about @androolloyd. And this is in no way intended as a slight to Andrew, he has written 23,029 lines of code for Gitcoin. Around half of the 44,747 lines I have contributed.      lefterisjp:  Again here I feel it unfair on the stewards and the DAO to have to deal with \u201cdirty laundry\u201d of Gitcoin holdings.   If the DAO has the power to allocate GTC and Gitcoin Holdings does not, I believe this is the appropriate forum to make this request. Perhaps Gitcoin Holdings architected the token issuance and made an oversight regarding early contributors and contractors, but they have since handed control over to the DAO.     lefterisjp:  If anything, anythign at all is decided here it should be for every single missed contributor. And then the tricky part (and what would be unfair to some) would be to figure out the actual value submitted.   Agreed. That is why I propose only considering contractors who performed significant work for Gitcoin Holdings early on, were not provided a stakeholder allocation, and were not paid out on Gitcoin and so did not receive a GMV allocation in the airdrop. To my knowledge, there is only one other candidate, the author of Gitcoin Kudos V1. Perhaps there are 1 or 2 others. I propose these contractors are allocated tokens as if the funds they were paid were transacted on the Gitcoin platform as a Bounty or a Grant, like the thousands of other developers who worked and earned on Gitcoin. I plan on reaching out to the other top contributors to Gitcoin in the next few days to see if any of them were contractors in the past and fit the above description. If they self-identify Gitcoin Holdings should be able to confirm their contractor status or not without any privacy issues. This sets a very high bar for the retroactive allocation, with a small number of significant early contributors, using the same allocation mechanism that the airdrop employed. In sum, my request is to be included in the governance of the platform I helped build. I believe my work has contributed greatly to the mission of \u201cGrowing Open Source\u201d and has helped facilitate funding for thousands of developers. It is unfortunate that a small few\u2019s early work, that every holder of GTC has benefited from, was not allocated tokens. This is an opportunity to rectify that. I am asking that my work be recognized by the community and to be granted the same opportunity to participate like everyone else. ",

I want to bring some points as a core developer for like 3 years in Gitcoin, because not sure how that will affect or not in the calcs or if even I would be benefit by the proposal. I started first as a user on Gitcoin, then moved as a contractor (I was the front end dev on Kudos v1 the other one was Jason)  and after some time got hired, first as contractor then as core dev. In the next 3 years worked with every product on gitcoin (very proud of it  ) Today Im not longer a Gitcoin core dev I vested part of my vesting tokens but I wasn\u2019t part of the airdrop either because I was a core dev at token launch time. By contract my tokens will be locked for one year more so I don\u2019t own any  Of course I was paid for all the work I done here and very glad and grateful to be worked on Gitcoin, but at the same time looking on what is fair or not I understand @captnseagraves feelings, I started when the team was really small, the product was only bounties so I feel I could add more value to the community, of course \u201cadding value\u201d not necessary is attached to the amount of tokens, but I do feel makes part of the feeling of \u201cbelong\u201d. About the formula, I feel is very relative when talking about contractors or employee and not sure if should be based on the amount received as I feel is not a good validator of value added.  I feel time based is strong way to measure dedication to a project. Again, my intention here is bringing \u201cthe feelings from the other side\u201d I will be happy on any decision. ",

And I\u2019d say you succeed in being deferential to stewards \u2013 if the stewards feel the scope is too small for a wider judgement (2 potential claimants), then it really is the best decision to then defer back to you/gitcoin holdings internal team. There isnt really any conflict of interest or centralizing risk given steward request and limited scope. My more general thoughts: Its clear there appears there is a consensus that there should be some reward. It seems the issue that @lefteris /folks have is largely with the size of the claim rather than a claim itself. That said, internal context within gitcoin is probably necessary to judge where kevins work sits on the spectrum / how much compensation is reasonable. + I think context regarding any potential implication of future equity whenever Kevin\u2019s employment began is probably necessary as well (even if just implied in the company\u2019s ethos). Other context is of course the other people that were rewarded. I feel I received an absurd amount of GTC, what equates to a bit over $120,000 though it was largely because I hit many qualifiers (Kernel Participant & Mentor, large donator, large grant recipient). Have my contributions been more than Kevin? Honestly, who knows, but probably not. I have contributed quite a lot in small ways over time, and I do not personally know the details of his contribution + can personally speak to how horrible LOC is for a metric (my first project was, a disgusting 20,000 line rebalancing tool/python GUI), so its hard to say. All this said I personally err on over-rewarding past/potential contributors, rather than potentially undercompensating them. ",

                    "content": "Happy 2022 everyone! Wanted to give an update to the community. I received this email from @owocki this morning.  Hey Kevin, Thanks for your patience as we worked through this discussion over the holidays. We (Gitcoin Holdings Leadership) decided that we\u2019re not in support of this proposal (or a variant that rewards past contractors) at this time.  I understand this is not the outcome you wanted to hear.  I\u2019ll do my best to capture the discussion below. The primary reasons we decided not to support:  You and I didn\u2019t meet on the platform or do any of the engagement on the platform, and so it\u2019s not appropriate to treat our engagement like it should be retro distribution for platform usage. You didn\u2019t stay at gitcoin for the cliff time (6 months), so it\u2019s not appropriate to treat it like you\u2019re a full time employee or long term contractor allocation. The proposal is not in the best interest of the community, it\u2019s only in the best interest of a small handful of people. Supporting the proposal would set a precedent for people to come out of the woodwork and ask for distributions, and that\u2019s not in the best interest of the community.   The message went on to include a personal note as Kevin and I have been friends since 2017 and still see each other regularly in the Boulder, CO community. While the Gitcoin Holding recommendation is unfortunate for myself and other early contractors, and I disagree with the outcome, I will accept it moving forward. I will respond to the points above and then I will consider this matter resolved:  I seem to fall in an edge case that is just not worth it to have included in the community/GitcoinDAO governance.   Yes, this is the exception I was proposing for early contractors.   My records indicate that the first day I submitted an invoice for work was 7/20/18 and my last day submitted for work was 2/22/19. 8 months in total. If 6 months was the cliff, then it appears that I do qualify for a long-term contractor allocation. Regardless, crypto-winter hit and I left because it was unclear whether there would be funding for me in the next month, let alone whether ConsenSys would consider hiring me full time.   3 & 4. What I hear in these statements is, this edge case of early contractors wasn\u2019t included in the original token drop and is now too politically costly to address. There is no comment on the quality or value of the work contributed, which seemed to be a significant point of conversation in the thread above. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t valuable work to lead the effort on Gitcoin Grants v1. This outcome seems misaligned with Gitcoin\u2019s core mission and how it has rewarded contributors on its platform in the past.  However, the community asked for Gitcoin Holdings\u2019 recommendation and this is the result. I am happy to live with that. Thank you everyone for the time, effort, and thought you put into this proposal. It really does show the willingness to govern and work together on issues. I am truly grateful to be a part of this community. I wish Kevin, the Gitcoin Holdings team, the GitcoinDAO and platform, and all those working to provide public goods the best of luck and the highest success. I will always support you. I will always be your friend and advocate. Best, Kevin ",

I personally don\u2019t consider it case closed. I\u2019m in a similar boat here, except that I did engage with the gitcoin.co bounties before I met Kevin personally.  I contributed to bounties as early as November and December of 2017.  Once I started to get more involved with Gitcoin, I wanted to play a bigger role.  At that point I was put under contract with Gitcoin rather than going through the bounty system. As a contractor, I worked for Gitcoin for longer than 6 months - my records indicate I was involved with Gitcoin for about a full year.  I contributed to the gitcoin/web codebase and launched Kudos V1 - which involved leading the project, writing the backend code, and writing and deploying the solidity contract. I share the sentiment of @captnseagraves and feel that the allocation of GTC does not truly represent the contributions of the community members, and contractors are being left out in the cold. So to address the 4 items: 1 and 2 don\u2019t apply to me.  3 and 4 seem like easy outs to not address the issue at hand.  How many people are going to come out of the woodwork? It seems like some of the biggest contributors were these contractors, and in those days there were only a handful working on the project. ",
