                    "content": "I love Maker DAO and what they are doing. But let\u2019s be frank: there is no KYC/AML on the in and outflow of funds in the vault. The fact that the DAO can go ahead and use anonymous funds to buy US Treasuries seems like a huge blind spot in the counterparty\u2019s AML/KYC program. What if they find later that some of the vaulted funds are tainted or associated with sanctioned individuals? What then? Asset freezing on the Treasuries putting the collateral system of Maker at risk. I don\u2019t get this approach. Maybe I have completely missed something and I am going to be corrected by the more knowledgeable community members which I look forward to. ",
