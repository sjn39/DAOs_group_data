                    "content": "MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application for 80% BAL 20% ETH Balancer Pool Token  Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  @monet-supply  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Balancer is a decentralized exchange that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens and custom allocations. Traders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. BAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals and changes. The 80% BAL / 20% ETH Balancer pool token represents an ownership share of the assets in the underlying Balancer pool. It is currently the largest and most liquid pool on the Balancer exchange with over $50 million in total liquidity. The Balancer exchange is also offering a long term liquidity incentive program, which was recently updated to favor liquidity between key BAL pairs. This has resulted in this pool currently earning BAL rewards of around ~200% APY (this figure may change with new governance proposals or changes in asset price).  Provide a brief history of the project.  Balancer was co-founded by Mike McDonnald and Fernando Martinelli in 2019. Balancer Labs held a seed round in March 2020 and launched the exchange to the public. Liquidity and usage grew substantially after Balancer began offering BAL reward distributions to liquidity providers, with total value locked in their contracts currently over $1 billion.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Whitepaper: https://balancer.finance/whitepaper/ Blog: Balancer AMM DeFi Protocol Documentation: https://docs.balancer.finance/ Website: https://balancer.finance/ Source Code: Balancer Labs \u00b7 GitHub 80% BAL / 20% ETH LP token contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x59a19d8c652fa0284f44113d0ff9aba70bd46fb4 BAL token: https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.  Audit section of Docs: https://docs.balancer.finance/protocol/security/audits  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs Forum: https://forum.balancer.finance/ Discord: Discord  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  BAL is the governance token of Balancer Exchange. It is used in governance voting (primarily concerning modifications to the liquidity mining program. BAL has recently been given a few advantages in the liquidity program, including a \u201cBAL factor\u201d where any liquidity with BAL is more heavily weighted for rewards, as well as \u201cBAL liquidity staking\u201d where 31% of total rewards are reserved for liquidity between BAL and the most important defi tokens (including ETH). Any BAL deposited in liquidity pools is also counted for voting weight purposes. The applying collateral type (80/20 BAL/ETH Balancer Pool token) represents an ownership share of the underlying assets in the liquidity pool. Users can trade against the pool in exchange for 0.15% fee per trade as well as slippage depending on the trade size and liquidity depth. With 80% of the pool allocated to BAL and 20% ETH, the pool will suffer relatively less impermanent loss from price changes and will maintain stronger BAL exposure than a Uniswap pool with 50/50 weights.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  No, Balancer Exchange and the BAL token are decentralized. Balancer Labs is a privately held company which created Balancer v1 and is still heavily involved in directing the project.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  The LP tokens can be created from or redeemed for their underlying assets (BAL and ETH) via the Balancer UI and contracts. Most BAL liquidity is on Balancer itself, but BAL is also traded on centralized exchanges including Binance, FTX, and OKEx.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  None as far as I\u2019m aware.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  Centralized exchanges from (9) may offer price feeds for BAL. Ratio of Balancer LP tokens to BAL and ETH is freely accessible on chain via Balancer contracts.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Special considerations: Holders of this LP token receive weekly BAL distributions via airdrop, currently amounting to around ~200% APY. We\u2019ll need to be sure that vault owners (or Maker in the case of liquidation) are able to recover these tokens. The process for BAL redirection described in Balancer Github here may be helpful. Disclosure: I hold BAL. ",

If we have not done the normal diligence for subcollateral, we could end up accepting a pool that is worthless overall. Suppose there is a balancer pool that is 99% WETH, 1% SHIT. Under your position we might value the WETH enough to accept the collateral. But the unverified SHIT then hyperinflates to zero, and we are unable to liquidate the liquidity before most all of the WETH is gone. In this scenario, the mere presence of SHIT is significant enough to threaten the whole pool. We must not skip due diligence for all subcollateral. Subcollateral is collateral. ",

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. yUSD (also known as yyCRV) is an ERC-20 token issued by Yearn.finance that represents shares in Yearn\u2019s most popular vault: the yCRV Vault. yUSD aims to be a \u2018better USD\u2019\u2014a smart-asset backed by a basket of stablecoins autonomously working to harvest yield from sources such as Aave, Compound, dydx, and Curve. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. yEarn was launched in 2020 and initially optimized yield across Compound, dydx, Aave, and Fulcrum. The yCRV vault is the most popular yield strategy and currently has over locked $250 million in stablecoins. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. yEarn documentation yUSD documentation yUSD token contract vaults.finance source code on github Current yCRV strategy 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. yEarn audits 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Twitter Community/governance forum: gov.yearn.finance Voting portal: ygov.finance Discord 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? As a long term Stable coin interest account (in the yCRV vault current value ~$250 million) Within the current yETH strategy which deposits ETH into a Maker vault As the reward token for the YFI staked in the governance contract. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? yUSD is a decentralized token. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? yUSD is minted by depositing assets into the yCRV vault. yUSD also trades on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or Balancer. ",

And I imagine that\u2019s great! Would you please spend a few words, for the less Defi-savy of us, discussing the intricacies of this collateral onboarding? In my simple-minded view, yUSD is a basket of stablecoins (including DAI), which are actively and cleverly managed to gain some interests. Question: what would you do (useful and productive) if yUSD was a collateral? It\u2019s not immediately clear to me, why you\u2019d want to mint new DAI from yUSD (which is itself composed in part of DAI). We already support the major stable-coins as collaterals. Why isn\u2019t this sufficient for your purposes (the basket of stablecoins that yUSD represents can be used in CDPs now)? It seems to me like onboarding yUSD implies some kind of circularity. I am not saying this negatively, but I\u2019d like to try to understand it better. Thanks in advance ",

                    "content": "Thanks for all of the questions.  Question:  what would you do (useful and productive) if yUSD was a collateral?  The most basic way to use a yUSD Maker CDP/vault is to simply mint dai from the yUSD (which is a credit to my underlying yCRV strategy on yearn), turn the Dai into yCRV, and deposit back into the vault to earn more yUSD. What makes this vault particularly exciting is that the Yearn community incentivizes its community to create \u2018strategies\u2019 (what they call \u2018vaults\u2019) for yield.  Some of their strategies utilize Maker CDPs (such as their ETH-vault strategy\u2013although it is currently paused).  If they had the ability to mint Dai from yUSD it is likely they would create vault strategies that allows for greater returns than their current yCRV vault without end users having to play with CDP\u2019s. Currently the outstanding 258M yUSD is largely sitting idle (although it accrues value on its own, and it may be farmed by newer protocols).  The idea that DAI backs DAI is a strange one.  Should we eg. allow yDAI as a collateral? Also very stable one.  It is important to note that yUSD does contain underlying Dai, by association of being a claim on yCRV.  Here is the current breakdown of yCRV collateral makeup:   DAI:  33,437,386.49 (5.14%)  USDC:  159,826,477.28 (24.58%)  USDT:  253,537,768.17 (38.99%)  TUSD:  203,399,884.98 (31.28%)  DAI+USDC+USDT+TUSD:  650,201,516.92  There has been some in-depth discussions around Dai backing Dai / recursive assets in these threads, particularly aDai/cDai:     [Discussion] cDAI/aDAI/yDAI collaterals as a peg enabler tool Governance       Please find below a capture of the last balance sheet of the Fed regarding the collateralization of dollar bills (federal reserve notes).

                    "content": "[SLP-DAI-USDC] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application for Sushiswap DAI-USDC LP Token  Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  @monet-supply  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset.This tends to be a lower concern for stablecoin pairs. The SLP-DAI-USDC LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and USD Coin (USDC). This token currently has $90,000 of liquidity spread among 3 total holders (most liquidity is owned by a single address). Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Liquidity and usage fell off after launch and bottomed out in November, before rebounding to rival Uniswap\u2019s TVL and usage levels.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

SLP-DAI-USDC LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. As both assets track 1 USD, there is lower risk of impermanent loss for depositors. SLP-DAI-USDC is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Sushiswap LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The USDC token is issued by the Centre consortium which includes CirclePay and Coinbase. Further details can be found here: USD Coin (USDC) | Fully Reserved Fiat-Backed Stablecoin  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  SLP-DAI-USDC can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Sushiswap contracts and front end UI. DAI and USDC are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. USDC can also be redeemed or created 1:1 for USD on Coinbase.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  n/a  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  n/a  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a I think this might be a good initial Sushiswap LP pair to onboard, because the pair does not receive incentives so we wouldn\u2019t need to deal with harvesting rewards.

                    "content": "This application is now closed! Please take a look at our new application here. This is a MIP6 Proposal for the addition of REINNO\u2019s tokenized commercial real estate backed loans to MCD by REINNO. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The asset originator is REINNO as is represented by Viktor Viktorov (@Viktor_REINNO, [email\u00a0protected]no.io, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer) and Hristo Piyankov (@Hristo_Piyankov, [email\u00a0protected], Chief Data Officer). 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. REINNO is a financial technology company offering a new solution for lending and real estate tokenization with a focus on providing liquidity. Our services cover the technology, corporate structure, legal compliance and marketability of tokenized real estate assets. We are positioned to be the first company to accept tokenized real estate as loan collateral. Our proven expertise in lending and financial services allowed us to realize this tremendous opportunity. Lending using tokenized real estate as collateral provides much higher flexibility, simplifies the application process and reduces costs for end customers. REINNO is a turnkey solution for anyone who wants to tokenize real estate and who is matching our eligibility criteria. Through our offerings, property owners obtain new ways of both replacing their existing bank mortgage and borrowing against their equity in a property. Using digital tokens as loan collateral allows for greater liquidity and cheaper funding, benefiting the end customer. In effect, by tokenizing their assets users can trade real estate in fractions with higher liquidity and lower costs. REINNO\u2019s ultimate goal is to build the first truly international real estate tokenization platform, which will provide the full spectrum of blockchain-based financial services for consumers worldwide. REINNO is the company behind the very new Tokenized Instant Lending (TIL) concept for real estate. This new approach is possible because of the blockchain technology that underpins it and the rising security tokens popularity. TIL is making real estate associated loans (mortgage, HELOC and home equity loans) efficient, fast, flexible and with no need to foreclose. Using tokenized real estate as collateral allows us to tremendously improve the way these loans work today. REINNO combines the benefits that you could have from having a mortgage, a HELOC or a home equity loan and bundles them in one product adding even more benefits. Usually a mortgage blocks the entire property, making it hard for the owner to sell any equity from it. Even if they have already repaid $4,900,000 of a $5,000,000 mortgage, the entire asset is blocked by the bank. However, by using tokens (fractional digital ownership) borrowers are able to take out an instant loan backed by just a fraction of the real estate value. This way, only the tokens used as collateral are being blocked; the rest of the equity remains free and can be accessed for additional funding or sold as needed. Moreover, when a portion of principal is repaid, the borrower receives an equity equivalent back. The more principal is repaid, the more tokens are freed from the collateral. Furthermore, if two people are holding tokens that represent the same property, a loan taken by one person will not affect the tokens (or ownership) of the other in any way. REINNO will bundle multiple tokens representing tokenized real estate into a single REINNO token, which in turn will be used as collateral for obtaining DAI. REINNO tokenizations to date:  Collateral: US-based commercial real estate Total value tokenized : $355,137,266 Completed deals: 8 Deals in the pipeline: 9  3. Provide a brief history of the project. The idea for REINNO was born in December 2018 when Viktor Viktorov, it\u2019s CEO, was working on another project related to cryptocurrencies. He saw the potential that tokenization had in the real estate space and decided to start a new company. Since then, REINNO has reached many important milestones. The company completed its first tokenization of a commercial real estate fund worth $105.5 mln in January 2020. It also created a unique legal and technical structure that allows REINNO to streamline the tokenization process. Since then, it tokenized a total of eight projects worth over $355 mln. All of them include income-producing properties located in the U.S., including residential, retail, healthcare and industrial real estate. REINNO launched the demo version of its lending platform in August 2019. The company created a proprietary lending model that accounts for the risks associated with both real estate and digital tokens. Currently, REINNO is in the negotiations with a bank that will originate the loans. The company also built a marketplace where investors from all over the world can invest in tokenized real estate. With the recent amendments from SEC allowing investors with certain professional knowledge, experience or certification to qualify as accredited, even more people can participate in the offerings. Other achievements include winning Startup World Cup regionals (2020 edition; the finale was postponed due to the COVID-19 complications), appearing as experts in industry-specific publications and media (e.g. Decrypt, Value.Tokenized), and building a strong team. REINNO brings together experts in commercial real estate, fintech, IT, law and business growth. It also has a global tea of sales people around the world - from the USA and UK to Nigeria and Russia.  timeline updated2094\u00d71166 333 KB  4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Examples of tokens issued by REINNO: Token 1 Token 2 REPO LINK Pitch deck 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Not available at the moment. 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. LinkedIn Twitter 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? For the time being, REINNO tokenizes individual commercial real estate locations and real estate portfolios, and issues their own individual security tokens which represent fractional ownership of the building or portfolio (and the underlying cash flows). As part of the integration with Maker, REINNO will issue a single REINNO token (not yet existing) which will bundle multiple tokenized real estate assets. The token itself will be a stablecoin with a fixed price of one USD and it will essentially function the exact same way as multi-collateral DAI does. Subsequently, this token will be used as collateral in order to produce DAI. The reason for the second step is to provide liquidity to the REINNO token in order to disburse loans to the projects which lock their security tokens in the REINNO contract. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? WE as Reinno Tokenization LLC or Reinno Property Management LLC, USA, Delaware 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Currently, the REINNO token is non-existent. The security tokens produced by REINNO as a result of commercial real estate tokenization will shortly be available for sale on REINNO\u2019s marketplace and subsequently on REINNO\u2019s secondary market (still in development). Even after the REINNO token is created, it will not be made available for trading on any exchange, since its only function will be to bundle multiple security tokens and obtain a loan against them. As such the liquidation sequence will be:  Obtain REINNO token in exchange for DAI (at a discount) Obtain a security token in liquidation in exchange for REINNO token (at a discount) Sell the security token on REINNO\u2019s secondary market (or any other marker where it is listed) OR hold the token and benefit from % of its cashflows.  10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. LINK 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Not applicable. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. REINNO will perform regular audits and re-appraisals of any real estate which is subject to tokenization and subsequently loan disbursement. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type REINNO will act as a liquidator both for the REINNO/DAI contract and for the REINNO/(tokenized real estate) contract.

If yes - what is REINNO\u2019s process regarding this?   Yes. We do our own KYC for all registered users and our escrow provider does KYC for everyone who actually invests.     Planet_X:  If REINNO is the only place that trades REINNO, it means Maker faces a counterparty risk. Can you please detail the liquidation process for Maker Vaults containing REINNO?       Planet_X:  Above you state REINNO will not be listed on exchanges and then two sentences later it is sold for DAI at an exchange. Maybe it is just me but I think this requires some clarification.   At the core of REINNO\u2019s business is the tokenization of individual commercial real estate properties (or portfolios) into separate tokens. We are then looking to provide loans against those tokens. The REINNO token is not part of the original REINNO technology stack, but rather a derivative tool, specifically designed to enable us to integrate with Maker. We are currently in discussions with Centrifuge on what is the best way to handle this. We are also, very much looking for feedback from the Maker community on the best approach, since this is not one of our core competencies. To address question 3 in particular, in our design, REINNO will be exchangeable for DAI via a smart contract, when a liquidation is triggered, but REINNO will not be listed on exchanges for trading. We apologize for the poor wording of the original text.     Planet_X:   Bundling individual properties into a single token has some advantages as well as disadvantages. Can you describe how Maker (or rather a Maker appointed auditor) ensures both the quality control process behind each application and the value of the bundled token?    REINNO will perform an independent assessment for each property applying for a loan. Furthermore those properties will be re-assessed on bi-annual basis. All the documents produced in the process will be made available to the appointed auditor. Furthermore each property is a cash-flow producing assets, so they can also be assessed by the actual money coming in.     Planet_X:   Is Maker planned to be the only source of capital for REINNO or is Maker only providing only a part with traditional sources of financing providing the rest?    Maker will only be one of the sources of financing.     Planet_X:   Once DAI is generated, how are you planning to get this to your customer\u2019s bank account? How is the backend of your business set up?    We will offer our clients a choice - whether they want to receive the loan in USD or DAI. If they choose USD, we will exchange DAI to USD immediately and transfer the money to the client\u2019s bank account. If they choose DAI, we will just send them DAI. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions. ",

                    "content": "With real world assets, REINNO being one example, it looks like the liquidation mechanism is going to be the most critical item. @spin Centrifuge has come up with a possible solution for this Vault Liquidation Mechanism for Centrifuge Trade Finance Assets: A Pre-MIP Discussion for short term (around 90 days maturation or less) which looks promising, the working principle being restriction on further debt and focus on debt repayment if certain conditions are triggered. For longer maturation periods nobody has yet come up with a better idea than auctions. However, from the REINNO promo video on Youtube I saw you were planning a flexible repayment period. Because of this plus you are bundling loans together you will have both continuous revenue stream as well as a continuous need for capital. I guess it depends on your average maturation period if the short-term repayment model could work for you as well. With regards to your sources for finance I think it would be an advantage if Maker was only supplying part of the capital needed. The reason for this is first and foremost robustness and second that it could allow stability fees/interest rates to be set with increased accuracy. Example: a real estate investment company is financed by 3 fiat banks charging an average interest of 3.75%. In this case Maker needs to take into consideration that if Maker rates exceeds let\u2019s say 4% we are prizing ourselves out of this particular market, while if we charge less than 2-3% we loose profit. If collateral companies have multiple sources of capital and Maker knowing (or recalculating) the approximate cost of capital will allow Maker to finance a much wider span of industries compared to a situation where we would have to guestimate the rates a sector can stomach.

New Silver has a track record of originating loans and selling them to other lenders for example. Both our legal framework and our smart contracts support a mechanism by which the asset originator can be required to attempt to refinance the loans if any investors want liquidity before maturity.  There are two ways that this can be done:  Some loans can be quite easily financed, mortgages can be sold one by one to other banks for example Backup line of credit: instead of selling the loans one by one, an asset originator can also have agreements with banks and lenders to provide a blanket line of credit against their loans.  When there are investors that want liquidity (for example when the Vault needs to be liquidated) then the asset originator could simply make use of these off-chain mechanisms, repay the DAI to the investors on chain and Maker would see DAI repaid before the maturity. Perhaps that\u2019s a mechanism that would work for REINNO as well? ",

The type of the property does not matter; it can be multifamily, retail, or mix-use. Tokenization will be the same in all cases (SPV formation, moving the property to the SPV, issuing digital shares (tokens) of the SPV, sending you these digital shares/property tokens). You do not have to register it as a security offering if you are not selling the tokens (just holding or using them as loan collateral). If you decide to list this property on our marketplace and sell it, REINNO will help you register a security offering under a suitable exemption. We will start by issuing loans in DAI without converting to USD.  ",

Bancor operates as a decentralized exchange and market making platform, allowing users to seamlessly exchange and provide liquidity for blockchain assets. BNT acts as the \u201cbridge\u201d asset (similar to ETH on Uniswap v1), enabling any two tokens to be traded against each other.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Bancor is named after the theoretical trade balancing international currency proposed by John Maynard Keynes. Bancor conducted an ICO in 2017, raising roughly $150M, and released the first operational constant function market maker. Bancor v2 introduces several potential improvements, including the ability to provide liquidity without needing to stake BNT, as well as integration with Chainlink price oracles to mitigate impermanent loss and enable single asset liquidity provision.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

During the development process, there have been several preliminary reports with potential issues, which have been addressed during the course of development. Additionally, two previous reports concerning the crowdsale specifically.    The Bancor protocol implementation has a security model based on centralized trust: the `owner` of the contracts have, to a large degree, full control over assets traded over the platform. This makes it possible to avoid many problems in fully decentralized solution, where all upgrade paths, invariant-check-based escape hatches etc, need to be defined beforehand.   Since the bancor protocol is fairly a complex scheme involving a large number of interacting contracts, it makes sense to have a centralized model, at least initially.   The security of the account(s) which ultimately secure and control the audited contract is not within scope of this audit.      This file has been truncated. show original        Note: Bancor had a recent security incident shortly after the release of the Bancor v2 contracts. The team\u2019s post-mortem can be found here. Bancor v2 audits are forthcoming, I have not been able to find when exactly they\u2019ll be available.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/Bancor Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor/ Telegram: Telegram: Contact @bancor Dev Telegram: Telegram: Contact @BancorDevelopers  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  Bancor Protocol comprises a system of constant function market makers (similar to Uniswap) that allow for the exchange of Ethereum and EOS assets (info about the ETH/EOS chain swap mechanism can be found here). Bancor uses BNT as the bridge asset (like ETH in Uniswap v1) that allows for trading between non-BNT assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  BNT is a decentralized asset.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  BNT is traded on centralized exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex, and OKEx, as well as decentralized platforms such as Kyber, Uniswap, and Bancor itself.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  As far as I know, BNT is not registered with regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  Centralized exchanges from (9) may offer price feeds for BNT.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Disclosure: I hold BNT ",

Curve finance is a decentralized exchange platform focusing on swaps between like assets (stablecoins, wrapped assets, etc). The Curve AMM formula provides amplified liquidity around 1:1 ratio, which allows for larger trades with low slippage and better capital efficiency.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Curve launched in the beginning of 2020 with USD stablecoin pools. Curve began supporting BTC as well once more wrapped options emerged in mid 2020. The first Bitcoin pool was the renBTC Curve pool, which consists of Ren Project\u2019s renBTC and Bitgo\u2019s Wrapped BTC. Ren launched renBTC in mid 2020. It uses a semi decentralized network of nodes to act as custodian for BTC held on Ethereum, and holders can create or redeem renBTC against native BTC with no KYC or special permissions required. Currently, a centralized set of nodes (the greycore) backstop system security, which makes renBTC subject to significant custody and centralization risks. WBTC is the longest standing Bitcoin token on Ethereum. Technically, WBTC is governed by a consortium of defi organizations and protocols, but Bitgo is the only approved custodian for funds and the system is fairly centralized as a result. WBTC has been trading on Ethereum since 2019, but total supply and liquidity took off in the middle of 2020 after MakerDAO onboarded WBTC as a collateral asset.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/CurveFinance Telegram: Telegram: Contact @curvefi Telegram: Contact @curveficn Discord: Curve Finance  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  CurveLP-renBTC-WBTC is a source of liquidity for trading between renBTC and WBTC. Users can deposit one or both assets to the pool in exchange for LP tokens, and earn a portion of the fees charged on trades. LP tokens can also be staked in Curve\u2019s gauge contracts to earn inflationary CRV token rewards.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Curve LP tokens are permissionless assets, no party bears legal responsibility for the asset. WBTC is custodied by Bitgo, which operates in the US. RenBTC is semi-decentralized, but the core team based in Singapore has control over system operations. Ren team was recently absorbed/acquired by Alameda Research (FTX affiliate).  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  CurveLP-renBTC-WBTC can be exchanged for underlying assets (renBTC and WBTC) directly via the Curve finance contracts. renBTC and WBTC are traded on a wide variety of centralized and decentralized exchanges. WBTC can be minted or redeemed for native BTC via a network of approved merchant entities (KYC is required). RenBTC can be minted and redeemed via the Ren protocol with no KYC required.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  n/a  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  n/a  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Notes: Curve LPs can be staked in gauges to earn CRV token rewards. Maker would need to design a way to stake LP tokens to capture this yield. The Curve system also allows LPs to boost earnings by locking CRV tokens. It may be advantageous for Maker to stake CRV in order to boost vault holder returns, but this would require approval from Curve governance to whitelist a Maker governance contract to lock CRV tokens.

Curve finance is a decentralized exchange platform focusing on swaps between like assets (stablecoins, wrapped assets, etc). The Curve AMM formula provides amplified liquidity around 1:1 ratio, which allows for larger trades with low slippage and better capital efficiency. The Compound Curve pool (containing cDAI and cUSDC) was Curve\u2019s first stablecoin LP pool. It earns underlying interest from the Compound money markets, as well as additional trading fees from Curve.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Curve launched in the beginning of 2020. The Compound curve pool was the first pool offered by the protocol. Over the past year, Curve has added several additional USD stablecoin pools and other assets. However, the Compound pool stands out due to being the only USD denominated LP pool that does not include USDT.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/CurveFinance Telegram: Telegram: Contact @curvefi Telegram: Contact @curveficn Discord: Curve Finance  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  CurveLP-cDAI-cUSDC allows DAI and USDC holders to deposit their assets, in order to earn lending and trading fees. In addition, the LP token can be staked in Curve gauges to earn CRV inflationary rewards. Curve users can access this liquidity to trade funds between DAI and USDC.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Curve LP tokens are permissionless assets, no party bears legal responsibility for the asset. USDC is issued by Centre, a consortium of Coinbase and CirclePay. It represents a claim on $1 of cash or equivalent assets held in reserve. Centre is primarily governed / supervised under US law.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  CurveLP-cDAI-cUSDC can be exchanged for underlying assets directly via the Curve finance contracts. Once the LP has been redeemed for cUSDC and cDAI, these deposit tokens can be redeemed for underlying DAI and USDC via Compound. DAI and USDC are widely traded on DEX and centralized exchange platforms.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  n/a  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  n/a  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Notes: Curve LPs can be staked in gauges to earn CRV token rewards. Maker would need to design a way to stake LP tokens to capture this yield. The Curve system also allows LPs to boost earnings by locking CRV tokens. It may be advantageous for Maker to stake CRV in order to boost vault holder returns, but this would require approval from Curve governance to whitelist a Maker governance contract to lock CRV tokens. cDAI and cUSDC have not yet been onboarded to the Maker protocol. Thus far, Maker has only onboarded LPs where all constituent assets are already supported. For this reason, onboarding Compound Curve pool may take more review and domain work versus other collateral assets. The liquidity supplied to Compound through this LP may also compete with MakerDAO\u2019s other vault offerings, and the costs and benefits to the overall portfolio would need to be carefully considered.

Giving vault holders access to these rewards is mandatory for strong demand for these vaults. So will it work like this:  Deposit cCurve LP token into vault. Maker then deposits cCurve into the Curve gauge (to start receiving CRV rewards) while crediting the user with the vault deposit. User can claim the CRV rewards (and any other incentive rewards like SNX) from the UI within oasis at any time he/she wants?  This is certainly some added complexity that we need discussion/planning around as to not create delays for onboarding this collateral. Curve has 4.3B in deposits and accessing this collateral is a major opportunity for Maker. ",

Details about the Wrapped ZEC token Zcash are provided by wrapped.com. img_bg_wzec2000\u00d7700 90.3 KB 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Zcash is a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency providing anonymous value transfer using zero-knowledge cryptography. The protocol gives users the ability to transact in either \u201cshielded\u201d transactions, which are totally anonymous, or have them be \u201ctransparent\u201d or totally visible. The protocol distributes part of the mining rewards to fund the \u201cFounders Reward,\u201d which funds ongoing protocol development. These rewards are distributed to the Electric Coin Company as well as the Zcash Foundation which both work to develop and represent the mission of the Zcash protocol. In late November the existing Founders Reward will expire and be replaced with a new developers fund with grants available for ecosystem development without allocation towards investors and founders. The Zcash total supply to be issued through mining rewards will be 21 million, similar to Bitcoin\u2019s total supply. Miners receive 80% of the mining rewards from each block, with 20% allocated in the Founders Reward which goes to The Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation, incentivizing ongoing development of the protocol. The Wrapped Zcash token (WZEC) is an ERC20 standard token which represents a 1:1 value of WZEC to Zcash (ZEC) held in custody by Anchorage, a US-based trust. WZEC allows for Zcash to be used in traditional defi applications such as Uniswap, Balancer and Curve. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Zcash, previously iterated on under the Zerocoin and Zerocash monikers started in 2013 and was meant to be an experimental privacy extension to Bitcoin using zero knowledge proof cryptography. The goal was to improve upon the privacy and fungible capabilities of Bitcoin, avoiding significant identifying information about users of the cryptocurrency to be derived from on-chain events publicly visible on the blockchain. Not gaining acceptance or implementation from the Bitcoin community and core developers, Zcash raised $3 million USD through venture capital and began working on a standalone protocol based on a fork of the Bitcoin codebase under the Zcash Company which could deliver on a higher standard of privacy without compromise. In 2017 the Zcash Foundation, a non-profit, was created to help build internet payments and privacy infrastructure for the Zcash protocol, later re-branding to the Electric Coin Company. Wrapped is a joint-initiative started in July 2020 by Tokensoft and Anchorage with the purpose of creating greater interoperability between blockchains. Wrapped accomplishes this by wrapping layer one blockchains and issuing 1:1 representations on the Ethereum blockchain. Both Tokensoft and Anchorage separately established in 2017, are cutting edge leaders in their respective technology expertise. Tokensoft is an industry leading provider of AML/KYC services for issuance of security tokens allowing for precise regulatory compliance during all stages of fundraising. Tokensoft also manages the smart contract security of the minting, burning and distribution of the wrapped tokens. Anchorage is a Qualified Custodian which secures over 100 billion in transactions annually through cutting edge cyber security architecture. 4.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? ZEC is a privacy focused peer-to-peer cryptocurrency used as a means of payment between parties. Users have the option to transact in both private shielded transactions as well as transparent transactions. WZEC can be used in decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or in defi applications that accept Wrapped Zcash as collateral or similar. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Tokensoft and Anchorage are responsible for the Wrapped tokens custody, minting, burning and distribution. Anchorage is headquartered in San Francisco, CA and Tokensoft is headquartered in Austin, TX. They are both incorporated in Delaware. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? ZEC is traded on most major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, Kraken, Huobi and more. An Ethereum ERC-20 asset called Wrapped Zcash, or WZEC is also traded currently on Uniswap. Wrapped Zcash is an asset issued by Wrapped in partnership with Anchorage, a US-based trust and Tokensoft (a tokenization platform). 10.

ParaFi Capital, with material prepared by @monet-supply, @BitcoinPalmer, the BadgerDAO community, and the ParaFi team.  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Badger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across the ecosystem can collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the initiatives pursued are determined by the community. BADGER is the DAO\u2019s governance token, while bBADGER is the token that represents one\u2019s position in the Badger Sett on app.badger.finance and is indicative of a user\u2019s partial ownership of the assets within the vault. bBADGER receives liquidity incentives and is a yield-generating asset with revenues from Badger\u2019s suite of products and vaults. There is currently 2,815,000 bBADGER in circulation, which corresponds to 3,434,300 BADGER. This amount of BADGER represents approximately half of the circulating BADGER supply.  Provide a brief history of the project.  The BadgerDAO was bootstrapped by a small team before launching an Early Contributors Program in October of 2020. This led to Badger\u2019s first two products, the Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC, and Digg, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, and Digg was launched on January 22nd, 2021. There are additional products under development, such as a fixed term yield dollar product and an interest-bearing bitcoin basket. The DAO is collaborating with projects like UMA, DeFiDollar, and Yearn.finance.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Currently, bBADGER holders receive liquidity incentive rewards for staking, but bBADGER\u2019s utility increases daily as the DAO pursues expanded cash flow streams, use cases, and products. bBADGER is currently under consideration to be onboarded as a collateral type to Aave, and is already a supported asset on Cream  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Badger contracts are upgradable by the BadgerDAO multisig which is behind a 48 hour timelock and 5/7 signer at the address: 0x21CF9b77F88Adf8F8C98d7E33Fe601DC57bC0893 BadgerDAO is a decentralized organization, and BADGER is a bearer/non-custodial asset.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  bBADGER can be easily exchanged for BADGER via the bBadger deposit contract. BADGER is traded on several decentralized exchange platforms, with the largest amount of liquidity available on Sushiswap. BADGER was also recently listed on Binance, and is also listed on other prominent exchanges such as FTX, OKEx, and Huobi. There is significant liquidity for BADGER across the crypto ecosystem. Through January and February, there was over $40 million worth of BADGER liquidity across both Uniswap and SushiSwap. Importantly, the liquidity for the token has been stable despite volatile market conditions. According to CoinGecko, BADGER has consistently seen over $20 million worth of volume per day across centralized and decentralized exchanges since the start of January.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  n/a  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  n/a  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  Centralized exchanges listed in section 9 may offer price feeds for BADGER. The BADGER<>bBADGER ratio can be computed from on chain data. The live ratio can be viewed by querying the bBadger contract, found here. The price for bBADGER is determined by price of BADGER * PricePerFullShare() of the bBADGER contract.

Badger is focused on bringing bitcoin to defi and is only very early in its journey yet already it has gained a huge amount of TVL. It\u2019s focus on security and the many new products coming this year will bring in massive amounts of capital that bitcoin represents and being able to use that as collateral on Maker will allow for large amounts of dai to be created and generating fees for Maker.

Regarding the controversial BIP - the forum says otherwise - BIP 35: Long-Term Core-Contributors - BIP | Badger Improvement Proposals - BadgerDAO Just some excerpts:  So, this is what I am doing. I have mentioned that I agree in principle with the framework, except that I believe the Badger portion should not be paid daily, and that everyone (you, Badger, the community) would be better served if that portion is used in a more strategic way   Although I love this project, the compensation is not reasonable. Especially if the compensation isn\u2019t locked up somehow.  And the proposal itself was very half thought-out and rushed. There were a lot of shortcomings - no mentions of contributors\u2019 track-records, deliverables, in-depth compensation, etc - just a no-questions asked continuous outflow into contributors. It seems ludicrous to me to propose such high salaries paid out daily (!) for an 11-person team in just a 800-word post. Regardless, I\u2019m not here to rip on the project. This is the limited research I\u2019ve done on it and it made me question the legitimacy of the project. As with anything - I suggest everybody DYOR - I just wanted to shed some light on what I\u2019ve found. ",

                    "content": "Hello MKR Community, This is our application for ArCoin, a digital asset created through the first SEC registered fund to issue digital shares on the blockchain, to be used as MCD for MakerDAO. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Arca is an investment management company focused on digital assets and blockchain technology. Since its founding, Arca has focused on building an institutional infrastructure that leverages the highest operational, risk, legal, regulatory and security standards. Within Arca, Arca Labs pioneers innovative, regulated products in a digital structure that aim to revolutionize how we think about investments. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. ArCoin is the brainchild of Arca Labs, the product development division of Arca. The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) is a closed-end fund invested in a portfolio of short-duration U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes. The Fund is the first of its kind to be SEC-registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201940 Act). ArCoin are digital securities issued by the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund and by purchasing ArCoin, you are investing in shares of the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund. Arca chose to offer digital shares of the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund in the form of ArCoin because of advantages this innovation offered. First, by using the blockchain ArCoin holders can quickly transfer digital securities between investors (peer to peer) in small increments. Second, the Fund and its transfer agent are able to track transactions that are published on the Ethereum blockchain on a real-time basis allowing for a unique auditing opportunity. Third, by using blockchain the need to go through a brokerage to purchase ArCoin is eliminated. Provide a brief history of the project. In late 2018, Arca submitted their first prospectus to the SEC outlining the specifics of the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund. For Arca, it was the highest priority to bring a registered, lower volatility digital security to the blockchain space.  In order to meet SEC compliance requirements under the \u201840 Act, Arca was tasked with creating a first of its kind product.  ArCoin needed to meet the highest level of securities standards; this process required seven service providers to bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto. Now, almost two years later, ArCoin has been granted effectiveness by the SEC and is now the first SEC registered blockchain traded fund. The selection of short term U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds as the underlying collateral in this blockchain traded fund was extremely intentional. Arca hoped to provide investors with a lower volatility asset when compared to other assets in traditional financial and crypto markets. For Arca Labs, the future viability of ArCoin rests in the many use cases that this coin may offer. For individuals, Arcoin could be an interest-bearing low-volatility investment that mitigates digital-asset market volatility. For clearing and settlement purposes, ArCoin has the opportunity to eliminate intermediaries and reduce risk through the efficiencies of blockchain. ArCoin could streamline internal processes by rapidly and efficiently transferring funds across entities. It has the ability to further offer lenders and borrowers a more secure alternative with interest payments in accordance to the underlying collateral, U.S. Treasuries. ArCoin could prove to be a major insurance tool. It could allow institutions to easily hold funds internally in the event of a distribution/ payout and would offer the same safeguards to individual investors. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Website ArCoin Portal: ArCoin may be purchased through the ArCoin portal maintained by TokenSoft, ArCoin\u2019s Service Provider. Prospectus: All documentation regarding the fund and digitized security structure may be found in ArCoin\u2019s prospectus. Token Standard: ArCoin operates on the ERC-1404 standard which is an open source standard for security tokens. ArCoin Contract Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. ERC-1404 Open Source Standard Procedural: The Fund will report its Net Asset Value (NAV) on a daily basis and will publish the NAV each business day on the Arca Labs website.  The NAV of an ArCoin is calculated by taking the total value of all the cash, U.S. Treasury Securities, and any other securities in the Fund\u2019s portfolio, minus any liabilities, and dividing it by the number of ArCoin outstanding to get a per share NAV. The calculation of NAV is conducted by the Fund\u2019s Administrator, Ultimus Fund Solutions. The Fund will also provide each holder of ArCoin with a monthly account statement showing the value of their holdings and will publish and deliver financial statements on a semi-annual basis that show a complete list of all assets held by the Fund. The Fund\u2019s annual report will be audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP. Although the SEC mandates a minimum set of requirements, the Fund will make best efforts to report as frequently as possible in order to ensure the highest level of transparency into our assets. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Due to the high level of regulatory compliance surrounding ArCoin any communities resulting from this project are not under the purview or maintained by Arca. How is the applying collateral type currently used? ArCoin can be used for multiple purposes. For individuals, ArCoin could potentially be a useful and productive digital asset while limiting volatility inherent with many other digital assets. For financial institutions and digital-assets enterprises, ArCoin could potentially be used in the following scenarios: clearing and settlement, lending, treasury management, payments, and industries where banking has created friction. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Arca is an advisor to the fund while the fund itself is classified as a Trust. The Trust bears responsibility for the collateral of ArCoin overseen by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC verifies reporting which Arca is mandated to produce. This reporting most notably ensures that the underlying collateral, or ArCoin, is fully backed and that Arca is following due diligence regulations. Where does exchange for the asset occur? ArCoin is currently offered through the ArCoin Investor Portal. ArCoin may also be exchanged in a peer to peer fashion pending KYC/AML registration of the receiving wallet. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Arca\u2019s Form ADV is mandated by the SEC along with state securities authorities and stands as an investment disclosure document. Once again, the regulatory parameters of ArCoin can be found in the prospectus. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.                                                                    -  An investor should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund before investing. \u200d This and other information is available in the Fund\u2019s prospectus, which should be reviewed carefully prior to investing.

Reading your SEC registered prostectus I have three questions:   ARCA is a closed-end fund registered for USD100 million. In the world of US Treasury Bills, this amount is to put it mildly not very large so I must assume you have expansion plans. Why don\u2019t you tell us a little bit more about that? After all ARCA is making a huge leap here - straight from the conservative world of Treasury Bills to the cutting edge of Defi. This is a huge step for many traditional buyers of T-Bills and opens up a whole range of intermediate investment possibilities in the terms of advice, staking and risk management.   In the ARCA FAQ section you mention ArCoin being peer-to-peer transferable. Basically meaning it can be bought and sold. The same page also mentions all ArCoin holders will have to undergo AML/KYC. How do you plan to enforce this? (EDIT: sorry forgot it was ERC-1404) Would it be possible for non-KYC\u2019d individuals to hold ArCoin but not be able to redeem them?   As T-Bills are considered extremely safe investment objects, the largest uncertainty for Maker will most likely be the counterparty risk of Arca. What are the steps for winding down Arca and how would this affect ArCoin?   ",

The total return of the Fund is determined by the change in price of the underlying securities, the interest paid minus expenses and liabilities. This would be in addition to any interest distributed through the MKR system.  You are correct in that there is an expense cap for the Fund.

As this is the first fund that issues digital securities (\u201cArCoin\u201d) through the use of blockchain technology, we set the fund size a lot lower than traditional U.S. Treasury funds and may have the ability to amend the fund size pending approval from the SEC at a later date. 1.2 In terms of our plans, Arca set out to create the Fund using blockchain technology two years ago under the premise that a lower volatility coin, created under the Investment Company Act of 1940 would be a powerful advancement for the entire digital asset community. In creating ArCoin and the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund, we\u2019ve also created a wrapper that can be used for a variety of different assets, similarly to what @monet-supply suggested above. Our plans are to continue to develop and launch an innovative family of products under the nomenclature Blockchain Transferred Funds (BTF). 1.3 Finally, we agree with your assessment that ArCoin opens up a whole range of investment opportunities which is why we have been speaking with Maker since January 2020. 2.1 ArCoin is transferable via the ETH blockchain from one approved wallet to another approved wallet.  ArCoin is created using a portal built in conjunction with our partners at TokenSoft. As part of the onboarding process, conducted through the portal, the Fund will conduct AML/KYC on any prospective ArCoin holder.  Once approved, a buyer will be required to provide an ETH wallet address that can be whitelisted and associated with that buyer. TokenSoft also created a smart contract that was audited by Quantstamp on Arca\u2019s behalf.  As part of the Fund structure, the Transfer Agent to the Fund, DTAC, LLC, monitors the blockchain for any transfers of ArCoin.  The smart contract will only permit peer to peer transfers of ArCoin that are associated with a whitelisted wallet address.   Under the flows we have created, any individual or entity must undergo AML/KYC in order to possess ArCoin. 2.2 We would encourage any interested participant to undergo the onboarding process through our portal.  There is no obligation to purchase ArCoin after completing the onboarding process. 2.3 Please note that the portal has been operational since July 6th, and we have, to date, minted 122,360 ArCoin tokens through it. 3.1 The Fund is a closed-end fund registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This was done so very deliberately as we wanted to offer ArCoin holders an array of customer protections that exist in the traditional finance world. These protections include, but are not limited to:  All assets are held in trust at the Fund\u2019s custodian bank (UMB, N.A.) Periodic Independent Audits by an Independent Auditor (RSM US, LLP) Independent Fund Administrator overseeing daily operations (Ultimus Fund Solutions) Independent Board of Trustees comprised of leading industry veterans Periodic Financial Reporting (Audited Financials, Mandatory SEC filings) Daily publishing of Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund by an independent 3rd party (Ultimus Fund Solutions)  3.2 Most importantly, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and as an ArCoin holder you are protected from such fund-company disasters. The Fund is set up as an individual company, separate from the Fund\u2019s Adviser (Arca) and owned only by its shareholders. In the unlikely event that Arca filed for bankruptcy, its creditors would not be able to touch the money in the Arca U.S. Treasury Fund. ",

Since we began offering ArCoin and the Arca US Treasury Fund in early July, Net Asset Value (NAV) has not strayed from a dollar. This is largely due to the balance between increasing bond prices and lower interest rates. Yield moving forward is impossible to predict as rates fluctuate based on the Fed. However, any additional yield will be returned to the ArCoin holder. In chatting with members of the Maker community, many have recommended the collateralization ratio which is currently assigned to stablecoins within the MKR system to also apply to ArCoin.   The addition of blockchain technology allows a very traditional and well-known financial product, US Treasury Funds, to have increased utility. Therefore, ArCoin customer\u2019s use cases range from treasury management to insurance to lending and payments.   One objective of Arca, as mentioned by @swakya, is for ArCoin to act as a gateway to bring institutional investors into this space. This was part of our thesis from 2018 - using a regulated structure (\u201840 Act Fund) and an underlying instrument (US Treasuries) that institutional market participants are familiar with and would feel comfortable using.

UMA is a protocol that allows the issuance of \u201cpriceless\u201d synthetic assets. Instead of relying on a traditional price oracle, the system allows for a bonded appeals process to dispute improper liquidations. UMA token holders can earn inflation rewards by voting on liquidation disputes and settlement prices as part of the data verification mechanism. The UMA token also controls overall governance of the protocol.  Provide a brief history of the project.  The original UMA whitepaper was released in December 2018 after the team closed a funding round led by Placeholder VC. A supplemental white paper covering the UMA data verification mechanism was released in April 2020, with the UMA token going live at the end of the month via a Uniswap listing. Since going live, the protocol has voted on several UMIP governance proposals. The initial yCOMP and yETHBTC synthetic assets have recently been settled successfully, and UMA recently started a liquidity incentive program for their new yUSD synth on the Balancer exchange.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

UMA tokens can be used to vote on liquidation disputes, contract settlement prices and governance proposals.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UMA is a decentralized token.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UMA is traded primarily on decentralized exchanges. The token was launched on Uniswap v1, and recently the project team\u2019s liquidity was migrated to Uniswap v2. There is also a UMA pool on Balancer, as well as trading on a few less prominent centralized exchanges.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  None as far as I\u2019m aware.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  There are a few centralized exchanges offering trading. Otherwise most liquidity is on Uniswap v2 and Balancer.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Disclosure: I hold UMA. ",

Details about the FIL token and Filecoin have been furnished via wrapped.com.    Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.   Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to utilize unused data storage throughout the world by creating an althogritmically driven market for both providers and purchasers of storage. By unlocking the potential of vast sums of unused storage capacity, Filecoin has potential to not only decentralize data storage but also provide far better price dynamics at scale through incentives for all participants in the network. The total supply of FIL is capped at 2 billion and a majority of it is released through block rewards over time.  70% of FIL is dedicated to Filecoin Miners through mining block rewards, providing data storage services, maintaining the blockchain, distributing data, running contracts, and more. 15% of FIL is dedicated to Protocol Labs at genesis with a 6-year linear vesting period to be used for research, engineering, deployment, business development, marketing, distribution, and more. 10% of FIL is dedicated to Investors at genesis with a 6 month to 3 year linear vesting period. For funding network development, business development, partnerships, support, and more. 5% of FIL is dedicated to the Filecoin Foundation at genesis, with a 6-year linear vesting period which will be used for long-term network governance, partner support, academic grants, public works, community building, etc.  To read more about the crypto-economics of FIL, please reference: https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-cryptoeconomic-constructions/ The Wrapped Filecoin token (WFIL) is an ERC20 standard token which represents a 1:1 value of WFIL to Filecoin (FIL) held in custody by Anchorage, a US-based trust. WFIL allows for FIL to be used in traditional defi applications such as Uniswap, Balancer and Curve.    Provide a brief history of the project.   Filecoin was started by Juan Benet, the founder and CEO of Protocol Labs in 2014. Protocol labs also created projects such as IPFS, lib p2p, and others. The token sale for Filecoin lasted roughly minutes and raised over $200 million USD. The protocol reached its mainnet launch milestone on October 19th through the 23rd quickly reaching a $900 million USD market capitalization. Wrapped is a joint-initiative started in July 2020 by Tokensoft and Anchorage with the purpose of creating greater interoperability between blockchains. Wrapped accomplishes this by wrapping layer one blockchains and issuing 1:1 representations on the Ethereum blockchain. Both Tokensoft and Anchorage separately established in 2017, are cutting edge leaders in their respective technology expertise. Tokensoft is an industry leading provider of AML/KYC services for issuance of security tokens allowing for precise regulatory compliance during all stages of fundraising. Tokensoft also manages the smart contract security of the minting, burning and distribution of the wrapped tokens. Anchorage is a Qualified Custodian which secures over 100 billion in transactions annually through cutting edge cyber security architecture.    Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Filecoin (FIL) is the native cryptocurrency asset to the Filecoin blockchain and powers the data storage and data retrieval markets as a means of payment.    Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?   Tokensoft and Anchorage are responsible for the Wrapped tokens custody, minting, burning and distribution. Anchorage is headquartered in San Francisco, CA and Tokensoft is headquartered in Austin, TX. They are both incorporated in Delaware.    Where does exchange for the asset occur?   FIL is traded on centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Coinlist, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, Bitfinex, Huobi, and Poloniex An Ethereum ERC-20 asset called Wrapped Filecoin, or WFIL will also be traded on Uniswap. Wrapped Filecoin is an asset issued by Wrapped.com in partnership with Anchorage, a US-based trust and Tokensoft (an AML/KYC platform).    (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction?

                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? xDai Chain team xDai Dev Team - xDai 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. The xDai chain is a stable-payments L2 sidechain, providing fast, secure transactions with full interoperability and compatibility to the Ethereum Mainnet. It features a dual token model, where xDai is the native and stable transactional token bridged from a stable token (Dai) on Ethereum, and STAKE is the underlying Ethereum mainnet asset providing security and governance capabilities. This collateral application is for the STAKE token. STAKE is a multi-chain ERC20-based staking token. It resides on the Ethereum mainnet and is bridged to the xDai chain via OmniBridge to provide network security. It supports Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus (POSDAO), secures the payment layer and prevents malicious activities. Though initially designed for xDai, it can also be implemented in other blockchain networks for staking and governance. STAKE is also designed as a governance token, providing chain and bridge validators the opportunity to vote on network parameters such as fees structures and staking minimums. There are plans to extend this capability to allow stake-weighted voting on transaction priority and micro-governance decisions. These efforts are evolving as public staking launches on the xDai chain. While STAKE is the security and governance token for the xDai chain, the xDai native token is used for stable and predictable transactions, payments, and fees. It is bridged from Dai, meaning all xDai users are essentially Dai users. As of 2020-12-03T21:00:00Z, there is more than 2M Dai locked in the xDai bridge contract and circulating as xDai on the xDai chain. In November 2020, xDai transactions nearly doubled Dai transfers. Total Dai Transactions: xDai: 1,100,784  Ethereum: 572,396 Average Dai tx/day: xDai: 36,693 Ethereum: 19,080 3. Provide a brief history of the project. xDai stable chain was created in October 2018 with its xDai stable coin. The idea was to build a stable blockchain with a native stable coin that could be bridged directly to a sidechain, eliminating high transaction costs and volatile prices and remove the additional gas token. More than 2 years later, the xDai chain is currently secured by 12 nominated validators, consisting of known and respected projects within the Ethereum ecosystem including the Maker Foundation, Giveth, Gnosis, Shapeshift, and Protofire. These validators are participating in a delegated  Proof-of-Stake consensus where they provide STAKE to secure the chain, but do not currently have delegators and are not subject to a rotating validator set. This will change when public POSDAO (Proof of Stake Decentralized Autonomous Organization), a new consensus algorithm, gives all STAKE holders an equal opportunity to participate and benefit from the consensus process. The xDai chain has seen rapid adoption from projects throughout the Ethereum ecosystem as recent high gas fees and congestion have made it difficult to transact on Ethereum. As a compatible L2 solution, developers can quickly deploy their infrastructure to xDai with minimal changes. While some projects have migrated completely, others have chosen a hybrid approach, moving some resource-intensive operations to xDai while keeping others on Ethereum. The result is an interoperable infrastructure where xDai extends and augments the Ethereum operating space with a low-cost, stable transactional environment. With Eth2 on the horizon, xDai has plans to continue providing scalability during the multi-year transition. Once realized, xDai will be prepared to be integrated into the Eth2 infrastructure. STAKE will continue to have a valuable role as a governance token with plans to incorporate transactional sequencing capabilities and more.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? STAKE token supports Proof-of-Stake consensus, secures the payment layer, prevents malicious activities, and allows block producers to receive their staking incentives. It will also provide stake-weighted governance voting privileges for holders. It\u2019s not implemented in everyday user transactions. Users can also participate in staking on the Ethereum mainnet through the EasyStaking application. This serves to limit supply and provides emissions for those who lock STAKE into EasyStaking. It also incentivizes STAKE liquidity providers on Uniswap. As of 2020-12-03T21:00:00Z, 1.298M STAKE with a value of over 13M in USD are staked in the Easy Staking protocol on Ethereum. More information on  EasyStaking. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? POA Networks, Ltd., a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Cayman Islands, with company number 327912 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur?

Provide a brief history of the project. Uniswap was created by Hayden Adams and v1 was launched on mainnet November 2018. Seen as a public good and vital DeFi infrastructure, the protocol has grown to be one of the highest used applications on Ethereum.   There are over 11,000 token pairs, $2 billion in total liquidity, and over 100 DeFi integrations. The UNI token was launched with one billion minted at genesis, a portion of which was distributed to the community.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-DAI-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and ETH . This token currently has $405 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

SLP-DAI-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Sushiswap LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?

Below is our application following the MIP6 template, and we welcome questions or comments: 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Crypto.com, the issuer of the CRO token. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. [a] Crypto-com Overview Crypto-com was founded in 2016 on a simple belief: it\u2019s a basic human right for everyone to control their money, data and identity. Crypto-com serves over 5 million customers today, providing them with a powerful alternative to traditional financial services through a wide range of products such as the Crypto-com App, the Crypto-com Card, the Crypto-com Exchange and DeFi offerings. Crypto-com is built on a solid foundation of security, privacy and compliance and is the first cryptocurrency company in the world to have ISO/IEC 27701:2019, CCSS Level 3, ISO27001:2013 and PCI:DSS 3.2.1, Level 1 compliance. Crypto-com is headquartered in Hong Kong with a 500+ strong team. Find out more by visiting https://crypto.com. [b] Crypto-com and DeFi To better support its mission, Crypto-com has been venturing into the decentralized finance space. It has launched Crypto-com DeFi Wallet - a non-custodial wallet that lets users have full control of their private keys, and Crypto-com DeFi Swap - a web application where users can provide liquidity and/ or swap tokens, and receive rewards powered by CRO. In addition, Crypto-com has been actively conducting research on DeFi topics, including the DeFi Research Hub with a repertoire of self-produced reports, and a recent joint collaboration with BCG on the Rise of DeFi. In addition, Crypto-com is developing Crypto.com Chain, a decentralized blockchain that aims to let users pay anywhere, in any crypto, for free. [c] CRO Overview The Crypto-com Coin (CRO) token is the token that powers the overall Crypto-com ecosystem with over 5 million users, including token utility across payment, trading and financial services use cases (including De-Fi). Issued in 2018, CRO has gained significant traction in the crypto market and is one of the top 15 crypto currencies with around 3 billion USD market capitalization (at time of writing).

Would adding CRO as collateral allow crypto.com to use its reserves of CRO (assuming you have some), to provide more liquidity for DAI on crypto.com?  I know your answer is probably contingent on a number of factors like stability fee and debt ceiling, but I\u2019m curious if there is any plan to use this facility to provide more DAI liquidity on your exchange, and if the answer is yes, what risk parameters would make this more attractive?

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and WBTC. This token currently has only $12,000 of liquidity across 9 holders, but this could potentially improve if LPs can benefit from greater capital efficiency. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided.

UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The WBTC token is a 1:1 representation of BTC, with underlying assets held in custody by BitGo subject to governance by a consortium of prominent defi protocols (including Maker).  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-DAI-WBTC can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI.

Going from fiat to token on Uniswap/Sushiswap currently costs 0.6% in fees plus slippage on two trading pairs. With the PSM active, users would face only 0.4% fees (0.1% PSM + 0.3% AMM) and slippage on only 1 pair. I\u2019m hoping that this could be market expansionary and help DAI liquidity. ",

It\u2019s more or less doing what Alpha Homora already does for ETH. So we can either develop vaults to encourage DAI infrastructure or investing directly on DAI/YFI with our balance sheet. There is pro and cons for both approach. Promoting DAI should be a priority for 2021 so I like the idea (maybe not for YFI first).

Really glad someone has data @Aes  here because it has been my impression for quite some time that Maker was losing marketshare to competitors.  I have been talking about paying attention to \u2018market share\u2019 in ETH ever since Black Thursday because every vault holder that was wiped out was ETH of a user that basically disappeared likely never to come back.   Once liquidity farming came on line via compound driving DAI PEG high with high demand (which I wanted to counter with rate i\u2026     Part of the Maker3.0 proposal is to utilize the new MKR3 token to incentivize UNIv2TOKEN-DAI LP vaults.

An aggressive growth proposal for Maker.    Maker3.0 - Start fresh - utilize all available information, good and bad to create a new, more competitive, better Maker.

MATIC-DAI v2 LP NEXO-DAI v2 LP GNO-DAI v2 LP I had another idea EIP related to how to create a ETH market of last resort by taking 1/2 of the ETH slated for burn in EIP-1559 (already enacted) and instead of burning it, burn 1/2, take the other 1/2 sell 1/4 for DAI and pair with 1/4 ETH (Periodically) and drop it into the Uniswap ETH-DAI v2 LP pool to build a huge ETH-DAI v2 LP market backstop over time for the entire ETH community. One of the reasons Token-DAI pools never took off was because others were incentivising (in a unsustainable way) other products.   Maker could have taken the lead here with large scale partners to promote a vision of how to build a treasury that earns returns, that backstops their tokens, provides large scale and growing liquidity, and can be used for borrowing that still could capture a significant chunk of market. Basically Maker has never even tried to enter the farming market in any serious way to promote a vision or DAI as a key product in such a vision. ",

Provide a brief history of the project.  TrustToken launched their initial TUSD stablecoin in March 2018. They have since expanded their line of tokens to include several other fiat currencies, including TGBP, TCAD, TAUD, and THKD. TGBP became available for use in April of 2019.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Website: https://www.trusttoken.com/truegbp Source Code: GitHub - trusttoken/smart-contracts: TrustToken smart contracts TGBP token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x00000000441378008ea67f4284a57932b1c000a5  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.  Real time attestation of reserves: TrustExplorer - real-time audit I wasn\u2019t able to find any technical audits specific to TGBP on the TrustToken website. Presumably the technology is similar to TUSD. I defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify if any separate audits have been conducted. For reference, there is a discussion thread about the technical costs of maintaining TUSD collateral type due to the complexity of the token contract and frequency of upgrades. Similar concerns may apply to TGBP.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/trusttoken Telegram: Telegram: Join Group Chat  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  TGBP is used as an on chain representation of the British Pound fiat currency. The vast majority of DeFi transactions are conducted in USD, so there\u2019s limited direct usage in Ethereum apps. There is a pool for TGBP/ETH on Uniswap v1. Celsius (custodial lending service) offers interest on TGBP deposits.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  TrustToken controls the ethereum smart contracts, while the underlying GBP funds are held by qualified custodians. I will defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify the exact legal structure and jurisdictions involved.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  TGBP is traded on Uniswap v1 (fairly low liquidity), and can be redeemed directly through TrustToken via their website (KYC required). TGBP may also be used by OTC desks.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I defer to TrustToken for any legal opinions on regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  I defer to TrustToken for info about any regulatory registrations.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  There are numerous reputable sources for GBPUSD price data which could be used to represent the TGBP price.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  TGBP has lower on chain liquidity, so auction keepers would likely need to open/maintain an account with TrustToken for the purposes of redeeming TGBP.  Because TGBP is not USD pegged, a TGBP vault type may remain useful even if the peg stability module mostly eliminates the need for USD stablecoin vaults. As an example, GBP based investors could borrow DAI against their TGBP to participate in DeFi without taking on forex risk. ",

Overall, we\u2019re looking forward to working with the community to onboard TGBP and are ready to commit several hundred thousand dollars worth of TGBP to create vaults, borrow DAI, and sell into the market in order to help stabilize the DAI peg, in addition to running a keeper for this collateral type.

YFII and its strong community would be interested in forging DAI by using the YFII token as collateral. 2.Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token YFII\u2019s For Innovative Investment. YFII Finance is a community-owned DeFi infrastructure where its users determine what products they want and enjoy the yields. It\u2019s permissionless for all the people to join. How and when was YFII launched? \uff1aYFII belongs to the community. No pre-mining. No ICO. No dev team rewards. The only way to get YFII is to provide liquidity to the pools. YFII is the token for community governance and the key to farming yields of various DeFi platforms. It is used for revenue allocation and voting in the YFII DAO.     Size of the Community There are 24 large WeChat groups, with about 10,000 people. The telegraph group has about 10,000 people, for a total of 20,000 people.     Number of Proposals Currently, seven proposals have been adopted and two are at the revision or ballot stage.   Number of Working Groups Community volunteers are divided into operation group, contract group, web development group, strategy group, etc. The operation group includes proposal promotion group, governance process design group, cartoon popularization group, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, new product launch group, Defi Tuesday group, administrator communication group, overseas information relay station, governance hall, etc. There are about 300 community volunteers.

Number of Strategies 9 kinds, including ETH,WETH,USDT,USDC,DAI,BUSD,HBTC,TUSD,yCRV.    3. Provide a brief history of the project YIP-8 and forking of YFI:As mentioned above, the mining/farming of YFI has stopped on July 26. Mainly not for preventing a sharp drop in liquidity of the pools,but for yfi token distribution period was too short (just 1 week) to include a wider user group, as a result, a large part of yfi tokens was farmed by several whales, that was not a real and fair defi governance community should be, therefore, to have a wider and more diversified governance community and ture fair launch,  yfii community early members proposed YIP-8, to prolong the farming period with a weekly halving model, which can both reward early whale farmers and include late but more diversified small users.  Though more than 80% of the votes were FOR the proposal, it was declined because of the unmet 33% quorum requirement. To protect the ture defi governance from being spoilt by whales, we forked YFI, naming it YFII (dfi.money). The issuance of YFII imitates the halving model of Bitcoin so that the tokens will be fairly distributed to the community. 4.Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

TCAD is a fully collateralized custodial stablecoin, backed 1:1 by Canadian Dollars held in reserve. This allows users to transfer and use CAD on the Ethereum network.  Provide a brief history of the project.  TrustToken launched their initial TUSD stablecoin in March 2018. They have since expanded their line of tokens to include several other fiat currencies, including TGBP, TCAD, TAUD, and THKD. TCAD launched in May 2019.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Website: https://www.trusttoken.com/truecad Source Code: GitHub - trusttoken/smart-contracts: TrustToken smart contracts TCAD token contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x00000100F2A2bd000715001920eB70D229700085  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.  Real time attestation of reserves: TrustExplorer - real-time audit I wasn\u2019t able to find any technical audits specific to TCAD on the TrustToken website. Presumably the technology is similar to TUSD. I defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify if any separate audits have been conducted. For reference, there is a discussion thread about the technical costs of maintaining TUSD collateral type due to the complexity of the token contract and frequency of upgrades. Similar concerns may apply to TCAD.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/trusttoken Telegram: Telegram: Join Group Chat  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  TCAD is used as an on chain representation of the Canadian Dollar fiat currency. The vast majority of DeFi is conducted in USD, so there\u2019s limited direct usage in Ethereum apps. There is a pool for TCAD/ETH on Uniswap v1. Celsius (custodial lending service) offers interest on TCAD deposits.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  TrustToken controls the ethereum smart contracts, while the underlying CAD funds are held by qualified custodians. I will defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify the exact legal structure and jurisdictions involved.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  TCAD is traded on Uniswap v1 (fairly low liquidity), and can be redeemed directly through TrustToken via their website (KYC required).  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I defer to TrustToken for any legal opinions on regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  I defer to TrustToken for info about any regulatory registrations.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  There are numerous reputable sources for CADUSD price data which could be used to represent the TCAD price.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  TCAD has lower on chain liquidity, so auction keepers would likely need to open/maintain an account with TrustToken for the purposes of redeeming TCAD.  Similarly to TGBP, a TCAD vault type may remain useful even if the peg stability module mostly eliminates the need for USD stablecoin vaults by allowing Canadian investors to use DeFi without taking forex risk.

Presumably the technology is similar to TUSD. I defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify if any separate audits have been conducted. For reference, there is a discussion thread about the technical costs of maintaining TUSD collateral type due to the complexity of the token contract and frequency of upgrades. Similar concerns may apply to TAUD.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/trusttoken Telegram: Telegram: Join Group Chat  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  TAUD is used as an on chain representation of the Australian Dollar fiat currency. The vast majority of DeFi is conducted in USD, so there\u2019s limited direct usage in Ethereum apps. There is a pool for TAUD/ETH on Uniswap v1. Celsius (custodial lending service) offers interest on TAUD deposits.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  TrustToken controls the ethereum smart contracts, while the underlying AUD funds are held by qualified custodians. I will defer to a representative of TrustToken to clarify the exact legal structure and jurisdictions involved.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  TAUD is traded on Uniswap v1 (fairly low liquidity), and can be redeemed directly through TrustToken via their website (KYC required).  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I defer to TrustToken for any legal opinions on regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  I defer to TrustToken for info about any regulatory registrations.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  There are numerous reputable sources for AUDUSD price data which could be used to represent the TAUD price.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  TAUD has lower on chain liquidity, so auction keepers would likely need to open/maintain an account with TrustToken for the purposes of redeeming TAUD.  Similarly to TGBP, a TAUD vault type may remain useful even if the peg stability module mostly eliminates the need for USD stablecoin vaults by allowing Australian investors to use DeFi without taking forex risk.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-USDC-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of US Coin (USDC) and ETH. This token currently has $395 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

SLP-USDC-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Sushiswap LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The USDC token is issued by the Centre consortium which includes CirclePay and Coinbase. Further details can be found here: Circle | USD Coin (USDC) Stablecoin  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  SLP-USDC-ETH can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Sushiswap contracts and front end UI. USDC and ETH are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. USDC can also be redeemed or created 1:1 for USD on Coinbase.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-WBTC-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of WBTC and ETH. This token currently has $995 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-ETH-USDT LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and USDT . This token currently has $306 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

SLP-ETH-USDT LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Sushiswap LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  SLP-ETH-USDT can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Sushiswap contracts and front end UI. LINK and ETH are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues.

GUSD is a fully collateralized USD stablecoin operating on the Ethereum network. GUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company, LLC, and fiat funds are held by State Street Bank and Trust Co (NYSE:STT).  Provide a brief history of the project.  Gemini was founded by the Winklevoss brothers in 2013, initially focusing on the exchange business. They have since expanded into general custody services as well as stablecoin issuance. The Gemini USD was launched in September 2018 and for a time was one of the largest stablecoins with over $100M circulating at its peak. The circulating supply of GUSD has since declined as it was dwarfed by USDC, USDT and other stablecoins with wider trading and defi usage. The supply of GUSD is currently ~$11M, having grown from a trough of ~$4M at the end of 2019.

GUSD can be redeemed for USD via Gemini exchange accounts. GUSD is also accepted for deposits and lending via BlockFi.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  GUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state based trust company. The fiat USD corresponding to issued GUSD is held by State Street Bank and Trust Company (NYSE:STT). Monthly accounting examinations are performed by BPM, LLP.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  GUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange.

(Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.

That being said, it has the advantage of having a different issuer and custodian than USDC, TUSD, and the Paxos stablecoins (PAX, HUSD, BUSD). This could help diversify Maker\u2019s credit and custody exposures and reduce overall risk. To avoid a Coinbase dominated USDC monoculture, we should consider dogfooding some competing stablecoins by onboarding them before they have found wide adoption in DeFi. ",

                    "content": "@monet-supply thank you for bringing this proposal up for vote in a thoughtful and detailed manner.  Since inception, crypto, and DeFI especially, have been, and probably will continue to be, a Main Street (not Wall Street) phenomenon for some time. That being said, there will come a day when financial institutions (the largest money by an order of magnitude) will be ready to enter the DeFi market and when that day comes, they will need bridges into this ecosystem that are completely buttoned-up. In that vein, I think it is important to emphasize two additional points about GUSD: 1) GUSD is a regulator-approved stablecoin (by the NYDFS), whereas as far as I know, USDC has actually NOT received regulatory approval (by either NYDFS or any other US regulator). 2) GUSD publishes the names of the financial institutions (State Street, Goldman Sachs, etc.) that hold the USD that correspond to GUSD, whereas as far as I know, USDC or PAX do not tell you where your dollars are being held. These details may not be material to your average crypto user or early adopter today, however, they will be with respect to financial institutions and their true adoption/participation in the future. As I hope I\u2019ve made the case, GUSD is uniquely able to meet the rigorous compliance and regulatory requirements of future participants, including financial institutions, looking to make the jump into crypto and DeFi. Giving users greater choice with respect to collateral types (such as adding a fully-regulated stablecoin like GUSD) will improve both the number of new participants and long-term adoption of crypto and DeFi. Thanks everyone for your consideration and let me know if you have any other questions. Onward and Upward, Tyler ",

Maker Community Member @ElProgreso on behalf of the Maker Community 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Each asset supported by the Compound Protocol is integrated through a cToken contract, which is an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol. By depositing USDC and minting cUSDC, users (1) earn interest through the cToken\u2019s exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset, and (2) gain the ability to use cUSDC as collateral. cTokens are the primary means of interacting with the Compound Protocol; when a user mints, redeems, borrows, repays a borrow, liquidates a borrow, or transfers cTokens, she will do so using the cToken contract. There are currently two types of cTokens: CErc20 and CEther. Though both types expose the EIP-20 interface, CErc20 wraps an underlying ERC-20 asset, while CEther simply wraps Ether itself. As such, the core functions which involve transferring an asset into the protocol have slightly different interfaces depending on the type, each of which is shown below. For more information please visit compound.finance/docs/ctokens 3. Provide a brief history of the project. In February 2019, the Compound paper was released. Compound is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? cUSDC accumulates interest through their exchange rate \u2014 over time, each cUSDC Token becomes convertible into an increasing amount of it\u2019s underlying asset, even while the number of cUSDC Tokens in your wallet stays the same. Let\u2019s say you supply 1,000 USDC to the Compound protocol, when the exchange rate is 0.020070; you would receive 49,825.61 cUSDC (1,000/0.020070). A few months later, you decide it is time to withdraw your USDC from the protocol; the exchange rate is now 0.021591: Your 49,825.61 cUSDC is now equal to 1,075.78 USDC (49,825.61 * 0.021591) You could withdraw 1,075.78 USDC, which would redeem all 49,825.61 cUSDC Or you could withdraw a portion, such as your original 1,000 USDC, which would redeem 46,315.59 cUSDC (keeping 3,510.01 cUSDC in your wallet) 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organization bears responsibility for the collateral and users bear the responsibility of their collateral and use of the protocol 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? On decentralized exchanges 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-UNI-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of UNI and ETH . This token currently has $49 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

                    "content": "Hello everyone, This is my proposal to include SNX as a collateral asset for MCD. Background Information  Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  The strong and rapidly growing SNX community, with the full support of the Synthetix developer team would love to be able to mint DAI against SNX collateral. This would provide SNX holders more flexibility in the form of access to liquidity from their collateral asset, 1. with a potentially lower c-ratio than SNX staking (currently 300%) and 2. without being exposed to the debt obligations incurred by SNX staking (backing a proportional share of all synth value). Similarly, this would provide great value to MakerDAO and DAI holders by tapping into the considerable liquidity of SNX, generating interest for the DAO and strengthening the DAI peg against ever increasing demand.  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Synthetix is a decentralized platform on Ethereum for the creation of Synths: on-chain synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. Synthetix\u2019s native token SNX is the primary method of collateralization, although minting sETH against ETH and sBTC against renBTC is also supported. SNX holders can stake it as collateral backing newly minted synths, which are freely tradeable ERC20 tokens. Instead of a fixed or DAO adjusted interest rate for this loan against one\u2019s own assets, the cost of minting synths is in the form of a debt obligation to back a fraction of all synths, which is proportional to the minted value. The primary motivator to purchase and hold synths is to trade between them without slippage using the Synthetix Liquidity Mechanism. Transaction fees from Synths traded through one of multiple trading interfaces and downstream protocols such kwenta.io and dhedge.org go to SNX holders/Synth minters, rewarding SNX stakers for taking on the debt obligation of backing a share of the total debt owed to synth holders. This innovative and mutually beneficial solution to the long tail liquidity problem faced by most DEX implementations has catapulted SNX into a consistent spot in the top 10 and at times top 3 Defi projects. Synthetix employs counter-cyclical rewards adjustment to achieve and maintain a target staking ratio. In short, while less than 80% of SNX is staked, inflationary rewards increase. While more than 80% of SNX is staked, inflationary rewards decrease. This mechanism helps ensure that a large percentage of the token market cap is utilized to provide liquidity through staking. The demand to buy SNX to earn high rewards and the supply of rewards being sold promotes a healthy liquidity environment. As of 5/31/22 24 hour volume is $99,000,000.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Born as stablecoin project Havven, Synthetix rebranded and expanded its scope prior to launching on mainnet in February 2019. Since Mainnet launch, the project has grown and evolved geometrically. As of February 2021, the Synthetix platform supported 54 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities, indices, and cryptoassets. Synthetic stocks like sNFLX and sTSLA were added later. Since then many synths were deprecated due to high oracle fees making them uneconomical on L1, a problem Maker knows well. High L1 fees hobbled growth and revenue for Synthetix, as low volume trades were rendered impractical. Nevertheless, high volume trades and the revenues associated with them continue to occur consistently on the protocol, providing considerable revenue to this day. Sources of this volume include 1inch routing trades through Synthetix and popcorn finance using Atomic Exchanges to trade forex using Synthetix. Synthetix Spartans pushed onward hard and fast beyond the limitations of L1 to become pioneers in launching on and migrating to Optimism, where much lower fees have allowed agile trading of synths, along with smaller stakers, to flourish once again. Trading revenues as APY on staked value are 8.8% on Optimism (2x mainnet) and active staker count is 11k (also about 2x mainnet). Synthetix is one of the the oldest, largest, and most well known Defi derivatives protocols, with over $170M in synths across Optimism and L1. While [detailed stats] (https://grafana.synthetix.io/) are available here, in short the protocol earns trading fees on millions to hundreds of millions of dollars of capital flow across hundreds to thousands of trades, each and every day. Synthetix has recently launched Perpetual Futures Beta. Anyone with access to the internet can leverage Synthetix\u2019s infrastructure to access up to 10x leverage on an evergrowing list of Synthetic assets. Kwenta, a fully decentralized and composable protocol with an easy-to-use trading UI, is the first partner to integrate Synthetix\u2019s perps. Synthetix perps markets are accessible through a dedicated Kwenta UI. Synthetix\u2019s perpetual futures enable a much expanded and capital-efficient trading experience by allowing both leveraged longs and shorts on a large selection of assets.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated\u2026  Live Synthetix System Dashboard: https://stats.synthetix.io/ Synthetix Litepaper:   docs.synthetix.io   \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa English - Synthetix System Documentation Decentralised Synthetic Assets      Synthetix Governance Portal: https://gov.synthetix.io/#/ Synthetix Github:   GitHub    Synthetix Crypto backed synthetic asset platform. Synthetix has 81 repositories available. Follow their code on GitHub.      Asset Information  What type of asset is it? (e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)  and  How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)  The primary function of SNX token is as collateral for staking, which is at its core a form of both borrowing and liquidity provision. Staking SNX entitles the staker to a time weighted proportional share of the inflationary and revenue based rewards earned by the protocol during that 1 week staking epoch. Staked SNX acts as a governance token in that stakers vote for governance council members counts proportionally to amount of staked SNX (weighted debt). SNX holders can stake it as collateral backing newly minted synths, which are freely tradeable ERC20 tokens. Instead of a predictable or DAO controlled interest rate for this loan against one\u2019s own assets, the cost of minting synths is in the form of a debt obligation to back a fraction of all synths proportional to the minted value. The primary motivator to purchase and hold synths is to trade between them without slippage using the Synthetix Infinite Liquidity Mechanism provided by the Synthetix Exchange. Transaction fees from Synths traded through one of multiple interfaces for the exchange such as Synthetix.Exchange and kwenta.io go to SNX stakers, rewarding them for taking on the debt obligation of backing a share of the total debt owed to synth holders. About 64% of the total SNX supply is currently staked.   What is the market cap for the asset? $760M   Where does exchange for the asset occur? and 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth.   Coinmarketcap markets list:   CoinMarketCap    Synthetix price today, SNX to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap Get the latest Synthetix price, SNX market cap, trading pairs, charts and data today from the world\u2019s number one cryptocurrency price-tracking website      SNX has comparable liquidity to MKR and is traded on most major CEXes including Binance ($11M 24h), Coinbase ($7M 24h) and Huobi ($1.4M 24h). SNX is also traded on many DEXes and liquidity protocols including Uniswap V2 ($328k 24h) and SushiSwap ($112k 24h).  Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)?

List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type.  SNX stakers looking to buy SNX at a lower price, as well as arbs looking to resell what they can buy at a discount on the very liquid open market for short term profit. Business Questions  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?  To access liquidity from SNX at a lower c ratio than staking and without having to deal with the unique debt obligations that SNX staking entails. To LP DAI/sUSD.  What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  Maker man suggested this: \u201cSay SNX puts up what is like 6 months or oracle costs and PE cost against a KPI that says they need to meet a 50M TVL and 30M DAI minted in 6 months or the bond is forefit.\u201d The Synthetix Treasury Council is open to discussing an arrangement similar to this if it necessary for addition as collateral.  What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?  SNX token is currently the largest token on Optimism, with more value on the network than ETH. It is a great move to align Maker with the Optimism ecosystem. Synthetix is also at the center of its own ecosystem of protocols like Thales, Lyra, Dhedge, and Aelin, Maker stands to capture a portion of the fees from entry/exit into/out of the ecosystem by lending to LP\u2019ers. Legal Questions  What are the legal risks associated with the tokens?  None I can think of.  (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? and (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. and (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  Synthetix has taken an aggressive approach towards decentralisation and is fully governed by a number of decentralised governance bodies and elected representatives of token stakers.  Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)?  Issuance is decentralized, determined by a governance council, whose members are elected by SNX stakers. Technical Questions  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.

Overall score is 97       Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified?  Yes, see https://www.defisafety.com/pqrs/419  Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400)  ERC20  Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)?  As mentioned above some aspects of the asset like issuance are controlled by elected council. A full list of DAO\u2019s involved in governing Synthetix is available here  Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved?  No.  Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved?  Yes. Through the SIP and SCCP process, much like the MIP process. The process and involved parties are detailed here  Does the token contain rebasing logic?  No rebasing logic.

If we give it a sizeable enough debt ceiling, SNX as collateral will greatly expand the DAI supply. The only concern I see right now is that running these oracles, with gas as high as it is, is costing us an arm and a leg. Adding another price feed is costly, but probably worth it in this case. ",

As for the business use case, Synthetix is currently the leading dApp on Optimism, one of the two L2s MakerDAO is focusing on for upcoming deployments. This presents an opportunity to provide DAI liquidity for SNX users on mainnet, whose demand will organically grow to Optimism. There\u2019s also the sUSD MIP, which could be an interesting addition to the PSM at some point. I foresee a mutually beneficial relationship between two DeFi \u201cblue-chips\u201d as both protocols continue to grow in the L2 space. ",

SNX market cap:  https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f 1.1B Which at 2% SF would mean a required 50M (or 9% or 100M for 200CR SNX market capture just to cover oracles, though oracle costs are lower lately so maybe 50M is a bit high). I think looking at total realistic upside here at not much more than 20% (or 220M) giving what 2.2M/yr in revenue is probably the actual top unless SNX price jumps significantly.  The issue is that Synthetix itself is a competitor for their own SNX liquidity.   Now maybe there is a leverage case here and with reasonable LR maybe Maker captures a part of that market.   150 LR means best case Maker gets ~100M (200CR) DAI minted.   minimum case is what 30-40M which again means Maker has to compete to capture 6-8% of the SNX Market Cap. Possible?   Maybe.   Highly ambitious - definitely. I think this one is borderline neutral to the protocol and PE is busy with other things.   I keep thinking perhaps Maker needs to go a bit further here on these MIP6 applications that are marginal or even in general.   Tie a proposer bond to kpi performance metric. Say SNX puts up what is like 6 months or oracle costs and PE cost against a KPI that says they need to meet a 50M TVL and 30M DAI minted in 6 months or the bond is forefit.?    Point here is that everyone wants to be added to Maker and when it comes down to deciding I\u2019d like to see communities put money where their mouths are on these as it would help us consider whether we really should do them or whether we shouldn\u2019t and if they can\u2019t meet the basic performance metric then we just claim the bond and remove the collateral.   Put some of the risk on these communities to be serious, rather than frivioulous about whether their communities can support the effort and expense required to even get a Maker vault.

                    "content": "@monkey.irish in my assessment SNX is a good candidate for addition as collateral. It strongly satisfies most points of the Recommended Metrics Summary:  30M Dai minimum target debt ceiling  The Spartan community is one that famously loves put their SNX to work, and this gives them another avenue to do so. With $500M in SNX currently staked, considering the high on chain activity levels of SNX stakers, surpassing a 30M DAI debt ceiling with $45M in collateral doesn\u2019t seem like a stretch.  Clear business case  Some have asked if SNX staking itself would compete with using SNX as DAI collateral. While indeed staking SNX issues an sUSD loan against SNX collateral, the primary purpose of staking is to collect trading and inflationary rewards. The borrowed funds are difficult to use for arbitrary purposes. A staker\u2019s debt changes in accordance with the distribution of synths in the Synthetix global debt pool.  image620\u00d71334 75.2 KB  This means that the sUSD funds issued as a loan during staking must be invested in assets which mirror the debt portfolio so as to hedge it, or else the staker will be assuming the counterparty risk of all synth holders. Instead of beating an interest rate, the staker must mirror \u2018the market\u2019 of synth holders to keep their assets and debt even, or outperform the market to make money on their sUSD loan from staking. This also means staking is not a great mechanism to safely leverage an SNX position, since market behavior unrelated to SNX price can arbitrarily increase debt. Maker loans perfectly fill the needs of people wanting to access liquidity from SNX tokens for leverage, farming, or other use cases in which they prefer a relatively stable and predictable interest rate to the complex and sometimes volatile debt obligation staking entails. Since this debt obligation can change quickly, the minimum c-ratio (200%) and target c-ratio (300%) are both  quite high relative to Maker vault c-ratios. MKR is a more stable and capital efficient option for those looking to utilize liquidity borrowed against SNX without having to hedge the complex debt obligations incurred by staking.  Min. $250M market cap of circulating supply  Mcap is over $600M right now.  Min. $40M of onchain liquidity (132% of debt ceiling)  I\u2019m not quite sure what this is meaning, $40M of SNX in on chain pools? $40M of other assets paired with SNX in pools? Liquidity such that $40M can be sold at one time? There are few ERC20\u2019s that can absorb a $40M on chain dump instantly at this time. SNX has, if I were to guess, about $5-10M sitting in on chain liquidity pools. This is pretty good compared to most ERC20 tokens. Overall SNX liquidity on and off chain is quite good, and I fully believe that the risk profile of SNX as collateral in a liquidation scenario is much more appealing than other tokens which have already been approved as collateral.  Traded on at least 5 exchanges with  SNX is traded on over 170 exchanges.  Daily exchange volume of the collateral asset >$2M.   image1920\u00d71134 141 KB  I\u2019m not sure if this means $2M for each exchange or $2M total, but either way the top 5 exchanges for SNX have a combined daily volume of 5.68+3.11+.743+.521+.499 = $10.55M, so I would call that one met in spirit.  Order book depth of over $200k in the +2% and -2% tiers   image1352\u00d7326 58.2 KB  For the top 2 yes, backed up by a long tail of 5 figure order book depths.  Technical metrics to gauge complexity and upfront implementation cost  I am no expert but I don\u2019t believe there is anything nonstandard required for SNX as collateral. Reliable decentralized price feeds are available. There is plenty of on chain infrastructure supporting it. ",

HBTC is a standard ERC20 token with approximately 710 BTC market cap as of July 23, 2020. 1.\tWho is the interested party for this collateral application? Huobi Global Limited, the issuer of the HBTC. As a digital assets service provider, Huobi Global is far ahead of its competitors in establishing a global network of licenses. It has over thousands of employees and established subsidiary companies and partnership companies in 12 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Thailand, Gibraltar, etc. Huobi Global has been operating safely for 6 years without any security incidents. 2.\tProvide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. HBTC aims to solve the lack of Bitcoin in DeFi market. By issuing HBTC digital assets based on the ERC20 standard, the value of Bitcoin is transferred to Ethereum, which injects Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity and stability into the Ethereum ecosystem. HBTC strictly backed 1:1 by Bitcoin makes its value consistent with Bitcoin, preventing problems that may occur in synthetic assets, ensuring that users can use HBTC and BTC for 1:1 exchange at Huobi Global at any time. The amount of HBTC issued\uff0cBTC reserved and relevant records are open and transparent on the website https://www.hbtc.finance/ 3.\tProvide a brief history of the project. 1\uff09\tOn February 14, 2020 (GMT+8), Huobi Global announced the official launch of HBTC. 2\uff09\tOn February 28, 2020 (GMT+8), the HBTC minting exceeded 700 BTC. 4.\tLink the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. The smart contract has been audited by Slow Mist. Please check the audit report here https://www.hbtc.finance/static/pdf/audit-report-en.pdf 6.\tLink to any active communities relating to your project. Find us on Medium: https://medium.com/@HBTC_Finance 7.\tHow is the applying collateral type currently used? As the BTC issued on Ethereum, HBTC can be used by users for more convenient transfer, lending, trading, oracle etc. Also\uff0cHBTC already used in Fortube (ForTube) as collateral and loan asset.\tHBTC already used in Nest(https://nestprotocol.org) as the oracle. 8.\tDoes one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? HBTC is issued by Huobi Global Limited; Huobi Global Limited is a company incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles in accordance with the relevant laws of the Republic of Seychelles. The company operates the website https://www.huobi.sc 9.\tWhere does exchange for the asset occur?  Users can acquire HBTC by deposit BTC via Huobi Global Exchange (Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Exchange | Huobi Global) and/or HBTC official website the HBTC withdraw process is as follows:   Buy, deposit or get BTC through trading and save it in the Exchange account on Huobi Global. Select BTC - Withdraw - ERC20 in the Exchange account. Enter the address and amount for withdrawal and click \"Withdraw \". Then the process of BTC minting HBTC is completed.   also could directly buy HBTC through our Partners\u2019 platforms:   Legend Trading\uff1ahttps://legendtrading.com/  dForce Trade: https://trade.dforce.network/   10.\tHas your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A 11.\tDescribe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12.\tList any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Nest Oracle provides direct quotation on the Ethereum network for HBTC/ETH, the quotation contract address\uff1a0x99bd363a144Fb61FEAe863b182F1f200667a1879 Note: HBTC (assets based on ERC20) does not use oracle itself, and the exchange ratio between HBTC and BTC is 1:1. You can directly use the existing MakerDAO BTC/USD oracle. ",

                    "content": "Hi @robert and welcome to the community, ERC-20 editions of BTC looks to be highly fashionable these days. I will give my first impression on HBTC. Some of this you might add something too and some is more for community discussion Pros: another BTC coin on the Ethereum blockchain. Technically identical to WBTC as far as I can tell. Cons:  low market cap at USD6.5 million. We in the Maker community should possibly start discussing if small caps of this sort are worth the effort.      Robert:  2\uff09 On February 28, 2020 (GMT+8), the HBTC minting exceeded 700 BTC.   So the market cap has grown by 10 BTC since February? https://etherscan.io/token/0x0316eb71485b0ab14103307bf65a021042c6d380  no defi presence. Like none. As far as I can tell HBTC is not used outside of Huobi.  I feel there is a story here that is not being told. HBTC saw the first transactions about nine months ago and finished audits in December 2019. That is almost eight months ago and the market cap is still only USD6.5 million. Not exactly stellar growth to put it mildly - especially considering the growth of WBTC and renBTC just over the last two months. You might think that so what - it is still early days of crosschain functionality. Well - that is assuming that the growth of crosschain tokens will just continue, and that might not be the case. Just go on the various discussion forums of other chains and search for defi related articles: they either don\u2019t know about defi, they don\u2019t care about defi or they positively consider it diaper filling. This makes me think the idea that 10% of BTC (to match the Ethereum level) will end up in defi is either without connection to reality or something that will take many years. Crosschain is possibly all the rage in smaller circles, but there is not a single BTC whale that has looked twice at it yet. All in all this makes me slightly uneasy about adding more centralized BTC variants, especially with such a low usage. ",

Curve has vastly improved slippage between stablecoins, and adding HUSD would help address some of the concerns about limited on-chain trading and usability.     Being able to trade HBTC for WBTC or renBTC on curve.fi would be very useful. Overall I\u2019m supportive of HBTC; diversifying custodian risk is probably good. ",

As we know, HBTC is in its infancy. Although its market cap is low now, it immense growth potential. The issuance mechanism of HBTC is competitive, the generation and redemption of HBTC can be done natively within Huobi Global Exchange, and users can use HBTC directly in Huobi Global. HBTC acts as a gateway that guides user who are unfamiliar with Defi into to the DeFi world. Users who want to generate HBTC, only need to pay less than 0.00005BTC (about $0.5) in fee, and redeem HBTC for free. If MakerDAO supports HBTC, it is predictable that a large number of users and assets will be funneled into the MakerDAO ecosystem, accelerating protocol growth. ",

As you mentioned, Huobi Global was ready for the issuance of HBTC in December 2019, hoping to bring prosperity to DeFi. The initial focus of HBTC was not on growth in terms of marketcap. It is precisely that Huobi has been looking for reliable and reputable Defi platforms, like MakerDAO, to synergy with each other and promote higher liquidity. For example, there was not much volume (only 1.125K)before WBTC was added to the MakerDAO collateral, ,and the data soared after joining. This could be a mutually beneficial collaboration. Due to the convenience of HBTC issuance, it is believed that HBTC will gradually enter a period of rapid growth and bring more BTC users to the MakerDAO ecosystem. ",

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-AAVE-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of AAVE and ETH . This token currently has $128 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. aUSDC Token is an interest-bearing derivative tokens that are minted and burned upon deposit (called from LendingPool https://bit.ly/3bXogNQ) and redeem(called from the aToken contract https://bit.ly/33xOoek). aUSDC value is pegged to the value of the corresponding deposited asset at a 1:1 ratio, and can be safely stored, transferred, or traded. All interest collected by the aUSDC reserves are distributed to aUSDC holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance. The source code for aTokens can be found here: https://bit.ly/32wdzPq 3. Provide a brief history of the project. aUSDC mainnet was launched in January, 2020. Headquartered in London, Aave protocol is a decentralized, open-source, and non-custodial money market protocol. Depositors earn interest by providing liquidity to lending pools, while borrowers can obtain loans by tapping into these pools in both an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion. At the start of 2020, Aave had a Total Value Locked ( TVL ) of 4.1 Million USD. Today Aave has over 1 Billion USD in TVL. 4.

Whenever USDC Tokens are deposited on Aave, either as a lender, or as collateral when borrowing, the user is given an equivalent amount in aUSDC. For example, if you deposited 100 USDC into Aave, you would be given 100 aUSDC. The function of these tokens is to allow you to earn interest. Every second, a small fraction of corresponding aUSDC  is added to your Ethereum wallet in accordance with the APR interest rate for your asset. These can then be exchanged for the equivalent amount of the underlying asset in Aave at the time of withdrawal. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organization bears responsibility for the collateral and users bear the responsibility of their collateral and use of the protocol 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? On decentralized exchanges 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.

Update: The Aave team has evaluated the behavior of the price provider and believes that in the worst case, the CPMPriceProvider\u2019s performance will match that of the oracle for the underlying currency (ex. Chainlink\u2019s DAI/ETH aggregrator) in the UNI pair.\u201d https://docs.aave.com/developers/developing-on-aave/the-protocol/price-oracle ",

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-SUSHI-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of SUSHI and ETH . This token currently has $683 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

SLP-SUSHI-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided.

Sushiswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and uses identical swap mechanisms and formulas. It uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.25% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The SLP-SNX-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of SNX and ETH . This token currently has $64 MM of liquidity. Sushiswap v2 pool contracts are permissionless and non-upgradable - the switch for protocol fees has already been activated and governance has no further control over pool assets. Uniswap\u2019s contracts (the basis of Sushiswap) have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Sushiswap was launched as a fork of Uniswap v2 in late August, with the fee switch turned on and a native SUSHI governance token to incentivize deposits. Since Sushiswap launch, the protocol has become a key decentralized trading venue with billions of USD worth of total value locked. Sushiswap is also beginning to operate on other sidechains and L2s, and has released a pair lending product called Kashi with other natively funded projects in development.

SLP-SNX-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  Sushiswap LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  SLP-SNX-ETH can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Sushiswap contracts and front end UI. SNX and ETH are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues.

It provides a liquidity provider of last resort in case of DAI liquidity issues on Compound. That is valuable for Compound protocol but also to DAI borrower as we can provide ways to avoid punishing interest rates (>20%)   It provides an easy way to expand DAI supply, if needed, by recycling DAI locked in Compound.   This collateral has only a protocol risk, no volatility risk (it\u2019s DAI) and no custody risk which is not frequent.   A general discussion can be found here => [Discussion] cDAI/aDAI collaterals as a peg enabler tool   Application Form 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @SebVentures 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Compound is a money market protocol. Participants can deposit tokens in excess in the protocol in order to get interest as liquidity providers. They get a Compound interest bearing token in exchange (cDAI in case of DAI deposited). Having a deposit on Compound also offers the opportunity to borrow some tokens from the liquidity pools using the deposit as collateral. Each borrowing is over collateralized. The interest received on deposit and the interest paid on borrowing depend on the supply and demand for each token. Below is the DAI interest curve for supply (green) and borrowing (purple).  The cDAI token has an exchange rate with DAI that increase over time (more DAI per cDAI due to compounded interest). The current rate can be found here. image1263\u00d7552 27.3 KB Currently, each cDAI earns some COMP tokens. Obviously, the collateral usage (an possible stability fee)  would be better if the cDAI owner still gets COMP tokens. Not sure how that can work with a Maker Vault. 3. Provide a brief history of the project Compound was launched by Compound Labs. Compound Lab raised $33M of equity with a last Serie A of $25M from Andreessen Horowitz in November 2019 (Andreessen Horowitz is also a big owner of MKR tokens). Compound launched on mainnet in October 2018. It has strong adoption as TVL is now around $700M. image811\u00d7405 21.7 KB The DAI collateral contract exists since Nov 2019. It can, and was, upgraded (to use DSR). The DAI usage on Compound was increased due to COMP farming with farmers supplying and borrowing DAI. It\u2019s around 200M DAI currently. image817\u00d7410 20.2 KB 4.

The collateral is not widely used (no many use). It can be used on exchanged (Balancer mainly, Curve or uniswap). It is also a possible underlying for yDAI (which is not currently). 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organization bears legal responsibility for the collateral. 9.

We\u2019ve received some of the BUSD holders\u2019 requirements for adding BUSD in the collateral of Maker Protocol. Despite the information we\u2019ve posted here, we may have missed things. Please feel free to comment or correct, so much appreciate your support of BUSD. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The Binance BUSD Team Contact us: [email\u00a0protected] 2.\tProvide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Binance USD (BUSD) is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), Approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). 3.\tProvide a brief history of the project. Launched on 5 Sep 2019, BUSD aims to meld the stability of the dollar with blockchain technology.  September 5, 2019: Launched by Binance and Paxos. March 13, 2020: Market Cap surpassed 100 million USD. April 17, 2020: Market Cap reached 200 million USD. (It took 35 days for BUSD market cap to jump 2x ) May 28, 2020: Purchasing volume (minting or tokenizing) reached the 1 billion USD milestone. (It took 261 days for BUSD to hit 1 billion)  4.\tLink the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. BUSD on Github BUSD on CoinMarket Cap BUSD on Etherscan 5.\tLink any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. 5.1 The BUSD smart contracts are audited by Nomic Labs, ChainSecurity, and Trail of Bits. Full audit reports are available at the BUSD GitHub repository. 5.2 Monthly Attestations: Additionally, Binance and Paxos team has engaged Withum, a nationally top-ranking auditing firm, to independently verify at specific points in time that the entire supply of BUSD is consistent with USD in reserve accounts at U.S. banks held and managed by Binance and Paxos. Withum performs month-end attestations of these accounts using standards established by the AICPA. Every attestation report that has been published since the launch of the Paxos Standard can be viewed BUSD Monthly Attestation Report. 6.\tHow is the applying collateral type currently used? In the first 6 months of BUSD\u2019s rapid growth, to be honest, it was mainly used in the Binance exchange (trading and savings), which is a top contributor for its market cap. From the second half of 2020, we will rapidly promote the other use cases for BUSD. We believe the Defi and payment will be the next biggest use case. 6.1 Here are some of the existing BUSD use cases:  Trade BUSD on different exchanges and DEX. (All BUSD trading pairs on Binance is Maker Zero transaction fees) Deposit BUSD to earn an interest rate. Pay BUSD as payment for goods and services. Use BUSD as collateral and loan asset. Use BUSD as cross collateral in Binance Futures. Transfer your digital dollars (BUSD) anywhere in minutes, with low cost and on the blockchain. Store BUSD on an exchange or wallet.  6.2 Where you can use BUSD: (Sorry for not being able to list all important partners, while we plan to update the BUSD ecosystem on the BUSD website before this Sep.)  DeFi (Lending): Aave, Curve, 1inch, DDEX, etc. Trading: More than 30 exchanges/Dex had listed BUSD by July.2020, Binance.com, Binance.US, Poloniex, WazirX, Kyber Network, Tokenlon, etc. CeFi Lending: Binance, Celsius Network, Coinloan, etc. Payment: Bitpay, BitTorrent, Bundle, Simplex, AlchemyPay, Moonpay, etc. Cross-Chain case: Binance Chain, Elrond, Syscoin, Zilliqa, etc. Wallet: BUSD is issued on the Ethereum, we suppose that it has been supported by most of the mainstream Wallets.  7.\tDoes one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Binance and Paxos manage the smart contracts and issuance of BUSD. Paxos is a qualified custodian under New York law, and in that capacity bears full legal responsibility for custodian the US dollar reserves underlying BUSD. 8.\tWhere does exchange for the asset occur? More than 30 exchanges/Dex had listed BUSD by July.2020, Binance.com, Binance.US, Poloniex, WazirX, Coinsbit, FTX, Tokok, Bilaxy, Binance DEX, Kyber Network, Tokenlon, etc. Link to Coinmarketcap. 9.\tHas your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. BUSD has obtained legal memoranda from major international law firms, Davis Polk. Consistent with standard industry practice in these jurisdictions, the firms require that Binance not share these memoranda with third parties without certain non-disclosure/non-reliance agreements. Binance can disclose that based on the legal advice provided in these memoranda from US counsel, Binance has concluded that BUSD is operating consistent with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions. 10.\tDescribe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. The joint issuer Paxos is a Limited Purpose Trust Company chartered since 2015 by the NYDFS, making PAX and BUSD the first fully regulated digital asset. 11.\tList any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. As BUSD is always redeemable 1:1 with a US dollar, it can be treated the same as PAX or USDC and be pegged 1:1 to Dai. Thanks! ",

Loopring is a zkRollup based DEX and asset transfer protocol built on Ethereum. Each trade through the protocol incurs a small fee, which accrues to LRC holders through a staking system. Additionally, operators running DEXes atop Loopring are incentivized to stake LRC to reduce their costs.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Loopring was started in June 2017, and performed a public token sale in August of 2017. To date, there have been 4 main versions of protocol, version 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 (current version). Loopring recently released Loopring Pay, which uses their underlying zkRollup infrastructure to support ETH and ERC20 transfers in addition to DEX trading.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/loopringorg Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/ Telegram: https://t.me/loopring_en Discord: https://discord.com/invite/KkYccYp  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  LRC can be staked at staking.loopring.org in order to claim a share of 70% of Loopring\u2019s protocol fees. Fees received are proportional to both amount of tokens staked and time staked, encouraging users to lock up for longer periods. In the future, there is a plan to launch a Loopring DAO to manage the protocol. Currently, 20% of protocol fees are reserved for use of the future DAO.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  LRC is a decentralized token. No organization bears legal responsibility for LRC and LRC is not connected to any off-chain assets.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  LRC is traded on centralized exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, Bittrex, and Bitfinex, as well as decentralized platforms such as Kyber, Uniswap, Balancer, and Loopring.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  xSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP being the other one). We are currently not fully decentralized but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are bound to respect all of the governance votes. We do plan to be a real DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by the community. xSushi receives 0.05% of all the swaps happening on the Sushiswap AMM and should also benefit from all of the future revenues streams from upcoming platforms such as Bento, Miso, Gusoku, Deriswap and more. The current yield on this asset is hovering around 10-40% APY with over $100MM locked in the Sushibar making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Sushiswap was launched by pseudonymous individual Chef Nomi in August 2020. The core code was forked from Uniswap v2, with a few changes: the 0.05% protocol fee was turned on, and a governance token (SUSHI) was created to manage the platform and receive revenue. Chef Nomi also created staking contracts that would incentivize existing Uniswap LPs to migrate their liquidity to the new platform. The project ran into controversy when Nomi unexpectedly sold SUSHI from the dev fund. After this point, FTX/Alameda Research principal Sam Bankman Fried stepped in to organize a multisig to manage the development fund and migration. Nomi eventually returned funds to Sushiswap and then left the project. New contributors such as 0xMaki stepped up to manage development and day to day operations. After Sushiswap launched and completed the liquidity migration, Uniswap released their own platform token and launched a competing liquidity mining program. This was largely responsible for a decline in Sushiswap volumes and liquidity from September to November. Since the trough of the defi market drawdown in November, Sushiswap has experienced a virtuous cycle of increasing volume and liquidity driving token price, which in turn amplifies liquidity incentives and further improves fundamentals. The platform is also investing in new products and services beyond the core AMM which may lead to further value accrual and differentiation from other DEX platforms.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

This works via automatic compounding, so each xSUSHI token represents an ever increasing amount of SUSHI in the staking contract. While xSUSHI\u2019s primary purpose is to receive protocol earnings and vote in governance, it is also beginning to be supported by defi protocols. There is around $1 million of xSUSHI liquidity on Sushiswap itself, and Aave is also onboarding xSUSHI to their v2 lending platform.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  xSUSHI is a decentralized asset. It does not represent a legal claim or liability of another party.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  The primary method of exchanging xSUSHI is to swap it for SUSHI tokens directly in the Sushibar contract (with no slippage or fees other than gas required to exchange between them). SUSHI is widely traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges. Top CEX venues include Binance, Huobi, OKEx, FTX, and Bitfinex, while the largest DEX venue is Sushiswap itself.

Centralized exchange platforms listed in section (9) may be able to offer price data for SUSHI. xSUSHI price can then be computed by multiplying SUSHI price times the SUSHI/xSUSHI exchange rate.

Our only ways to make a differentiated xSUSHI product would be through either offering higher or lower collateral ratio vs ~150% offered at Aave. For risk reasons we probably wouldn\u2019t want to offer lower CR, and higher CR with lower rates runs into profitability concerns.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-DAI-BAT LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and BAT. This token currently has $2,000 of liquidity spread among 15 total holders. The top holder owns roughly 70% of current supply. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

UNI-V2-DAI-BAT LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets. UNI-V2-DAI-BAT is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-DAI-BAT can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. The OMG Network is a Layer-2 value transfer network for ETH and any ERC-20 token. The Network is a scalability solution for the Ethereum Network and intends to reduce the high transaction fees and network congestion facing the blockchain. The OMG Token is a fee token that can be used to pay for any ERC-20 transactions on the OMG Network, thereby, reducing Ethereum\u2019s network congestion and transaction fees for all. The token will later serve staking purposes as OMG Network\u2019s consensus algorithm will be migrated to Proof-of-Stake. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Initially known as OmiseGo, the ICO raised over $25 million around July 2017. 3 years later, during the summer 2020, the project is rebranded OMG Network as the company announce the public Mainnet beta. Shortly after, mid-August, Bitfinex integrates with OMG Network allowing to scale USDt transactions. 4.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-YFI-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and YFI. This token currently has $13,000,000 of liquidity spread among 706 total holders. The top 8 holders account for over 50% of total supply, but the top two holders represent BAO and Alpha finance so this accounts for many underlying users. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol Forum: https://gov.uniswap.org/ Discord: https://discord.com/invite/XErMcTq  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  UNI-V2-YFI-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets. UNI-V2-YFI-ETH is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. Details of the YFI token are available in the YFI collateral application. There is also an active proposal to increase YFI total supply from 30,000 to 36,666, details here.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-YFI-ETH can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI. ETH and YFI are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-UNI-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and UNI. This token currently has $155,000,000 of liquidity spread among 3,900 total holders. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

The UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and AAVE. This token currently has $36,000,000 of liquidity spread among 300 total holders. The top LP holds over 80% of the current liquidity in this pool. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets. UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-AAVE-ETH can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI. ETH and AAVE are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  n/a  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  n/a  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.

The Spartan Tough SNX community, with the full support of the Synthetix governing bodies would love to be able to mint DAI against sUSD collateral. This would allow sUSD holders, including SNX stakers, to easily generate DAI to lend, pool, farm, or spend without selling their sUSD. This is particularly advantageous for SNX stakers, who manage debt obligations which must be repaid in sUSD, but may want to generate yield on DAI over sUSD for higher rates or deeper liquidity. Similarly, this would provide great value to MakerDAO and DAI holders by capturing a slice of the higher yields on larger amounts sought by sUSD depositors. This generates interest for the DAO. It also adds supply side liquidity to DAI and thus helps to strengthen its peg against ever increasing demand.  1600\u00d7890 250 KB   Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  For a high level overview of the Synthetix project in general, see my MIP6 for SNX here:     [SNX] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Collateral Onboarding Applications (MIP6)       Hello everyone,  This is my proposal to include SNX as a collateral asset for MCD.  Background Information   Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  The strong and rapidly growing SNX community, with the full support of the Synthetix developer team would love to be able to mint DAI against SNX collateral. This would provide SNX holders more flexibility in the form of access to liquidity from their collateral asset, 1. with a potentially lower c-ratio than SNX staking (curre\u2026     SNX holders can stake it as collateral backing newly minted sUSD, Synthetix\u2019s stablecoin. Instead of a predictable or DAO controlled interest rate for this loan against one\u2019s own assets, the cost of minting synths is in the form of a debt obligation to back a fraction of all synths, which is proportional to the minted value. This means that while the value of the staker\u2019s sUSD stays relatively constant, the value of the corresponding debt can fluctuate based on the performance of all synthetic assets. When synth holders gain value, SNX stakers owe them that value, or must forfeit their 300% overcollateralized SNX tokens. If the staker can manage a portfolio funded entirely with their minted sUSD that manages to beat the market of other synth holders, they have managed to turn staking into a profitable activity before staking rewards are even considered. This means SNX stakers holding sUSD have strong incentive to be using it to generate yield and at least balance but ideally demolish their debt. The primary motivator for the non-SNX-staker to purchase and hold sUSD is to use the Synthetix Infinite Liquidity Mechanism to trade for other synthetic assets, on a permissionless DEX without slippage. Trading fees from this activity are paid to SNX stakers in sUSD.  How long has the project been live in production?

(e.g. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token etc.)   How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights)   sUSD is a stablecoin store of value used principally for trading with the Synthetix Exchange through one of several front end exchanges, but it also a very popular token for several other lending and LP Defi Protocols including most notably aave and curve. There are frequently good yields on sUSD on these protocols. As mentioned above trading fees are awarded to stakers in sUSD. sUSD is minted by stakers against SNX collateral, with the c-ratio currently at 300%, meaning every $1 sUSD is backed by $3 in collateral. This safe ratio makes sUSD even more appealing as a collateral type. Some sUSD is also generated through an LUSD wrapper. A small amount is also generated through borrowing against ETH and renBTC. A full percentage breakdown of sUSD backing is available below.

Thales protocol allows the creation of on-chain, non-custodial Parimutuel markets. You can trade AMM-based positional markets, immerse yourself in novel gamified DeFi experiences, and much more.      sUSD has a modest but resilient market cap of $162M across Optimism and Ethereum mainnet. Due to the highly decentralized design and use case of the Synthetix protocol, sUSD is much more liquid on DEXes than on CEXes. the largest CEX is Gate.io ( $68k 24h/USDT). Where it really stands out is defi liquidity. It is infinitely liquid on the synthetix exchange and all interfaces for it, but its biggest source of external volume is curve pools, with the aforementioned sUSD pool generating over $7M in daily traded volume at time of writing. This volume profile falls in line with sUSD\u2019s intended functionality, as once it is held its most core function is to be traded with the synthetix exchange, taking advantage of the infinite liquidity mechanism. The majority of the volume is in the curve sUSD stablecoin pool, as people enter and exit the synthetix trading environment by buying into and selling out of sUSD. This pool functions as a major liquidity onramp and offramp for synthetix.  Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)?  On chain.  If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process and estimated time.

List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type.  SNX stakers, sUSD lenders, or sUSD poolers looking to buy sUSD at a lower price, as well as arbs looking to resell what they can buy at a discount on the open market for short term profit. The obligation of SNX stakers to repay sUSD denominated debt in order to retrieve 300% of its market value in SNX is perhaps the strongest core motivator for liquidation participation.  What is/are the expected use case(s) of the Dai generated by the vault?  A main use case would be SNX stakers holding sUSD who want to earn higher yields using DAI borrowed against it. This is a very compelling case as stakers owe all debt as sUSD and receive it from staking, and if they can earn yield on during that term then the sUSD portion of their debt becomes profitable. Since sUSD can also be generated by being borrowed against LUSD, an sUSD vault would also provide LUSD holders with a path to borrow DAI.  What is the amount of Dai expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of Dai to be generated?  Similar to the SNX proposal, the Synthetix Treasury council is open to discussing cooperative commitments if they are necessary for addition as collateral. I would imagine at least 30 M DAI could be generated from sUSD if Synthetix publicizes this opportunity to stakers.  What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral?  sUSD is a stablecoin backed with 300% over-collateralization, very safe. Synthetix has its own price stability mechanisms which historically work well. It is the 4th largest coin on Optimism behind only SNX, ETH, and USDC. Facilitates use of DAI as an onramp and offramp to the synthetix trading environment. Epowers SNX stakers to earn yeild from their stake through DAI, and rewards MakerDAO with a chunk of that yield. Cooperation and integration between OG defi projects helps strengthen both organizations and the ecosystem as a whole. sUSD is backed on chain by 3 different collateral assets, LUSD, SNX, and ETH, making it highly decentralized when compared to other stablecoin collateral such as USDC. Layer 1 sUSD: 97.1M sUSD sUSD backed by LUSD: (48.4M in synths * .6046 sUSD fraction of synths) = 29.3M sUSD or 30% of total sUSD backed by ETH and renBTC: 1.3M sUSD or 1.3% of total sUSD backed by staked SNX: 97.1M - 29.3M - 1.3M = 66.5M sUSD or 68% of total Layer 2 sUSD: 70.2M sUSD sUSD backed by LUSD: (43.0M in synths * .6046 sUSD fraction of synths) = 26.0M sUSD or 37% of total sUSD backed by ETH and renBTC: 1.2M sUSD or 1.7% of total sUSD backed by staked SNX: 70.2M - 26.0M - 1.2M = 43.0M sUSD of 61% of total  What are the legal risks associated with the tokens?  None I can think of.  (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  Synthetix has taken an aggressive approach towards decentralisation and is fully governed by a number of decentralised governance bodies and elected representatives of token stakers.  Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)?  Decentralized  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits.

Yes, see above.  Does the asset follow a token standard? (E.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400)  ERC-20  Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (e.g. through a multisig, or DAO)?  Issuance is only possible through the decentralized activity of staking SNX collateral, at which sUSD is issued as a loan.  Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved?  No  Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved?  Yes. Through the SIP and SCCP process, much like the MIP process. The process and involved parties are detailed here  Does the token contain rebasing logic?  No rebasing logic.

Nexo.io is a product that provides crypto-backed loans. Nexo.io was launched in 2017. It allows users to deposit crypto assets into custodial accounts to either gain access to yield on those crypto assets or access to credit lines. Nexo accepts a variety of different crypto assets for usage as loan collateral including ETH, BTC, DAI, USDC, as well as many others. The nexo erc20 token can be used on the platform through staking to gain access to various features. Staking allows users to: receive discounted interest rates for their crypto loans, higher yield on deposited assets, and allows them to receive dividend distributions from the nexo platform. Provide a brief history of the project. Previously stated launched in 2017. Nexo provides users with access to collateralized USD loans by providing crypto assets as collateral. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Briefly explained in project overview but the nexo token to is primarily used to gain benefits on nexo.io through staking. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Unclear to me. The token seems to be the work of a company called Credissimo which seems to have some presence in a few European countries. Where does exchange for the asset occur?

True! Although i would point out that there is still potential for customer demand as nexo (the token) has a terrible LTV on nexo.io. On nexo.io, the LTV seems to be ~14.5% meaning that $100 worth of nexo token secures you $14 worth of credit. We would likely be able to beat that significantly, so it stands to reason that there may still be demand from customers that are long on nexo but are looking to extract some short term liquidity from their holdings.

                    "content": "Hello MakerDao community, Happy to share today this aAAVE collateral onboarding application, Let\u2019s build more bridges and find new synergies between DeFi protocols! 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @Marczeller 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. The Aave Protocol users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (Flash Loans) fashion. The AAVE token is a governance token and the center of gravity of the Aave protocol, with the ARC/AIP process, Aave token holders are in direct control of their Aave protocol : Assets onboarding, risk parameters updates, rewards schedules among others. The Aave protocol is protected by the Aave Safety Module, a ~2B$ protection fund, managed by the AAVE stakers accepting the risk of slashing to protect the Liquidity providers of Aave and act as a layer of defense if case of a shortfall event. The aAAVE asset is a 1:1 ratio IOU token representing an AAVE deposit into AAVE. The AAVE protocol currently holds ~1.1B$ of AAVE and thus there\u2019s a ~1.1B$ circulating supply of aAAVE. As AAVE is already a MCD collateral, onboarding aAAVE will allow more composability and synergies between MakerDAO and Aave. There\u2019s a good probability that the AAVE liquidity providers would be interested in having an \u201cadditional credit line\u201d with MakerDAO and would be keen to arbitrage the premium between DAI SF and DAI Supply/Borrow rates on Aave. This proposal is also part of a larger project with StakeDAO to create a Dedicated vault to arbitrage the returns on the Curve Aave pool and the Makedao SF on ETH, AAVE and potentially aETH & aAAVE. This passive strategy Vault has the purpose to stimulate minting demand for DAI and increase liquidity in both Curve and Aave protocols. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Aave is the upgraded revamp of the fixed-term lending platform ETHLend launched in 2017. Aave deployed a decentralized Liquidity Protocol based on pooled liquidity and open-end variable and stable rates loans. Aave democratized the concept of single-transaction loans (Flash Loans) leveraging on transaction atomicity enabled by the EVM. Aave launched in early Jan 2020 and reached the 2nd position of the DeFi ecosystem at ~5B$ market size. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Our Whitepaper Our Technical Documentation Our source Code on Github Deployed contracts Audits Our Risk Framework  7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? aAAVE currently allows users to use them as collateral at a 50% LTV (65% liquidation threshold) to borrow Assets on Aave. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? aAAVE tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? aAAVE can be exchanged for AAVE at a 1:1 ratio without slippage at anytime permissionlessly via the withdraw()method of the Aave LendingPool contract and front end UI. AAVE assets are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. aAAVE being a liquid 1:1 IOU for AAVE, AAVE MakerDAO oracle can be used for this purpose Disclosure: I hold AAVE, aAAVE tokens and am a participant in Aave governance and member of the Aave Genesis Team.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-LRC-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and LRC. This token currently has $50,000,000 of liquidity spread among 100 holders total holders. The top LP controls over 97% of pool liquidity. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-LINK-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and LINK. This token currently has $95,000,000 of liquidity spread among 1600 total holders. The top holder with 32% of liquidity is Alpha finance, which likely accounts for dozens or hundreds of individual users\u2019 positions. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

UNI-V2-LINK-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided.

UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?

Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The USDC token is issued by regulated financial institutions, and backed by fully reserved assets (redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollar). USDC is governed by Centre 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? UNI-V2-DAI-USDC can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI. DAI and USDC are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing. 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. There are no regulatory restrictions for the token directly, but the underlaying asset (USDC) has a blacklisting functionality and it is regulated by USA authorities. A possible risk would be blacklisting the UNI-V2-DAI-USDC contract address which would make impossible to recover the funds within the contract. There is no precedence of USDC regulators requesting to blacklist a smart contract address and given the huge economical impact it could have for USDC holders, it is expected to be a very extreme case scenario. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. UNI-V2-DAI-USDC value can be determined based on the value of underlying assets. This said, USDC is a stablecoin also pegged to the US dollar similar to DAI, therefore it is expected that the token value only grows while it collects swap fees. Variations in DAI price (since it is the more volatile of the pair) are the major contribution to negative changes in value. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. n/a  I\u2019ve used most of the information provided previously by @monet-supply on MIP6 applications for other collaterals Would like to remark that even if the PSM could have a lower fee than Uniswap (which would make it a direct competition for swapping DAI-USDC), I would not expect that we keep that swap fee so low since it will increase our exposure to USDC directly. I would expect that in the future the tin parameter of the PSD be reverted to something like 1% (which would permit us to collect further fees and in the case that the DAI price grows again, we\u2019ll be motivated to put it back to 0.1% earning more fee in the process). Also the fact that USDC-DAI pair be collecting so much fees shows that typical users would prefer to exchange through Uniswap, plus Uniswap could use this LP as a route for other swaps which increases the swap-traffic in that LP (at the moment of writing the pool it is returning a 22% in fees based on volume in last 24 hours annualized). Adding this collateral could have a huge impact in the amount of DAI generated from it, and it\u2019ll increase the liquidity of DAI greatly which is all positive for us. ",

Just one question, to make sure I understand what you wrote.     smaugho:  However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset.   was this a copy and paste from a general LP MIP-template? Because, under the assumption that divergence loss is what used to be called imparmanent loss, there should be a predictable ~0% loss on the DAI-USDC pair (assuming the their pegs stays around 1:1usd). Or is divergence loss something different? thanks again! ",

Ampleforth is a system of synthetic commodity money, based around the AMPL token. The Ampleforth system seeks to keep the value of AMPL as close as possible to the 2019 value (purchasing power) of $1. It accomplishes this through a daily quantity rebasing process; if AMPL is trading above target price (as determined by a Chainlink AMPLUSD oracle), all AMPL balances are increased by an equal percentage, while if AMPL is trading below target all balances are reduced. AMPL quantity adjustment is non-dilutive, in that all balances change by the same percentage so each user owns an equal portion of the network before and after the daily rebase.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Ampleforth completed a private financing round before launching in June 2019 with a public token sale. Since launch, AMPL has gradually seen declining volatility of the token price to more closely track the $1 target, but the overall market cap (which is more indicative of returns due to quantity adjustments) has continued to vary widely. This past week, Ampleforth began an incentive program on the AMPL-ETH Uniswap v2 pair which may increase liquidity and demand.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/ampleforthorg Forum: https://www.ampltalk.org/app/ Telegram: Telegram: Contact @Ampleforth  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  AMPL is currently used as a form of commodity money. Due to its dynamic supply adjustment, the AMPL token has different price and quantity dynamics which may make AMPL less correlated to other crypto assets.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  AMPL is a decentralized token. No organization bears legal responsibility for AMPL.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  AMPL is traded on centralized exchanges such as KuCoin and Bitfinex, as well as decentralized platforms such as Kyber, Uniswap, and Balancer. The Ampleforth team is currently sponsoring the ETH-AMPL pool on Uniswap v2 to encourage liquidity.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  As far as I know, AMPL is not registered with regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  Centralized exchanges from (9) may offer price feeds for AMPL. AMPL supply also expands and contracts as the price deviates from the target price, so the system would need to take the daily rebasing into account.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Due to the way that AMPL quantity increases or decreases daily, it may be more complicated to add it as a collateral asset to MCD. Potentially the AMPL could be wrapped into another ERC20 with a fixed quantity and floating Token:AMPL conversion rate. Disclosure: I hold AMPL ",

I think AMPL provides a unique collateral opportunity as it is uncorrelated to other crypto assets and its own sound monetary policy would keep the value around $1. Here are a few observations: 1. Timing. While I think that AMPL is ingenious, and has a lot of potential as collateral, I do think it is necessary to assess when would be the appropriate time to enable it. The way I see it now, the project is going through explosive, early stage growth now. With a small market cap, price fluctuation is much more volatile, as there are less participants to take either side of the trade. Right now, there is an astonishing influx of players and money into the AMPL ecosystem. I\u2019ve been tracking the soaring number of active wallets and market cap. I strongly believe AMPL is here to stay, the question now is: when will it have consolidated enough to become useful collateral?  ***I would propose coming up with a multi-prong test such as: *** a) a minimum of time above a certain market cap ($1 Billion?) AND; b) a minimum of time with the price consistently around $1 (or the ability to prove that as the price fluctuates, the protocol can successfully self regulate to $1)  2. Rebase/Debase. While I believe that the unusually high coin value (closer to $3 as of the time of writing) and the resulting unusually high rebase (15%+) are a unique feature of very rapid, early stages growth, I do think it is necessary to address the challenge of using something as collateral as the supply increases or decreases automatically every 24 hours. In this regard, I think we need to employ a hybrid thinking model framework. The core of the theory is that the % change in supply can be mitigated through the Maker collateral ratio. If collateral ratio is high enough, the theory would suggest that even if the supply shrinks, the remaining AMPL tokens value would go back to 1 dollar. Hence the collateral ratio must be calculated with this remaining $ value in mind. Similarly, when collateral is pledged, regardless of the actual price of AMPL at the time, the nominal value should be of $1, as it is known and expected for the network to issue more coins over time to eventually balance around that price target. The buffer between the current price and the nominal value, plus all the resulting tokens from rebasing should provide more than adequate buffer. Final thoughts. AMPL is the only collateral options that seems uncorrelated and has the ability to stabilise itself when all other collaterals plummet. We just have to be creative in designing the appropriate requirement and processes that accomodate for this coin\u2019s unique monetary supply system. I would encourage further conversations on this topic, including a deeper exploration of the merits and concerns of the monetary supply model and the opportunities or threats for Maker that arise from it, while we monitor the (heated) price action and growth over the next few days and weeks.

Not an insurmountable issue but not exactly what you want from something that wants to be a 1:1 stablecoin. The problem is that once the AMPL peg is broken wild speculation sets in due to the mechanics of the token. The second issue I have with this kind of token is the legal framework for it - it is after all an algorithmic stablecoin. It would be preferable if the Ampleforth team could be more open about their legal efforts. ",

Different stablecoins may use different words to mark this, for example\uff1a USDC\uff1a $XXX Issued PAX\uff1a $XXX Total PAX Minted Please check the screen cap as following. usdc840\u00d7162 6.93 KB Source\uff1ahttps://www.circle.com/en/usdc pax1146\u00d7238 14.9 KB Source:https://www.paxos.com/pax/ For all crypto product and services,the first step is always difficult, with few people known and not widely accepted,and HUSD is no exception. So that\u2019s why HUSD team has been worked so hard. HUSD is still a young stablecoin, the 1st anniversary of HUSD is just coming soon.And HUSD has been very low key and put most of time to build our product and improve services. The primary goal of our team is to making HUSD stable, secure, and safe for our customers. image759\u00d7567 86.4 KB The market cap of HUSD ranked no.7 in stablecoins as of today. Stablecoin market has changed a lot in this year, we have seen a lot of emerging new comers. Now we are proud to say, although HUSD is relatively young and small, with the support of our clients, community and 3rd party ecosystem members, HUSD has grew in a fast speed in past few months. It is true that some people and institutions has noticed HUSD.This is what the HUSD ecosystem looks like as of now: image (1)975\u00d7519 67.9 KB And HUSD data is already supported by Coinmarketcap, Coingecko.Coinmetrics, DeBank, DappTotal and many other top professional 3rd party platforms. I believe you can find the liquidity and market data in these platforms. (you can check by click here) HUSD has been gradually recognized by crypto/DeFi communities, and we know we still have a lot of work to do. So that\u2019s why we choose to apply for the support of MarkerDAO community. For On-chain price oracles, we are already communicating with top oracles now, with more support from different nodes and of DeFi platforms, you will see the HUSD on-chain price soon. You are also welcome to know more about HUSD by visiting: www.stcoins.com And we are glad to see, by this communication we have introduced one more people to understand more of HUSD.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-COMP-ETH LP token is the pair consisting of ETH and COMP. This token currently has $4,000,000 of liquidity spread among 450 total holders. The top holder accounts for nearly half of pool liquidity. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

UNI-V2-COMP-ETH LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. When trading volumes are high relative to price drift, LPs can benefit from higher returns versus simply holding the individual assets. UNI-V2-COMP-ETH is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?

Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @Marczeller 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Aave is a liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (Flash Loans) fashion. The Aave protocol is protected by the Aave Safety Module, a ~2B$ protection fund, managed by the AAVE stakers accepting the risk of slashing to protect the Liquidity providers of Aave and act as a layer of defense if case of a shortfall event. The aWETH asset is a 1:1 ratio IOU token representing an wETH deposit into Aave. wETH is a ERC-20 wrapper contract for the native Asset of Ethereum : ETH The AAVE protocol currently holds ~850M$ of ETH and thus there\u2019s a ~850M$ circulating supply of aWETH. As ETH is already a MCD collateral, onboarding aWETH will allow more composability and synergies between MakerDAO and Aave. There\u2019s a good probability that the ETH liquidity providers would be interested in having an \u201cadditional credit line\u201d with MakerDAO and would be keen to arbitrage the premium between DAI SF and DAI Supply/Borrow rates on Aave. Also aWETH provide some passive income, allowing to gradually increase their collateral factor by having continuously more aWETH deposited in their vault. This proposal is also part of a larger project with StakeDAO to create a Dedicated vault to arbitrage the returns on the Curve Aave pool and the Makedao SF on ETH, AAVE and potentially aWETH & aAAVE. This passive strategy Vault has the purpose to stimulate minting demand for DAI and increase liquidity in both Curve and Aave protocols. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Aave is the upgraded revamp of the fixed-term lending platform ETHLend launched in 2017. Aave deployed a decentralized Liquidity Protocol based on pooled liquidity and open-end variable and stable rates loans. Aave democratized the concept of single-transaction loans (Flash Loans) leveraging on transaction atomicity enabled by the EVM. Aave launched in early Jan 2020 and reached the 2nd position of the DeFi ecosystem at ~5B$ market size. 4.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? aWETH currently allows users to use them as collateral at a 80% LTV (82.5% liquidation threshold) to borrow Assets on Aave. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? aWETH tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. 9.

Celsius Network Limited, English Company Number 11198050  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  The Celsius Network is a leading retail yield-generation platform for both retail and corporate users, as well as a market-leading lending provider. Celsius Network operates on a community-first mandate, aiming to return up to 80% of its revenue back to its users in the form of rewards for their crypto. Combining attractive interest rates, low fees, and a strong community, the platform has experienced considerable growth since inception with over 500K registered users and $17B in community assets held in the platform. CEL Token finds its foothold within the MakerDAO ecosystem as a collateral asset with both earning and borrowing capabilities. Due to the nature of the CEL utilities (detailed below) and our rapidly growing user base, combined with the ratio of Celsius users who choose to earn in CEL (> 58%), there is a rapidly growing demand for both CEL Token deployment and acquisition. As Celsius crosses half a million users and over $17 billion in assets, the consistent growth and traffic for CEL Token would be complemented elegantly by MakerDAO\u2019s platform, allowing Celsius and MakerDAO to establish a symbiotic relationship - empowering the users of both platforms to thrive, as well see palpable platform growth, security, and longevity for both parties. As a supplemental point, Celsius has launched an internal initiative towards financial transparency and auditability by third parties with the aim to have over 90% of our financial transactions settling on an open distributed ledger. Our goal being that any individual, regardless of if they are a Celsius user, have the ability to understand Celsius\u2019 financial position at any given time. This on-going incentive is aptly named \u201cproof of community\u201d. As a step in this direction, we will provide MakerDAO and its community with Celsius\u2019 ERC20 addresses to enable all MakerDAO users the opportunities to self-audit transactions on chain. The clarity this provides to both the community and your own internal risk assessment includes:   Close the gap on some of the information asymmetry Allow MakerDAO, its team, and the community to have visibility into the \u201cownership concentration\u201d  It is an amalgamation of both the CEL Tokenomics, the parallel growth of two industry leading platforms, as well as the ability to move forward with transparency, hand-in-hand, that we believe CEL would be a great collateral asset on MakerDAO. Additionally, Celsius is already a significant contributor to the DAI ecosystem, as we currently lend DAI against WBTC, ETH, and a slate of other assets. We eagerly look forward to continuing and expanding our involvement with the Maker community. Provide a brief history of the project.  When Celsius launched its product in June 2018, the CEL Tokens from the ICO were locked for ICO investors for 6 months, in order to stay as compliant as possible in an uncertain regulatory landscape. Additionally, the decision was made to lock all employee CEL tokens for 1 year from ICO investors unlock date. Due to a lack of clarity regarding the classification of tokens as a security, Celsius also decided to forego exchange listing for a year after product launch in compliance with Rule 144 of the securities act, and to file a form D with the US SEC. The first listing of CEL on a centralized exchange occurred in August of 2019. All of these factors presented major challenges for CEL trading and volumes. However, the choices made by the Celsius executive team also prevented the speculative trading and price manipulation common among other tokens released during this time. Though this path was uncommon and met with resistance it also protected the Celsius community and allowed the product to mature to the point of natural price support through the functionality of CEL utility and demand. As a result, today CEL has experienced steady sustained growth through organic demand and community utilization as was originally intended.

                    "content": "[wNXM] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application for Wrapped Nexus Mutual Token  Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  @monet-supply  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Nexus Mutual describes itself as a people powered alternative to insurance. Mutual members can take out coverage on a smart contract in order to protect against technical risks, or stake NXM on a smart contract in order to underwrite some of the risk of coverage in exchange for earnings. The NXM token is used both to stake on cover (which allows more customers to purchase cover and at a lower price) as well as to adjudicate claims. Nexus requires KYC for membership in the mutual, and NXM tokens are subject to a whitelist which restricts their free transfer. However, a wrapper contract (wNXM) without whitelisting functionality has been created to allow non-members to own NXM tokens. wNXM can be freely used on decentralized apps and transferred between users, and any Nexus member can redeem wNXM for NXM through the contract. NXM has a unique token model based on a bonding curve that controls issuance of NXM tokens based on the financial health of the mutual. This helps ensure that Nexus has enough funds to cover outstanding cover written, without impacting capital efficiency by having too much money on hand. NXM tokens are effectively partially backed by the Nexus Mutual capital pool, which is currently made up of ETH and some DAI. This may provide some level of price stability to the NXM token (and wNXM by extension) relative to an entirely unbacked token or one fully reliant on future cash flows.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Nexus Mutual was started in 2017. The project continued developing the protocol and legal framework until it launched on main-net in May 2019. 6 weeks after launch the initial capital had been contributed and the protocol went fully operational allowing cover to be bought. More recently the project has seen material growth, increasing the capital in the mutual from around $5m to over $60m, off the back of DeFi growth and yield farming.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/NexusMutual Telegram: Telegram: Join Group Chat Discord: Discord  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  NXM is used for mutual members for risk assessment (underwriting) purposes. By staking NXM on a cover contract, members can earn some of the fees for issuing coverage and increase the maximum coverage limits. If a claim is made, NXM holders vote to approve or deny the claim - Nexus is a discretionary mutual so there is NO OBLIGATION to pay claims, it is entirely dependent on NXM vote. NXM is also used to vote on governance proposals.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  wNXM is a decentralized token, no organization bears legal responsibility for it. NXM represents membership rights in Nexus Mutual Ltd, a company limited by guarantee in the UK. Nexus Mutual Ltd doesn\u2019t bear legal responsibility for NXM, but NXM holders have legal rights as per the Articles of Association and Rules of Nexus Mutual Ltd.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  wNXM is traded primarily on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Balancer. However, it was recently listed on Binance and is also listed on Huobi, so centralized exchange coverage seems to be increasing. NXM can be bought and sold directly with Nexus Mutual via it\u2019s bonding curve (only for members who have passed Nexus Mutual KYC).  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.

If wNXM < NXM, Nexus members can sell ETH for wNXM, unwrap it to NXM, redeem NXM for ETH, and then repeat the cycle. If the value of the capital pool is too low compared with the minimum coverage requirement (MCR) to pay for potential claims, redemptions are halted until the capital pool grows. Without the ability to redeem NXM for ETH, the second arbitrage loop above becomes infeasible, so wNXM might trade below NXM.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-GUSD-DAI LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and Gemini Dollar (GUSD). This token currently has $2,000 of liquidity spread among 2 holders. Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol Forum: https://gov.uniswap.org/ Discord: Discord  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  UNI-V2-GUSD-DAI LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. Because both DAI and GUSD are pegged to $1, depositors can earn a passive return with relatively low risk of divergence loss (impermanent loss). UNI-V2-GUSD-DAI is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The GUSD token is issued by Gemini Trust Co. Further details on GUSD can be found in the collateral application and risk assessment.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-GUSD-DAI can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI. DAI and GUSD are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. GUSD can be created or redeemed 1:1 with USD on the Gemini exchange platform.

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap uses an invariant function (x * y = k) to quote prices of asset pairs based upon the relative quantity of those assets in a liquidity pool. If the price differs from the prevailing market price, arbitrageurs are incentivized to trade against the pool to correct the price discrepancy. Any user can join a liquidity pool by depositing equal valued amounts of each asset. To incentivize users to provide liquidity, 0.3% of each trade is retained by the pool as a fee, increasing the underlying token balances of all participating LPs. However, being an LP is not without risk, as the pool will programmatically buy assets as the price falls or sell as the price appreciates. This leads to a phenomena known as \u201cdivergence loss\u201d, where larger price moves cause LP tokens to underperform versus a benchmark of simply holding 50% of each asset. The UNI-V2-DAI-PAX LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and Paxos Standard USD (PAX). This token currently has $20 of liquidity with only a single LP (yours truly  ). Uniswap v2 pool contracts are mostly permissionless and non-upgradable. However, UNI governance has the ability to activate a 0.05% protocol level swap fee (reducing swap fees received by LPs from 0.3% to 0.25%) after a 180 day timelock, which could make participating as a Uniswap LP less economical. Uniswap\u2019s contracts have been audited and are among the most battle tested of any application, but it is possible that an undiscovered flaw could lead to loss of funds.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Uniswap was first deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on November 2, 2018. On May 18, 2020, Uniswap v2 was launched. Liquidity increased sharply beginning in late August when Sushiswap began incentivizing deposits. The UNI governance token was launched in September, partly in response to liquidity migrating to Sushiswap, and incentives helped Uniswap regain primacy in decentralized exchange liquidity. Incentives have now ended as of November 17, 2020, and it\u2019s unclear if/when they will be reinstated.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol Forum: https://gov.uniswap.org/ Discord: Discord  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  UNI-V2-DAI-PAX LP tokens allow users to deposit equal values of the two constituent assets and earn trading fees proportional to their liquidity provided. Both assets track USD, so depositors can earn from trading fees with relatively low risk of impermanent loss. UNI-V2-DAI-PAX is not currently integrated with other defi apps.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  UNI LP tokens are permissionless assets, with no legal issuer or freeze/blacklisting functionality. The PAX token is Paxos Trust. Further details can be found in the collateral application and risk assessment.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  UNI-V2-DAI-PAX can be exchanged for its underlying constituents permissionlessly via the Uniswap v2 contracts and front end UI. DAI and PAX are traded on a wide variety of decentralized and centralized exchange venues. Users can also mint or redeem PAX for USD directly via the Paxos platform.

But we should probably add support for Curve LPs as well, the main blockers I see are most Curve pools have USDT exposure or lending protocol exposure which increases risk. One other benefit of Uniswap pools is they provide more liquidity for DAI when it is trading off peg. Curve has lots of liquidity around 1:1 ratio, but a side effect is much greater slippage for stablecoin trades when the pool is unbalanced. So Uniswap LPs with DAI can serve as a backstop in these cases. ",

Uniswap is a decentralized protocol that allows for permissionless asset exchange and passive market making. Uniswap has been covered extensively in other collateral onboarding apps. Here are some links relevant to the specific pool The UNI-V2-DAI-USDT LP token is the pair consisting of DAI and USDT. This token currently has $9,867,884 of liquidity across 212 holders at the moment of writing this post (Jan 1, 2020). USDT is the 3rd most liquid token on uniswap at time of writing. Itself having $181,423,852 in exchange liquidity. It is the also 3rd most liquid DAI swap (at least among semi reputable tokens) only after ETH and USDC 3. Provide a brief history of the project.

I don\u2019t know that I totally agree with the fact that USDC is \u201cfar less risky\u201d however. The fist thing to consider there is the DAO\u2019s total exposure to USDC ATM. Currently at about $500MM. That is pretty much the entire MKR marketcap, so if we are ever unable to liquidate our USDC holdings for some reasonable fraction of their current value we could be in real trouble. As far as the regulatory concerns go. If there is a stablecoin \u201ccrackdown\u201d coming I would doubt that USDC manages to come out unscathed in that environment, so based on that I would argue that the regulatory risks already exist and in a big way and that increasing our exposure by a few million through USDT-DAI doesn\u2019t change things much because it is already so large nominally. On the flip side of this though the liquidity yield is ~1000 bps higher than the yield for DAI-ETH. Based on that i would think a potential DAI-USDT vault could be able to charge significantly higher SF and help grow on-chain liquidity in that pair. ",

Balancer is a decentralized exchange that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens, custom allocations and fees. Traders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. BAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals. BAL also receives preferential treatment in the Balancer exchange liquidity mining program.  Provide a brief history of the project.  Balancer was co-founded by Mike McDonnald and Fernando Martinelli in 2019. Balancer Labs held a seed round in March 2020 and launched the exchange to the public. Liquidity and usage grew substantially after Balancer began offering BAL reward distributions to liquidity providers, with total value locked in their contracts currently over $1 billion.  Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.

BAL is the governance token of Balancer Exchange. It is used in governance voting (primarily concerning modifications to the liquidity mining program. BAL has recently been given a few advantages in the liquidity program, including a \u201cBAL factor\u201d where any liquidity with BAL is more heavily weighted for rewards, as well as \u201cBAL liquidity staking\u201d where 31% of total rewards are reserved for liquidity between BAL and the most important defi tokens (including ETH). Any BAL deposited in liquidity pools is also counted for voting weight purposes.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  No, Balancer Exchange and the BAL token are decentralized. Balancer Labs is a privately held company which created Balancer v1 and is still heavily involved in directing the project.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  Most BAL liquidity is on Balancer itself, but BAL is also traded on centralized exchanges including Binance, FTX, and OKEx.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  I am not aware of any publicly available legal opinions addressing the project or token\u2019s regulatory standing.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  None as far as I\u2019m aware.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  Centralized exchanges from (9) may offer price feeds.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  n/a Disclosure: I hold BAL. ",
