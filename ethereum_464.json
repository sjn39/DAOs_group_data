This has the added bonus of this providing a discussions-to  In summary, ERC902: Token Validation is a standard for sharable, chainable, #erc-1066 compatible, on-chain token validation. It has applications for security tokens (ex. #erc-1400), NFTs, \u201crestricted\u201d ERC20s, shared or maintainable whitelists, the full decentralization of control behaviour to a clear on-chain process, and so on.
