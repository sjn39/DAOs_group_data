Here is a fun little visual overview of how we\u2019ve represented that mission. (Many of these can be independently viewed on archive.org or google images.)  2017 In 2017, we stated our mission as Push Open Source Forward.

And also this launch  article that I somehow got published in Forbes (today we get free press because of our impact - back then no one was writing about us unless i worked hard to get their attention!):   2018  In 2018, we evolved it to focus more on Open Source.  This was a recognition that open source didnt need a \u201cpush\u201d.  It needed to grown - cultivated, like a garden.   You start to see more tree/plant based iconography during this era. (hey btw did you know that classic gitcoin tees are still for sale??!?)  mockup-d4062753_1200x12001000\u00d71000 77.7 KB   2019 In 2019, during the great bear, we focused on articulating our view of the world + what web3 could do.

As our momentum has grown, we\u2019ve cartographied the territory more, & our hearts have opened further, it has even expanded from Open Source to other public goods. This is a progression I see: From Open Source Funding > Open Source Funding & Public Goods Funding > Funding Public Goods as a means to create Human Thriving I also see a progression from Kevin aritculates our mission/values => Other Internet helps us articulate our mission/values with Gitcoin Holdings => GitcoinDAO articulates its mission/values through its own means. I\u2019d be curious how else the community would like to see this mission articulated into the future.a ",
