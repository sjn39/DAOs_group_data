Gamma Strategies is an active liquidity manager on Uniswap v3 and creates an ERC-20 wrapper around its managed positions by interacting directly with the Uniswap v3 core contracts. This collateral type is an LP token representing user-deposited assets and the trading fees accrued from providing those assets on Uniswap v3. This MIP6 application\u2019s Greenlight Poll is scheduled to go live on Monday, September 5th.  Join us  Join us 2022-08-30T15:00:00Z as we host:  Brian @BP33 from Gamma Strategies Vick @mountainvick from Gamma Strategies   If you\u2019re unable to attend this call but have questions, submit any questions for the AMA on this forum post and our hosts will have them addressed during the session.  Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by Gamma Strategies Community Q&A   [MIP6]: [UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC] MIP6   Asset Information 7. How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (e.g. financial claims, dividends, governance rights) The asset is used as a receipt token given for providing liquidity on Uniswap v3. It gives the holders financial rights to his or her portion of the underlying assets and fees returned from providing liquidity. Gamma LP tokens are ERC-20 and are minted to users who deposit the base assets (WBTC & renBTC) of the LP pair into the position manager contract called the Hypervisor. The Gamma WBTC/renBTC LP token will be concentrated +/- 20 ticks from a renBTC / WBTC price of 1. (0.9980021 - 1.0020019). In ticks, this would be a lower tick of -20 to upper tick of +20. Upon a 5% threshold amount of fees collected from the position, the position will automatically rebalance in the same lower and upper ticks. Given the rapid redemption available for both assets back into BTC, the price should not diverge much from parity. 8. What is the market cap for the asset? The market cap for the WBTC-renBTC LP token would be a function of the marketcaps of WBTC and renBTC. As of August 11, 2022, the market cap of WBTC is 5.9B and the market cap of renBTC is $77.4M according to CoinGecko. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume and order book depth. The Gamma WBTC/renBTC LP token can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time. 10. Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)? The LP token is settled on chain (trustless) 12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type The same oracle that is used for wBTC and renBTC can be used, with the weights according to percentages in the Gamma position. These weights can change based on price movements.   When Time in your local-timezone format: 2022-08-30T15:00:00Z Mark it on your Google Calendar!

Is Gamma Strategies currently deploying any other deterministically managed contracts today? 27:24 - PaperImperium: Can you walk us through what liquidation looks like? 28:24 - PaperImperium: Is there a specific debt ceiling needed? The TVL on Gamma is quite low, so I would assume even a modest debt ceiling is useful? 29:33 - PaperImperium: Is that redemption permissionless? Or does a keeper need to be whitelisted with you ahead of time 30:35 - Retro: Are there any other implementation steps either from the Gamma side or something that you have already addressed within the MakerDAO process that would be for consideration?
