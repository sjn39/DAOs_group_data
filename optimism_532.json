The daily transaction volume and user count showed that Optimism outperformed Arbitrum. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the level of participation during the Quest was remarkable. Specifically, projects that participated in the quest (Kwenta, Pika Protocol, Rubicon, Velodrome, Synapse Protocol) succeeded in making a lot of traction from Optimism users. Our analysis can be found in our dashboard here: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism Comparison: Transaction Tendency and DEX Volumes Points that should be addressed The effect of the quest did not last long where we witnessed the sharp decline in the network activation right after the event. Please take a look at the below figures: number of daily transactions per day with more than 10,000 transactions and number of daily transactions.  dapp_activation.2061\u00d7597 90.7 KB   transaction_decline1246\u00d7369 37.4 KB  Future Direction Although the transaction volume has decreased now, what if we prepare for the next phase? What if we think about ways that the Optimism Quest could help activate optimism more sustainably and in the long term? And if we propose a Quest based on that, we may be able to make the next phase more successful. Ways to do this include:  Conducting a protocol survey that helped Optimism grow as an L2 layer and targeting a quest to accomplish this Designing quests that align with the direction Optimism is heading, such as TVL, Dex Volume, NFT Volume, etc.  Would you be interested in analyzing and discussing these areas to help design the next step of the Quest?

Even though the Optimism team might have a clear idea about the next quests, community members can take part to gather collective intelligence about how to design the next steps for the Optimism quest.

                    "content": "Note: I work at OP Labs, but making this comment in my personal capacity Hey, awesome to see more analyses on Optimism & thanks for sharing here! We\u2019ve historically seen that programs like quests can get overrun by sybil attacks and massive farming operations (qualitatively, this was observed during Optimism Quests as well). So if the total usage number is known to be skewed, a large off drop post-quests should be expected. The stated purpose of the program was to \u201cmake Optimism more accessible for both new & experienced users.\u201d So, comparing usage in the post-quest period versus the pre-quest period could get us closer to measuring the impact. The Optimism Quests - App Growth on Optimism After Quests  dashboard takes this approach. In the 30-days post-quests, we saw a +47% growth in all Optimism transactions post-quests vs pre-quests, and +100% growth among apps such as Pooltogether, Granary, Rubicon, Beethoven X, and more. While this still isn\u2019t a ~perfect measure, I think the time-period selection gets us closer to a quality read. ~Early insights were shared here, but ideas for next steps could include benchmarking this against overall L2/L1 usage growth. It\u2019s still unclear if quests had an impact, or if this growth would\u2019ve happened anyway.  image2980\u00d7960 266 KB  Other scattered notes:   For raw transaction count, I recommend filtering out system addresses (labels.system_addresses table - example query using this). Optimism has a system transaction ~every L1 block, Arbitrum has one ~every L2 block (Optimism will have this in Bedrock). So, raw transactions can be a skewed indicator for L2s if the goal is to measure \u201cuser activity\u201d.   Glad to see you used our queries & project tagging tables! Dune also has a \u201cfork\u201d function, which may help readers attribute queries back to the original source if that\u2019s desired for you all.   Definitely happy to provide feedback if you all continue with these kinds of analyses! ",

Dune also has a \u201cfork\u201d function, which may help readers attribute queries back to the original source if that\u2019s desired for you all.   First of all, I apologize that my previous queries were not written under \"fork\"ed query. Even if I wrote in the text widget that those queries were forked from yours, it is my mistake. I mistakenly confused that those queries were written under the \u2018forked\u2019 setting  (Other queries for the pie chart were written under the forked query and correctly shows the source of the code). I revised the query and you can see the changes in my dashboard.   For raw transaction count, I recommend filtering out system addresses (labels.system_addresses table - example query using this). Optimism has a system transaction ~every L1 block, Arbitrum has one ~every L2 block (Optimism will have this in Bedrock). So, raw transactions can be a skewed indicator for L2s if the goal is to measure \u201cuser activity\u201d.   Thank you for the advice!

Evaluating the impact of the Quest It seems that in the twitter post and the associated Dune dashboard you shared in your reply, the activity level is compared between two periods: before 2022-09-19 and after 2023-01-18. Considering that the overall atmosphere in crypto industry has changed a lot in 2023, we should filter out the external effects (overall expectation of the public on token prices, yield demands, overall liquidities and \u2026 etc) To filter out the effects from external sources, we could design a comparative analysis on several aspects similar to clinical studies (acutally, I have some background in medical researches). Only with comparison on various aspects, we can enhance the probability that we can correctly assess the impact of the quest. I just brainstormed the analysis direction but each requires sophisticated design process.  comparing the growth with other L2 layers comparing the growth with L1 layers comparing the activities (pre/post Quest) of addresses between two groups: who already used Optimism before the event vs who just started using Optimism during the Quest  In evaluating the impact, I will look for some statistical techniques that can wipe out the effect from external sources. Furthermore, the changes should be observed for short-term and longitudinal basis to correctly understand the characteristics of the Quest\u2019s impact on Optimism. Determining the future direction I perfectly agree with your statement that the quest is successful in terms of \u201cmake Optimism more accessible for both new & experienced users.\u201d. First of all, however, as I stated in the \u201cEvaluating the impact of the Quest\u201d, we should assess the impact in a more sophisticated/various aspects with longitudinal observations. Another point I want emphasize in this post is that we should discuss \u201cwhether we can elaborate or further develop the purpose based on the retrospect on the Quest\u201d. As we witnessed that the Quest have powerful impact on attracting user\u2019s engagement, with more elaborate purpose and strategies, I believe we can utlize such event as one of the powerful fuel to drive the Optimism growth. This is the point I want to discuss in the governance post. Thank you posting your feedback and really nice inputs. I hope to listen about about thoughts on the above issues! ",

However, I believe that the foundation knows what they are doing and future iterations will compensate real users who completed the quest. Besides airdrops, incentives can also come from being part of a collective that extracts value from the real world and not just from a temporary investment ",
