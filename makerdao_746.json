The idea behind WrapUp is to save time both for community managers and server members as it\u2019s hard to be on top of everything in servers where hundreds or thousands of messages are sent every day. MakerDAO Discord has lots of members and it\u2019s often hard to be on top of everything. We would like to to test WrapUp on MakerDAO Discord and help everyone be better informed about relevant stuff going on inside the server. Feel free to check it out and give feedback. I\u2019ve talked to Discord admins and we can support MakerDAO server if there is sufficient interest from the community. WrapUp Beta is available here: https://wrapup.ai ",
