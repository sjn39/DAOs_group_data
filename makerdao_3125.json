                    "content": "Happy new year everyone! The DAO Autonomous Group has been growing a lot since its inception. We now have 10 members actively working to move towards the decentralized future of Maker. As our responsibilities have been scaling up, so have our bills. So far the Foundation has been able to cover most things through the grants program, but with the introduction of the community-led PSM we are now racking up costs which need to be covered. We believe it is time to take the next step towards the DAO funding operation of the protocol. The DAO Autonomous Group proposes setting up a Gnosis multi-sig wallet for the end of the month owned by all mandated domain facilitators who opt-in. As of right now this would include:  @LongForWisdom @Primoz  By the end of the month there are potentially 3 more candidates to join the multi-sig:  @SebVentures @juan @hexonaut  We propose running this as a (N - 1) of N multi-sig so you need the signatures of 1 less than all the owners. We will also be whitelisting governance with full authority over the wallet, so they can take the funds back at any time. This allows us to keep a conservative threshold for fund distribution as there is no risk due to key loss. The Autonomous DAO group will keep public records of when and why funds are distributed. The DAO will also return any remaining funds if the number of signatories drops below 3. To get things started we propose an initial budget of 100k DAI to cover previous expenses (~50k mostly for the PSM audit) as well as give us some budget for January and February. For perspective this is less than 2 days of protocol revenue at current numbers. We will be preparing a formal MIP in parallel as well to cover how funds are allocated on an ongoing basis. In the event the MIP fails the remainder of the 100k DAI will be returned to the surplus buffer, and another strategy will be devised. There is also a 1 year expiry in which the funds will also be returned.     Yes, I want to proceed with this plan with 100k DAI Yes, I want to proceed with this plan, but 100k DAI is too much No, I do not want to proceed with this plan Abstain     0 voters     This poll will be run for 2 weeks closing on Tuesday, January 19th which can be extended if there is significant controversy or discussion. If this poll passes then it will proceed to an on-chain governance vote for the week of February 1st to give time to confirm who the domain facilitators are. If the governance vote passes then the following executive will include a vat.suck() to move 100k DAI from the surplus buffer to the multi-sig. ",

You are saying  that 100k should be enough, so let\u2019s go for this, but this should probably be increased soon. But again it also depend on what this budget is for.  So waiting to know more.     MakerMan:  Also N-1 probably not ideal as if two are lost for any time this means funds are locked. Improbable to be sure but I would go for N-2 at least (which won\u2019t work with < 3) with 2 it means one person authorizes. I\u2019d say get a larger group (5 and do N-2). In 1Hive swarms (DAOs themselves) basically use majority of quorum (quorum decided by holding non-transferrable swarm tokens).   Also agree with this.  N-1 doesn\u2019t give a lot of flexibility. Maybe we can start like that and change it latter. but N-2 seems better to move quickly. Especially if multisig holders live on different time zones. ",

Yeah.  I was there with you on the MIP to authorize DAI transfers - seems so long ago.  So now with Foundation pretty much riding off into the sunset you and the few others here are having to bootstrap the entire DAO from scratch.   Why I think doing a MIP for some real funds beyond 100K is probably desirable.   I honestly would support up to 500K given that is earned in what 2 weeks now. I would urge you and primoz to get your team of 5 and put together a .3-5Mish proposal with some basics laid out.   As a MKR holder I am very supportive of this.   We risk millions every day it is time we start using some of those millions being earned to get the true MakerDAO off the ground.  I expect a real budget will be in the 1-2M/yr (really higher for entire DAO functions) and I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d trust more than yourself to see those funds managed with prudence and as much transparency as possible.     LongForWisdom:  I also think that the 100k starting amount will need to be added to in the near future, but we felt it was important to start small to maintain trust rather than saying something along the lines of \u2018we want 500k to cover the next 3-6 months worth of potential expenses.\u2019   The above is exactly why I would agree to doing more.   Honestly put at least a rough idea of budget for at least 3 months (ideally 6) together.  If it is reasonable and includes at least a small component to pay someone to provide transparent updates as to spending and quality assurance I think we would find significant support.   I\u2019d rather your group get more than ample funding to start and hazard losing 50K (what 20hrs of Maker earnings) to something than to short change you guys and cause headaches in the effort to find and retain key people. This was needed 6 months ago, even more so now. ",

I think it is time that MakerDAO finally start getting its act together beyond the Foundation here.   You already have other stuff coming up (PSM for other stablecoins, UI, documentation).  These will require audits.  MakerDAO is going to need money to secure 3 auditors (would really love if lev wanted to be a paid 4th btw as he seems to have a good handle on the protocol from a security sense).   Literally I can see 50K not covering the above and something more like 150K being needed. I am going to urge one last time.   Get at least a 3 month and preferrably a 6 month budget up for MIP vote with a list of line items with tentative budgets.   There is no reason to pass 3 or more MIPs through governance when we can do this with one.   Maker needs to grow up a bit here in a DAO sense and I am confident the players in charge of these funds will make sure they are put to good use. We are definitely going to need work accounting, and auditing so I expect at least 10% of whatever funds to go to efforts in that regard.   500K here to kick start the next 6 months of autonomous MakerDAO given this is now a 1B project really isn\u2019t that much.  Right now this is like 2 weeks of protocol profits. ",

Thanks for the explanation. I don\u2019t support more work on PSM except for the minimal maintenance. The interested parties could fund the integration of \u201ctheir\u201d coins. The MakerDAO system gets nothing from including dozens of small cap coins in the short term. PSM is a nice experiment and a showcase but it does not solve any major issue (although time will tell). I\u2019m also not much enthusisatic about the governance rewards. The circumstances changed. The gas price is not getting cheaper and it prevents many rewards to be claimed. When you add the costs of claiming rewards, approving, voting (poll), voting (exec), trading, anonymizing?.. - it\u2019s just not worth it. My list of unclaimed rewards, interest, coins, even abandoned deposits just gets bigger. Maybe the whales would be interested in such rewards - if we get 3x more whales (100 MKR+) voting - that would be a real success. BTW, the good way to get some money would be to start charging for the oracles. I\u2019d vote immediately for a 200k budget for that purpose.
