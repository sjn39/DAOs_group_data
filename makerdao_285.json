                    "content": "Ever since the Gorton & Zhang paper in July, the regulatory discussion about stablecoins has thankfully narrowed to just those that are \u201cconvertible to fiat.\u201d This shift in legislative and regulatory focus was also apparent in private conversations, and cemented by the recent publication of proposed legislative changes and regulatory oversight for stablecoins by the President\u2019s Working Group, FDIC, and OCC. This trend has also been reflected in publications out of the ECB and BIS. To me, it appears that the term \u201cstablecoin\u201d is used very differently within government circles, and implicitly or explicitly excludes Maker and DAI. Just as Maker is not a bank (and the burdens that come with that title), DAI is perhaps best described as something other than a stablecoin (now that stablecoin-specific regulation is being advanced). When speaking with lawmakers or officials, what are some alternatives we can uses besides stablecoin \u2014 now that it appears likely DAI will escape burdensome regulation that is being advocated for our competitors? I think it\u2019s clear DAI is not \u201calgorithmic\u201d \u2014 both in fact and in that regulators are aware those exist and have suggested they will get to them in due course. So\u2026 what are some good alternative colloquialisms to use in place of \u201cstablecoin?\u201d Something informal and without immediately associating Maker/DAI with impending regulations.

Ever since Facebook has first announced their stablecoin plans in 2019, Maker has been dragged into the never-ending discussion on how we are different if the product (= \u201cstablecoin\u201d) is purportedly the same. Right now, according to my observations in the US, EU and other places (including international initiatives like FATF), the following potential triggers for stablecoin regulations are being proposed:   \u201cStablecoin\u201d maintains a stable value relative to a specified asset, especially fiat currency   \u201cStablecoin\u201d is redeemable for / convertible to fiat currency   \u201cStablecoin\u201d is used as means of payment (this exact point seems to bother policymakers most, as this is where stablecoins may become competition to fiat, including CBDCs)   Maker cannot do much about no. 1 as long as Dai is soft-pegged to USD (or other fiat currency). It seems that this is already a globally adopted definition of a \u201cstablecoin\u201d. This is however a very broad definition which\u2014as we can see already\u2014may not be actually used as a regulatory category for the first wave of stablecoin regulations. The focus is rather on no. 2 and 3 stablecoins. Dai is surely not no. 2, and I would even say that it is not no. 3 in terms of retail adoption (when compared to traditional payment options). Maker should focus on pursuing the narrative that while Dai is a stablecoin within the meaning of no. 1, the new regulatory frameworks should not not apply / are not appropriate due to lack of no. 2 and 3 characteristics. If there is a good new term which could help convey this message, that would be helpful for sure. ",

We always used to talk about \u201cdecentralized and collateralized\u201d (we wrote a fairly extensive blog on this which unfortunately didn\u2019t see the light of day), to distinguish Dai from fiat-backed stablecoins and algorithmic currencies (which have tended not to work too well anyway - a good reason not to go there). Aside from grabbing the thesaurus (stablecoin, levelcoin, inertcoin, snoozecoin, etc) and describing what Dai does, another approach is looking at what it\u2019s for. E.g. calling it a \u201cpayment currency\u201d, \u201cpayment asset\u201d, \u201ctransactional asset\u201d etc, because it serves money\u2019s purposes of being a means of exchange and unit of account. I\u2019d want to describe it as something like a \u201cdecentralized/trustless, collateralized payment asset\u201d, or just \u201ctrustless payment asset\u201d perhaps.
