The purpose of this alliance is to solidify the partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder where we can work together to enable DAOs to succeed.  Motivation Gitcoin and Wonder are pursuing aligned missions. Gitcoin\u2019s mission is to build & fund the open web; Wonder is building the necessary tools to facilitate thriving projects on the open web. Wonder\u2019s task management system allows DAOs to intuitively organize projects, pay contributors with their native token, and onboard new members with ease. Gitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, it would allow for:  Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder  Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the \u2018DAO tooling\u2019 space.  Background on Wonder Wonder was founded by Andros (Kernel Block 4), Adam, and 0xtocqueville to help empower builders with the tools they need to change the world for the better. We believe in an intentional approach to crafting the future of work and play. In just over two months Wonder has launched their private alpha and grown into a community with over 11,000 members and 45,000 people on their waitlist. Wonder has been collaborating proactively with impactful DAO partners for their alpha launch. Highlights and examples of purposeful collaborations include:  Helping Unchain DAO\u2019s coordination efforts to raise $4m USD in humanitarian aid for Ukrainian civilians. Onboarding and partnering with Developer DAO to establish a standard around credentialing for work/tasks in web3. Onboarding and partnering with Radicle to establish best practices around streaming payments via drips. Onboarding and working with Orca protocol to bring pod membership and fine-grained permissions around multisig on chain.   Specification The passing of this proposal would transfer 100,000 GTC to 0x231F77F0c4D7a9F2E20767c7B76ae745A6c547f9, Wonder\u2019s specified Treasury address. On the launch of Wonder\u2019s token, 2,500,000 $WONDER would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin\u2019s multisig address. In addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder\u2019s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder. Use of Funds To ensure long term alignment, Wonder will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.

This partnership is essentially us taking part in Wonder\u2019s governance but that isn\u2019t clear. This means that we will be taking on responsibilities without clarity. What\u2019s explained is that there\u2019ll be \u2018spartan council\u2019 style governance but who\u2019s gonna be on the council/threshold to be on the council? Why didn\u2019t you approach this from a grants perspective instead? Initiating a token swap is more complex and Gitcoin could also write proposals on Wonder\u2019s eventual discourse too Wonder\u2019s treasury has ~260k USD (15k USDC, 200k in AAVE?), the ask is 100k GTC which is at least 500k USD in value, essentially tripling Wonder\u2019s current treasury. also, 500k USD would now be 2.5% of the mcap, thereby making Wonder\u2019s new token mcap to be 200M. That\u2019s quite a fair bit!  Hope to hear some responses please! Thank you for the proposal ",

As mentioned we\u2019d like to take the approach outlined by Index Coop and Synthetix where token holders get to vote who is on the council or leaders with their pods. These will likely be people in our community and core team. Token swaps ensure more aligned interests in our opinion and we want to work with Gitcoin on our governance structure as well! I think the token market cap would be 24M (2.5% excluding the 1% aqueduct) if I\u2019m not mistaken. We actually have more funds in fiat - that is just our crypto treasury for now.

Because this is a tokenswap, the questions raised here by @monet-supply might also be worth looking into and responding to, setting up a vesting contract seems like a good idea. I will probably abstain from voting because I am not sure Gitcoin is actually a \u2018DAO of DAOs\u2019 or should be one. It is good to bring diversity in our treasury but would prefer we pass more tokenswaps only after we have a full-time treasury manager onboard. (work in progress) ",

What\u2019s been achieved by the team so far is telling and I absolutely see the alignment between GD and Wonder. I would suggest and support a slightly lower allocation of 50,000 GTC to begin with. This is mainly  because I do believe us taking the time to flesh out our policies for 100k+ mutual grants is important. It is a key piece in strategy moving forward as I feel it ensures the right flow for diversification and cross DAO collaboration. Should this level work, I would happily see this moving forward. ",

                    "content": "First, congratulations for Wonder team on the project and I hope you a lot of success. DAO toolings are definitely super needed and I hope we can see more of them in the future. Having said that, here are some weird red flags for me:  You are asking $800k dollars to be invested in a token that doesn\u2019t exist yet. We have no way to properly know how to define the market price of such token and I don\u2019t think Gitcoin should be in such early stages of buying pre-market tokens. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a white paper somewhere that defines how the token governance will work, but until you have it live on main net, these are no guarantees  The project page has no links to the working app. In fact the only two links on the project page are one asking my phone number to be on the \u201cwaitlist\u201d and another to join the discord. Why are you collecting phone numbers and not addresses? Are doing some analytics on phone numbers? I have bad associations with phone numbers and crypto projects: they remind me of stolen SIM cards, 2fa hacks, phone spams, country blocking etc. I find that GitHub and twitter should be much better tools for sybil protection.  It seems you have a private beta. I\u2019ve even seen some videos on YouTube of a working product. But I am extremely skeptical of projects that I haven\u2019t used, as there are tons of little details that make or break the experience. The fact that the project seems huge and complicated doesn\u2019t help my fears. I work for ENS DAO and was recently considering using Colony as a tool for our working groups: instead of asking the DAO to put money, I set up my own colony, with my own funds and started paying people out of it. My experience was a bit turn off and I had to shut down the project and will wait a few more months before judging if it\u2019s a good tool for ENS. Same here: I don\u2019t know if Wonder is a good tool for Gitcoin and believe we should test before committing such large amounts of money.  No GitHub. Where\u2019s the project? Sure, maybe you want to have a limited amount of users in your private beta not to overload your servers with early success. But why can\u2019t I fork and run it on my own? Are you afraid someone will steal your ideas (!)? So in short:  If this is an investment proposal, I don\u2019t believe Gitcoin is an early stage investment firm and we don\u2019t have the tools to judge the investment potential of pre-launch tokens. If this is a collaboration proposal, I don\u2019t see how we can commit to use your tools if they are not accessible for everyone to use If this is about supporting DAO toolings, then I don\u2019t see any evidence that your code is open source which would be a requirement for me.

We\u2019re in the process of doing a security audit for our backend to be open-sourced!  As @Pop pointed out we\u2019d love to change the proposal to 50k GTC in exchange for 1.5% of our treasury (as well as 1% to Aqueduct). We\u2019re actually not interested in $ but forming a long term collaboration as our missions of helping public good projects make for a perfect collaboration.  Forgive us, our landing page is 6 months old. Phone numbers were also the way that we thought gave us the best sybil resistance since we didn\u2019t want people to enter their emails. Twitter would have been better! We\u2019re in the process of updating our landing page right now to be more reflective of what we do.  Our long term vision is to be an open platform where anyone can launch a project, but we\u2019re in private alpha because we want to be intentional about the partners that we work with initially and provide more dedicated support. We actually created a workspace for members of the Gitcoin core team who have seen/used the product and gave their stamp of approval. In addition, Gitcoin-related/funded projects such as Developer DAO, Unchained DAO, and Orca are currently using the platform. We would love to hop on a call with you or the whole community to show/use the product and answer more questions.

An $800k early-stage token swap didn\u2019t really seem to me what Gitcoin DAO should be focused on directing funds to. A smaller amount to foster long term collaboration is something I can be supportive of though I think in anticipation of future similar proposals, it\u2019s worth Stewards discussing how we feel about Gitcoin DAO directing treasury funds into early-stage projects as this feels different to me than standard treasury diversification (moving some funds into more stable or liquid assets) I think it\u2019s also worth a discussion among Stewards on meta-governance if we have the proper structures/processes in place for it and if this is what we want to dedicate resources to.

There are many positive aspects to this partnership, very well articulated by @andros. I acknowledge all of the pros, I\u2019m just not convinced enough that they balance the cons. As mentioned by @linda, funding early-stage projects is a different activity than treasury diversification. A token swap can have other purposes, like solidifying an incubation process or expanding an existing partnership. As many people mentioned here, GD doesn\u2019t have processes in place to incubate early-stage projects (while Gitcoin has a long history of funding such projects through grants). Unless I missed it, it has never been an approved strategy with associated policy, structure, and budget. I understand and approve of the usefulness of having meta-delegates, but it sounds like a rushed and ad hoc measure that covers only a small part of what such activity would entail. My main concern is that the proposal would set apart Wonder from other projects supported by grants (or not supported at all). There are so many new open source projects for DAO tooling right now (Dework, Charmverse, Otterspace, Crew3, Station, etc.). I\u2019m concerned about the unintended and unforeseen consequences that may result from forming a special relationship with one of them without the justification of an existing and successful partnership, or the existence of a seed investment program.

My biggest issue is understanding if being part of this is in scope of Gitcoin DAO? If so, thats cool, and we should get a group together around it, and it\u2019s not a bad move, Metacartel and ETHDenver do this sort of work for their ecosystem incubating Kernal projects could be an awesome move towards making Gitcoin DAO regenerative while also supporting the ecosystem\u2026 but I doubt making a full DAO vote for every move would be the way to go for that.

Just to be clear, this is not an investment, but a partnership like the ones previously passed with Developer DAO and Prime DAO. With this partnership, we want to build tooling that GitcoinDAO uses and closely work with GitcoinDAO to improve our platform in a way that specifically serves the needs of the DAO as well as Gitcoin funded projects. We also want to help those in Kernel better collaborate on their projects since Wonder was actually started in KB4. Specifically, this would be tooling that:  Helps onboard new contributors and gives context to work that needs to be done in the GitcoinDAO Makes it easier to pay Gitcoin contributors for tasks/bounties and through retroactive/recurring payments Sets up more nuanced permissioning and token gating around who can create/review tasks Helps create better task workflows within the DAO across the different working groups Enables contributors to build up their web3/on chain profile (we\u2019re part of DAOStar where we help build standards around credentialing). Helps Kernel fellows build their projects in public and invite other fellows to collaborate on those projects.  In addition, 1% of our treasury will also be dedicated towards aqueduct to help improve the aqueduct technology as well as to ensure part of the funding of Wonder projects flows back into the Gitcoin ecosystem. This is why we think this is more of a partnership, not an investment. Happy to attend the Steward\u2019s meeting or set up a separate call/meeting to discuss more! ",

                    "content": "I agree with @philh and @griff (against this proposal) here are some reasons: From the Motivation, I am not convinced.     andros:  Gitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, it would allow for:  Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder  Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the \u2018DAO tooling\u2019 space.   Wonder provides DAO tooling to GitcoinDAO, but at the same time, the DAO tools are not only for GitcoinDAO. So from this partnership, what benefits for GitcoinDAO? From my view, the partnership should be positive sum (or multiple wins), but from this proposal, I didn\u2019t see many benefits for GitcoinDAO.     andros:  this would be tooling that:   Helps onboard new contributors and gives context to work that needs to be done in the GitcoinDAO [Bob] agree this, so what are the characteristics  for new contributors, how could they benefit GitcoinDAO?

                    "content": "As it relates to the concerns brought up by @bobjiang, the way I see it is:     bobjiang:  what benefits for GitcoinDAO?   This proposal gives Gitcoin the ability to shape the direction of this DAO tool to more closely match the needs of the Gitcoin community.     bobjiang:  From my view, the partnership should be positive sum (or multiple wins), but from this proposal, I didn\u2019t see many benefits for GitcoinDAO.   The partnership is positive sum in the sense that it helps Wonder to have GitcoinDAO in its network, and it helps GitcoinDAO to have stakes in Wonder since that implies a say in the direction of a DAO tool that is already serving large DAOs and making them more efficient. This will make Wonder more decentralized and transparent by bringing the Gitcoin community to it, and it will make Gitcoin more efficient and productive since the Wonder team will start building features that specifically fit GitcoinDAO\u2019s needs.   Another good illustration of the positive sum nature of this collaboration is that 1% of the Wonder treasury will be dedicated to quadratic funding of Gitcoin grant rounds that use Wonder for project management. With regards to the other questions:     andros:  [Bob] agree this, so what are the characteristics for new contributors, how could they benefit GitcoinDAO?   StemsDAO which I am a core contributor of, is using Wonder extensively to onboard and handle contributor workflows - it has been very helpful for us to streamline that process. I\u2019m happy to answer more specific questions about this. Also, having large DAOs on the platform that are already doing work and have high throughput productivity requirements means that the contributors on Wonder are all typically experienced with web3 projects and decentralized work environments .     andros:  [Bob] As I know, there are Utopia and pay party available now. so what\u2019s difference with Wonder?   Wonder actually supports payment via Utopia payment request links, but additionally allows context of each payment to be attached to a task, as well as being able to batch pay multiple bounties at the same time. Think @andros attached some demos in this comment. ",

Let me sum up here:   I don\u2019t believe this proposal has followed due process. The original proposal was for 100k GTC. In fact as of right now the post still says 100k. The snapshot is for 50k GTC, but it links to this post which says 100k GTC. The amount changed somewhere in the middle of the discussion but not enough time has been given to deliberate and the proposal has not been updated accordingly.  2022-04-14_17-08878\u00d7312 39.8 KB    This is a mutual grant acting as a bet for something that may exist in the future. Wonder does not have a token yet. We are effectively setting up a price floor for their token which is not something I believe gitcoin should be touching at all. I am not againt such mutual grants with projects that already have tokens in the market but a grant for a promise of a token is not something I think gitcoin should do.   I feel (this could be my personal shortcoming) that not enough deliberation and discussion has happened on this proposal. I learned about it 2 days ago. We got an explanation by Scott in the stewards call today. But the snapshot already ends in less than 24 hours. For such proposals I really think stewards should be given a heads up and context much earlier in the process.   ",

I\u2019d like to take this chance to bump up in priority the call for a mutual grants review committee and include Wonder as our first candidate for review. this is to ensure Gitcoin remains credibly neutral and have an unbiased approach to conducting these token swaps as we are not only committing to help provide funds to the project but also to become a partner in each others\u2019 journey through governance. I\u2019d like to work with @Pop  and @ceresstation  to make this a reality as soon as we can!   Procedural - per the new governance rules, after stewards have given comments, an updated proposal needs to be available on the forum and then finally be posted onto the snapshot. this is to ensure consistency and as part of keeping processes open and preserved for posterity.   a path forward would be to 1) engage the Wonder team for a revised proposal 2) update the proposal by working closely with stewards that volunteered to be on the mutual grants committee 3) post on forum and proceed with the voting process ",

I think the issue we discussed in the Steward Council yesterday is that the governance flow requires a proposal to be up for 5 days and have 5 stewards commenting. I know it a technicality but I think this is one point. The second was around the lack of a token at present that a few of the steward council brought up - not without merit in terms of implications for the DAO. I think establishing a committee to evaluate, vet and recommend suitable proposals based on an established matrix would be incredibly valuable. Also - an escrow contract should be established for any such mutual grants.  Both parties would put the tokens into said contract - this is especially important in this situation where the $WONDER token doesn\u2019t exist yet. So then the GTC swap would only activate once the $WONDER token is also in the escrow. Does this make sense? ",
