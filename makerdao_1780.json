DAOs are no different. They\u2019re made up of people, each with a unique perspective coloring the contents of their actions and decisions. It\u2019s hard enough to form a group devoted to a singular goal and likely impossible to find one (at scale) fully in agreement on the \u201cbest\u201d method to reach it. And it\u2019s for the best; echo chambers may be comforting, but they\u2019re rarely productive. Conflict can be similarly unproductive, but that depends entirely on the resolution reached. The majority of human growth can be attributed to \u2018struggle\u2019. We learn and grow through pain. Conflict in business can be an extension of this, provided the discussion remains focused and, of course, centered in reality. The first section was written with this as its core concept. The second highlights the competition, emphasizing roadmap amendments and functionality updates.  UST as a Mirror  UST was of a different breed. The embodiment of a parasitic ideology that paints the majority of human history.  \u201cInter arma enim silent leges\u201d, or \u201cfor among arms, the laws are silent\u201d.  In other words, win at all costs. Terra\u2019s angle was not unlike Microsoft\u2019s in the '90s. Its goal was to dominate, conquer, and destroy. That isn\u2019t to say they correlate 1 to 1. Microsoft had the ambition, and more importantly, the means, to seize and hold control. Terra possessed only ambition. It conquered because it had to. At the scale it reached, the only way the platform could succeed was to expand and destroy. Some point to the tweet calling for the death of DAI as Do Kwon\u2019s \u201cIcarus moment.\u201d I see it more as desperation. Terra relied on its social momentum, and in many ways, Terra was that momentum. Now, this might all read like aimless rambling, and perhaps it is. But every story nests an underlying truth. Here\u2019s mine: The world is never black and white, so as we consider our path forward, we must find a balance between extremes. Growth takes time, patience, and the ability to handle an unhealthy degree of self-doubt. My hope is we tread carefully. We have one of the largest, most active, and diverse communities of any protocol in the space (I check regularly). Lean on them, as the most impactful perspective\u2019s often come from those least involved, and lastly (I know, I know\u2026) I\u2019ll wrap it with an old quote:  The first draft of everything is shit. The first draft of anything is shit. The first draft of anything is rubbish.  The magic happens during the editing, or in our case RFC, process. When a poll passes, snippets of code are immortalized. So as we sift through the plethora of protocol alterations, ask questions, cast doubt, and offer improvements. Take part in their construction, and take note of the many forms. Watch as things bend, meld, and shape. Then, when it comes time to poll, all that remains is an informed decision. Myself included. I\u2019ll do more on the revision side rather than fully focus my efforts on reporting.  Up-and-coming competitor growth  A wide range of protocols like Aave, Compound, and Yearn could slot into this category, but most of us are already familiar with them. They\u2019re also only tangential competition (excluding Aave and its GHO stable). Instead, we\u2019ll focus on the \u201clate-bloomers.\u201d FRAX and Synthetix aren\u2019t new, but they didn\u2019t exactly come out of the gate hot. In the case of FRAX, the decline seems fair considering its competition. No legitimate protocol could compete with UST\u2019s scheme for now obvious reasons. And then we have Synthetix. The protocol has a strong use case, but it\u2019s failed to generate much use for most of its lifespan. While the model was sound, Ethereum transaction fees made it unprofitable, and in a sea of simple yield farms - the concept and UI were (and are) too complex for most passersby. First, let\u2019s quickly run through who they are and what they do. What is FRAX?  Frax is a stablecoin partially backed by external collateral complemented with the issuance of protocol shares, represented with the Frax Share (FXS) token. FRAX derives its value both as the protocol\u2019s governance token and as a means to receive a percentage of the seigniorage the protocol generates. In this case, seigniorage mainly refers to the income produced when the collateral that backs Frax is put to work. \u2013 seba via Mirror.xyz  In other words, FRAX utilizes decentralized collateral (in various forms) to retain a partial backing ranging from ~80-90%. Just as Maker currently manages its peg primarily through the use of USDC (I am aware of the many ideas to remedy this), the FRAX Treasury is composed of shares in Convex/Curve LPs spanning several chains. This Treasury holds around 100M DAI or 1% of the circulating market cap. While this figure appears \u2013 and is \u2013 entirely underwhelming, recent announcements show it\u2019s likely to grow. FRAX Finance\u2019s Sam Kazemian on Blockworks Research Spaces The transcribed interview with FRAX\u2019s founder, Sam Kazemian, begins with his thoughts on the current regulatory landscape for stablecoin issuers. Maker was referenced throughout the discussion. Kazmeian believes it\u2019s harmful to suggest that fiat-backing is inherently wrong and that FRAX and DAI should return to overcollateralized ETH. Direct quotes can be found below. 1. \u201cA system based on overcollateralized ETH doesn\u2019t work.\u201d 2. \u201cTop stablecoin issuers already recognize the flaws in this system.\u201d 3. \u201cDrawing from past data, overcollateralized stablecoins cannot scale and instead shrink over time.\u201d He goes on to say that DAI and FRAX, the two largest [decentralized] stablecoins do have fiat exposure, while the remaining tokens (LUSD, RAI, sUSD, and FEI) add up \u201cto less than an 800 million market cap\u201d.  \"Once you build a stablecoin project, you notice that at a point there\u2019s a fork in the road: You can adopt a hybrid model, take on some fiat/RWA risk and continue to scale, or stay true to the immutable, decentralized ethos - but you will shrink over time.\"  This preliminary discussion set the stage for the primary topic of conversation. Where does FRAX go from here? \u201cThe Trinity\u201d aka the FRAX Endgame Plan 1. frxETH frxETH serves as the protocol\u2019s \u201cendogenous\u201d liquid staking arm. Through it, users can deposit ETH and receive frxETH in a 1:1 ratio. This newly minted frxETH can then accrue yield through a Curve pool similar to the current ETH-stETH LP or be deposited in a protocol-owned vault for additional PoS yield. frxETH aims to remain pegged 1:1 with Ether, functioning as a fully-liquid \u201cETH-stablecoin\u201d. The goal is to utilize this derivative as a portion of FRAX\u2019s backing. 2. FRAX Rollup This piece of the puzzle is the furthest from realization. Cross-chain bridge\u2019s myriad issues have been on display throughout 2022. The FRAX team hopes to avoid this pitfall entirely by issuing native FRAX, redeemable on ETH layer-1 through an \u201cexit mechanism\u201d. The goal isn\u2019t to build a rollup capable of competing with Arbitrum and Optimism, but to create \u201ca stablecoin issuance rollup better equipped to handle trustless money.\u201d 3. Fraxlend and Fraxswap Kazemian sees the current DeFi landscape as a \u201cdifferent flavour of the same three things: stablecoins, AMMs, and lending/leverage.\u201d FRAX aims to build a native version of each, which he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe DeFi full-stack\u201d. This vision begins with Fraxlend and Fraxswap. As the names imply, the products allow users to lend and swap Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies. Fraxswap functions as an AMM, and Fraxlend as an isolated lending market. By fusing these products, FRAX aims to allow custom stablecoin loans between DAOs. Fraxlend\u2019s \u201ccustomizable money and loan-backed stablecoins\u201d This is FRAX\u2019s attempt at shedding USDC risk in a \u201cunique way\u201d. Through the lending arm, myriad loans with numerous loan parameters will be created, with the end goal of finding and matching acyclical loans and debt. 4. Frax Basepool This one\u2019s been a bit more publicized and is likely the most important variable in the equation. The BasePool is a Curve LP composed of FRAX and USDC, structured to allow BasePool LP tokens to be paired with assets in new pools.  \u201cInstead of taking market share of others, grow the total size of the pie.\u201d  Before the pool\u2019s launch, FRAX made up around 20% of Curve\u2019s total market share, primarily through subsidizing the DAI-USDC-USDT 3pool. However, additional rewards weren\u2019t offered to MetaPools built atop this base pool. FRAX\u2019s BasePool distributes these incentive rewards (CRV, CVX, FXS) to all MetaPools paired with the FRAX-3Crv pool. The BasePool is already live on Ethereum and should soon launch on Arbitrum and Optimism. Now, I didn\u2019t want to paint this section with my bias before presenting the facts, but it seems fair to say that quite a bit of this sounds very familiar\u2026 But as a semi-related sidenote, watching the DeFi landscape grow and morph has been quite interesting. Dai has entrenched itself as a central building block in the financial composition of numerous DeFi protocols like Convex, FRAX, GMX, etc. What is Synthetix? Synthetix specializes in token derivatives. While numerous synthetic assets are offered, the competition lies in two primary tokens.   SNX - a governance and utility token  sUSD - a stablecoin backed by a litany of ERC-20 assets.  Through the platform, users stake SNX to mint sUSD at a 350% collateralization ratio. Stakers that maintain adequate collateralization receive weekly SNX and sUSD rewards. The protocol also chose a much more traditional governance route. Rather than delegation-centric governance, Synthetix tackled the issue of voter apathy with a more traditional method. Users elect members to the \u201cSpartan Council.\u201d This council then votes on proposed changes to the protocol. And therein lies their competitive advantage; the duality of SNX. It functions as a governance token, but outside of governance polling, it also offers a competitive stable, and non-stable yield. In other words, holding the token benefits the average investor and those heavily invested in protocol operations, but this only works if the scheme remains profitable for the average trader. Enter layer-2. Optimism blew the doors wide open for Sythetix to thrive. Rewards now greatly exceed the gas paid to claim them, and all protocol functionality can be performed for a fraction of the original fee. This reduction alone saw the protocol quickly accrue around 135MM in locked collateral, but future updates and overhauls hope to capture a larger market share. Updated Synthetix roadmap 1. sUSD Bridge Bridging is now built directly into the Sythetix Staking UI, enabling fee-efficient movement between layers. 2. Perps V2 and V3 Through these SIPs, Synthetix aims to construct a platform for \u201cpermissionless asset creation\u201d, wherein any financial derivative can be built atop Sythetix V3. On the user end, the overhaul looks to simplify staking, introduce veSNX inflation weightings, and provide the option to lock for increased rewards. For devs, the overhaul allows builders to create pools supporting any financial derivative of their choosing, alleviating some of the \u201cCold Start\u201d liquidity issues new protocols often face. 3. Debt Migration All debt held by the protocol was merged into a single pool. This not only combines two linked markets but also serves to increase volume (and trading fees) for both mainnet and L2 stakers. 4. Atomic Swaps Atomic swapping enables users to automatically exchange assets between chains, typically by routing through a multi-chain liquidity hub like Curve, 1inch, and Uniswap. Though the tech isn\u2019t groundbreaking, it\u2019s rocketed the protocol\u2019s daily trading volume - generating up to $1M in daily fees for SNX stakers and liquidity providers.  The two may be taking different routes, but regardless of the paths traveled, they\u2019ve shown a willingness to adapt to the roaring future. Maker\u2019s shown a similar hunger, but it lacks focus. Initiatives are in place to assuage the communication gap, but I feel it will take a more refined community effort to find and pursue our \u201cnorth star.\u201d  \u201cWhen push comes to shove, you gotta push.\u201d  Customary NFA, and should probably toss in a Not Philosophical Advice as well - can never be too careful.
