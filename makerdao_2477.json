Similar to MKR, as a governance token YFI is susceptible to a governance attack if enough liquidity is built up on lending protocols such as Aave or Compound. As Maker does not lend collateral deposited by users, it becomes the ideal platform for YFI holders to utilize to tap into the equity in their YFI without impacting the security of YFI governance. Furthermore, YFI as a collateral type enables the creation of yYFI Vaults which facilitate YFI holders to accumulate additional YFI in a secure manner due to the one hour liquidation delay afforded by the Oracle Security Module in contrast to Compound and Aave. YFI has in the most rapid fashion asserted itself as one of the top DeFi primitives in the ecosystem. In its thus far short lifespan it has been listed on an assortment of tier-1 exchanges that facilitate creating a robust Oracle. In particular it benefits from a couple of direct to USD pairs, supplemented by a pair of USDT pairs, and rounded out with a hard-to-manipulte Uniswap pair against ETH. This creates a YFI Oracle that is resilient to a USDT failure, while still accounting for a fair weighting of its highest quote by volume. ",

While Binance LINK/USDT trading volume is higher than BTC/USDT, the BTC pair was chosen to lower USDT exposure. This allows the LINK data model to safely utilize the BTC pair and USDT pair on Binance and Huobi respectively without taking on significant BTC and USDT risk. ",

While there were several reputable exchanges such as Gemini and FTX with highly desirable USD quotes, the volume was considerably lacking to be included. Nonetheless no quote is used more than twice, and with a total of six sources this removes the risk of a single token\u2019s implosion or inaccurate price to affect the median calculation for BAL. With the formula for the magnitude of BAL liquidity reward taking into the inclusion of BAL as a component of a Balancer Pool, integrating BAL as a collateral type in the Maker Protocol is the first step towards the inclusion of Balancer Pool Tokens with yield generating potential.

When ranked by wash-trading adjusted volume most of the reputable exchanges trade against USDT. Being overweight in USDT is an undesirable property as it exposes the price model to a potential tether collapse risk. OKEx\u2019s COMP/USDT was dropped as a source in favor of Huobi\u2019s COMP/USDT as Huobi has more liquidity and as such is more expensive to manipulate. Kraken\u2019s COMP/USD was chosen due to USD fiat pairs being preferred for price discovery. Despite the low volume on Kraken relative to others in this set, the market-depth is disproportionally deep and bots arbitraging against Coinbase\u2019s COMP/USD have abnormally high activity on Kraken.

It makes little sense to hard-peg the value of USDT to $1 because there is no guarantee of solvency. This is in contrast to tokens like USDC, TUSD, or PAXOS which have much stronger guarantees. As such, the Oracle Team recommends a floating price USDT Oracle with active liquidations. Being one of the most highly traded tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem, there are a plethora of data to choose from. While high volume and liquidity are always high priority items for Data Models, the Oracle Team focused additional attention towards segregating the USDT price from outsized influence to any single pair. Out of the six total sources, two are against BTC, two are against ETH, and two are against USD. This minimizes the impact of price distortions driven exclusively by BTC or ETH though not necessarily a combination of the two. Similarly the Oracle is also resilient to manipulation of lower liquidity fiat pairs on BitFinex and Kraken. ",
