Two years later, Uniswap emerged as a new generation power and took the cornerstone role of Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Looking though the current data among all DEX protocols, you will observe that Uniswap dominates more than half of total trade volumes. While turning to the \u201cdaily active traders\u201d measure, Uniswap shows even more advantages far away from all the other DEXes. clipboard1209021216\u00d71058 60.6 KB clipboard1209011193\u00d71053 85.4 KB    duneanalytics.com    Dune Analytics Ethereum analytics by and for the community.

These advantages could be our strength to win the battles, and they also could be a Achilles\u2019 heel of the Uniswap team and our community. Luckily, I got 800 UNI from the airdrop, and since then, I have become a member of the Uniswap community. In the past 3 months, I tried my best to play as a qualified member of the community. It\u2019s quite an experience in my crypto life. I made some friends in the past 3 months, and sometimes also a bit depressed by the divisiveness among the whole communities. As we already have many contributors in the community playing the role of \u201cgood cops\u201d, I\u2019d like to play as a \u201cbad cop\u201d. I will put all my mind on finding out \u201cthe killer weapon that could defeat Uniswap in 6 months\u201d. I hope the failure of mine will be the victory of the whole community. ",
