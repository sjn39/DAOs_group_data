                    "content": "Hi Everyone, Following the PSM (Click to learn more!) discussion in this week\u2019s G&R meeting, I wanted to start the discussion/polling on whether we wanted to add any new PSMs for other stablecoins or not. Based on the discussion on the call there was some hesitancy from some to onboard more potential risk in this regard so I thought it best to gather broader consensus here. This discussion/signalling will also include the sweeping of existing stablecoins into respective PSMs if applicable with the option to sweep only with the intention to remove, or sweep and enable as a new PSM type. Below I have compiled a list of the most used stablecoins on Ethereum based on on-chain metrics. I will personally go through each one and analyze their worthiness as collateral based on my own opinion as a community member with Maker\u2019s wellbeing in mind.  Screen Shot 2021-05-21 at 9.21.33 PM969\u00d7688 71.9 KB  1. USDT The OG with a sordid past. The rumour has always been that Tether has never had the funds to back USDT 1:1 with its tokens. While this is probably true and may still be true, there is no denying that it has survived a long time and doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping any time soon. Recently they have begun attesting to their reserves and had a breakdown of their reserves. Although the jury is still out on whether these are legitimate or \u201cup to code\u201d, there is no denying that they\u2019re still in the game. One final note: as a protocol we do not currently trust the peg of USDT. Our USDT vaults have liquidations turned on and the USDT oracle is not locked to $1 like USDC. Therefore in order to have a PSM we would have to accept USDT at 1:1.  Personal Opinion  I would be open to having a limited debt ceiling (30M-100M) PSM for USDT to diversify our stablecoin collateral holdings as well as bringing in a new revenue stream based on these new details and the fact that USDT is still the #1 most used stablecoin ahead of USDC. 3. BUSD BUSD is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), issued in partnership with Paxos. Essentially it\u2019s PAX but for Binance. Based on curve data BUSD seems to have more on-chain liquidity than PAX. Whether we as a community want to trust a Binance operated stablecoin is another matter.  Personal Opinion  Since we have trusted PAX in the past I think it would make sense to also consider adding a BUSD vault. I like the fact that they are NYDFS approved and have a larger supply/more liquidity than some of the other options. 5. PAX MakerDAO has used PAX as a collateral type for over a year now and while useage has been low (except for recently) the community seems to trust it. Monthly attestations bring transparency to its legitimacy which is a key factor in choosing good collateral types.  Personal Opinion  While PAX doesn\u2019t have as good on-chain liquidity as others, based on historical usage within MakerDAO I think we could afford a PSM similar to what we have now. 6. TUSD MakerDAO previously added TUSD as a collateral type (still do technically) in response to peg deviations after Black Thursday and demand in the form of yield farming.    [TUSD] Proposal for Collateral Onboarding Domain Work       Hey guys, last week TUSD submitted a MIP6 application and as a result we have done a risk evaluation for governance to consider onboarding it into the Maker Protocol. Tomorrow we\u2019ll do a presentation on the governance call as well.  Overview  The primary use case of stablecoin collateral types is to increase Dai liquidity, particularly in times of distress or when Dai is trading at a significant premium. Stablecoin collateral helps generate Dai that is then used to push the market price down, su\u2026      After the PSM was implemented all existing stablecoin vault DC\u2019s were set to 0. Soon after, news came out that TUSD was changing ownership and the likely new owner was notorious crypto bad boy himself, Justin Sun. Several community members did not like the sounds of this new development and so TUSD has fallen out of favour.  Personal Opinion  Regardless of the personal sentiment of one investor/owner, I don\u2019t think this should disqualify a product based solely on this metric. TUSD was recently added to Compound and is already available on Aave. Liquidity and volume are decent from what I\u2019ve observed and they have a good proof of reserves system. I think this would be a good choice in diversifying our USD collateral. 7. HUSD HUSD is issued by Huobi and stcoins.com. While they do monthly transparency reports and have a decently large total supply/volume according to DeBank | DeFi Wallet for Ethereum Users, they have almost no on-chain liquidity or users (similar to PAX, although worse). Huobi also recently was forced to scale back some of their business in China due to changing regulations.  Personal Opinion  Due to their lack of use in DeFi and on-chain liquidity, I would highly recommend we pass on this option as collateral. 8. UST Imagine DAI was only backed by MKR. This is UST/LUNA. Pass. 9. sUSD Imagine DAI was only backed by MKR. This is sUSD/SNX. Pass. 10. USDN Pass. 11. GUSD GUSD is issued by Gemini, a New York licensed crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. GUSD is regulated by NYDFS and reserves are FDIC insured up to 250k. Total supply is small however on-chain volume to liquidity is decent. Decent liquidity can be found in Curve and GUSD is also accepted at Aave.  Personal Opinion  The only reason I included 11 was to get to GUSD. @tylerwinklevoss has shown support in being added to the ecosystem in the past and since they are based in New York and run a very trusted and respectable exchange/enterprise I think this is a good addition, even though their liquidity/volume are lower than we\u2019d normally like. Having collateral you can trust is still uncommon so when you see an opportunity to add a new one I think you should take the opportunity. They Final Thought While diversifying into different collaterals seems like the smart choice, there is always the chance that if the US government cracks down on Maker for any reason, diversifying won\u2019t matter. From a technical, competitive, and marketing standpoint I think diversifying into multiple USD products is a good hedge. The following polls ask you to vote on which (if any) PSMs you would like to add and/or sweep. Should we add a USDT PSM?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Should we add a BUSD PSM?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Should we add a PAX PSM?     Yes Yes, Sweep Only (0 DC, 0 tout) No Abstain     0 voters     Should we add a TUSD PSM?     Yes Yes, Sweep Only (0 DC, 0 tout) No Abstain     0 voters     Should we add a GUSD PSM?     Yes Yes, Sweep Only (0 DC, 0 tout) No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps Polling will end on 2021-06-10T16:00:00Z. If any of these polls end in \u201cYes\u201d with a majority they will be included in the following Monday\u2019s on-chain polling. Those that pass with \u201cYes\u201d from there will be included in a future executive. Mandated actors (PE/Risk/Gov) will be responsible for setting proper parameters and implementing the will of the MKR voters. Looking forward to the discussion/outcome. ",

Also, PAX and BUSD are closely related although I\u2019m not sure exactly how that 1:1 bridge works. In any case, it\u2019s a risk to be considered since the poll results so far seem to be pro-PAX but anti-BUSD. ",

This is why bank usually diversifies their counterparty exposure. So from a risk perspective, I think having many PSM is good. It is also good from a business perspective as favoring competition between fiat-backed stablecoin can only help to stay relevant. And we should be unbiased. This is good for business development as well. On-chain liquidity is not that important I would say as you can always mint as much as needed. PAX has low liquidity while BUSD is better but you can swap those at Paxos for no cost and in an instant. The backing is the same anyway. In my view, the aim should be to decrease our liquidity reserves to ~10-20% and diversify the counterparty risk between at least 5 counterparties. i.e. a 2-4% exposure at most. I would also favor more auditing. I would be fine with TUSD and USDT if we could have confidence in them. If we provide a 200M PSM to Paxos, I\u2019m quite sure we could get more information. ",

The main reason for having the psm is to be as close as possible to the usd. If usdc is under at 0.98 that means we will buy usdc at 0.98 for the price of 1 dollar. It seems for me one asset should be good enough, as far as it full fills the initial purpose. In my view it is bad to have a higher percentage of stable coin, because it just doesn\u2019t fit the initial purpose. I would prefer to have a better rate to attract more users and more collaterals.

Sweep only is a good option for taking existing stablecoin vaults and moving them into a PSM.  TUSD was great at first, and then they sold out to a questionable actor, therefore sweep only is my choice there. PAX unfortunately has such low liquidity and adoption but maybe it will pick up. A small PSM DC is better than sweeping imo.  Binance has not treated MKR or DAI very well, from a BD standpoint, and I think that\u2019s why people lean against BUSD.  To me it\u2019s irrelevant, and I agree with Sebs points about this being good for BD. Their regulatory legitimacy is nice so thats why I\u2019m voting yes on a BUSD PSM. USDT/TUSD - I voted no.  For USDT it\u2019s a PR thing. From what I understand they released their backing info and they have some portfolio of decent assets backing it(75% cash equivalents), but i\u2019m not totally aware of the risks and feel general discomfort around USDT(maybe unjustly now.) Also I think the space should do what it can to reduce USDT\u2019s market share\u2013it\u2019s enormous. As for TUSD, fuck Justin Sun is my reason.  ",

There is no other elegant liquidation mechanism for these until we patch the vow to have a collateral specific bad debt queue.  We can\u2019t just put this out for liquidation with a duration of 1 year, otherwise it will become bad debt within a few days.  We could limit the ilk.box for these so they only do 100k DAI at a time and liquidate over a year that way, but that will be costly for incentives to bark.  It\u2019s much cleaner to liquidate into the PSM and let anyone come along and take the collateral for the DAI outstanding whenever they want.  If you\u2019re voting no on TUSD, you presumably are assuming LIQ-2.0 fixes the liquidation problem here, and perhaps it does if we limit the amount out for liquidations and let it constantly liquidate for a year, but I think \u201csweep\u201d is a much more elegant solution.

We need an efficient way to get rid of this collateral and moving to a PSM would be the most efficient.   So I worry about having multiple PSMs, after I have thought about it more and discussed it with several others who pointed out some possible dangers I had not originally thought of. Right now our big risk is exposure to USDC \u2013 mainly in the form of them involuntarily being forced not to honor USDC sitting in the PSM, as it seems unlikely they would want to destroy their own brand, reputation, and peg by voluntarily monkeying around with us. Note that that risk \u2013 regulators based in the US where Circle is deciding to do something that negatively impacts us \u2013 is not lessened by including other US-based centralized stablecoin issuers. It does reduce the risk of Circle deciding to take a swing at us, but we likely hold enough of their float that we present an existential threat to them as well, since we could force a mutually assured destruction by asking to redeem our $2 billion in USDC on a whim. We do, however, add additional risk by creating a multiple-legged PSM. Suddenly there is not just one peg to maintain, but multiple. That means that, one stablecoin issuer could mint a bunch of their coin unbacked, move it into our PSM for DAI, use the DAI to take the redeemable stablecoin of another issuer from our PSM, move it onto their books. Net result? They grow their circulation and balance sheet for free, and at our expense. Just as we (and Circle!) have benefitted by the current PSM, some other stablecoin issuer could do the same trick but entirely through our PSM and not through the secondary market. We cannot/should not operate multiple PSMs at the same time without a solution to the above scenario. Otherwise, we risk the DAI supply shrinking by billions instantly, and all the havoc that would wreak both on our business and on the markets as a whole. ",

It seems like the only difference is that by using through the PSM, Maker collects some fees   So the big thing is that we enable multiple, large-scale iterations of this, and it also happens inside our balance sheet. We could \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 end up with a huge amount of recursive leverage inside our own balance sheet from this. Moving billions back and forth like this on the secondary market is likely to increase slippage quickly, whereas we are offering flat fees. Imagine this: $2b unbacked GUSD are minted. $2b GUSD into PSM \u2014> $2b DAI out of PSM \u2014> $2b DAI into PSM \u2014> $2b USDC out of PSM. Note we have the same DAI in the end, and if well executed, it may not even upset the apple cart. But that $2b DAI is no longer backed by USDC. It is now backed by $2b GUSD, which is itself backed by USDC. So there\u2019s an extra layer of risk for no reward. Not imagine USDC decides what is good for the goose is good for the gander: $2b unbacked USDC are minted. $2b USDC into PSM \u2014> $2b DAI out of PSM ----> $2b DAI into PSM \u2014> $2b GUSD out of PSM. Now we have still $2b DAI, but it is now backed by $2b USDC, which is backed by $2b GUSD, which is backed by $2b USDC. In net, this isn\u2019t a problem. But each time there\u2019s an extra layer, that\u2019s an extra risk of something going wrong when unwinding. And if there are new issuers/assets involved (maybe a third coin gets into the game of trying to expand their liquidity), then there\u2019s the extra counterparty risk, too. Note that there\u2019s nothing stopping this from occurring now on the secondary market. But that doesn\u2019t occur entirely contained within our balance sheet. In a world where the markets stay liquid, people don\u2019t make dumb mistakes, etc, then this isn\u2019t an issue. But if something blows up, I\u2019d rather the settling process be straightforward. It\u2019s not that something will go wrong. It\u2019s that there\u2019s invitation for shenanigans and extra complexity risk, but doesn\u2019t seem like it would lower our risk to USDC \u2013 certainly not regulatory with the available options all subject to the same risk, and potentially not counterparty, depending upon the final make up of a suite of PSM vaults.

Imagine when the PSM is $10 billion or $20 billion. I should also note that GUSD was just a placeholder. But it would be a way for them to 10x their market cap in a matter of minutes while experiencing minimal slippage by using our PSM, notably, the smaller the stablecoin market cap, the more useful this would be in gaining adoption of their coin.

I suspect that we are just going way out of our way to avoid potential $1-4MM worth of liquidation losses. Just taking a look at @cmooney post     cmooney:  There is no other elegant liquidation mechanism for these until we patch the vow to have a collateral specific bad debt queue. We can\u2019t just put this out for liquidation with a duration of 1 year, otherwise it will become bad debt within a few days. We could limit the ilk.box for these so they only do 100k DAI at a time and liquidate over a year that way, but that will be costly for incentives to bark. It\u2019s much cleaner to liquidate into the PSM and let anyone come along and take the collateral for the DAI outstanding whenever they want. If you\u2019re voting no on TUSD, you presumably are assuming LIQ-2.0 fixes the liquidation problem here, and perhaps it does if we limit the amount out for liquidations and let it constantly liquidate for a year, but I think \u201csweep\u201d is a much more elegant solution.   I see there may be some issue with the vow, but no statement of consequence relating the issue. Its all just hyperbole about year long auctions as best i can tell. For me at least, What i want to know is if there is a reason to believe that maker would not be able to recoup at least 80% of the debt auctioned? If so then lets hear that otherwise my vote is just eat the loss and move on, and by that i mean just turn on liquidations for this vault type if people don\u2019t repay their debt maker should just auction off their collateral at a loss and cover the rest out of the stability buffer same as whats done with any other asset.

It won\u2019t be very efficient to liquidate underwater TUSD vaults efficiently without PSM. This is because Liq 2.0 auction price curve is applied on debt + accrued fees, and if you wanted to liquidate every vault with a predefined haircut to vault\u2019s collateral to attract keepers, you would need to use different curves for every vault. If we use one price curve that is unified, it is possible some vaults won\u2019t be liquidated that efficiently and more money could be lost to keepers or some auctions would be pending. If we liquidate via PSM, things become much easier. TUSD is transferred to PSM and liquidation is done on TUSD level instead of vault level and it gets easier to define PSM parameters to off-board it. It is true that tout of 0% will probably not be enough to liquidate it very fast, but I think there should be some other ways to do it if we wanted. ",
