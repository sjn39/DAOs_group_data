                    "content": "It has been a busy time at 6s Capital. From growing our pipeline, adding a new sector, completing our first annual audit, tax season, and getting new investors to closing on projects. We have been \u201cheads-down\u201d on executing our operations. As we grow, we will have growth pains like any organization. We continue to focus on building on a foundation of rock to scale our lending platform for the future. As a function of our growth and recommended to implement by some DAO-participants, it is important to encourage decentralization of any possible singular point of failure. This includes our project pipelines, our investors, and even our credit sources. In the same context that Maker should have multiple LendCOs to avoid concentrations, LendCOs should also have a variety of credit sources, MakerDAO being one of them, as each will have varying factors that encourage use. Any commercial borrower that explicitly relies only on one Lender is taking more systemic risk than needed. Thus a type \u201cclient-diversity\u201d is needed to remedy this concern. Once implemented, each party must then \u201ccompete\u201d for the other\u2019s business which helps ensure a win-win environment. Institutional commercial credit sources can provide specialization in ways that Maker can learn from. Further, those commercial credit sources must compete with Maker (the same is true in reverse as well). This helps keep \u201cmarket\u201d transactions. So what are the determining factors that help LendCOs select which credit provider to utilize? Fundamentally:  Scope Scale (e.g. size) Transactional certainty and of course, economic terms  From the above and once started, 6s Capital has the continuous challenge of ensuring capital to facilitate each closing for the transactional pipeline. Thus diversification becomes a requirement when a constraint in the above factors is observed / forecasted (e.g. not enough credit). In parallel to our existing growth plans, 6s Capital is expanding its lending scope beyond credit tenant leasing with other investors / credit providers in different registered series of 6s Capital Partners LLC. In the near future, 6s Capital will be submitting a MIP that outlines how and where MakerDAO can participate as well. 6s will be entering new markets and looks forward to growing with MakerDAO, if approved. The MIP that is about to be proposed will also allow / authorize the RWA Senior Lending Trust to be able to purchase US Treasuries. While just one Trust \u201ccould\u201d resolve the stablecoin \u201cissue\u201d for the DAO (as a whole), it would of course then replace one concentration risk for another. This is not the objective. The fact the Trust can hold US Treasuries should not be the primary selling point, rather the primary use case is that it would be an institutional capital battery that 6s Capital could then tap to deploy senior-secured capital based on a DAO-approved lending scope. It is my sincere hope that the DAO appreciates the significance of the recent credit tenant lease senior-secured loan that occurred last week (first of its kind ever!) This the first of many to come, not only with credit tenant leases, but other sectors should 6s\u2019 scope be approved by the DAO. Let\u2019s roll ! ",
