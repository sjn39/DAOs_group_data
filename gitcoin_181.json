                    "content": "Last week, @kyle kicked off a discussion series on what the next 12-18 months might mean for Gitcoin if we are successful. This post is intended to follow on that, diving into the long-term future of the grants program. It seeks to surface conversations we are beginning to have in the DAO, in an attempt to continually build in public. I\u2019d like to call out fellow DAO contributors @connor @lthrift @nategosselin @ceresstation @kevin.olsen @J9leger who co-wrote and/or deeply contributed to much of this thinking.  Context Gitcoin Grants is at a critical turning point. We\u2019re evolving from a small, mostly-centralized group running a quarterly grants program into a large DAO managing & maintaining both a grants program as well as a modular protocol. In the last six months, we\u2019ve focused largely on kicking off protocol development and defining what the different components of the protocol will entail. A major question for Gitcoin as we look ahead is what the Program entails, and what the Protocol entails. This includes questions around how we should restructure the rounds we run today. These are large questions that will require multiple perspectives, but this doc exists to give us a starting point for the discussion. It is one point of view that should not be taken as the \u201cfinal decision\u201d, but rather as a jumping off point while we navigate this new Protocol and Program territory.  Where we\u2019ve come from Gitcoin Grants has evolved substantially since its launch three years ago. In the very early days, Gitcoin Grants was focused on two things \u2013 and since those early days, Gitcoin Grants has become much more than its two original focus areas. Let\u2019s revisit where both of those stand today.  1. Funding Open Source in the Ethereum Ecosystem At the genesis of Gitcoin Grants in early 2019, this question was posed:  Today, open source and the Ethereum ecosystem are still deeply embedded in the veins of the Gitcoin community \u2013 but they now are far from the only communities we serve with our Grants program. Over the past few rounds, we have expanded beyond just open source \u2013 and beyond just Ethereum \u2013 and into funding public goods both on other chains, as well as in the real world through our Ecosystem & Cause Rounds. With our Ecosystem Rounds, we\u2019ve helped over 20 unique groups fund their shared needs \u2013 from individual projects like Lootverse & Polygon, to collaborations like the ZK Tech & Open Gaming rounds. With Cause Rounds, which represent Gitcoin grants\u2019 first material expansion beyond just software, Gitcoin Grants is now providing funding to entirely off-chain projects, many of which are onboarding to crypto for the first time with our program. Cause Rounds now account for roughly a third of our program.  2. Experimenting with Quadratic Funding (aka Liberal Radicalism)  Gitcoin Grants has effectively been synonymous with Quadratic Funding since day one, and a big part of who we are has involved implementing Zoe, Glen, and Vitalik\u2019s vision in the real world. Over the past fourteen rounds, we\u2019ve experimented with many configurations of QF \u2013 from having just one large pool, to a pool sub-divided into percentage-based categories, to running eighteen unique QF pools in tandem in GR14. We are the largest QF deployment in the world \u2013 now distributing over $5M entirely via QF each quarter \u2013 and we have proven that there is product-market fit here from funders, community donors, and grantees alike. We have also seen other projects begin to focus on enabling QF for communities in light of our success.  Where we are today In today\u2019s world, we effectively have an inextricably coupled tech product + program + services, where Gitcoin is the only operator of our legacy platform (dubbed \u201ccGrants\u201d, for \u201cCentralized Grants\u201d) and anyone wishing to fund grants using our technology needs to go through us. Since early 2019, Gitcoin has been running our quarterly grants program. This program has become our flagship product, the thing for which Gitcoin is most well-known and is where the majority of our resources have been focused over the past couple years. This program involves two-week grants rounds which run each March, June, September, and December. Today\u2019s program, which has evolved in the ways described above, currently consists of three round types, all running at the same time on cGrants:   Main Round \u2014 one large matching pool (in recent rounds, ~$1M) funded by many partners, distributed using QF to all projects on the platform with an Ethereum payout address   Cause Rounds \u2014 individual matching pools for specific social causes (e.g., Climate, DEI, Longevity) typically funded by many partners, distributed using QF to projects working on that cause   Ecosystem Rounds \u2014 individual matching pools for specific Web3 ecosystems (e.g, Polygon, Web3 Social), typically funded by one or a few organizations, distributed using QF to projects who meets the funders\u2019 eligibility criteria   Running a program centrally can only scale so much. As the DAO revealed earlier this year in announcing Grants 2.0, we are moving towards becoming a protocol DAO. In addition to offering our protocol permissionlessly for others to use, the Gitcoin Grants program itself will soon run on top of that protocol. The remainder of this post is intended to outline a vision for the future state we are working towards.  The Big Vision Gitcoin\u2019s purpose is to empower communities to fund their shared needs.  Today, the Gitcoin Grants program accomplishes that on a small scale. Our ambition with this new protocol & program delineation is to be able to accomplish this vision on a much larger scale, funding tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in shared needs. We aspire to provide the mechanisms to help communities \u2013 whether they be DAOs, companies, countries, cities, not-for-profits, groups of friends \u2013 fund their collective needs in the way that is right for them. For some communities, this might look like picking up our grants protocol and reference interfaces and running with it themselves. For others, it might involve Gitcoin providing some hands-on operational support. And for some communities, this might involve using Quadratic Funding as the sole mechanism, as with our program today. For others, this might look like experimenting with a combination of direct grants + retroactive public goods funding + MACI QF \u2013 all of which we\u2019ll offer as money legos within our protocol. In all cases, we aspire to be a trusted resource on the journey \u2013 to provide the toolkit these communities need in order to effectively distribute funding, based on their terms. In addition, we aspire to continue to intentionally fund areas that meet the Gitcoin community\u2019s perception of humanity\u2019s shared needs \u2013 this will be the continuation of our Grants Program, which will run on top of the new Protocol. So, in this future state, the Gitcoin Grants Program is just one of many programs that run on top of our Gitcoin-built technology \u2013 and is a program that we hope will inspire others to start their own, too.  1592\u00d7894 232 KB  And, finally, we envision a world, for grantees, where access to grants funding & early-stage funding at large is much less disparate. Blockchains provide the opportunity to build a unified grants registry, a one-stop-shop source of truth where both institutional funders & individual funders alike can access data \u2013 depending on permissions a grantee sets \u2013 on all of the projects out there looking for funding.  Deconstructing our Future Grants Components In the future state, we envision separating the product, program, and services components of Gitcoin Grants into distinct efforts. The protocol will programmatically enable the goals of many grant programs, inclusive of the Gitcoin Grants program.  1. Grants 2.0 Protocol (i.e. the product) This is the decentralized, permissionless protocol for running grants programs. As outlined in the initial Grants 2.0 forum post, the Gitcoin Grants protocol will be open source, modular, and decentralized \u2013 any community can create a grant program using our dApp front-end (or by interacting with the protocol directly), and then running it themselves. When the grants protocol is launched, matching funders don\u2019t operationally need the Gitcoin Grants program anymore. Anyone, anywhere can stand up a grants program anytime \u2013 they aren\u2019t bound to Gitcoin\u2019s quadratic funding construct, nor are they bound to our quarterly grants round cadence. So, what does the protocol change? The protocol represents a few substantial shifts:   Gitcoin moving beyond just QF, and into grants tooling at large. The protocol is, in short, a software stack to run & manage your entire grants program by yourself \u2013 without Gitcoin\u2019s help. Today, the Gitcoin Grants program is 100% quadratic funding-focused. With the protocol, QF is but one module, one funding lego that exists among many.   The ability for anyone at all to use it. By virtue of the protocol being truly permissionless, anyone can use it without needing to go through Gitcoin as a gatekeeper \u2013 today, we have the ability to hand-pick which matching funders engage with the program. With the protocol, as with anything open-source, the maintainer (Gitcoin) will not have authority over who uses it or what it is used for.   The ability to fund anything \u2013 not just public goods. Again, by virtue of this protocol being truly permissionless, those using the protocol can use it to fund whatever they want \u2013 not just public goods. Today, in our program, we explicitly focus \u2013 and always have focused \u2013 on funding public goods.    2. Gitcoin Grants Program In the early days of the protocol, the Gitcoin Grants Program is likely to be a super-user of the protocol \u2013 given our current scale, we expect to be the largest implementation on the protocol in the near-term. With the move to the protocol, we plan to gradually ramp down on running so many rounds ourselves, and will instead focus the Program on key areas where the DAO aspires to have an impact. Today, as described above, the program funds the shared needs of Web3 communities (Main Round / Ecosystem Rounds) and of humanity at large (Cause Rounds). As we look ahead, we have three objectives for the program in mind:   To grow Gitcoin\u2019s brand. The quarterly grants rounds have become a schelling point for Web3 and have been extremely effective in developing our brand and bringing in funders. We see no reason this shouldn\u2019t continue.   To have an impact, on the DAO\u2019s terms. At the heart of Gitcoin since day one has been funding public goods, and maintaining a program allows us to continue to direct pools of capital specifically towards projects that meet the public good ethos \u2013 or whatever ethos the DAO decides is most important to fund \u2013 in spite of the protocol itself being entirely permissionless and, in theory, funding anything.   To drive protocol interest. As with any piece of technology, the protocol is something that will mature gradually over time, becoming easier to use self-serve as it gets built out. Continuing to run a program is a way we can hand-hold early users of the protocol and enable them, with an eye to them using the protocol more independently in the long-term.   We also see an opportunity for the program to become financially self-sustaining \u2013 which, today, it is not. As we evolve the program direction and where it is headed, we\u2019ll explore business models that could make the program more long-term sustainable. To reiterate the \u201cwhere we\u2019ve come from section\u201d above, the three objectives above move us further along the journey we\u2019ve already implicitly begun in starting to move away from just \u201cfund open source / public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem\u201d and \u201cserve as a testing ground for QF\u201d as core objectives. While both remain core to our ethos, we are building towards something bigger.  3. Services Looking ahead, we aspire to be a trusted partner that helps communities in deploying their funds using our protocol. We will do this through the Services we offer \u2013 by understanding the efficacy of funding models better than anyone else, we can effectively advise funders on how they might deploy capital and help them in deploying that capital through our protocol. Today, the program & services are inextricably coupled. To run a QF round in the Gitcoin program, given that our platform is centralized, you need Gitcoin\u2019s help operationally \u2013 there is no way to run grants through our platform without the PGF team\u2019s involvement. Although we have not charged for our Services to date, receiving service from us has been a requirement to use the Gitcoin Grants Program, given that there has been no self-serve way to engage with the program due to its tech limitations. In the \u201cprograms-as-trees\u201d analogy, services can be thought of as a watering service. The services we offer are Gitcoin helping you water your garden, so that your program can become the most thriving, fruit-bearing tree it can become. And these services would be completely optional \u2013 if you chose to water your own tree, and just use the protocol yourself, you could absolutely do so.  What does this mean for GR15? In Grants Round 15, we will still be running the Gitcoin Grants Program as usual on our cGrants platform. As we prepare for a protocol future, we will de-couple the Main Round from the Ecosystem / Cause Rounds. De-coupling starts to move us in the direction of what living in a protocol world will look like \u2013 wherein anyone can stand up any sort of round permissionlessly. What this means, tactically speaking for GR15, is that grantees will be able to be eligible for a specific Ecosystem or Cause Round, as long as they meet that round\u2019s eligibility criteria \u2013 even if they don\u2019t meet the Gitcoin Main Round criteria. Today, the Main Round criteria include not having raised VC funding over $500k, not having a token, not selling NFTs, being open source, and generally being a public good. We have received feedback from some of our funding partners that this is more restrictive than they would like to be, and this is the first step in our journey to enable permissionless funding of shared needs more broadly than just what we as Gitcoin prescribe as \u201cpublic goods\u201d based on our (imperfect) working definition. More to come in the upcoming GR15 Governance Brief.  Next Steps We would like to solicit feedback from DAO contributors, grantees, and funders alike as we crystallize this vision and more clearly define what the Program & Protocol will look like in the future. We will continue to provide updates on the journey as pieces get built out and tested. ",

What this means, tactically speaking for GR15, is that grantees will be able to be eligible for a specific Ecosystem or Cause Round, as long as they meet that round\u2019s eligibility criteria \u2013 even if they don\u2019t meet the Gitcoin Main Round criteria.  Having the capability to define round level eligibility has been requested for a while, and is an awesome first step into this future.     annika:  by understanding the efficacy of funding models better than anyone else, we can effectively advise funders on how they might deploy capital and help them in deploying that capital through our protocol.   I want to call out that this is really one of the unsung heroes of our future. Gitcoin today is largely a one (very large) trick pony when it comes to grants funding. Luckily the QF mechanism has proven to be one of the most democratically fair way to distribute funds. Imagine if you don\u2019t need the consensus of the commons and instead want to fund using a different method. In theory, Gitcoin should be experts in helping you understand hte pros and cons of deploying that capital. We will have the expertise to offer insights (to the world) on how effective capital distribution has been. Further, imagine if we could track the impact projects had, and tie that back to the funding model used\u2026 We can actually evaluate \u201care the grants the community choose \u2018better\u2019 than the grants chosen by VCs, Grants programs, etc.?\u201d I am excited for our skillset to grow into the data analysis and insights generation too!

Your post helped outline a lot of what has already been discussed by our branding team (and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not a coincidence lol). All that said, I believe that it would be helpful to define a Grants Program narrative that is heavily values-centric and continue to lean in and rally around our vision for a regen future. Our protocols will be neutral but our Program should be explicit in its stance/embody our community\u2019s stance for a flourishing future for humanity, imo.
