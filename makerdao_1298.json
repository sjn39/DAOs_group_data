We already implemented and have different Discord bots running that filter:  Junk words and inappropriate phrases Spam links Multiple messages sent in a short period of time that can be considered spam Users trying to register with usernames containing specific words like admin, helpdesk, support, etc.  For all of above, actions are taken automatically and instantly by the bots. For everything else, I could suggest opening requests for TechOps Core Unit in #techops-requests private Discord channel (visible to everyone with MakerDAO role). Urgent requests from that channel are processed very fast by someone from the team that is currently online. Remember that we always have people on-call to take urgent actions whenever that is needed. You can also report it in the #reports channel mentined by Patrick_J, but then someone else would have to process it. I hope my answer helps. Let me know if any clarification is needed. ",
