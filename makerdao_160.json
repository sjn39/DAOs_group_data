Introduction of the Performance Modifier   Sentence Summary This proposal describes how Recognized Delegates will be compensated.  Paragraph Summary Governance Facilitators will compute and send the compensation to Recognized Delegates starting from the MIP adoption date with payments sent monthly.  Component Summary MIP61c1: Definitions MIP61c1 defines key terms. MIP61c2: Compensation Formula and Process MIP61c2 specifies how to calculate the compensation and convey it to Recognized Delegates. MIP61c3: Payment Process MIP61c3 specifies the process for the payment of compensation to Recognized Delegates MIP61c4: Accommodation for Delegate Contract Migration MIP61c4 specifies how Recognized Delegates can continue to receive predictable payments during a contract migration. MIP61c5: Examples MIP61c5 provides examples of the calculation for a few different situations. MIP61c6: Modification of Parameters MIP61c6 is a process component that allows authors to appeal to Maker Governance to change compensation parameters.  Motivation  If I don\u2019t delegate my MKR, why should I contribute to the expenses of those that do? I am receiving no benefit from this, and in fact may be harmed by a delegate who votes against my wishes.   Active engagement of delegates with the community and each other. This is unlikely if MKR holders hire their own delegates. Robust discussion and engagement should lead to better decision-making for the protocol. Consistency in defense of the hat. If the protocol compensates Recognized Delegates, they are incentivized to vote regularly in order to receive their compensation. If more MKR is securing the hat, the Maker Protocol is more secure. MKR holders paying their own delegates is unlikely to happen because it is not in their best interests to do so. It is in MKR holders best interests to let someone else (i.e. the largest MKR holder) spend their time and resources governing the system. Given that it is obfuscated who the largest MKR holder is, everyone assumes it is not them, and no one pays the costs.  The only way to force cooperation is to have the Maker Protocol pay for Recognized Delegates, such that the cost is divided between all MKR holders. Is this unfair for smaller MKR holders that actively vote? Yes, absolutely. But smaller MKR holders that actively vote cannot secure the hat or pass proposals without significant cooperation from other smaller MKR holders - and again, it is not in their best interests to do so given their relative vote-weight, especially in a high-gas environment, as the cost of voting for polls can become obstructive. Vote outcomes are largely determined by how well voters are informed. As Recognized Delegates hold a great deal of voting weight, MKR holders are strongly motivated to encourage delegates to be as informed as possible, deliberate on questions of Governance in depth, and engage in discussion with all stakeholders to gain the broadest possible perspective on the questions presented before them to decide. Compensation will help free Recognized Delegates from some of their other responsibilities. For outstanding Recognized Delegates, a secondary goal of compensation is to retain talent and prevent poaching other businesses or protocols.  Specific Goals  Recognized Delegate compensation should be positively correlated with MKR weight. There should be a per-delegate maximum compensation because we do not expect a large difference in performance among outstanding Recognized Delegates. Compensation should be positively skewed toward Recognized Delegates with smaller MKR weight to encourage recruitment of new Recognized Delegates. The compensation formula should discourage zero-sum thinking among Recognized Delegates. One Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation should be as independent as possible from another Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation.   Performance Modifier Motivation The intention behind the Performance Modifier is that these parameters be considered over the duration of time that a Recognized Delegate is active. The advantage of such an approach is that it allows Recognized Delegates that have been performing at high levels flexibility in terms of unexpected ability to vote, for example, in the event of illness, or planned inactivity, such as a vacation period. If a Recognized Delegate\u2019s parameters were calculated on a rolling-basis, for example over three months, taking a week off would have an outsized effect on compensation, particularly if it was a week with a large number of Governance Polls. If it is difficult or uneconomical for Recognized Delegates to take time off when required, there is potential this could lead to burnout and this is consequently undesirable.  Relevant Information  Quadratic funding   Specification / Proposal Details  MIP61c1: Definitions   Recognized Delegates: Any delegate that has been labelled as a Recognised Delegate by a majority of Governance Facilitators according to a public and consistently applied criteria.   MIP61c2: Compensation Formula and Process  A Solution Goal 1 can be addressed with a linear relationship or many different curves. Goal 3 can be addressed by using an exponential with a factor between 0 and 1 (exclusive). A factor of 0.5 results in quadratic funding. The idea is to distribute compensation proportional to the square root of the MKR weight. To achieve goal 2, we cap the maximum per-delegate compensation.     Parameter Math Symbol Initial Value     Threshold for a large delegate T 10k MKR   Exponential factor q 0.5   Maximum annual compensation per delegate C 144k DAI    The formula is C*min(1,MKR^q/T^q). In practice, the Governance Facilitators will calculate compensation for Recognized Delegates on a monthly basis, as such the formula becomes (C*min(1,MKR^q/T^q))/12.  If a Recognized Delegate has greater than or equal to T MKR delegated to them, they will receive the maximum amount of compensation, C. If a Recognized Delegate has less than T MKR delegated them, they will receive an amount of compensation derived by the above formulae.   Performance Modifier Governance Facilitators track participation and communication metrics for each Recognized Delegate. For the purpose of calculating the Performance Modifier, we look at the minimum of the two metrics. For example, if a Recognised Delegate has 85% participation and 80% communication then the Performance Modifier is based on min(85%, 80%) = 80%. A few parameters are used to determine the effect of the Performance Modifier. For Participation, a score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted in all possible polls since they started their role as a Recognized Delegate. GovAlpha tracks Participation in Governance Polls and Executive Votes separately and also tracks a combined overall participation rating. For Communication, GovAlpha tracks how Recognized Delegates have communicated their voting decisions. Recognized Delegates are rewarded with a higher score for providing reasoning for their voting decisions. For example, a score of 100% would mean a Recognized Delegate communicated all of their voting decisions AND gave reasons for reaching these decisions. On the other hand, a score of 50% would indicate a Recognized Delegate communicated their decisions but did not provide any reasoning for these decisions. Recognized Delegate are expected to communicate their vote within seven days of a Governance Poll concluding. For Executive Votes, a more lenient approach is taken as there may be valid reasons to delay voting on an Executive Vote, so it is expected that reasoning is communicated within two weeks of an Executive Vote being executed on-chain. Their scores for each vote are combined to give an overall communication rating.     Parameter Math Symbol Initial Value     Threshold for adequate performance L 75%   Threshold for good performance H 90%   Beginning compensation scalar B 40%     For less than L, the Recognized Delegate will receive no compensation. For L or above, the Performance Modifier starts at B and rises linearly to 100% for metrics of H and above.  This is demonstrated in the below graph:  dc0d6e19d5b85b312de77d11b458a1ecb9ab2e63_2_1035x6341035\u00d7634 15.2 KB  These requirements and metrics may be adjusted in the future depending on the number of Recognized Delegates, the resources available to the Governance Facilitators, and feedback from the Recognized Delegates themselves.  MIP61c3: Payment Process  The Governance Facilitators shall maintain a note of how much MKR was delegated to each Recognized Delegate each day. Compensation will be calculated on a monthly basis using the mean average of MKR delegated to each Recognized Delegate over the course of the month, using the formulae detailed in MIP61c2. Once calculated, a summary of the compensation for the Recognized Delegates will be published to the MakerDAO forum. Compensation for Recognized Delegates will be distributed by Executive Vote, the Governance Facilitators will aim to include these payments in the first Executive Vote of each calendar month. Recognized Delegates should confirm both the amount of compensation being paid, and the receiving address with the Governance Facilitators in the week leading up to the Executive Vote If a Recognized Delegate is not able to do this, that Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation will not be included in the next Executive Vote and instead will be included in a future Executive Vote at a mutually agreeable time.   MIP61c4: Accommodation for Delegate Contract Migration This component addresses the situation when a Recognized Delegate intends to migrate from one delegate contract to another. The associated entity must inform governance 7 days in advance of the migration effective date and which contracts are affected. The new delegate contract cannot already be involved in a migration (e.g., two delegates merging into one). During a 30 day interim period, the old and new delegate contracts are regarded, for the purpose of compensation, as referring to the same entity and compensation is calculated using stats from both the old and new contracts. For example, MKR weight will be obtained by the sum of the MKR weight of the old and new contracts. Participation and communication stats will be calculated across both delegate contracts.  MIP61c5: Examples Suppose the parameters are set to their initial values. The effect of the Performance Modifier is B+(1-B)(clamp(min(participation, communication),L,H)-L)/(H-L) With 100 MKR delegated, 95% Participation, and 95% Communication, the compensation is calculated as C*min(1,100^q/10000^q). The Performance Modifier is 100% because min(95%,95%) >= 90%. This is 100% C*10/100 = 14 400 DAI per year. With 6772 MKR delegated, 85% Participation, and 95% Communication, The Performance Modifier is 40%+(1-40%)(clamp(min(85%,95%),75%,90%)-75%)/(90%-75%) simplifing to 40%+60%(85%-75%)/15%. The compensation is calculated as C*min(1,6772^q/10000^q). This is 80% C*82.29/100 = 94 797.6 DAI per year. Compensation can be visualized by plotting the amount of MKR delegated against the compensation formula,  Rplot01708\u00d7441 6.43 KB   MIP61c6: Modification of Parameters The parameters that can be modified are:  Threshold for a large delegate Exponential factor Maximum annual compensation per delegate Threshold for poor performance Threshold for adequate performance Beginning compensation scalar  Recognized Delegates are potentially conflicted in consideration of these proposals. There may be a temptation to approve increases in compensation and vote against decreases. Hence, a Signal Request is required to assess broader community sentiment and spotlight any positions on the MIP61c5 proposal staked out by Recognized Delegates. The Signal Request Poll must be posted at the start of the Frozen Period. The Governance Facilitators will aim to perform a review of the above parameters on an annual basis. This will provide an objective review of these parameters and take into account changes in the amounts of MKR delegated, the number of active Recognized Delegates, as well as USD inflation to ensure that Recognized Delegates remain fairly compensated, whilst also ensuring good value for MKR holders. It is expected that this will occur in April to bring it in line with the annual GovAlpha CU budget submission. MIP61c5 subproposals have the following parameters:   Requirements: 7-day Signal Request Thread, passing with 51%. If the Signal Request fails, then the proposal does not proceed to the Governance Cycle.  Default Feedback Period: 4 weeks  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Monthly  ",

Compensation is never an easy topic to discuss and I think (Recognised) Delegates need to get paid in order for this to work. I\u2019m curious to hear more from the delegates themselves but in order for delegation to be an effective, I think we need to create a situation where:  Delegates don\u2019t worry about gas. Delegates don\u2019t worry about legal/regulatory risks. This isn\u2019t to say delegates shouldn\u2019t be concerned with legal/regulatory risks; only that we\u2019ll have a hard time finding and retaining good delegates if they\u2019re worried about going to jail. Delegates are able to justify the time needed to effectively evaluate proposals. In other words, if we want good work, we have to pay for it.  Ignoring Gauntlet, because they haven\u2019t been delegated MKR or voted yet, the Recognised Delegate with the least MKR currently holds 66.75 MKR. What if we set a floor and make any Recognised Delegate with at least 50 MKR eligible for a \u201cbase salary\u201d and use the curve to allocate additional compensation? I\u2019m not sure what to propose as a minimum for dealing with gas so I\u2019ll throw out 50/week as a starting point. Legal fees can easily run from 300-600/hour. Assuming a delegate wants 5 hours/month of consultation, we\u2019re looking at 1500 - 3000/month. If we stick with the low end of these estimates and kick in 1000 for their time, we could start at 2700 or just round up to 3000/month/delegate as the base. ",

I personally think including a cap doesn\u2019t have any downsides and is a good safety feature to have so it\u2019s more of a suggestion from my point of view. ",

Given the difficulty in attracting and retaining delegates, I\u2019d suggest that we move to a higher maximum annual compensation per delegate. To give a little more colour here, we\u2019re seeing delegates unwilling to accept the legal and regulatory uncertainty at the proposed rate of compensation. I think it\u2019s unlikely that this uncertainty is going to go away at any point in the near future. If we don\u2019t increase this, I think we will end up in a situation where delegated MKR continues to centralize to only a handful of delegates. Given that we\u2019ve clearly undershot initial compensation here I would propose leaning towards overcorrection rather than further exacerbating the issue. I\u2019d suggest increasing it 3x the current value to 144k. This is roughly equivalent to a CU facilitator at >10k MKR delegated. To avoid low quality delegate spam. I would suggest keeping the current thresholds for communication and participation. ",
