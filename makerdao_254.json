Monetalis wish to deploy the amount towards wholesale, green growth economy, senior secured credit originating from non-bank SME lenders in the UK. We have presented the full case for this request, in detail, for your convenience, in this document. As new documentation is added to the project, again for convenience, it will be aggregated on this website: https://monetalismip6.brick.do We appreciate your kind consideration of this request. Sincerely, The Monetalis Team  MIP6 Q&A FOR MONETALIS 1/ Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Ultimate interested parties are the founders of Monetalis: Allan Pedersen - https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanio/ Alessio Marinelli - https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinellialessio/ 2/ Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Monetalis is a newly designed, from the ground up, wholesale lending business squarely focused on bringing the MakerDAO collateralization model into the traditional wholesale SME lending world, first in the UK and subsequently in the EU. We have developed it to do so on an institutional-level scale, with a complete bond issuance and securitization model, and, importantly, with a strong green growth economy mission at the center of our business. 3/ Provide a brief history of the project The project is the product of having followed the RWA MakerDAO Community for months and devising a business model we believe would serve the MakerDAO RWA strategy, as we understand it, well. 4/ Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Our principal documentation on the project is this document: and further documents on the project will be found here: https://monetalismip6.brick.do 5/ Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. A formal review of the legal structure is forthcoming and will be provided to the community when ready. The IT system - in particular the interaction with MIP21 - will also have a third-party audit and will be provided when available to the community. Lastly, on Green Economy and the Net Zero quest, we are undertaking a number of certifications and pledges, which will be shared also. 6/ Link to any active communities relating to your project. Not Applicable. 7/ How is the applying collateral type currently used? Not Applicable. 8/ Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Please read this section on our proposed legal structure. 9/ Where does exchange for the asset occur? Not Applicable. 10/ (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Not Applicable. 11/ (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Not Applicable. 12/ (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Oracle data will be automatically produced from our IT solution and generated from our raw lending data from lenders data-tape, bank account and account statements. We are working with a provider to secure the independence and validity of this datastream. 13/ (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. Not Applicable. 14/ Provide (a) proposed legal structure for transaction including, type of legal entities, (offshore/onshore, form (trust, corporate, other)) and jurisdiction(s) of legal entities, and (b) likely funds flow (DAI => Fiat => DAI). Please read this section on our proposed legal structure 15/ Provide details on the organizational structure of the interested party, beneficial ownership, governance/control, key personnel, capital/funding resources and past financial performance. a) Org structure and key personnel: Please read this section on our team. b) Beneficial Ownership and Governance/Control: Please read this section on our proposed legal structure c) Capital and funding for the setup of Monetalis is today provided by the founders and a set of private investors. d) As this is a new setup, there is no past performance of Monetalis. However, the founders do have substantial positive experience with SME lending and Impact Investing. 16/ Provide detailed summary of the proposed economic terms of the transaction, including, without limitation, commitment term, principal amount, interest rate, frequency of principal and interest payments, disbursement schedule, equity amount, funding ratios (equity/debt pro rata, equity first, etc.), collateral security, coverage ratios, currency (if not DAI) and other material terms. The quality of the proposed economic terms will be a consideration for the prioritization process. Please see this section on proposed financial design - and this section on Portfolio construction. 17/ Identify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address, without limitation and to the extent relevant, market risks, commercial risks (e.g., diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc. The various risk categories, we hope, are discussed within their relevant sections in the application document We will shortly release further risk studies on our expected portfolio here: https://monetalismip6.brick.do Generally speaking the business has been designed to be extremely low risk: from legal structure over underwriting process to core credit focus and collateral management. 18/ Outline the applicant\u2019s underwriting guidelines/policies, origination strategy (marketing, sales, channels), servicing strategy (charge-offs, collections) and historical asset performance. Please see this section on Portfolio construction and this appendix on Tactical Credit Guidelines. 19/ Outline the applicant\u2019s risk monitoring and operations guidelines/policies (e.g. charge-offs, collection, recovery provisions, data collection and technology, etc) Please see this appendix on Credit Operational Setup. 18/ Describe the regulatory regime applicable to the underlying asset (if any) and the applicant\u2019s legal and compliance program relating thereto. For all practical purposes wholesale lending to SME non-bank lenders in the UK is unregulated. 19/ Identify any 3rd party persons likely to be relied upon by applicant to implement the transaction (legal, accounting, servicers, trustees, etc.). Today we principally work with Reed Smith as lead legal counsel and PWC on accounting/audit. We are in the process of identifying appropriate trustees and servicers to match our legal structure, but do not expect to finally appoint these before they have been approved by the MakerDAO RWA team.

                    "content": "Endeavored to quick read the google document here MonetalisMIP6-V5-Final - Google Docs My understanding here is that such a project would be funded by venture capital to bootstrap the liquidity process (i.e. someone has to have real skin in the game before other players, banks and other investors will buy-in).   This is skipped with the view that MakerDAO can help bypass this step by providing initial financing. My issue here is that the vc often takes a pretty sizable share in such companies either via an options contract, or some agreement strike of % ownership stakes should such a company finally go public etc. You pretty much have all fees, and a .5% management fees going to the company and a 50/50 split of profits above the SF paid to the protocol.   You then say that 100% of the founding stake would be held back to cover shortfalls in this. My questions:   Why wouldn\u2019t Maker get a 50% ownership stake for effectively taking on the vc investment risk that can be properly structured to account for tax liabilities.?   Bonds from an initial supplier tend to not have a lot of liquidity.   You are asking for a pretty significant initial DC on a bond issue that probably isn\u2019t going to have dink for volume and market depth.   This will put Maker on the hook here for potentially quite a bit of bond issue where there is an uncertain market.   How exactly are you guys going to handle this?   It looks like Maker takes on ALL of the company risk and no-one at the company takes on any material risk here.   Where is at least one deep pocket partner that is willing to put their money where the companies mouth is?   And if Maker is going to take on the lions share of the risk why isn\u2019t the DAO getting the lions share of the profits/ownership until the people involved prove themselves?   (ala a kind of ownership vesting model that starts with MakerDAO owning most of Monetalis and dripping out rewards to the founders based on actual performance   There is a lot I like about this proposal.  A focus on tangible reduction in GHG production etc. Desire to bootstrap markets and liquidity Ability to scale into a space that could be 10\u2019s if not 100\u2019s of B A strong view from inception on MakerDAO focus.  My final question is on DC, SF terms?   Are you guys looking to basically get long term rates on this vault?  Or a better question how will not just currency exposure be managed, but interest rate exposure.?    I have already seen many articles suggesting serious inflation is on the horizon so we better get prepared for possibly significant rate hikes.   I want to know how Monetalis expects to manage this with MakerDAO. All in all an interesting proposal.   Ambitious, and probably lean on the what Maker gets for the risk it takes on.   I would prefer to see some other players have a financial stake here not just in Monetalis, but also in bonds - and some real company happening here.   There is some distinct appeal in getting in on the ground floor with a larger player at inception, but I feel like Maker with this 50:50 profit option should at a minimum get a 50:50 stake at a minimum and probably hold a significant part of the founder stake in a vesting/slashable set of contracts to encourage founders to perform over the period.    Point here is that both parties need to have real skin in this game and I don\u2019t see the mechanic where the founders have put anything of substance in other than \u2018future stake in the company\u2019 which at inception has little real tangible market value. Thank you for bringing this forward and I look forward to responses and discussion. ",

                    "content": "Hi @MakerMan Thank you for reading the application and giving it thoughtful consideration - it is much appreciated. Let me try to answer your questions: 1/ Maker only providing credit capital - Monetalis is already VC/privately funded I apologize for not having made this clear in the document: Monetalis is already funded by venture capital/private investors. That means we are paying for all the setup (team, IT building, legal setup and operations etc) and we are responsible for the continued operating cost of running the business - in fact several millions in private capital has been committed to the setup and running of Monetalis so far. Capital coming from Maker via the Vault is exclusively used for wholesale, green economy loans extended via non-bank lenders. Not to fund any startup cost or operating cost of Monetalis operations. 2/ Financial equation is built to truly share profit between Maker and Monetalis - not for Monetalis to make money on asset size related fees. In respect of these wholesale loans we extend, we pay Maker, of course, any agreed stability fee AND a 50/50 profit share (to ensure both parties benefit from our ability to negotiate interest rates for the extended wholesale loans). And the profit share is calculated via a \u201cwaterfall\u201d where we propose a 0.5% business operating allowance to us for operating cost AFTER Maker stability fees are paid AND any legal/admin fees to ensure the base legal/admin structures are paid. With the 0.5% we are to pay principal business runnings of Monetalis (i.e. 400M USD x 0.5% = 2M), which I can safely tell you is actually not a large annual budget for running a fully-fledged institutional level wholesale lender in the UK - particularly one that requires appropriate Green Economy underwriting and continued development to support a growing portfolio. In short, if we are to make a profit from Monetalis ever, it will have to be originating from the 50% profit-share - and certainly not from the 0.5% operational business allowance. 3/ Skin in the game/control: largest asset we have is being put up + substantive control mechanisms setup for Maker In terms of \u2018skin in the game\u2019: firstly we are developing a business squarely focused on working with MakerDAO and spending substantive private capital on that. As such, we certainly from day one have material skin in the game as we of course would like to see a return on all those investments. And should (in a highly highly unlikely \u201cblackswan\u201d situation that I can\u2019t even conjure up in my head - we are doing senior, secured with low LTV and we are widely diversified across classes, geography and lenders - and each portfolio have conservative default provisions build-up - and we have direct line of sight and control to the underlying assets for disposal - there is nothing synthetic in the credit design etc) we not see enough proceeds from the lending to cover a stability fee demand from Maker, we commit to selling shares in our business to pay for this. This is by far the largest asset we can provide as an underlying guarantee. It is worth mentioning, I think, that we have developed the legal and operational structure such that actually Maker has quite direct access and controls to the operations of our company - in a true spirit of collaboration. The lending entity (the UK entity) has a representative from Maker on the board and will be granted traditional VC style covenants and protections. This, in practice, from my experience in private equity, has been a lot more effective in preventing any non-aligned risk-taking/exposures, than skin-in-the-game commitments/measures. 4/ Bond: a path to a traded listing - but for now a technical listing The bond we are issuing is, for now, a technical listing/private placement and in place for tax planning purposes, ensuring a strong control framework for Maker - and establishing potential emergency liquidity mechanism from a Vault/MakerDAO blackswan event (i.e. easier to sell a well designed technical listed bond than a portfolio to an external party if absolutely needed fast). As we grow - and we start having the size and performance - we can start doing external private placements of parts of the bond or the full bond - to start \u2018mixing in\u2019 other asset managers\u2019 capital. Ultimately we might truly list the bond for actual trading etc - but that is quite some time away - and it is not a cheap operation to undertake - we need real scale to do so and should probably only be done if there is liquidity reasons to do so. The bond will also be financed \u2018step-by-step\u2019 on an agreed cash flow plan between Maker and Monetalis - i.e. we don\u2019t deploy 400M day one - it takes some months to do safely. I.e. there will never be a disconnect between end-loans issued and the bonds financed. 5/ DC & SF terms We have built our portfolio pipeline to match a 24 to 36 months duration and so a vault with some stability in SF terms would be ideal and obviously some duration - 36 months or so. Also we have developed this portfolio to be as low risk as possible and so the SF can\u2019t be too high - to compensate for this please do remember we have a 50/50 profit share on top - this also addresses some of the upward interest rate pressure potentially coming to the markets. On DC: we do believe a large vault makes sense for this type of operation - scale is important to make it work well. On the specifics of the terms we are engaging with the RWF unit to figure out what makes sense for all. I hope this answered most of your questions? If I missed something or you need more details/clarifications, please do ask! ",

Why not providing junior exposure as originators in accordance with market best practice and Maker\u2019s perceived risk profile? The mechanisms described (board sit, control of operations, etc.) seem more relevant for an equity, early-stage, investor rather than a super-senior lender such as Maker. I\u2019m sure the MIP requires extensive review but this crucial point is not satisfactory in my opinion as a mere community member. ",

                    "content": "Hi @chris Thanks for reading the application and let me try to respond to your well-taken comments: 1/ Track-record of key people I asked our key people to put together some more details on their relevant experience base. Allan Pedersen, CEO and founder I have about 25 years of experience in the financial services industry in mainly Europe and Asia. I have founded a good number in Asia and Scandinavia - and sold a good part of them also. Of main interest to this situation probably are the following roles:  I worked for TPG on financial services investments in Asia Pacific. USD 100M+ private equity growth/buyout deals. And have thereafter worked as advisor for several other private equity companies on similar sized deals - as deal advisor as well as in value creation and executing an exit. I set-up and managed, with 2 partners, an Impact (increasing financial inclusion) private equity company in Singapore, Triple P Capital, to invest in financial services in South East Asia. It\u2019s investor-base was 3 development financial institutions: KfW DEG (Germany), Proparco (France), BIO (Belgium), LGT, and professional family offices . The first fund was closed at USD 51M in 2017. Recently, in the UK, I have had a brief stint (6 months) as CEO for a Credit fund manager focused on the SME wholesale lending industry - until I started focusing on this opportunity of Monetalis.  If I had stayed with private equity my next \u201cstep up\u201d fund for own steam would probably have been raising a USD 200M+ private equity fund - and given it is credit (and senior secured at that), a USD 400M, I\u2019d venture is not a stretch. Alessio Marinelli, Head of Credit and founder: Having started my career in the space industry, specialising in predictive modelling, I have worked in Financial Services for over 20 years.  I worked for over 10 years in Management consulting with 2 of the Fours providing services to FS clients. My last role was Head of the Data Analytics practice at KPMG for HK and China Following a successful career in consulting, I joined one of my clients, a lender operating in The Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore and the UK, as Group CTO where I designed and implemented an end-to-end platform centred around proprietary credit technology I founded my own alternative lender in the UK providing short term unsecured loans to UK SMEs. In this role I have raised an managed eight different institutional funding facilities, including Block Discounts and RCFs I am in the process of completing a PhD in Machine Learning-driven credit risk modelling for SMEs  \u201cMr H\u201d, Head of Portfolio Management (cannot disclose name as person is in the process of resigning)  Over 15 years of experience in the UK\u2019s wholesale lending market working with top tier UK banks. Developed and managed whole-sale lending portfolios in the UK of over GBP250m.  Dr. Julian Frede, Head of ESG/Green Economy  Spent 8 years with KfW DEG (Germany\u2019s development finance institution) heading up a number of ESG efforts Developed KfW DEG\u2019s Development effectiveness Rating model and numerous impact and ESG studies  In combination, we feel we have a strong core team to deploy USD 400M++ on this particular business model. 2/ Viability of legal structure The legal structure is a plain vanilla securitization structure used for many years in the UK. We had our legal counsel write his views on this also for your reference here We have added some elements to the model to give MakerDAO even further controls and participation in governance than would usually be given to an institutional investor, but again done so in the spirit of collaboration and transparency. Of course the devil is in the detail and when we start developing the actual documentation (company formation, AofA, Trust Agreements etc) underlying the structure, we will work through it with the RWF team. 3/ Smaller amount and scale out The proposed business model is industry-standard for a small/medium size senior funder in the UK - and generally the EU. The Vault funds will be used to originate senior, secured credit facilities of GBP10m to GBP30m to non-bank lenders with a proven track record. And not many that are GBP10M. Realistically speaking there is, unfortunately, no investable, high-grade, larger set of senior, secured positions below these sizes in this market. Going below would adversely affect credit quality - and cost (due diligence, audit and monitoring costs remain constant per lender portfolio). So reducing the scale of the vault materially (and staying with high-quality lenders) would not allow us to achieve the portfolio diversification (in # of lenders) we would like to attain to manage risk appropriately (less than 10% of overall portfolio per lender). Also beyond risk and cost, I also want to mention \u2018attractiveness\u2019 as a key benefit of size. I don\u2019t know if you have tried convincing high-quality lenders/institutions to take senior secure positions from a structure that has a stablecoin as funding end-point, but it is not as easy as it might seem - even with a strong interest rate/terms offering. General media has not recently been kind to stablecoins and crypto - nor has many regulatory and government statements. So to counter this we\u2026:  Have a team they can trust and have seen before in the industry We use legal structures and agreements common to industry Our underwriting guidelines are proprietary, but still certainly in-line with industry Our due diligence, monitoring audit etc are all in-line with industry  \u2026and very importantly, we want to show, through the size of commitment, that this is not just a \u201cdabble\u201d, but a commitment from us and Maker to building a long-term, green economy focused, senior secured wholesale lending business. The non-bank lenders of substance that we want to work with, are looking for long-term partnerships and would broadly stay away from any funders that have a \u2018we are just testing the waters\u2019 kind of feel to them. The USD 400M vault, in our view, shows exactly the right level of strength in commitment. Not so small it can be considered a dabbling/test, and not so big that it would be considered half-hazard, but a strong, measured, entry into the market, with enough strength to have competitive cost and appropriately sized infrastructure to work with non-bank lenders of substance. 4/ Proof of business model working As probably you might have worked out from above, we are not innovating a lot in this particular wholesale lending business model - for now at least. Adding stable-coin as funding end-point and implementing a green economy screening into the credit underwriting is more than enough of \u2018business model changes\u2019 we can realistically implement and still be able to acquire senior secure positions with high quality lenders. To a large degree we are just executing an industry-standard proven whole-sale lending business model and the fact that we have a large pipeline signed up, we think, shows we are successfully overcoming the 2 business model adjustments above. 5/In practice: MakerDAO is in control Perhaps good to remember also, that in practice, given the legal and technical setup, MakerDAO is ultimately in control of funds irrespective of the size of the vault. Also as we scale and build out the portfolio over a 6 months period. I hope this provides you some colour and context to the issues you raise in your comments? Please let us know any other questions or clarifications you might need. ",

                    "content": "Hi @luca_pro , Thank you for your comments. Now, your comments, make me think perhaps we haven\u2019t made our business model entirely clear. Allow me to present an example so we are completely sure we are on the same page in what we are talking about (numbers are for illustration!): 1/ End-borrower <-> Non-bank lender A business wants to grow their business via certain investments, and so wants to take out a loan for 100 USD over 2 years for this purpose, and secure it against one of their properties. The non-bank lender would require a LTV of 70% (and a lot of other things we won\u2019t go into for this example), so to get the loan of 100 USD, the non-bank lender would need a lien/pledge/first charge on their property and it would have to be valued independently at more than 133 USD. Let\u2019s say it is actually valued at 150 USD to keep round numbers. Let\u2019s say 8% interest for this loan. So let\u2019s say borrower and non-bank lender agrees on a 2 year loan @8% of 100 USD secured against a 150 USD property 2/ Non-bank lender <-> funding via Monetalis and Junior funder Next step is for the non-bank lender to fund this 100 USD loan. The structure we would support is a junior/senior funder. I.e. a junior funder would take 25% of the loan and the senior funder would take 75% of the loan. Monetalis would be the senior funder. The junior funder could be a credit fund (many in the UK), a private office or in fact sometimes equity capital from the non-bank lender (not uncommon for the larger and stronger lenders). So Monetalis checks the underwriting and documentation of the loan and, given it fits with the agreed facility with the non-bank lender, Monetalis then funds the 75 USD of the 100 USD loan. The junior funder funds the 25 USD. The important part is, of course, that Monetalis has waterfall cashflow preference and direct access to the lien/first-charge on the property. Let\u2019s say Monetalis charges 4% and Junior funder charge 12%. 0.75x4% + 0.25x12% = 6% is thus the cost of funding for the non-bank lender - and so there is a 8%-6%=2% margin for the non-bank lender. But this is not a paid-out monthly margin (as interest payments are made and principal repaid), because Monetalis and the Junior lender would require the proceeds arriving monthly from the borrower (the 8% + principal) to be locked up until a realistic reserve fund has been built up. Usually this would be something like 5% of the outstanding portfolio amount. We would further require the lender to re-invest part of their waterfall margin through the term of their facility (generally three years). This will promote the growth of the assets under management and promote a compounded growth of the collateralisation rate. 3/ Monetalis <-> Maker Last step to resolve is between Monetalis and Maker. Monetalis puts up the senior loan as collateral on a ~1:1 basis, vault mints dai, we exchange DAI to GBP and pay the to the non-bank lender so he can complete the loan to the end borrower. (simplified version!). Let\u2019s say the vault has a 2.5% stability fee. We have 4%-2.5%=1.5% margin of which to charge 0.5%, pay legal/structural fees and ultimately share 50/50 in profit. So - at Maker level - we fundamentally have a USD 75 loan @ 2.5% stability fee + profit share protected by many factors - including, but not limited to:  First charge on USD 150 property that is enforceable Reserve build up and reinvesting conditions Ultimate USD 100 loan @ 8% available for pursuit Company Guarantees provided by Non-bank lender available for pursuit Waterfall cashflow preference across all parties easily enforced Profit-share build-up Certain portfolio protection terms to keep a portfolio healthy (such as the requirement that non-performing loans must be replaced by performing loans by the non-bank lender)  Worth here remembering also that the above described exposure is aggregated across many loans, many assets, many geographies and many lenders. In sum, the Maker Vault-loans are quite heavily protected from multiple sources. It would require a very substantive black swan event across the portfolio to penetrate into the Maker principal + stability fee aggregate portfolio amount. Specifically I hope you can see that with Monetalis all Maker vault-based loans are protected by junior capital (and a lot of other mechanisms including access to actual physical assets). I do apologize that this isn\u2019t clear from the document. Our share pledge is to cover any - exceptionally unlikely - losses that burn through all the protection factors mentioned above, including the junior capital. Our share pledge is another layer on top of the usual junior capital protection - not instead of. Again I apologise that this wasn\u2019t clear in the documents. So clearly we are not going to force a board seat and/or additional controls on MakerDAO, if it is felt out of scope or not necessary. The suggestion is purely made to show we wish to operate transparently (i.e. Maker representative on board), collaboratively (i.e. Maker voting on the board) and respect Maker\u2019s, in our view, basic right to steer capital deployment even after vault terms are agreed (via VC style governance rights and covenants). I hope this provides some context and potentially addresses your concerns? Any other questions/clarifications etc please do let us know. ",

                    "content": "Hi @chris Glad to see you digging into the material! A few answers to your questions: 1/ Liquidation question? You are correct that the UK SPV is managed by a majority vote, excepting, of course, the set of covenants and rights that MakerDAO are given. Basically the UK entity is the \u2018operating unit\u2019 that extends the wholesale loans and issues bonds on these loans. The BVI entity buys the bonds and the BVI entity is entirely controlled by a trustee instructed by MakerDAO. Whatever sort of liquidation you might be thinking about, MakerDAO will be able to achieve this via a BVI trustee instruction and/or exercising a right provided to MakerDAO under the Boardseat & right set provided in the UK SPV. MakerDAO will also be able to replace the share trustee if necessary. Also the case for the collateral and asset trustee for that matter. We will later release a note on the various trustees\u2019 roles and what parties we suggest appointing, so please allow me to explain this complex of trustees in that note. You are right to suggest we explain this in a bit more detail. 2/ Bonds The Bonds are issued on the pools of loans the UK SPV is extending to lenders. We will split into two bonds in the beginning (transition and green) to fit with our strategy of indeed providing wholesale lender funding to \u201cpure\u201d green assets and green transition assets. We expect, at least, the bond issued on the \u2018pure\u2019 green assets will be certified green (we are finding the right certification scheme we believe in) - potentially also the transition assets, but it is more opaque and we need to take a bit more time on figuring that out. The loans underlying these bonds are exactly those fitting under the strategic credit guidelines in the document - just split into two. In the long-run I hope we get to issue more green bonds and hope we can invite other funders into the bonds also (global asset managers etc) - true green bonds are in demand everywhere. I believe that would be a great way of further integrating with TradFi and giving more weight to \u2018a MakerDAO Greening of the world approach\u2019. In a longer run I hope these bonds can be listed for direct trading such that we can have the bonds being entirely liquid. 3/ Error\u2026will correct Well spotted - we certainly didn\u2019t mean motor vehicles - it should say electrical & hybrid vehicles - but perhaps more appropriately we should say clean transportation assets. I will edit the application directly also. Thanks! 4/ Balance sheet effect Agree that with USD 400M we are asking for a large vault and a chunk of the current balance sheet. My thinking, though, is that by adding assets/operations such as Monetalis to the balance sheet of MakerDAO you should see an expansion of the balance sheet rather than a reallocation ultimately. I am of the mind that there is an ever growing demand for DAI to \u201clubricate\u201d the ever growing DeFi economy and integrating DeFi/TradFi. I think the demand is so big that billions upon billions of high-quality RWA could be on-boarded - and there\u2019d still be unmet demand. But I am here only speculating of course. Please do keep thinking about it! We will shortly also organise an AMA video conference to answer questions and have discussions more directly. ",

                    "content": "Dear @Eumenes , Very good question indeed. If we compare Monetalis to a credit fund (\u2018CF\u2019)/investment vehicle, then I\u2019d suggest Honeycomb Investment Trust Plc as probably the best possible comparable. The scope of what they invest in/lend to is well aligned with what we are doing. Please do have a look at their material - they have a lot of details. As far as I can tell, they have a 1% mgmt fee and a 10% performance fee with a 5% return hurdle. They seem to be targeting a yield of about 8% to investors. We\u2019d actually be very happy to form a similar CF vehicle, use market standard agreements and work under these terms, but we actually think what we propose is better aligned with MakerDAO in terms of structure and financial alignment. With the Monetalis structure, compared to a standard CF type structure, I guess one could say that MakerDAO is trading away upside for down-side protection, low risk investing motivation, transparency and more controls (I might personally add the bond structure as well as a positive, because I think it has some very interesting long-term perspectives and options for Maker and Monetalis). In a bit more detail (and we\u2019re just, for simplicity, comparing Monetalis to the numbers of Honeycomb and sort of a common CF structure), one could probably compare this way: 1/ Management fee   Monetalis: 0.5%, but subordinate to paying Maker principal + stability fee and legal/admin cost necessary for the structures to persist. (if Maker doesn\u2019t get paid, we don\u2019t get paid)   CF: 1% - fixed - irrespective of return or capital preservation situation.   2/ Profit-share vs Carry/performance fee   Monetalis: 50/50 above stability fee + legal/admin cost + 0.5% Monetalis mgmt fee. (we don\u2019t have to push portfolio risk very high, as we get good profit-share - and hurdle is defined by realities of stability fee and cost rather than some set more or less arbitrary rate)   CF: 10% above 5% return hurdle   3/ Governance/Transparency   Monetalis: Deep involvement, very strong governance rights - and a strong reporting package   CF: arms-length (usually).   5/ Bond structure issuance   Monetalis: Opens up a new avenue for integrating TradFi and getting additional leverage - and longer term options for liquidity.   CF: No particular structural \u201cupside\u201d (usually)   6/ Legal structure/admin cost & \u2018licensing\u2019   Monetalis: comparatively low cost standardized securitization structure with easy movement of Maker integration points as regulations might change (i.e. from BVI to elsewhere). (we think this is fairly essential in a rather moving regulatory world for crypto currencies)   CF: Heavier cost and larger burden on licensing, regulatory reporting etc. Relatively more difficult to establish and move around as regulation may change.   The basic \u201cmotivational\u201d/alignment concept we have tried to embed in the Monetalis design is:   We must with great certainty ensure we get MakerDAO their principal and stability fee \u201cplus a bit\u201d- or we won\u2019t have capital to pay operations! (the subordination of our payment)   \u2026but we only need \u2018a bit\u2019, as we have a strong portion of the upside (50/50) so we don\u2019t have to push the riskiness of our assets to create very high yields.   This way we are motivated to definitely get MakerDAO paid and not \u201cpush out\u201d the risks of our assets. We believe this is the right way to motivate Monetalis to build a solid and secure lending asset-base with low risk. I hope that makes some sense of our thinking behind the design? ",

                    "content": "Thanks, Alan, for the thoughtful and detailed reply. I dont have a strong view on structure specifics but think this is a key issue for the proposed Arranger framework:  how does Maker structure deals with Arrangers that align them to Maker\u2019s goals and also provide a reasonable market-based,  risk/return to both parties?  The Honeycomb structure provides some guidance but to your point it isnt a perfect comparable. I expect that Maker wants the Arrangers to (1)  Originate high quality credit investments backed by high quality Green assets (2)  Be able to orginate significant volume of Green assets fairly quickly (3)  Provide high quality servicing and management of 3rd party servicers overseeing the credit investments and underlying assets (4)  Provide high quality reporting, controls & transparency on the investments and underlying assets Lets keep this key issue in mind as the RWA team reviews your proposal in greater depth and community discussions continue.

Yesterday, we got the signatory status of the UN PRI. This underlines our commitment to realize investments along with our green growth economy mission (upside). In the meantime, these standards support Monetalis heavily in performing on ESG risk management (downside). When looking at yesterday\u2019s World Economic Forum\u2019s global risks report, this is a business-relevant decision. A brief intro to PRI: PRI is the world\u2019s leading proponent of responsible investment. Signing PRI means you sign up to: a) incorporate Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes; b) be an active owner and incorporate ESG issues into ownership policies and practices. One example: Monetalis screens investments according to the UN PRI Screening Logic for Responsible Investment  based on an investment screening tool including ESG considerations and an exclusion list as well as a Green Economy inclusion list.

Users can complete gamified challenges (i.e\u2026 go meat-free for a week; switch to a renewable energy supplier; join a local climate action group) to cut their personal carbon footprints with clear explanations as to why that action matters and the impact it will have on the planet. It also leverages some aspects of positive peer pressure through a feed/follower social media type model to create a positive, carbon-cutting community. We believe the Climate App and our Carbon-cutting competitions will play a key role in bringing Climate Change down to an individual level within our lending ecosystem. Increase individual climate change awareness and motivate individuals to make good climate choices. All In a fun and exciting way. We expect to start deployment with lending partners in about April, and we are looking forward to having the Climate App fully integrated into our Green Growth Economy lending program.

I am confident Ocean Economy businesses and projects will play a large role in tackling the climate change challenge. I personally had a chance to dig into this exciting subject in a recent role as mentor to several startups under Katapult ( katapult.vc ), which is an Oslo-based VC and accelerator for startups focusing on Climate and exactly on the Ocean Economy. They have built an impressive team and portfolio addressing squarely the Ocean Economy. So the problem, in respect of Monetalis, is that a lot of the Ocean Economy businesses are today at a venture capital/growth capital stage - not quite at the \u2018large scale, safe, senior, secured debt\u2019 stage. So what we will do at Monetalis, is to keenly monitor the Ocean Economy sector, and try to \u2018jump in\u2019 as soon as we see some of these great Ocean Economy businesses get to a state where they can productively consume and merit \u2018large scale, safe, senior, secured debt\u2019. This should start happening in the quite near future I\u2019d predict. ",

We\u2019d like to present its current status.  Pipeline summary as of January 2022  Monetalis\u2019 immediate pipeline comprises of total initial **facility limits of \u00a3670m.**once at volume and converted in full, this pipeline alone could provide monthly origination volumes of \u00a3120m.  image779\u00d7269 14.3 KB  Figure 1 Current pipeline by stage The majority of our \u201cGreen Assets\u201d opportunities revolve around:  Energy efficiency improvements to properties Replacement combustion engine buses, taxis and personal vehicles with new electric and hydrogen ones  This is in line with our priorities to focus our funding to support the transition to the Green Economy. A more detailed view of our pipeline is presented below:  image1640\u00d7739 173 KB  Within twelve months Monetalis\u2019 funding will substantially contribute to the fight against Climate Change. With our funding lenders will:   Finance the refurbishment of over 2,000 commercial and residential buildings as well as the development of 2,000 new buildings making them more energy efficient and substantially cutting emissions.   Provide cash flow fudning to over 8,000 businesses to support their transition to the green economy.   Replace combustion engine buses that serve the Transport for London routes and bus routes served by councils across the UK with circa 7,000 new electric and hydrogen ones every year.   Finance the introduction of circa 12,000 new electric vehicles in London and other cities across the UK to replace combustion engine commercial vehicles and taxis   Support over 3,000 dental practises and opticians every year to implement the guidelines promoted by the Centre for sustainable healthcare (CSH) and the Dental Sustainability Advisory group (DSAG) for the attainment of Net zero targets   Help over 1,500 law firms to transition to Sustainable development and help fight climate change   Help over 5,000 homeowners every year to fund the installation of solar panels, heat pumps, roof insulation and other installations designed to improve energy efficiency   Support over 2,000 farmers every year to achieve environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use through the funding of land, purchase, and more environmentally friendly equipment    Reduction in emissions  Property development According to a recent report from a Climate Change Report (https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sector-summary-Buildings.pdf) UK buildings account for 23% UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. As well as behavioural change from occupants, it is expected that refurbishment of existing buildings or new developments can deliver the necessary improvements to reduce direct and indirect pollution. These improvements include:  Introducing insulations (wall cavity, windows, doors and roof) to existing buildings Replacement of gas hobs with electric Installation of heat pumps to replace gas combi boilers Introducing more efficient energy sources mix  Through its funding facilities, Monetalis will be at the forefront of these initiatives.  Electric vehicles The introduction of new buses on the streets of our cities will substantially contribute to cut emissions generated by single ownership cars. It has been established that the introduction of one new bus promotes the modal displacement of 50 single-ownership cars. In addition to this, the replacement of combustion engine vehicles with electric or hydrogen ones substantially cuts emissions, contributing to the attainment of Net Zero target. Statistics show that in countries where most electricity comes from renewable energy, emissions from electric cars are 70% lower than petrol vehicles. If by 2050 every other vehicle is electric or hydrogen, the world would reduce global CO2 emissions by 1.5 gigatonnes. Monetalis plans to fund the introduction of almost 19,000 new EVs in the UK every year to contribute to this ambitious target. At a later stage we will introduce sector specific measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases contribution, but we hope the above provide a good indication of the green credentials of our pipeline.

We are terribly proud of the fact that we have been able to get such a great list of investors to support our business, and we cannot thank them enough for the confidence and faith they are putting in us, except for now to put our best foot forward and turn Monetalis into a success. We are, of course, extra proud of the fact that many of our investors are long-term MKR holders and active in Maker and the Maker ecosystem. It is our hope that the Maker Community can take great comfort from this straight-forward direct alignment.  MKR Holders as Maker Ecosystem Investors More generally, in our view, having a set of highly skilled investors who are deeply, for the long-term, connected to Maker and looking to invest in, and support, the growth of the Maker ecosystem is a massive advantage for the Maker protocol. More investments will, in the end, equal more growth in the Maker protocol. We can only recommend that the Maker Community welcomes and encourages more of this. But, will the concerned Maker community member perhaps think, doesn\u2019t this lead to a situation where certain large MKR holders and investors start setting the Maker agenda and water out the Maker community? I say no, because, of all the investors on the planet, only investors with long-term Maker affiliations and MKR holdings,  will know that the crown jewel of Maker is it\u2019s active Maker Community - and that any actions that would have negative consequences for the vitality and growth of the Maker community would be detrimental to the long-term success and survival of Maker. This set of investors will listen to the community and respect the community opinions and governance processes. And should anything unintentionally go wrong in any Maker related process, this is the set of investors who will voluntarily engage with the Community to correct and ensure all is concluded as intended. So, all-in-all, these are exactly the investors we\u2019d suggest the community should encourage to participate as much as possible in Maker ecosystem development. I, by the way, also think the Maker Community sometimes is underestimating how resilient the community/DAO in fact is. Look at how a recent alleged governance attack by an outside investor was swiftly dealt with. Or how a FLAP auction problem is now also being well dealt with. ",

I think, before we delve into this, we need to tip our cap to Kermit, who already in 1970 figured it out and, in song, explains the world: \u201cit\u2019s not easy being green\u201d.  700\u00d7933 234 KB  As you can see in this chart the Green Bond market is growing very fast - but still very small in global context (global bond market is about USD ~120 Trillion). The market is showing a large set of growing pains: Competing standards and measuring approaches, limited (or challenging) connection between standards and practical day-to-day implementation, and an ever increasing set of actors with differing views on where this market should go (idealists, gold-diggers etc). As such, it can be hard to stay on the \u201cstraight and narrow\u201d road of Green financing - when that particular road is in fact not entirely clear and certainly will change as you drive down it. For that reason, we have chosen to focus on simple targets and built straight-line, equally simple, yet high confidence, measurable path-ways to achieve them. And only subscribed to a few key larger, general market standards. That way we don\u2019t overpromise, can work within most standards as they might evolve, allows for practical implementation and can easier scale. Over time, in tandem with market maturation, we would expect to add sophistication to our implementation methodology.  Green Goal:  Reduce GHG Emissions   Practical Implementation in Underwriting Guidelines (short-form):   Basis of review is use-of-funds for the end customer Loan: what asset/activity is the loan funding?   Do NOT finance the Carbon Economy (Monetalis exclusion list)   Do finance:   GREEN ASSETS. Purchases of/Investments in Net-zero/near net-zero Assets (Monetalis Eligibility List)   GREENING ASSETS.

Businesses that already have a very low/near-zero Carbon foot-print intrinsically (mainly professional services). (Monetalis White Asset List). NOTE: this credit class provides limited GHG reduction \u201cbang-for-buck\u201d and so will only be up to 20% of the total Monetalis portfolio.     Do require the Business to have a clear Path-to-Net-zero Plan (requirement for 3.b). (Monetalis Plan Requirements)    Validation in Practice   Documentation for Use-of-Funds   Documentation for GHG emissions of assets/business and/or relevant proxies pre- and post Use of Fund completed provided   Documentation for Path-to-Net-Zero Plan and updates   Quarterly random sample physical checks    Practical Reporting & Measurements / Carbon Accounting   Use of funds reporting (different per asset) is the key basis of reporting   GHG Emissions and respective GHG Reductions are calculated per loan based upon:   GREEN ASSETS: Carbon Economy equivalent Asset\u2019s GHG emissions minus acquired Asset\u2019s GHG emissions on an annualised basis.   GREENING ASSETS: Pre use of fund GHG emissions minus post use of fund GHG emissions on an annualised basis.   WHITE ASSET: Minor effect - not calculated      Next Posts My colleague Julian will in the next post go through some examples with calculations to make the above methodology completely clear. He will explain the various standards we are using to estimate GHG emissions of various assets.

Estimation result: : 1600\u00d7940 81.4 KB   1 - The logic behind is pretty simple  To identify our target \u201creduced emissions\u201d, we need to calculate the avoided emissions measured in tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e) - (  see info note 1 below) OLD (CO2 emissions generated before the investment) minus NEW (CO2 emissions still generated by new investment) equal REDUCTION (CO2 emissions avoided by new investment) The GHG calculation results in estimated emissions reductions shown in the graph as \u201cAvoided emissions\u201d  2 - Step by step with our practical example  We have two potential e-mobility investments in our pipeline. Investment 1: Substitution of 12,000 diesel taxis in the UK with electric taxis. Investment 2: Substitution of 7,000 diesel busses in the UK with electric busses. Calculating the concrete GHG emissions in CO2e is based on a) activity data (e.g. distance traveled and use of fuel) and b) a defined emission conversion factor specific for these activities ( see info note 2 below) Investment 1, a) estimated activity data = 12,000 diesel taxis driving on average 25,000 miles/year b) Emission conversion factor: 0,20826 kg CO2e per mile a mid-sized diesel engine  \u2192 Total emissions: 5,207 tCO2e per vehicle = 62,478 tCO2e for the whole investment Investment 2 a) estimated activity data = 7,000 diesel buses (EUR 6) driving on average 35,000 miles/year with an average diesel consumption of ~40l/100km (~0,2l/mile) b) Emission conversion factor: 2.51 kg CO2 for 1l Diesel  \u2192 Total emissions: 21,276 t Co2e per vehicle = 148,935 tCO2e for the whole investment OLD (total) = Total of Emissions generated before investment = Investment 1 + Investment 2 = 211,413 tCO2e NEW: The same is done for the new investments. The result is 56.338 tCO2e Happy to show this if of interest. Note: For electric vehicles, activity emissions relate to the national grid which in most cases is not 100% renewable energy yet. Thus, e- mobility is a solution sector but still, activities are producing CO2e emissions. AVOIDED: The two investments avoid 155.000 tons of CO2 emissions.   \u2192 GHG reduction estimated: 155.000 tons of CO2e          Adding some education on CO2 accounting:  Info Note 1: Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e) = how to add up apples and pears? There are several emissions in gas form that increase global warming (Green House Gas Effect). Besides CO2, methane is pretty known for this. We want to reduce the Green House effect, so we want to reduce emissions of all gases related to it. Adding these gases up is done by a technical normalization - the warming effect of every gas is translated into the warming effect equivalent in CO2 emissions. Thus, they are measured in CO2 equivalents. Here, a still simple but much more in-depth intro on this: GHG Emissions: Demystifying Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e) (era-environmental.com). Info Note 2: Emission conversion factor. Translating an activity into CO2e is based on activity data of an investment and an emission conversion factor. The emission conversion factor is scientifically standardized for the most relevant sources of greenhouse gases, foremost fossil fuels. As an example, burning a liter of diesel results in 2.71 kg CO2e. These factors are provided by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which are amended by other international and national institutions such as Green House Gas Protocol or UK specific Green House Gas Reporting Conversion Factors 2021  ",

And the basic turnover of cars will remain high - with 298,800 thousand taxis in UK (+2% since 2019) and an average usage of 4-5 years per taxi, the refinancing need to this market and the opportunity to green the cars is substantial. US market protections: I have a personal opinion as economist and development specialist on this as highly developed markets do not benefit by protecting industries while developing countries could install infant industry protection acts.  Happy to have a fireplace chat on this as there is no pure right or wrong depending on which stakeholder group you\u2019ve in focus. This can and needs to be automated. It is already built via Excel, where the calculation core will be further developed. The real effort is to find the best sources for emission factors and estimations on activity data of primary data cannot be collected. Once identified, it\u2019s only about updates and some checks/extensions. With a multitude of Asset Originators the attribution logic (who can claim avoided emissions) is also relevant. This had been difficult. Now, this is also a simple add-on in calculations (standardized by PCAF). In general: always happy to build a team. However, for this task, a good automatization and some initial research should do the job.  ",

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate Let me add a bit of color to Julian\u2019s answer: Most likely, we will be supporting the following e-mobility transition vectors over the coming years:  Diesel/Gas Cars/vans replaced with Electrical alternatives Diesel Heavy vehicles and buses to an EV/Hydrogen alternatives Energy etc Infrastructure around these \"Mobility-as-a-service\u201d  For now we haven\u2019t found any credible lenders, borrowers or loan products that makes sense in terms of 3. and 4. for us. We hope it will soon arrive. On 1. the transition is well away in the UK - demand for EV (electrical vehicle) among private and SMEs is way above supply. We have chosen to focus on lenders who look at fleet renewal, because the lenders are quite simply better, large and with better loss history, and the end-borrower more professional (and capitalised) about vehicle purchase and maintenance. Just for clarity - the taxi\u2019s that Julian mention above are actually not the iconic UK london black cabs, but rather fleets used by uber and other large scale hire-car operators. Very different end-borrower risk and underlying asset quality. On 2. we have focused, for now, on lenders who do large scale financing of public buses that are leased to UK cities for operating public bus routes. This is because the lenders again are larger with long histories of doing exactly this and enforce high-quality management/maintenance of the buses - and because the counterparties are very high quality. So, whilst we would love to support much more and much broader this e-mobility transition, we are ultimately driven by credit quality to guide us in terms of which of these vectors of transition we ultimately can put capital towards. In working with these types of lenders, 80 - 90% of the points of decision that lie in evaluating the lender, the risks and putting together an offer can be handled by the credit team who knows how to structure wholesale loans for non-bank SME lenders in the UK. The remaining 10 to 20% we need to discuss with a few specialists to come to a conclusion. For instance - in the case of EV - an issue we had to consider was depreciation. How much is the underlying asset - the EV - worth for the duration of a loan? There isn\u2019t a multi-year history to base a decision on like traditional cars. And the data that is there is somewhat challenged by the fact that innovation is moving very fast (development cycles for EV are shorter than for traditional cars) with large, hard to predict, feature improvement leading older EV to drop faster in value. On top of that you have these government subsidy schemes that - in focusing mainly on new EV purchases - may bring down values. And going the other direction is that with much fewer components, the EV\u2019s may actually last for many more miles than traditional cars, and the price of key components (such as battery) drops fairly rapidly. Coming to a perspective and a practical safety margin and scheme in the credit agreements on this sort of aspect required some discussion and involvement by experts from the EV/motor industry. The actual day-to-day oversight does not need specialists - it is ensuring the loan is performing and we have that almost automated via a portfolio managment IT system connected to bank accounts and credit systems etc. Should a non-performance trigger be sprung in the system, then of course the credit team gets directly involved again with the lender to rectify the situation. On a quarterly basis we have a larger review of each lender - including an on-site visit and random sampling of credit cases and detailed walk-through of them. At these quarterly reviews the experts will usually be consulted again to consider the situation. Important to note that all our credit arrangements with lenders are at-will. I.e. We issue a, say, 3 year senior secure facility to a lender, but we can at any point stop it. So the quarterly reviews have real weight in our decision making - if something doesn\u2019t look right or the markets moving wrongly, we will stop the facility - irrespective of whether the lender is performing or non-performing. We are basically underwriting our lenders every quarter. I cannot overemphasize how important this practice is in ensure portfolio performance. It is this \u201ctight-leash\u201d lending practice that ensures we don\u2019t see any individual portfolio\u2019s run truly foul. ",

Validation of our approach has not only been promoted by the ever increasing number of high quality, non-bank lenders wanting to partner with us, but also by other investment and partnership opportunities. In fact, we\u2019d venture, we have been rather successful in generating market comfort around having Maker as a senior funder. It required a dedicated market effort with a lot of face-to-face time, but after several months of doing this, we are quite proud of the partnerships we are being welcomed to participate in. Here are the highlights of the last month:  New Fund Partnership One of the UK\u2019s largest and best known private funds operating in the non-bank lending space has decided to partner with Monetalis. This fund provides equity investments and junior capital to some of the most innovative non-bank lenders in the country. We have discussed with them the opportunity to drive and grow our Green Economy agenda through some of their lenders. As a result of this discussion, we are currently undertaking due diligence on two lenders within this fund\u2019s portfolio. We are also looking to jointly grow a Green pipeline of outstanding non-bank lenders. This is how the funding structure will work for this type of arrangements   The private fund provides the lender with equity funding which will support operational growth and create the necessary capital reserves to absorb any potential market downturn   The private fund will also provide junior/first-loss capital funding to support the growth of the loan portfolio.   Monetalis will provide the senior facility that will enable the lender to grow its secured loan portfolio and assistance with developing Green Economy loan products with the identified relevant lenders.   More to be announced on this later.  New Forward flow partnership We continue to get more partnership suggestions, but a very promising one is this: Monetalis is in discussion with one of the Big Four\u2019s Energy Department to finance Green projects from their client\u2019s portfolio. This is a great opportunity and we are mainly worried about having sufficient capital to support the potential portfolio. In order to enable this, Monetalis has initiated discussions with two large UK-based mezzanine funds. Both funds are keen to collaborate with Monetalis and are now evaluating how to provide junior and mezzanine funding for this opportunity. More to be announced on this later. The origination of these opportunities have, of course, a lot to do with our team\u2019s experience base, knowledge and reputation in the market and the excitement around Monetalis and our Green Economy agenda - but there certainly now is also a lot of excitement around Maker\u2019s potential entry into this market via Monetalis. A great momentum has been built in the market for us - Maker and Monetalis - to build a great business on. And make a real measurable and visible mark on an important part of the UK economy and progressing its green agenda. Very exciting times! ",

                    "content": "External experts on Monetalis impact management approach  Are we ahead of the game?  For Monetalis, I spoke with Tristan Hackett, director at BlueMark, a leading provider of independent impact verification services, on our approach to be a Wholesale SME Green Growth DeFi Lender. Tristan is a leading expert on impact management systems and is interested in crypto.  First, we touched base on connecting crypto and sustainability \u2013 or more concrete positive social and environmental impacts. For Tristan, in crypto this is \u201cimpact/sustainable investment strategies using Crypto is super new and everything in the market seems conceptual. As far as I see it, nothing is yet implemented. While a lot of compelling concepts exist, it is especially the contribution part which is difficult to implement.\u201d With \u201ccontribution\u201d, Tristan refers to the three relevant elements of managing impact: it\u2019s about measurement, intention, and an active contribution. Second, we discussed Monetalis\u2019 approach to impact management. For Tristan, \u201cSigning up to the different initiatives will help greatly to be rooted. It will give ideas and guidance where the organization is going.\u201d. While he confirmed: \u201cthe frameworks you signed up for are really solid to think through a system \u2013 especially the impact principles\u201d, he highlights that it is now about living up to the commitments and getting active in managing data. Furthermore, checking regulatory frameworks will become more relevant \u2013 our explicit exclusion and inclusion list with clear references to market-leading organizations are here very helpful.  On data, especially on our target to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG emissions) Tristan is clear: \u201ctargets are only as good and helpful as the GHG data you have in place.\u201d He often sees data to \u201cbecome more performative than informative\u201d and often not really used to manage investments and a whole portfolio. Monetalis approach to follow the PCAF framework and push for primary data of our SMEs is the right way to go for high data quality and by this long-term credible management of the GHG reduction KPI. Many other institutions rely more on \u201cblack box methodologies\u201d and external data providers because they can provide a number and if the number is wrong it is from an external source\u2026 Tristan acknowledges that \u201cbottom-up data is difficult\u201d to manage and compromises on data quality will be necessary. Still, this approach is the best practice. Overall, in his view we are currently ahead of the game, as the overall strategy is translated into a clear screening and selection framework. From his perspective, this is exactly where we should be now. The next step and the hardest part to get it right is to transfer the functioning ex-ante criteria into a monitoring framework. This is the hardest to build and it will need feedback into the screening logic. \u201cIt sounds you are on the right track there.\u201d Thx Tristan for the discussion. We will keep you posted. ",
