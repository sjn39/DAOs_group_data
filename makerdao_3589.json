It\u2019s a crypto-based survey app that lets survey creators pay their responders xDai tokens for answering survey questions. This Dapp is powered by xdaichain Here\u2019s a survey I created using this app. You will earn xDai tokens for answering it! https://respond.cryptosurvey.market/surveys/QmSWyqCq47uPYaeEWmePg1MfTP7nrupmMTxafKm8AUR4RN Note: The survey can only be answered on desktop and not mobile for now. Looking forward to your feedback! PS: I am also looking for any community managers at MakerDAO who might be interested in creating surveys such as above? ",

It\u2019s strange, with Brave shields up clicking the \u201clogin\u201d button does nothing, even if Brave does not report anything being blocked. \u2192 Not nice, but ok.  Anyway, after disabling Brave shields, I am asked to register using \u201cPortis\u201d. Meh, I never heard about it. Not great, but ok.  Portis asks me to enter my email. game stopper, since I didn\u2019t even had the opportunity to read what the survey you linked was about.  At this point I quitted. My suggestion:  you should allow people to view the survey even if they are not registered (they will register if they think it\u2019s worth answering). You should just use metamask and no 3rd party services asking emails and who knows what else.  ",

I added portis integration mainly so that the app is accessible to non-crypto people as well (for eg people who don\u2019t know about metamask). But certainly, it makes sense to add metamask for people who know what they are doing. Stay tuned. Also if possible do try out the survey! Maybe you can give more insights after that too! Looking forward to hearing from you! ",
