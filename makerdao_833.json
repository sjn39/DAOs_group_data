How should we approach this? How should it be done? 58:24 - Asad Khan: How do Maker\u2019s RWA borrowing rates compare to market rates? 59:58 - Frank Cruz: What are some of the steps taken in TradeFi to monitor loans? Who is on the ground visiting sites? 1:01:53 - Juan: What is the best way to contact you?  Closing Comment  Juan  Outro 1:02:35  Thanks to everyone for coming and participating.
