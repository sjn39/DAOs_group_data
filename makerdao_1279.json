                    "content": "Dear Maker community, As previously announced, SES Legal Research seeks to bootstrap a Self Insurance Fund (SIF) to cover legal and liability risks of exposed MakerDAO stakeholders. In its first phase, the Fund would cover legal costs of defense if a DAO member is target of a legal or regulatory action. The SIF is a flexible risk management instrument that can be tailor-made to meet the needs of MakerDAO and adapted to the novel characteristics of a decentralized organization. The SIF is the first layer of a comprehensive legal risk management framework to be designed and implemented at MakerDAO over the next years. SES Legal Research, supported by risk management firms Artex and Gallagher, is undertaking a feasibility study for structuring the fund. In the first phase of the study, we are evaluating potential segments of insured persons and their respective legal risk exposure. For this purpose, SES Legal Research will conduct exploratory surveys with different stakeholder groups of MakerDAO. The first series of surveys will be sent to @Recognized-Delegates and @Core-Facilitators. We thank you in advance for your collaboration! Please get in touch with @SES-Core-Unit in case you have questions or suggestions. We have the opportunity to collectively design a novel instrument to transfer and mitigate some of the novel risks to which MakerDAO participants are exposed. ",

I had a few questions that I sent back to @layerzero by DM but thought they might also be valuable for other @Recognized-Delegates to consider and know the answers. In what way are the responses confidential? Who will have access to the information? Is there a written NDA or confidentiality agreement that covers the provision of this information and how it may be used? Who are the parties to that agreement and may I see a copy? Where is the information stored and what is the data security and applicable permission settings for user access to this storage location? Can you provide a version showing all the questions at once, so I can assess whether I want to participate, and further determine if any of the information requested would be problematic from my own assessment of privacy and legal/regulatory risk for ACREinvest and its affiliates.
