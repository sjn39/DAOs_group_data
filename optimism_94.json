My suggestion is that if you are a delegate, have self-delegated or will be influencing your delegate, then vote wisely by:  Reading all the Proposals in full, and also read the Proposal Replies in full (these Replies give Proposers more time to explain their project outside of the Word Limit enforced in the Proposal). If you don\u2019t understand something in a Proposal, then seek clarity via questioning the proposer in a Reply. I assume all Proposal creators are more than willing to spend all the time you need explaining concepts and ideas so you can understand things and helps you vote \u2018For\u2019 their Proposal.  That\u2019s just my two cents. Kind regards, Axel ",

This proposal has been repeating itself in various forms and I have personally stated and noted the values this will bring to OP. Optimism should not be underrated with the caption just \u201cgovernance tokens\u201d. It should be more. In fact, it is more! The network is big, fast and cheap. Whether or not they are scaling Ethereum, it still remains a blockchain of itself, a network of different dapps and projects! Let $OP rule. More utility, more demands\u2705 ",
