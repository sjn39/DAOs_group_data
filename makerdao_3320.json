Since the launch of MCD more than 20 different collateral types have been onboarded and more than 2B DAI have been minted However, it has always been one of the long term goals of Maker to expand not only in terms of collateral types (including real world assets), but also on providing stablecoins pegged to other currencies  This would not only be helpful for growth outside of USD-using countries, but would certainly also help on onboarding more real world assets as collateral The discussion thread on EuroDAI generated a lot of interest.   Declaration Detail  MakerDao should investigate about and build a subprotocol providing a DAI-like stablecoin pegged to the official currency of the European Union (\u20ac) The investigation should be contained by the following elements: The subprotocol must be controlled and governed by the Maker Protocol Debt auctions in the subsystem should not dilute MKR (not flopping MKR) until governance decide otherwise Surplus auctions in the subsystem should be beneficiary to MKR holders (flapping MKR if possible)   Operational resources While limited to exploratory and analysis work, this declaration of intent might trigger some costs (e.g. technical resources). MakerDAO intends to devote up to 50k DAI to this declaration of intent managed by the mandated actors multisig.  Relevant Links  [Discussion] EuroDAI  ",

It seems to me that adding eurDAI (and jpyDAI, gbpDAI, audDAI, etc) is a pretty small change to the system. I understand that we want to start with low debt ceilings at the outset, but otherwise the system should be identical to the usdDAI system. I speculate that any divergence between the systems would create extra work. ",

Not fully thought through, but we could do something like selling zero coupon bonds at \u2018flop\u2019 and settle them at \u2018flap\u2019. SB would be SB + outstanding bonds - only if this is filled traditional flaps will happen. imho this would be interesting to investigate in any case - if we eventually will have a bunch of stablecoins it might make sense to isolate risks (to a certain extend, could be configurable by governance how much of those bonds shall be sold at max) before a MKR backstop would kick in.

The EUR-stablecoin is so underserved that this shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Obviously, that means more risk for eurDAI holders meaning growth will be a bit harder and the SB will be super important limiting a lot the ability to flap. @ultraschuppi has also teased an idea of bonds to solve a bit this issue.
