I will hold open \u201cOffice Hours\u201d on Monday, June 20th at 3pm EST | 7pm UTC for any members of the community to attend and ask me anything (AMA). See zoom info below. The call will not be recorded. At ACREinvest we seek to regenerate the way global capital markets work and for whom. We are drawn to serve the MakerDAO community because the MKR ecosystem has the potential to be the most powerful lever in all of decentralized finance for the benefit of humanity and world. And not just DeFi,  All-Fi! My individual mission is to participate in transitioning our world system from one that enslaves humanity by virtue of a variety of corrupt, clandestine, illegitimate and exploitive tactics to one that is honest, transparent, trustworthy and regenerative. Accordingly, ACREinvest values core crypto principles of decentralization, transparency, consensus, cooperation, liberty and privacy. Nation states rise and fall, but freedom is an intangible we must insist upon for humanity in whatever system emerges from our Current Struggle. Without a medium of exchange and stable store of value that is freely available to be held and used permissionlessly and privately by all who would work for it honestly, there can be no liberty. Many of you know that I\u2019m a lawyer admitted to practice in New York State, USA. I graduated from Yale Law School in 1998. I value the rule of law. I stand with laws that serve humanity and not the other way around. Never forget that we are the authors of our laws. When laws become corrupt and destructive, we must change them in legitimate ways that are open, and that follow the consensus established for how such rules may be changed. Any new consensus must be honestly won to be sustainable. In our service to MakerDAO, ACREinvest supports accelerating decentralization in a way that does not promote lawlessness and illegitimate use within the protocol, social or governance layers. I welcome the opportunity to devote more time and focus to this community according to how you decide governance should evolve, and invite your feedback at this meeting or at future Office Hours. \u201cWithout common ideas, there is no common action, and without common action men still exist, but a social body does not. Thus in order that there be society, and all the more, that this society prosper, it is necessary that all the minds of the citizens always be brought together and held together by some principle ideas\u201d \u2015 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America Kianga Daverington is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
