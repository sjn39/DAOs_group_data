                    "content": "Hi Everyone, I just wanted to create an informal poll to temperature check the community into whether they liked the idea of changing the FLAP auction methodology to instead be a smart contract that market sells DAI for MKR and burns it. Pros Market efficiency due to lower auction slippage Immediately affects MKR price More gas efficient? Cons Opens up potential market manipulation as is dependant on one LP Less choice for auction participants to receive a good deal More dependancy on external markets (more governance overhead if liquidity dries up on specific pool)  Should the current implementation of FLAP auctions be changed to market sell lots of DAI on a protocol like Uniswap (eg. ETH/MKR pool)?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     One thing I am unsure of is whether liquidations 2.0 will change the functionality of FLAP auctions as well (or could be implemented to do so). If the dutch auction system proposed was also used for FLAPs that may work as well. I\u2019ll run this poll until 2020-12-11T05:00:00Z to give ample time for discussion and participation.  Next Steps If \u201cYes\u201d wins this will signal that the community is interested in further pursuing this idea. A possible next step would be to create a declaration of intent (MIP13) for the smart contract team to implement this proposal. Edit: @cmooney and @equivrel have informed me as to why this implementation is not recommended and that Liquidation 2.0 (Dutch auctions) will be the preferred implementation once developed. I\u2019ll leave this poll open as well as discussion but I think it\u2019s clear that while an interesting idea, is not an optimal solution.
