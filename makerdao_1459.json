                    "content": "With the extreme market changes we have seen in the past week, we have decided now would be a good time to once again engage in discussion about shutting down Single Collateral Dai. During today\u2019s call, @Primoz presented information on the state of SCD here Governance and Risk Meeting: Ep. 78 - YouTube. In summary of his findings it became apparent that peg instability and liquidity issues were beginning to hinder the efficiency of the protocol. Liquidations were no longer taking place in an ideal fashion due to cost inefficiencies. This poses a great risk to PETH holders and the overall stability of the protocol. With this new information in mind, it seems prudent to begin advanced discussions on this topic. Several months ago I began collecting signals on the direction community members would like to take in shutting down SCD. A summary of the first polls can be found here:     Summary/Discussion of Parameters for SCD Shutdown Governance       The results are in!  After weeks of discussion and voting, I have closed the final signal polls for SCD Shutdown. To recap, with the community currently trying to maintain 2 separate Dai credit systems, I thought it imperative to begin the process of collecting opinion on when we should shut down the legacy system. Especially since there seemed to be a lack of consensus on the issue. This led me to begin with a signal on \u201cWhen should we trigger SCD Global Shutdown\u201d.    With this first signal I a\u2026     While the latest conversation about introducing a tax to incentivize/penalize CDP users can be found here:     Signal Request/Discussion: Should we implement a tax during SCD Shutdown to recuperate unpaid Stability Fees? Signal Archive       Based on ongoing discussions on implementing the shutdown of our legacy Dai Credit System (SCD), the latest is in regards to how we may extract the remaining stability fees from CDP holdouts. If you are unfamiliar with this topic of discussion I encourage you to read/watch the following resources:                [Governance and Risk Meeting: Ep. 70]      With these resources you should start to see the picture that is emerging on the decisions that need to be made in regards to SCD Shutdown.  Wi\u2026     Since both of these threads are now a little out of date I think it best if we reset some of the conversations given the new market conditions we live in. My goal in this thread will be to foster purposeful and meaningful discussion, and signalling, that moves us towards the end goal of SCD Shutdown. I encourage all community members to bring their ideas to the table in regards to how they would like to see this process play out and what they think are mitigating factors. Once some discussion has commenced we can begin to collect signalling on next steps. Some questions to begin discussion:  When should we enact ES? What parameters should we follow to trigger ES? Should we implement a tax on CDPs to recoup SCD fees? (see Signal Request/Discussion: Should we implement a tax during SCD Shutdown to recuperate unpaid Stability Fees?) Should we forgive SCD Fees? How do we find someone to clear out the migration contract before ES?  March 18th Edit Now that some discussion has taken place, I would like to begin with a few basic polls. When should we initiate SCD Shutdown?     Less than 1 week from today Less than 1 month from today More than 1 month from today     0 voters     Pros and Cons of initiating shutdown sooner rather than later Pros  Shutdown while price/liquidity are stable Less governance/risk overhead in the coming days/weeks/months CDPs may migrate to MCD and provide more Dai liquidity  Cons  Not enough time to communicate to CDP users No more MKR fees burned Opens up more ETH onto the market, could cause downward pressure on ETH price Could be bad optically. CDPs that paid fees and migrated to MCD could feel short changed. CDPs that weren\u2019t prepared to settle right now could be effected financially.  If you have more pros/cons let me know and I\u2019ll add them to the list. Should we forgive stability fees or try and extract fees in another way?     Forgive Extract     0 voters     Thoughts on forgiving stability fees versus extracting fees Technically we could calculate how much each remaining CDP owes in ETH and vote to manually extract that amount from each CDP. This however could look bad optically and would be time consuming for the Foundation. On the other hand, if we were looking to close later than the next few weeks we could signal to the community that a tax was being placed on remaining CDPs who did not choose to migrate and hopefully incentivize them to migrate willingly. All of the options to extract fees in order to incentivize CDP users to make a certain decision are much more time consuming than just forgiving the fees. Unless there is a more elegant solution that has not been brought forth yet. Forgiving stability fees is the fastest and easiest option. Optics are mixed because remaining CDPs would be happy but I would assume most ecosystem users are using MCD now and may feel slighted at having to pay fees unlike remaining CDP users. The obvious negative to this option is losing out on additional fees in the form of MKR burn which would have helped offset our Black Thursday losses. Additional Thought @Cyrus has brought up the point that before we initiate ES, we may need to find a willing party to absorb the migration contract. The reason this is necessary is because the migration contract is technically unbacked Dai and if there is Dai remaining in the contract at ES, it gets liquidated and at 4M Dai currently, there would be a lot of slippage. So in order to safely cancel out this contract, a helpful whale would need to mint Dai, migrate their Dai to Sai for the amount in the migration contract and then become settled in SCD. March 26th Edit Thank you to everyone for their input so far. Please go check out @Derek\u2019s post about processes and next steps for SCD shutdown over here:     Sequential Process for SCD Shutdown Governance       Hi all, this post explains the sequential process for shutting down Single Collateral Dai. The process involves two executive spells; one to protect MCD and the other to shutdown SCD. I will outline what these steps are and why they are important. As of April the 19th you will notice that the section in (B) Executive Spell 2, now includes updated steps, a timeline and request Governance Vote support.  A) Executive Spell 1 - Set the SAI Debt Ceiling to 0 in MCD   This action will protect MCD by p\u2026     Now that the previous polls have concluded, we can move on to the final forum poll stage. With \u201cLess than 1 month from today\u201d winning by 64%, we can now narrow our options down to a week in April. With the winner of the following poll chosen to go on chain for MKR holders to ultimately decide. Therefore: When should we initiate SCD Shutdown?     Friday, April 10th, 2020 Friday, April 17th, 2020 Friday, April 24th, 2020 Later Other     0 voters     My plan is to leave this open until Sunday evening/Monday morning so as to move on chain for Monday\u2019s governance polls. If we haven\u2019t received enough votes by then I will keep it open longer. Please remember this is just a signal and non-binding. As we know, things move fast in this space and changes may be necessary. I look forward to seeing the results. A note on fee forgiveness and clarity Since the voting was close on the forgive/extract poll, I just wanted to quickly discuss these implications. When inevitably put on-chain, the governance poll may be struck down for a myriad of reasons (shutdown too soon, would rather extract fees, etc.). Therefore it may be necessary to revisit the results of these polls and put together a different package to entice MKR voters. MKR holders ultimately have the final say and that is to be respected, regardless of outcome. It may even be necessary to redo the extract/forgive poll on-chain for full clarity as well as any other factors that may be uncertain. Ultimately, I hope that these forum polls have helped guide us in the right direction to passing what the majority of community members voted for. ",

I will add a link but it is looking like SCD auctions are not completing with DAI PEG around 1.03 SCD doesn\u2019t have a GSM so if governance needs to change anything on the SCD we can do it quickly. LFW comments that perhaps we should shut down the SCD now before we experience another collateral price drop. Pros:  Doing it now we should have a decent SAI PEG so people can move. Gets MKR off the hook for any liabilities. liquidations in auctions - none are below 100% Also this ETH freed might find its way into MCD to provide more DAI Likelihood of more DAI coming into system Can formally close down the SAI-DAI bridge. Better to ES this now than to wait for a market collateral price drop.  Cons.  ETH will be freed to come on market to sell. SAI will basically be an option on ETH - SAI holders may end up selling causing a ETH/USD price event.  Issues.  Do we apply a fee.   Honestly at this point since it goes to PETH this seems moot.  Maker gets nothing out of shutting down SCD. PR - do we telegraph this or just shut it down.   Personally I think at least a PR post giving holders a warning that Maker is seriously considering shutting down SCD for the sake of giving everyone a chance to finally clear out of this system and for Maker to focus efforts on MCD management in these difficult times. Any development or \u2018post ES\u2019 UI work may need to be done.  We don\u2019t want people upset they can\u2019t get at their collateral or convert SAI to ETH in the system. If we don\u2019t shutdown this system we just heap more issues on to MKR holders.  Based on the discussion general consensus of the small number of people participating is that it might be prudent to finally put a time frame on SCD shutdown.   Given state of the markets probably better to have this happen quicker.   So time for discussion is now. Total Maker could be on hook for given auctions/liquidation process is stuck is 15M-collateral value which will be heaped on SAI holders in the case of collateral price drop.   Right now it would be more likely for SAI to hold a $1PEG for people to clear this. Remember everyone has been warned multiple times the SCD/SAI system could shutdown at any time. ",

It was touched on during today\u2019s call, but there were multiple calls that we should take some more time to figure out the impacts. Naturally the Foundation devs are busy. They have indicated that they will have more free time after the FLOP auctions have completed, so we shouldn\u2019t expect anything from them before that point. Given that timescale, I think it is worth starting some general polls before then (which I will leave to Aaron to setup as he thinks is appropriate.) On a personal note, I think I would like to see SCD shutdown sooner rather than later. Given the potential for SCD users (both CDPs and Sai Holders) to come out badly in the event of extreme market volatility I think we should try to shutdown SCD as soon as it is feasible to do so. From a PR standpoint, perhaps we should communicate that this is being actively discussed? That will give users of SCD more time to consider their positions. ",

This bridge, coupled with the fact that we have just added USDC to the MCD protocol, puts us in a unique position to allow USDC collateral holders to mint DAI, and exchange this Dai for Sai, thereby draining the Sai migration contract by burning Sai for ETH and returning it back to MCD as Dai used to pay down the original USDC position.

Or just trading eth for dai? If the latter does this antagonize liquidity concerns for DAI? In general is this a process that the foundation would want to take to ensure SAI leaves the migration contract right? I don\u2019t see the profit opportunity exactly, it very well could be there, but I am unsure if that\u2019s suppose to the driving force. I am fairly uncomfortable/annoyed with how USDC is now being considered to deal with all these problems we created/let happen. We have no models or analysis of that collateral type. It was added as an emergency measure because DAI wasn\u2019t available enough for keepers to function (+other factors). Clearly all of this is being made up as we go along, (maybe impossible to avoid in reality, but users need to be made aware of that. ",

It could just as easily be BAT or ETH (albeit again there is limited supply).

At this point I think we\u2019re just proposing a mechanism - it would need some review/discussion with participants. All that said, though, I think there is a strong drive from the community to resolve this (it\u2019s an important milestone) as well as the liquidations victims list. ",

It is not that stable asset they want and they will sell the ETH for DAI (or other stablecoin if they do not trust DAI any more). It will cause a huge dump on eth market causing losses for these SAI holders.   There should be some amount of SAI used as collateral in DeFi.

Is there any quantitative model with numbers, how the SCD system may behave if the price drops f.e. below $69? I suppose there are some numbers on volumes and prices from last crashes and should be possible to make the estimation for the next crash, right? This estimation may be right or wrong (hopefully we will not become an opportunity see the reality check), but it will let SAI-holders to make a well thought decision. If the model predict a crash, well you have warned SAI holders and it is their decision to take a risk. It could make sense to create a gitcoin grant or contest for the predicting model like this. I would put some money into the bounty fund, I know few people who would probably support the grant. MakerDAO Fund could support the contest as well. We don\u2019t need a lot of money to make it happen. What do you think? ",

The free market is not ONLY the way to get SAI liquidty. It assumes, keepers have some ETH liquidity, but the assumption is not that wrong.  They buy ETH collateral, so they should have some price/time assumptions on it. I suppose, the real problem is not that SAI goes $1.03. The real problem, that on falling market keepers become better ETH prices on MCD (more than 3% off) so they move from SCD to MCD auctions. ",

SAI holders and CDP owners will not like to see their money managed by devs without explicit consent given or even against it. The poll here and the voting there is BY FAR not the sufficient communication with SAI/CDP holders. They will lose the trust and will get fear. There will be enough actors who will profit from making a big thing of it. MakerDAO should not only take its own rational reasons in account, but also irrational fears of the DeFi users and efforts of those who will try to increase the volatility. Remember the DAO fork story and don\u2019t repeat that mistakes. Otherwise MakerDAO will face a shit storm and then will get forked or cloned. ",

My point here is that the idea that SAI or DAI price will be stable at all times IS COMPLETELY incorrect.   IF for any reason either system undergos a shutdown (emergency or not) the SAI or DAI (depending on the system shutdown) PEG BY DEFINITION will no longer hold.   As to communication.  I think you could actually garner a good amount of consensus on a question of whether Maker as a community (not just Maker Foundation btw) needs better media PR management including official communications.   The problem - only the foundation has a real structure that can carry out communications for itself and what it feels is important in the Maker space.  The DAO as it currently exists technically DOES NOT.   WIth regards to media \u2018shitstorm\u2019 - honestly there are multiple \u2018shitstorms\u2019 at the moment so you would have to let us know which one you are talking about. Regarding SCD and SAI system.   Literally that system is being wound down.   I will say the following if you want to follow the Maker community then follow the conference calls, participate here in forums or ask questions in rocketchat.    There are people there like myself who will happily answer questions if they can BUT NOONE can speak for governance. When will the SCD be shutdown formally?   We don\u2019t know for sure.  Polling suggests people want to do it by end of April? What will this mean for CDP holders?   Pay back your loans or migrate.makerdao.com to migrate your loand to the MCD.   As time progresses it will get harder and harder to obtain SAI to close out your loans.   Expect the SAI price to increase and SAI liquidity to dry up. What does this mean for SAI holders?   Right now price of SAI is above PEG - last I heard 1.08 USD.  If you hold your SAI into the shutdown your SAI will redeem at maker for ETH collateral at the OSM price when shutdown occurs.  This means that technically the value of SAI will be reflected in the value of the underlying collateral.  Put simply expect SAI to trade with the vaule of ETH in USD relative to the OSM value.  IF ETHUSD price is above the OSM settlement value SAI will be worth more than $1 ETH,  if ETH USD trading below the OSM settlement value then it will be worth less than $1.   The net effect of this is that the SAI value will trade as ETH trades.  IT WILL NO LONGER BE PEGGED TO $1 - in fact it has already lost the PEG and is trading > $1.   Were I a SAI holder that simply wanted to maintain value I would exchange SAI for DAI or some other stablecoin. Will there be any fees during shutdown.   This has not been formally decided. If you want to see the steps for SCD shutdown you can look here.     Sequential Process for SCD Shutdown Governance       Hi all, this post explains the sequential process for shutting down Single Collateral Dai. The process involves two executive spells; one to protect MCD and the other to shutdown SCD. I will outline what these steps are and why they are important.  A) Executive Spell 1 - Set the SAI Debt Ceiling to 0 in MCD   This action will protect MCD by preventing SAI from being swapped for DAI. This is necessary to prevent exposing MCD to SAI liquidity and/or peg fluctuations. We will continue to allow DAI \u2026     ",

If MakerDAO makes the broader public think, it shutdowns the SAI not because of emergency but just for own profit, it will destroy the trust.  The worse, the more money people will lose because of forced SAI->ETH conversion. ES without emergency breaks both promises of stability and decentralization at the same time. The MakerDAO fork (clone) with fixed governance will come as the answer. Remember the chain of incentives lead to TheDAO coin split, and you will see similarities. ",

For long term SAI/DAI holder \u201creasonable time\u201d may be days.    The promise.   I have been wondering where all the Maker \u2018promises\u2019 are in documents because I am kind of wanting to see them to understand what has been promised to the greater community by Maker (whether this is Foundation or DAO governance).  Stable coins often have \u2018redemption\u2019 points where the redemption value is guaranteed to be $1 by some centralized entity.  There is no such guarantee within the Maker system.   Hence while the \u2018goal\u2019 of the community is to have the PEG return to $1 after \u2018some\u2019 time it is NOT guaranteed.     ethernian:   ES is not just \u201csystem shutdown\u201d, ES is \u201cEmergency Shutdown\u201d. The emergency is not given now. Thus the shutdown needs broad discussion and really good justification and public risk analysis. Both are missing currently, IMHO.    I have argued the whole \u2018emergency\u2019 part of the shutdown mechanics is relevant only to circumstance.  For all intensive purposes the ES machinery IS the only shutdown machinery the circumstances determine if it was an Emergency, a malicious act, or Governance shutdown.  In either case the SAME machinery and effectively the same result occurs.  Now in the case of governance a spell could be cast to trigger the ES and have other things happen either before or after this trigger so in some sense the actual shutdown mechanics are different from Malicious Actor, or in response to an Emergency. As to shutdown being a broad discussion.   Maker already has work going on which will lead to a discussion of \u2018conditions\u2019 for when to use the ES as well as what happens from a risk scenario analysis during an ES.   Yes these and a whole bunch or other things are missing generally. On that we agree.     ethernian:  If MakerDAO makes the broader public think, it shutdowns the SAI not because of emergency but just for own profit, it will destroy the trust.  The worse, the more money people will lose because of forced SAI->ETH conversion.   The whole first sentence is simply speculative.  Maker community has been pretty clear since release of MCD that the SCD would be shutdown.   I have been one of the few voices suggesting to keep it open but to simply reduce the DC and increase the SF to urge people out of it - while providing sufficient SAI liquidity or mechanics for people to close.  Literally if Maker waits for more people to close we make more DAI doing that than closing it now.   As to forced SAI-ETH conversion - NOONE is forcing SAI holders to keep their SAI.   I know for a fact there are a lot of people holding SAI just so they can get a ETH conversion option.   If anyone is holding SAI now that isn\u2019t paying down a CDP and the fact that SAI price is significantly > 1 is gambling, speculating, or uninformed.  To believe the system will just be kept open indefinitely AND for Maker to keep its promises for all eternity is just wishing and believing vs. scientifically observing the facts.     ethernian:  ES without emergency breaks both promises of stability and decentralization at the same time. The MakerDAO fork (clone) with fixed governance will come as the answer. Remember the chain of incentives lead to TheDAO coin split, and you will see similarities.   Anyone who ever thought Maker governance was \u2018decentralized\u2019 only had to look at the holders of MKR and governance voting.   While the GOAL is decentralization - governance is centralized to MKR whales.   At ANY time anyone can fork Maker SCD or MCD but unless they actually change how governance works they will still have the same system.  I don\u2019t see that ETC actually did anything better than ETH.  Literally the fork was strictly political and based on financial interests plain and simple.   Right now while anyone can fork the protocol and I don\u2019t see how such an event will help current SAI/DAI holders.   Who exactly are the folks that are magically going to come together to then provide the financial backstop to the new protocol?   What guarantees are they going to give and how would anyone know whether they could trust these new players any more than Maker. With the above in mind I agree with you on a number of counts.  MakerDAO needs to communicate better. a) About promises regarding any financial backstop with MKR governance/financial tokens, and promises period as well as the responsibilies of DAI holders, vault owners, governance, MKR holder, etc. b) About conditions for shutdown.  Given what i have seen what we really want is to minimize the cases where any shutdown is considered.  This is one of my personal goals with this protocol - but I am but a single small actor and I don\u2019t think this surface will ever close to 0 area. Improve the protocol to stabilize and secure it against bad actors with significant financial resources and time. Alter the protocol so that its functions are more robust and rather than drive the market reflect the market. Make this system sustainable - that fees pay for system operations, build a reasonable surplus for emergencies, provide for creation of backing capital pools to insure against risk events and create additoinal liquidity creation and removal mechanisms.  It is my hope that more people rather than harping about how the system has failed them, or how it should change, or whatever negative machinations they want to posit - roll up their sleeves and find a way to cooperatively help to change this system for the positive. My general goal - for Maker to be the first decentralied bank for the entire world - and we need all hands on deck not just complaining about failures - but helping to document them - change them - together. Is it a truism that a completely transparent organization will both have the best and worst results because, being completely transparent means every failure is open to public scrutiny and opinion far and wide, while sucesses undergo unceremonious and unthankful acceptance. These are tough times for the entire world, Maker is not excluded it is my hope we find constructive positive ways to move forward rather than descend into negative destructive ones. BTW:  I have earned not .01DAI for any of my contributions to Maker over the past 6 months.  I am not paid to be here.  So far I choose to be because I don\u2019t see anyone even trying anything better.   The same is true to me of ETC vs. ETH.  I choose ETH over ETC simply because I see more real work going on within the Ethereum Community vs. the ETC one.   Are there issues with all of these protocols.  ABSOLUTELY.   But I see this as a work in progress inspired by a number of actors over a long time culimnating with S. Nakimoto releasing Bitcoin solving a pretty hard problem applying PoW to \u2018trust\u2019 regarding a public ledger (that individual did not create this in a vacuum - the entirety of Bitcoin).  I believe if that if we apply work to this system as well as time to derive \u2018experience\u2019 we - you - I - and everyone else in these systems might actually change the world yet again - hopefully in ways that make it better for all of us in the long run. I think we stray off the OT from the OP but I think it these concepts are important to discuss generally. ",

This isn\u2019t a money issue but more a practical one. Put simply a lot of people work on Maker and the protocol is not self sustainable \u2018yet\u2019 we have a lot of things we want to do and really want to focus on a single system.
