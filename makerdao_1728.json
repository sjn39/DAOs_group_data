This sprint consisted of 3 development work streams of which 2 were released and one is still in progress. We extended the simulation suite and improved its overall developer experience making it easy to test the UI and the bot in different scenarios. Other than that we extended our keeper implementation in a way that it\u2019s now able to run it for debt auctions as well, now covering all collateral, debt and surplus auctions. And lastly we pushed forward our work on the barking feature. Today\u2019s release is named after a smallish German auction house, Bischoff. This is a tribute to some of our team members who are located there. No spotlight auction house but continuous and hard working.  Core simulations functionality (completed) This adds a developer friendly CLI interface to test different types of auctions in a simulated environment. Step by step this feature is part of the core functionality, so it can be used to test the frontend, the bot as well as other external tools where the possibility to simulate different states of the Maker protocol is relevant. We plan to expand this simulation suit with more simulations in the future and replace some of those which were provided by chaoslabs in the past.  Extend Keeper to bid on debt auctions (completed) The keeper was extended to be able to participate in debt auctions. With that the SAS keeper now facilitates all three auction types. Participation is of course optional and the keeper user can decide in which auction types to participate and in case of the collateral auctions which collateral types to be whitelisted. As announced in previous releases regarding the keeper everything is configurable via environment variables.  UI based barking (WIP) We started the development of the vault liquidation feature. For that we defined and added all relevant types and started working on the required components for the barking flow. In addition we defined the new service that will be used to collect all information on active vaults and to determine whether a vault is in a liquidatable ",

Today we are happy to launch the first version of the UI based barking feature. After proper investigation, conceptualisation and finally the first implementation phase, the Unified Auctions UI now enables users to liquidate undercollateralized vaults. With this feature the whole auction lifecycle from its initiation to participation is facilitated via the UI. Besides that we\u2019ve implemented some housekeeping improvements and started the preparation to onboard rETH as a new collateral type. The release is named Nation\u2019s Attic. The name is a little out of line because it is not referencing a true auction house. But the company is a famous auctioneer of authentic antique diving helmets. Why diving helmets? Because our barking feature allows users to liquidate \u201cunderwater\u201d vaults and hence we have no choice but to make an underwater analogy here.  First version of UI based barking feature (completed)  VaultLiquidations3104\u00d71974 563 KB  Just as for the participation in auctions the barking feature introduces a backstop solution. It allows market participants to liquidate vaults that are not sufficiently collateralized. A user can do this without any further preconditions (except ETH to pay transaction fees). In the optimal market scenario, this task is taken over by dedicated keepers. However, in case of an inefficient keeper ecosystem the UI constitutes a low barrier fallback solution that helps secure the protocol. The barking feature uses familiar UX elements that we have already introduced for the auctions. For example the narration based flow or the panel based approach. The final transaction page provides the user with all relevant information for the decision whether to engage in the vault\u2019s liquidation or not.  VaultLiquidationPage1364\u00d71140 78.2 KB  In order to close the loop we allow the user to directly engage in the auction that is kicked off as a result of the liquidation event.  LiquidatedVaultState1360\u00d7404 43.1 KB  Since we are introducing the first version of the barking feature today it still has its limitations. For now, to interact with a vault the user has to enter the vault ID. Good that we have amazing dashboards like blockanaltica out there that provide an overview on all vaults and especially those at risk. For the next iteration of the feature we are planning to show all vaults at risk without the requirement to know its IDs in the first place. We highly encourage you to provide us with feedback and we are excited to extend it in the future. ",
