In Dec 2018, Afri Schoedon proposed to write an EEP to define the Ethereum Network Upgrade Process. EEP-5 primarily covers Ethereum 1.0 upgrades. It suggested moving from ad-hoc hardforking to fixed-schedule and provides a general outline process with all required stages of hardforking.  It was also pre-announced and requested for collaboration at Eth Magician then. Based on the recent discussions in ECH meeting #8 and ECH meeting #9,a formal process of selection of EIPs for hardforks (Meta EIP#) is proposed   #1929. The ultimate goal is to have well defined process which every EIP author may follow in order to add EIP in next upgrade. ",

I would suggest the EthMagicians forum (mentioned in the prior sentence) be the source for discussions of an EIP, to prevent information dispersal through an endless variety of social channels. I would suggest to modify that sentence to the following: \u201cInform others of the proposal via social channels, such as gitter, reddit, and twitter\u201d which implies that these are not \u201cofficially sanctioned\u201d venues for discussion of EIPs (i.e. it\u2019s not listed as discussions-to formally in the EIP). That\u2019s not to say it shouldn\u2019t be discussed on other social platforms, but that any serious concerns brought up on such platforms may not be considered in the process unless the conversation is brought to the official forum outlined in the EIP through discussions-to.  This small language change I think would help to reinforce that the EIP has an official discussion forum to raise questions and concerns of the proposal, and to come to technical (and non-technical?) consensus on the proposal.
