My hypothesis is that the 3% minimum bid increase creates an opportunity for keepers to price out other keepers from bidding as long as they are the first to bid and stay 3% away from the current spot price. You\u2019ll see here that all of the auctions except the first have one bidder and they stood to profit just under 3%, making it impossible for another keeper to outbid.    Dai Auctions | Flap    Dai Auctions | Flap The place to see all MakerDao Auctions. Welcome to the open blockchains.      One question we can ask is, is 3% a reasonable take rate for keepers or should it be as tight as possible? As a MKR holder I would like to see this value optimized as best as possible for MKR burn. My signal request therefore becomes: Should we reduce the minimum bid increase required for Surplus Auctions (FLAPs), and if so, what should the value be?     0% .5% 1% 1.5% 2% 2.5% 3% (Current)     0 voters     ",

Auctions were to be new, we had absolutely no historical data, we assumed there would be no UI/UX. We weren\u2019t even sure how many keepers would be participating. Had it been set to, say, 1%, maybe no one would have shown up, and one lucky keeper walks away with a lot more than a couple hundred bucks. 3% worked well because it is what SCD keepers were used to earning for SCD collateral. That a keeper would come in and bid 3% under market to \u201cguarantee\u201d an easy win was an expected behavior. All that being said, I think the only way to experiment in these early days is to tinker a bit, and maybe move it down a bit. I don\u2019t really see any analytical way to determine an \u201coptimal\u201d bid increment. We can spend all day arguing about time vs price priority, but I just don\u2019t see us getting anywhere with our limited data. ",

As of the recent kick/tend winners, we\u2019ve seen consistent prices for gas of either 100 or 101 GWEI. This suggests that a gas war is not yet occurring. If a gas war was happening, I would expect to see the gas price vary either higher or lower depending on the auction. I would like to wait and see what happens for a few more months - that\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for 3%. If we see gas prices go up above 200 GWEI, then that would mean there are competing auction participants who would be willing to accept a smaller amount. If that happens, I will change my vote to 2.5%. If we still see gas wars happening at 2.5, then I will change to 2%. I like where you\u2019re going with this - no sense in giving money to miners that could go to burns, but I\u2019d like to see some more competition between keepers first. ",

Are you saying that there might be keepers who watch but don\u2019t send transactions each time? I guess that is possible. That would be the best case scenario. It ties into this question:     jernejml:  Also, what are the benefits of the having more competition   I don\u2019t want an individual keeper to dominate the market so much that all of the other keepers quit. If there is only 1 keeper, then eventually he could sneak in a crazy bid like 0.000001 MKR and nobody would out bid him. So if there are dormant keepers, then they could capitalize on this and bid the normal amount. Having a higher bid increment allows the keeper to lose some auctions (and still pay gas) as long as they win enough of them to pay for the gas they lost in previous kick/tends.     jernejml:  Also, are different auction types somehow coupled and we also need take this in account?   No, I don\u2019t think so based on the risk construct proposal has different min bid increments for surplus, collateral, and debt auctions. Also, after thinking it through another day I still prefer 3%, but I\u2019m not going to push too hard to defend this position. If you guys want to try 1.5%,  2%, or 2.5% I would vote for it. The worst that can happen is the keepers get discouraged and someone sneaks in the low bid I described above. If that does happen, I think the other keepers would learn from that and go into a \u201cstealth mode.\u201d So, it would only be a 1-off thing. ",

Like you said earlier:     Aaron_Bartsch:  these are theoretical problems that I think aren\u2019t realistic as long as profits can be made and there are enough players in the system.   This is all theoretical and we can only guess how keepers will react. I do think we should leave some meat on the bone for the keepers though. It is a fairly complicated task and they should be rewarded for keeping the system running.     jernejml:  I don\u2019t think you can really avoid gas bidding war at super optimal levels.   Ya for sure. The gas wars haven\u2019t even started yet, that\u2019s one reason why I think we should wait to change anything.     jernejml:  Probably largest mining pools could also be keepers and have competitive advantage?
