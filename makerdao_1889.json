This is due to some final testing checks that require additional work before deployment on-chain. PECU and SNE are meeting tomorrow (Wednesday 2nd November) to sync on our spell deployment process to ensure unified testing alignment across the various Layer2 environments. Working with the StarkNet Team and GovAlpha, the intention is to deploy StarkNet Fast Withdrawals in a future (TBD) executive pending completion of the additional testing work. A subsequent deliverable from the above meeting will be a spells-checklist to ensure sign-off of all tasks in the lead-up to deployment to make tracking tasks and sign-off easier and more transparent.
