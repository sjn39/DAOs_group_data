Remember the CFL and Warren Moon or Doug Flutie? These were the marquis names in some leagues that were NOT the NFL. In the last 70 years without changing one major rule of their game, the NFL absorbed the AFL, picked over the remains of the USFL and must acknowledge the XFL, CFL, Arena League and World League only in paternal circumstances where it benefits the NFL. Maker has a very simple decision in front of it. Knowing that global finance and all its players are the NFL should Maker prepare to merge and become part of the collective like the AFL? Should Maker rage on and prepare to eventually be picked over like the USFL for any bits of value? Or should Maker try to stay on the periphery of relevance like XFL & Arena Football and be the silly little brother that nobody, including the regulators, takes seriously? Personally I hate all of those options and nobody can  perpetually run and hide from big brother. Which means Maker will have to change the game entirely if it is to survive. E N T I R E L Y. ",

And there are no right answers and no wrong question. But more importantly, Greatness requires the ability to empower oneself when facing uncertainties. ",
