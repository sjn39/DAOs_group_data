                    "content": " Situation The Surplus Buffer is the instrument within the Maker-Protocol to reduce the amount of flaps (auctioning DAI when the Protocol runs profitable) and flops (auctioning MKR to compensate for bad debt or expenses). It also provides some kind of safety net on large market downturns to compensate for loss on the protocol to avoid minting DAI when the general sentiment on crypto is bad, the MKR price therefore low and the amount of MKR minted unreasonably high. It is a parameter controlled by Maker Governance. Historically, we have always tried to keep the parameter to a certain percentage of DAI in circulation - usually between 1% and 2%. We did this in several executive votes (see corresponding Signal Requests here).   Complication There are several circumstances that makes controlling the instrument more and more complicated  We have a lot of different collaterals by now. Some of them will probably stick with the general rule of 1% of DAI minted from this collateral, while others may need different values: DAI from PSMs should probably not affect the Surplus Buffer at all DAI supply from non-stablecoins has increased a lot - 13% over the last week, 93% over the last month, 1000% over the last year (live numbers can be seen here) Fueled by rapid growth of DAI supply we have two conflicting sentiments: \u201craising the surplus buffer to keep the Surplus Buffer in line with the supply\u201d and \u201cwe need to finally start burning MKR again\u201d.   Resolution I want to propose that we introduce an Instant Access Module that would allow any user to adjust the Surplus Buffer based on parameters decided by Maker Governance. We already have a similar mechanism in place for adjusting the Debt Ceiling for vault-types. I would like to kick off this pre-MIP discussions with the a proposal of dimensions that would need to be part of this new IAM and would be under control by Maker Governance:  Target Surplus Buffer For each of the vault-types ilk we set a desiredBufferPercentage which is the amount of Surplus Buffer we would like to have based on the DAI-supply generated by all vaults of this vault-type. Additionally, we introduce a system wide riskAppetite multiplier (>0, <=1), that adjusts the Target Surplus Buffer. The Target Surplus Buffer for all vault-types combined could be expressed as riskAppetite * \\sum desiredBufferPercentage(ilk) * daiFrom(ilk) Example: Let\u2019s assume we just have two vault-types: ETH-A and USDC-PSM     ilk dai generated desiredBufferPercentage     ETH-A 100,000,000 2%   USDC-PSM 100,000,000 0%    The Target Surplus Buffer would be (100,000,000 * 0.02) + (100,000,000 * 0) = 2,000,000 DAI  Growth Rate As many think the Surplus Buffer is far too low from a risk perspective but we don\u2019t want to stop burning completely, we need a way to limit the growth of the Surplus Buffer. The easiest thing that comes into my mind is that we introduce a new parameter that sets the percentage of change possible related to the difference of the current and the target Surplus Buffer within a defined timeframe. Example: Assuming we currently have a Surplus Buffer of 1 MM and the Target Surplus Buffer would be 2 MM and we have the growth rate set to \u201c1% per week\u201d. If the last increase happened exactly one week ago, calling the IAM would result in the Surplus Buffer to be set to 1,010,000 DAI.  Decrease Rate Same mechanism as for the Growth Rate - but I guess we want to be able to set a different rate here.  Next steps Even if my idea is immature or super bad or very important parts are missing, I hope we get some discussion going on. At some point the discussion might result in a MIP. Happy to hear your opinions and even better ideas!  Edits   2021-11-17T23:00:00Z suggestion by @LongForWisdom about a global  riskAppetite multiplier  ",

If there\u2019s a market crash and we drain a portion of the stability buffer leading to a corresponding drop in the Target Surplus Buffer we would have an opportunity to possibly have Flaps at a lower MKR price as we refill the buffer. This could theoretically burn more MKR (for this to work the MKR price would need to follow ETH/WBTC in a market crash - which I suspect it largely would but you can never tell in crypto). Obviously, a counter to this is that the worst time to decrease our buffer is after a market drop in case the market keeps dumping. Interesting to think about though. Maybe we should keep a \u201cwar chest\u201d of Dai funded from fees but separate from the Stability Buffer that could be used to Flap after an x% price drop in MKR to enjoy the best of both worlds.

I would request @Risk-Core-Unit weigh in on metrics to determine - seems they are focused on CET1 Ratio (Equity / Risk Weighted Assets) but if leverage/liquidity ratios are relevant we should use a combination. IMO, burning decision should be quite easy to determine, if risk metrics < defined risk IAM, funds flow to SB, otherwise burn. I think there should be hard minimum(s) on the risk metrics. For example, if CET1 Ratio is <2%, all funds flow to SB. If CET1 Ratio >3%, all excess funds are burned. When the ratio falls in the middle, the SB/burn ratio could adjust linearly until the min/max are hit. These values are purely for illustrative purposes. Would also like to see how risk is calculating the recommended buffer/values so the community can understand the inputs and pros/cons. I\u2019m not opposed to burning a small % of MKR whenever SB > 0 as well just so the burner is always on and there is no technical atrophy for flaps. @williamr mentioned the below in the recent signal request thread which I wanted to provide visibility to given the relevancy in this discussion.  Maybe a first step is to maintain clear and transparent documentation on risk weights for each single asset in Maker. Then a second step is to come up with a regulatory capital calculation first (standardised approach), before going on doing our own economic capital calculation.  ` ",

I believe in order to keep mkr attractive and fair to investors, a promise needs to be made to first burn, and then use the remaining profits for surplus buffer increases for risk management and expenses. The problem with simply increasing the SB at some rate is that while the stated intention is to burn some percentage of profits, in actuality the SB increase is prioritized and the SB cap is increased even when what\u2019s in the buffer gets reduced due to expenses or other events which result in a loss.  For this reason, I would propose that the growth of the SB cap be paused whenever the content of the SB drops below 1 week worth of revenue from the cap.  This would guarantee that you are in some state close to burning whenever an increase occurs.  If this is difficult, it can also be implemented less precisely by only allowing growth when a certain % of the buffer is full. Alternatively, you can set aside some % of revenues for the purpose of burning.  This doesn\u2019t have to be a huge amount but any guaranteed amount would provide peace of mind for investors who simply want some return on investment.  I understand that the surplus buffer has its value and importance but if all funds flow toward it for sustained amounts of time, the picture is one of insiders hoarding profits for themselves, especially if expenses increase proportionally to profits in the name of growth.

                    "content": "Hi @Traster_Tray ! this preMIP discussion is about to setup an IAM on top of the existing mechanics (Surplus Buffer to prevent any income to the System Surplus to get burned immediately). I see where you are coming from, but I am afraid the changes you want to make are more on a fundamental level and not achievable by a IAM for the Surplus Buffer.     Traster_Tray:  Alternatively, you can set aside some % of revenues for the purpose of burning. This doesn\u2019t have to be a huge amount but any guaranteed amount would provide peace of mind for investors who simply want some return on investment. I understand that the surplus buffer has its value and importance but if all funds flow toward it for sustained amounts of time, the picture is one of insiders hoarding profits for themselves, especially if expenses increase proportionally to profits in the name of growth.   so this can be achieved with this IAM (in its current state): even if we set the desiredBufferPercentage to a level reasonable from a risk perspective we could have a riskAppetite far below 1 so that the Target Surplus Buffer is not x10 compared to the current Surplus Buffer. If we then set the Growth Rate in a way that the projected increase of the Surplus Buffer over time is lower than the projected income, we will burn a (high, low - depending on the parameters) fraction of the income.

                    "content": "IMO all of these percentages really miss the whole point of the SB and are at best a imperfect heuristic for setting the stability buffer. I think what really needs to be done here is that you should be spending more to further build out the VaR models produced by the risk team in the past to determine this value. See: Governance and Risk Meeting: Ep. 86 - YouTube At the end of the day the real risk associated with most of these collateral types comes down to them being relatively illiquid and a large sell off by the protocol could possibly create large disturbances in the price of most assets resulting in losses that are quite large. The thing about that is that it isn\u2019t a linear function so no % based solution really gives you coverage as your risk grows exponentially as you take on more collateral. IMO until you sit down and take the time to re-evauate what your VaR is your best option is to keep burning MKR in an attempt to store your excess cash reserves until a future date. Once you have a robust solution for determining VaR then you could potentially consider some automatic mechanism for adjusting the SB but not before. ",

I took the initiative to propose a IAM for that, so we can agree on some more meta parameter instead.

Andy_McCall:  IMO until you sit down and take the time to re-evauate what your VaR is your best option is to keep burning MKR in an attempt to store your excess cash reserves until a future date.   Do I? I don\u2019t think so. I offered an initial proposal, and I never said it is perfect.     Andy_McCall:  Once you have a robust solution for determining VaR then you could potentially consider some automatic mechanism for adjusting the SB but not before.   To quote Voltaire here: Don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But if a shitty approach triggers other to get angry and come up with a better solution - that\u2019s exactly what I want to achieve. We all would benefit from a proposal based on VaR as an alternative. Maybe @Risk-Core-Unit chimes in here at some point es well? My assumption has been so far that something like desiredBufferPercentage would be sufficient from a risk perspective. If not, great. Let\u2019s iterate. But doing nothing (and especially not touch the SB until we find the perfect solution) is not an option. ",

In the past before everything was put on an IAM risk would set hard ceilings for each collateral, but anytime those ceilings were hit people would be on the forums petitioning for ceilings to be raised so you end up in a sort of catch 22. Where risk says \u201cthis is a tolerable level of risk\u201d and governance says \u201clets take more risk.\u201d Ultimately i don\u2019t see the \u201clet\u2019s take more risk\u201d argument as necessarily a bad thing.
