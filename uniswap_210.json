                    "content": "The \u201cLiquidity\u201d view in Uniswap analytics is not only hard to read for anyone used to traditional finance, but also technically misleading. Each vertical bar shows the \u201camount of liquidity\u201d locked at that level: not the number of tokens. In fact - the SAME \u201cliquidity amounts\u201d, at different price points, do equal different numbers of tokens and also different dollar values. Bizarre! Try hovering over the different bars, to verify this by reading the text pop-ups. Example (ETH/USDT @ 0.05%) https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x11b815efb8f581194ae79006d24e0d814b7697f6  image1241\u00d7584 12.6 KB  The technical concept of liquidity, required to run v3, has limitations that make it extremely user-unfriendly. If you are used to Binance, TradFi, or any other non-DeFi trading system really, likely you think and expect the (simpler) view of an order book. Example. The same liquidity pool above, transformed into an order book (see the relevant section next to the price chart) https://app.civfund.org/pro-trade/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2  image472\u00d7918 54.3 KB  The Civilization community built this: a layer to transform v3 concentrated liquidity data into the view that users expect. Running for well over 6 months by now. Since launch, we filed a patent to protect the significant development investment, from a community that is self-funded without any VC investors. However, our goal is to build a decentralised hedge fund and help DeFi get broader adoption. Our community would love to see more people benefit from this tech, so that DeFi can continue its march to overtake TradFi! We would therefore be extremely happy for everyone\u2019s benefit to contribute this entire order book visualisation tech to be integrated into Uniswap Analytics, either complementing or completely replacing the current \u201cLiquidity view\u201d, including all rights of usage, so long as a tiny \u201cpowered by\u201d acknowledgement would be added at the bottom. Might this be a helpful new trading signal and view for anyone around here? Have a great day! ",
