                    "content": "Original Accountability flow Jan 2022 Tl;dr - Reasoning behind rework of the flow - New format - Consultation - Evaluation - Timeline S15  Summary This proposal seeks to amend, improve and standardize the budget proposal process for Gitcoin DAO following extensive feedback across the steward council, the steward circle and workstream leads/contributors. The purpose of this revision of the accountability flow is to integrate the lessons learnt in S14 and ensure the new budget proposal process delivers the most value, alignment and collaborative consensus across the DAO. It is designed to ensure that any funding requested by workstreams is in service of and in line with the Purpose and Essential Intents of the DAO, improving transparency, accountability and accessibility when it comes to proposal review processes.  Motivation A process to uncover, refine and define the purpose of Gitcoin DAO became a necessity as discussions around what should and should not be funded in S14 started to intensify. It became very apparent that any budget request must be made in alignment and with direct contribution to the purpose of the DAO. As a constantly iterating and innovating force in the web3 ecosystem, improving the accessibility and transparency of DAO flows is the next level in better coordination. For our DAO ecosystem to flourish, it requires a mindful effort to improve on current tooling and to support better ways for DAOs at large to enable governance engagement and accountability across the board.  Current proposal framework Proposals currently vary broadly in their stated goals, format and monetary requests. This v2 of the Accountability flow aims to establish a better standard template to facilitate review and discussion. It aims to take the alignment started in the run-up to S14 and bring all Gitcoin DAO activity around a clear, transparent, quarterly dynamic for better alignment, contribution and transparency across the organism.  New budget proposal framework As observed in S14, most of the proposals ended up being amended at least once so a better distinction between stages should make the process far clearer. All budget proposals should follow the following format & flow.  1600\u00d7797 102 KB  STAGES: 1. The first stage of a budget proposal will be a DRAFT  the draft proposal will be posted on the forum showing [DRAFT] in the title and shared in the first steward call of the new season (ex. [DRAFT] Public Goods Funding budget request) the DRAFT proposal will then enter a period of consultation lasting two weeks. Feedback and discussion will happen both on the forum and in the stewards council call and should involve input from the community, stewards, the council and other workstreams. Workstream feedback is highly encouraged at this stage as cross-stream support could become a key piece of the evaluation flow.  2. The second stage of a budget proposal will be INTEGRATED  Any feedback from the steward calls and the DRAFT post will be integrated in this proposal and published to the forum - this is to ensure clarity in amendments, changes and evolution this stage can be on the forum for one week  3. The third stage will be ACTIVE  a proposal will move to ACTIVE after the consultation period ends and all feedback is integrated. This ACTIVE proposal will be setup directly on Snapshot and be setup with the following format:  - [WORKSTREAM] S# Budget Request - Full amount - GTC and USDC Equivalent - Tl;dr - one paragraph - Main season objectives - Link to INTEGRATED DRAFT for all info The Snapshot will be live for a period of five days. 4. The fourth and final stage will be RATIFIED  a proposal is RATIFIED once it reaches Tally and the funds are moved into the multisigs ANY proposal moving into a Tally should PASS. All decisions on yes/no are made in the ACTIVE Snapshot phase. Format: XXX workstream S# funding request ratification  The Tally vote will be live for a period of five days. 5. The fifth potential stage - should a proposal be \u201cdenied\u201d  In the event of a proposal being denied, a new proposal can be created using the following template. The purpose of the template is to create a clear delineation between maintaining status quo only (current operations and fulfilling OKRs for the season vs any expansion)   1494\u00d7930 197 KB  FORMAT:  Which EI (Essential Intent) is the WS in alignment with (ratified current version here) A tl;dr section at the top of the proposal summarizing the main focus for the season.This is for increased transparency and a smoother decision making process. A milestone report containing goals achieved during the previous quarter. The milestone report should include: who are the current contributors (marked as FT or PT) funds spent to date/season & overall any funds carrying over to the next quarter notable achievements for the quarter Proposal body Mentioning initiatives, objectives, and metrics Budget breakdown   Example Proposal Template: EI Add the Essential Intent(s) respective Workstream is focused on. TL;DR Text section goes here. Amount State budget ask in GTC & USD equivalent. This section should include the following note: The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send the requested $USD amount in GTC at the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower. Milestone Report Initiative/Dept Objectives Past Season Value Delivered Proposal Body Focus on essential work for season you are requesting budget for ONLY Initiative/Dept EI Objective Current Season Key Results Budget Breakdown Budget Category (Dept/team) Goal/OKR relevant to EI for season requested Amount GTC Amount USD  Visual breakdown (this will be created by @ChrisDean in collaboration with each workstream - an automation/templating of this endeavour will hopefully be in place by S16)  CONSULTATION: The consultation, evaluation and ratification period for proposals is to be extended from the cadence of ~15 days experienced in S14 (and before) to a longer process as of season 16. This means that DRAFTS would be presented at least one to two months before the end of the previous season. This is to enable ample discussion, feedback sessions and engagement across the decision making apparatus. Types of discussion: Workstream: xx CSDO: xx Forum: Comments and feedback should be recorded on the forum as in previous seasons Stewards Call: a space for discussion involving the stewards - this will involve the steward/workstream allocation we discussed for better insight Steward Council Call: a space for strategic discussion amongst council members to address any pressing or problematic requests EVALUATION:  Screenshot 2022-07-25 at 13.53.331190\u00d71212 75.6 KB   Screenshot 2022-07-25 at 13.55.471376\u00d7818 75.1 KB  *NOTE: not all WS will match ALL EIs *Any budget request scoring under 4 average across stewards/community may need to revise budget request Financial Evaluation:  1600\u00d7650 164 KB  A visual report of the budgets for all WS against the treasury will be provided and WS will have it accessible to include in their proposals. A more complex forecasting report could evolve from here where we genuinely look at short | medium | long term.

Perhaps the only rule here is that the new proposal must be up for 5 days unchanged before going to snapshot. This way the onus is on the workstream to take feedback for as long or short a time as is needed.     Pop:  EI Add the Essential Intent(s) respective Workstream is focused on.   Essential Intents align much more closely to Initiatives within workstreams rather than workstreams. Perhaps this should change. Or perhaps we simply change this to be at the inititive level Example = FDD Operations = FDD OS: Maps to Financial Stability & DAO Organization Initiative 1 = Grants Eligibility:  Maps to Grants Program Success Initiative 2 = Contributor Fraud: Maps to Grants Program Success Initiative 3 = Protocol Research: Maps to Protocol Adoption & Growth I think the evaluations would be best to apply to the initiative level as well.

I would change this sentence to \u201c\u2026cross-stream support will become a key peice\u2026\u201d   Any feedback from the steward calls and the DRAFT post will be integrated in this proposal and published to the forum - this is to ensure clarity in amendments, changes and evolution   It would be very helpful if the changes are made notable so the reader is not required to re-read (and re-grok) the entire revised proposal. This might not be easy to do in the forum, but perhaps revised proposals could have a section called, \u201cThings modified in this revised proposal\u201d summarizing the changes.   This means that DRAFTS would be presented at least one to two months before the end of the previous season.   This is a great idea. I was thinking about suggesting not only this, but that the workstreams actively SIGNAL their intentions in the forum. \u201cHey DAO, we\u2019re thinking of shutting off project X which will lower our ask by Y amount,\u201d or, \u201cHey DAO, we\u2019re thinking of adding project X which will increase our budget by Y amount.\u201d This could be done prior to the budget proposal going into \u201cDRAFT,\u201d so that people are familiar with the changes from previous rounds. The way it works now is that these budget proposals are \u201cdropped\u201d on the community. If it was more of a continuous thing with SIGNALS, it would be easier to digest when it drops.   The Evaluation Section   I am so happy to see \u201cfinancial sustainability\u201d explicitly listed as part of the Evaluation section. I wonder if you considered including a similar section in the Budget Proposal Template. Force the workstreams to discuss how their work becomes (if it can become) financially sustainable, or if it can\u2019t become financially sustainable, then how it supports the efforts of other workstreams that are. If a work stream isn\u2019t one of those two things, it should go away sooner rather than later (in my opinion). Note that I\u2019m not saying financially \u201cprofitable\u201d. I don\u2019t care about that. I care about financially sustainable. A suggestion to add to the Template: I really want there to be a \u201cbest practices\u201d section as part of the Template instructing people to avoid the use of ACRs (ACR == acronym). Every time I read a budget proposal, I get lost within 10 seconds because it\u2019s ACR-heavy. ACRs are impossible for regular humans to understand. Having said that, ACRs are useful. Suggestion on the template: If you use an acronym, please spell out its full name the first time you use it followed by the ACR in parenthesis.   We in the Group Against Acronyms (GAA) hope we can stop using un-explained acronyms in order to make our budget proposals easier to understand.   I used to teach business writing. This was part of lesson one. Not everyone reading your proposal is in on the lingo. Summary: Great work. I think all of this is super important. Don\u2019t use ACRs. ",
