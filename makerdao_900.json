                    "content": "Has anyone been impacted recently by supply chain issues? Any idea on why that\u2019s the case? Globalization is great, until it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s actually a pretty simple problem to identify, blockages. For example, automobiles require semiconductors. When chips to build cars aren\u2019t available, production lines slow or stop. Let\u2019s say we get some chips and start production again but then we have a shortage in one of the raw materials to build tires. Cars can\u2019t roll off of the assembly line. What just happened? We\u2019ve simply shifted the issue from chips to tires. The net result was the same, we didn\u2019t ship as many cars as we would have liked. Or maybe none at all. This concept of shifting the issue is directly applicable to what I see happening in the DAO today. When there is a blockage, enterprising people try to find ways around it. Many times, this indicates issues with a lack of direction. Personally, I\u2019m intrigued when I see these actions since it means people are paying attention. Engagement is a key quality for anything to be successful. What is important to understand is that shifting an issue isn\u2019t the same as solving the issue. I can be a shifter all day long\u2026I just make it someone else\u2019s problem.  It\u2019s About What I am asking is for the community to help us solve some really important issues. MakerDAO is a community driven project and it\u2019s not only critical but imperative for us to work together. Everyone, it\u2019s about Prioritization AND Transparency! I\u2019ll share with you that this isn\u2019t about collateral. It\u2019s just that the first clear manifestation of this IS about collateral. As one example, the shift from chips to tires with MakerDAO collateral is about moving collateral Prioritization and Assessments deeper into the process.  COB Process Flow-lines1393\u00d7717 80.6 KB  Moving collateral Prioritization and Assessments into the Implementation phase changes very little. We still have to prioritize the work keeping in mind there are also competing priorities within and between Core Units and collateral types (on/off chain). In addition, this shifting has the potential to skip an important phase where the community holds an onchain vote based upon detailed Assessments from the Domain Teams. Things like this come up to help us understand the risk we are voting on:   We don\u2019t believe there is a rock solid legal agreement to ensure the DAO will be repaid   On Emergency Shutdown, vault holders own a fraction of something that doesn\u2019t exist   If we had a significant liquidation event, we could take a 50% haircut on this token   We will always have an over abundance of work and limited resources. This is a constant in all organizations. What\u2019s the solution? With a clear vision and stated objectives, it\u2019s about focus and only doing the most important work. Decentralization doesn\u2019t make this issue go away\u2026it only makes it more challenging. By its nature, prioritization is a flawed process. It\u2019s about alignment, not agreement. It always has an element of subjectivity. It requires us to check out egos and biases at the door and come into the room with the common goal of doing what is best for the Maker protocol based upon higher level objectives. We also have to find alignment in the context of a profit motive (including the DAO) and building with the protocol.  My Ask I am asking the community to help us fix the prioritization issue. Today, we have a collateral process that includes a Prioritization phase and it\u2019s broken. Trying to ignore this and onboard collateral by brute force will not change that problem. During the next round of MIPs (May cycle), the community will see an expansion of this approach which will not only create more ambiguity but CUs spending hours of non-productive work in the forums and increased bottlenecks with implementation. If there was a simple solution, we would have done it already. I can talk for an hour on why Prioritization is broken. It doesn\u2019t matter unless we fix it. Help me do this by voting NO on any MIPs that include prioritization and/or blocking language. The reason I ask for this is so we can place all of our energies on fixing the issues and not moving the problem around. There is A LOT of progress being made right now and more coming to help clarify, educate, prioritize, assess, and share the progress of collateral being onboarded into the protocol. Given our current process, all indications show me that the future will be a collaborative process in which the community plays a much greater role than today. Please attend the CES CU Quarterly Update meeting where the CES team will share with you our progress in Q1, plans for Q2, and a bit more detail on the above. All ideas on how to solve these issues is encouraged and welcomed. Thanks! ",

The novel structure of the DAO means that everyone is looking for efficient ways of working. And not only here.  People are always looking for faster ways to get ahead by using shortcuts and loopholes. Fortunately for us, if we can identify the flaws, at this stage the system can be easily shaped to work more efficiently. This is an advantage over traditional, rigid systems that is key to our survival. We could decide to leave the \u201croads in the DAO\u201d unpaved for a good while yet, let people develop the paths needed for the DAO to work effectively, and then pave them later.     monkey.irish:  Has anyone been impacted recently by supply chain issues?

It\u2019s very clear that an onboarding can only occur if there are public verifications of the actual, de facto, implemented structures and agreements. Regarding general legal structure, and emergency shutdown (and other edge cases) these conditions must be verified:  No ability by third parties or Monetalis to access the funds or change the terms of the legal structure Maker Governance has complete ability to trigger a liquidation with a successful executive vote encoding an instruction to the trustee of the structure. It should not be possible for a single third party to block the ability of Maker Governance to make decisions or modify the structure. There must be no apparent weak links or edge cases that allow funds to get misappropriated or stuck.  If these things cannot be verified to be true by RWF (which would in practice be done by Christian), the onboarding doesn\u2019t occur. The verification isn\u2019t of a plan or hypothetical scenario, it\u2019s a verification of the actual, implemented, executed, de facto structures and agreements once they are fully set up and ready to receive the Dai. Similar verification is required by Strategic Finance to ensure the liquidity of the assets. Again, if the assets aren\u2019t verified to be appropriate for providing large scale liquidity, the onboarding doesn\u2019t occur. And again, this is a verification of the actual, de facto, fully implemented and executed agreements and structures once they are a 100% complete stage and ready to receive Dai. It is only in that absolute and fully completed stage that it is ever even possible to make any kind of verification of the security and risk of an RWA structure. But the reality is that almost nobody would ever front hundreds of thousands of dollars to fully implement and execute a legal structure before they have any idea if it will be approved or not. A greenlight or some other non-MIP vote or process isn\u2019t enough, if it doesn\u2019t control prioritization and doesn\u2019t guarantee onboarding at set risk parameters. The onboarding could always be delayed indefinitely, or even it it got prioritized there could be additional votes or decisions by core units that might change risk parameters or cancel it etc. Only a MIP has the necessary force to provide the guarantees that such things won\u2019t happen - the only risk after MIP approval, is a cancel vote that must be actively triggered as signal request, which is a risk that is much more realistic to expect legitimate collateral providers to swallow and give them the confidence to pay the huge expenses to get a large scale RWA legal structure executed. And in general I really don\u2019t see the problem with using a new approach, if the new approach works. The whole point is that for very large and valuable deals, the current process doesn\u2019t really work, and has gotten jammed. So the most important reaction to that should be to start building momentum by doing something that works, and start getting things done. We shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of moving from being stuck in the process itself, to then being stuck trying to come up with some kind of new process that will solve the problem. In the very short term, we should just focus on doing things and that\u2019s what stand alone MIPs are perfect for. Then once we have started to actually doing things, then we can look at the patterns and experiences of what we\u2019ve achieved, and try to use that to create a future proofed process. But as long as we are still creating the process, and as long as it still isn\u2019t done and ready to take over and be fully able to do the things we want to do, we should not hold back from making sure that our top priority is to actually keep doing things. One last important piece of context for this post is that I\u2019m only talking about large scale deals here, 100 million+ debt ceiling. We have so many billions of USDC sitting around that must be activated that IMO it only makes sense to look at possibilities that are actually scalable. And so a final but really important point to make is that MIP65 does not block or reprioritize large scale deals, since it has an exception for onboardings of assets with a debt ceiling of more than 100 million. So the worst case scenario is that it blocks or interferes with a small collateral onboarding. Waiting on small deals in order to enable large deals to go through is the essence of proper prioritization IMO. ",
