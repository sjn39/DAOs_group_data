We\u2019re planning to deploy to game on AVAX, but V3 isn\u2019t deployed there yet. We noticed AVAX passed the temp check, with no on-chain vote yet. We\u2019re wondering:  How might we accelerate the deployment of V3 on AVAX? Can we deploy V3 as a service to the community? If it\u2019ll take time to get to AVAX, can we deploy a small deployment just so our game has LPs, and then migrate to the official V3 when it comes to AVAX?  Would love your support please to launch our game with V3 pools on AVAX soon. Thank you! ",

I believe the main issue right now is that their bridge doesn\u2019t support general function calls, only ERC20 transfers between chains, so it doesn\u2019t support the desired governance architecture. Is it not moving forward because of the governance issue, or are there other concerns? ",
