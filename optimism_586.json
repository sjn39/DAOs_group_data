This unique financial primitive is built from scratch and is currently unique in the DeFi market. The hedging swap tool is commonly used in centralized commodity markets such as the London Metal Exchange. Metalswap\u2019s mission is to enable businesses to cover themselves from commodity price volatility using a DeFi approach. The tool is also useful for DeFi users who want to hedge against price volatility of crypto digital assets.  1600\u00d7766 139 KB   1426\u00d7822 96.9 KB  What are you building?: Our product has been live on the ETH mainnet since September 13th and currently supports three different digital assets on our DApp. Users can utilize the Hedging Swap Tool with ETH, WBTC, and WPAXG (a PAXG wrapped version), all of which are paired with Stablecoin. Moving forward, our project is focused on three main areas: 1 - Find technical solutions to include RWAs (Real World Assets) in our dapp that are also useful for traditional businesses that need coverage on the volatility of commodity prices. Our tool is in fact widely used in this way by many companies in centralized markets 2 - Deploying our tool on a new blockchain to reduce transaction fees for our users and unlock novel use cases 3 - Creating a business funnel to address regulatory concerns of traditional businesses Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: We believe that our tool has numerous use cases in DeFi as well as in the commodities business, making our project highly relevant to traditional businesses. We have created a sustainable protocol with a real yield business model, where the fees from Hedging Swaps are used to buy back our governance token and redistribute value to the protocol DAO. To add value to our product, we want to deploy the smart contracts on a reliable chain with lower transaction fees compared to ETH, which will have a lesser impact on the total commission costs. How many users does your project have currently?   Distinct Addresses interacting with our Smart Contract Tool - 131  distinct_Users   Overall Hedging Swap opened - 426 number_of_swaps   XMT Holder on ETH Chain - 1431 $XMT   How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: 1 - We Deploy our smart Contracts on Optimism and suddenly Our users will have a much less expensive tool due to a significant savings in terms of transaction fees. 2 - We will implement the system with three tokens that people can use to hedge against market volatility: OP, ETH, WBTC paired with USDC. 3 - We will activate the existing Usage Incentives in our system with our Governance token XMT 4 - We will use the OP Grants to distribute to those who use our product and provide liquidity as detailed later 5 - On the Optimism blockchain, there will be a unique financial primitive that is only present on Ethereum with much lower transaction costs. Users will be able to hedge against the volatility of their assets, including OP, and will also be incentivized to do so with the OP distribution program. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.:   Defi Users: Any Defi user who wants to protect themselves from the volatility of digital assets, such as Lido Stakers, Univ3 or Velodrome Liquidity Providers, are some of the most interesting examples that we discuss and will discuss in our blog. All of these actors would have a clear advantage in using our product on the Optimism blockchain.   Optimism Dao Members: Any member of the Dao who wants to protect their value by hedging against the volatility of the Op price.   Trader : the Hedging Swap, like any other financial derivative, can be used as a trading operation. In this case, our product has the advantage of having a predetermined closure of the operation, which feeds interesting strategies.   How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: Users of our product will interact with our tool\u2019s contracts using the Optimism blockchain, and they will do so continuously, given the usefulness of our product, the cheaper tx price and the possibility to Open new Hedging Swaps against OP and other Assets not present elsewhere. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:   Demo: MetalSwap   Website: https://metalswap.finance/   Twitter: https://twitter.com/MetalSwapNet   Discord/Discourse/Community: Discord   Github: GitHub - DEFI-Foundation/swapsv2   Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.metalswap.finance/   Other: MetalSwap Bug Bounties | Immunefi   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Hedging Swap Stats @matteov   Distinct Addresses interacting with our Tool Smart Contract - 131   Overall Hedging Swap opened - 426   Total ETH target Size - 100,07 ETH   Total WBTC target Size - 2,43 ETH   Total USDT target Size - 128023,00 USDT   Total WPAXG target Size - 4,83 ETH   TVL Stats MetalSwap: TVL and Stats - DefiLlama   Ethereum - 841 k USD (Hedging Swap Liquidity included)   Bnb Chain - 302k USD   Polygon - 36k USD   Our Governance Token XMT is present on all three of the mentioned chains, while our Hedging Swap tool is currently only available on the Ethereum chain. Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: Metalswap Hedging Swap is a unique financial primitive in Defi. It is widely used in the commodity sector of centralized markets and has many use cases when used in Defi with tokens such as ETH, WBTC, and OP. One of its advantages is that it can be used with any ERC-20-like token present on this chain. Metalswap can become the first protocol where OP Dao members can hedge against price volatility. Please link to code audits (if any): MetalSwap - Web3 Security Leaderboard Team   Marco Braglia - CTO   Lorenzo Niccolai - Marketing Manager   Mirko Semprebon - Content Manager   Who are your founders?:   Tiziano Tridico - Leading Italian Crypto KOL   Paolo Luini - Digital Entrepreneur and Investment Expert   Umberto Prestini - Entrepreneur with experience in the specific field of metals   What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? The team has already demonstrated its ability to achieve set goals. The Whitepaper promised the development of an innovative tool built from scratch with a high level of security, and the team has successfully delivered on this promise. Our current objective is to showcase the usefulness of our product through the creation of high-quality content that highlights the numerous use cases for both Defi users and traditional businesses. Is this your first Web3 project?: Yes Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 50k OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: With the help of this grant we have the opportunity to bring our userbase to Optimism and to make our tool known to all those who already use Optimism There will be two ways to incentivize the use of our tool on Optimism: 1 - Liquidity NFT Reward - Each liquidity position represented by an NFT that guarantees Hedging Swaps will receive a daily reward in both XMT and OP tokens based on the time they lock their assets. It will be possible to deposit ETH, WBTC, USDC, and OP as Hedging Swap Liquidity. 2 - Hedging Swap Reward - Each operation will receive a reward in XMT and OP tokens based on the target size and duration of the operation. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: 1 - Create a Testnet to test our product on Optimism 2 - After testing, deploy our smart contracts on the chain adapted to the XMT and OP distribution system 3 - Provide initial liquidity to ensure operations can be guaranteed 4 - Create an editorial calendar to allow the Optimism community to understand how to use our product with use cases and the benefits of using our Product on Optimism Chain. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 5): 1 - Liquidity Pool Rewards - 15K OP - 30% - Approximately 40 OP will be distributed daily to Liquidity Providers in proportion to their share of liquidity relative to the total. This amount was determined to reach a liquidity target that allows the ecosystem to generate good trading volumes and allow Liquidity Providers to have an interesting profit while locking their ETH, WBTC, USDC and OP in our protocol. Our initial liquidity target is 500k USD in value divided among ETH, WBTC, USDC, and OP considering the current prices. 2 - Hedging Swap Rewards - 35k OP - 70% - Users who use our tool will receive both XMT and OP as rewards. This will increase the volume and number of our transactions. Users will receive a number of XMT and OP based on the target size of the coverage and the duration of the position. The receipt of this incentive is closely related to the actual duration of the coverage, as if a person closes the position early, they will only receive a portion of this incentive. The amount of the incentive has been considered based on the volumes of our product and the increase in volume due to this initiative. This Reward is closely related to the volumes, it could end early or be extended beyond the initially considered distribution period of 6 months, the incentives related to XMT, on the other hand, will always continue. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? The Liquidity Pool Rewards will be distributed over 6 months with a certain number of OP tokens distributed every day. The Hedging Swap Rewards will be distributed based on the volume of operations created, and according to our target volume, these rewards will also be distributed over a period of 6 months. However, the distribution of Hedging Swap Rewards may end a little before or after the 6-month period, depending on various factors. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: 1 - Create a testnet to test and adapt our product\u2019s smart contracts on the Optimism network. 2 - Bridge our governance token XMT onto the Optimism network. 3 - Create tutorials and documentation to enable our community to learn about and operate with Optimism. 4 - Publish an editorial calendar with the most important use cases of our product. 5 - Achieve the first 1000 transactions on our product within 3 months from the start of distribution 6 - Achieve 3000 transactions by the end of the 6-month distribution plan. After the distribution plan of OP and XMT, the distribution of our governance token XMT will remain active. 7 - After the distribution of OP is completed, the distribution of XMT will continue. During the 6 months of distribution, XMT will receive the buyback of the fees generated by our system. In fact, 80% of the fees collected by our system will generate a buyback. Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: 1 - Deploy our product\u2019s smart contracts on the Optimism network, adapting the smart contracts to the XMT and OP distribution system. 2 - Provide initial liquidity to enable trading with the three token pairs: ETH/USDC, WBTC/USDC, and OP/USDC. 3 - Monitor and update our product based on community feedback and Optimism network developments If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: As mentioned before, Metalswap is built to have XMT incentives. So, after OP incentives dry up, our governance token incentives will remain. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.):   Tool Contracts : https://docs.metalswap.finance/swap-addresses   Token Addreses : Token Addresses | MetalSwap Docs   Docs : https://docs.metalswap.finance/   Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Yes, Creating a OP Hedging Swap will be the first \u201cforward financial derivative contract\u201d built with OP token and Optimism holder can cover themself from price volatility with a Expire date contract. Will also bring in Optimism Chain a unique Feature. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: This proposal would not only incentivize the use of the Optimism chain but also allow OP holders to hedge against price volatility, encouraging their participation in the ecosystem\u2019s DAO Is your project Optimism Native?: No, as mentioned before we deployed in Ethereum Mainnet as first and unique step Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes ",

Off-ramping your on-chain assets is expensive, time consuming and confusing. Rain provides secure spend management from your decentralized wallet \u2013 no exchange or bank account required. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: We believe what we\u2019re building is going to succeed because eventually all companies will be web3 companies and will need a way to spend their on-chain assets on fiat purchases. We have also seen a large amount of interest from our waitlist which has all been word of mouth. How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: We have over 175 users\u2013 when teams join Rain they can add their team members which is how I arrived at this number. I want to note that we are currently in a U.S private beta but plan on an international launch and opening up the program this year. We have a waitlist with over 1,100 users \u2013 over 75 of those team are building on Optimism(they found us as a solution they need knowing we can\u2019t support their chain yet) How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: By receiving the grant we would be able to be on the optimism chain which would incentivize teams to build on Optimism because they would be able to off-ramp and complete business expenses that they otherwise would be unable to do. With Rain- Optimism teams or potential builders can use their OUSDC to purchase their domain, pay their lawyers, buy laptops, seamlessly attend conferences(buy flights and hotels) etc. Without Rain- Optimism teams or prospective builders will have to off ramp any revenue their earn on-chain to make any fiat purchases. After they off-ramp and pay gas fees they will then have to use their personal credit cards to make business expenses and then reimburse themselves with crypto\u2013 they would then need a lawyer to provide a document stating that the reimbursement isn\u2019t income since that\u2019s how it will be counted on their taxes. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: We plan to target DAOs, prospective builders, and Web3 teams. If teams earn assets on-chain they would need Rain\u2013 additionally in the restricted activities on banks and other corporate cards crypto is listen which means they can deplatform you for any reason which is why all crypto companies would want to use Rain and be our target. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: These users would interact with optimism for the lifetime of their project since they would be building on top of Optimism and use Optimism to provide their collateral to be able to spend on Rain. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: Happy to hop on Zoom and give a demo! Website: www.raincards.xyz/ Twitter:  www. twitter. com /raincards Discord/Discourse/Community: N/A Github:  github. com /SignifyHQ/ Technical/Economic Documentation: FAQ page covers most of this (www.raincards.xyz/faq) Other: N/A  Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): There have been over 5,500 transactions completed on Rain with over 200 unique addresses connected. Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: While we currently have no direct competitors Multis and Starlight are the most similar and it looks like neither of them are on Optimism. Please link to code audits (if any): Sherlock audited our smart contract and provides $5M in insurance. Find our audit done by Sherlock here app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/30. Team Who are your founders?: Charles Naut: Co-Founder and CTO of Rain. Charles is an engineer and technologist who is a previous startup founder and sold his last company to Intuit. Farooq Malik: Co-Founder and CEO of Rain. Farooq is an ex-banker turned web3 enthusiast and was the former Chief Investment Officer and a multi-billion dollar bank. What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? Our team has a proven track record of success on this project already by getting our product live from an idea to a working product with customers in less than a year. We are also committed to bringing on additional resources to ensure the success of our grant proposal. That being said, we have a team of 5 engineers, 1 general counsel and chief compliance officer, 1 head of finance, 1 designer, and 1 chief of staff. Is this your first Web3 project?: Charles and Farooq came up with the idea for Rain when they were building another Web3 company called Sign and Wire which allowed teams to fundraise on-chain. They are also the founders of DinnerDAO(dinnerdao.mirror.xyz/). If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): DinnerDAO(dinnerdao.mirror.xyz/), Sign and Wire (www.signandwire .com/)in the web3 space\u2013 both founders have built other projects and companies in Web2 if you would like to know more email jennifer@raincards.xyz Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 45K OP(currently priced at $2.50 USD totaling to $112,500 USD) How do you justify the size of the grant?: The lift to get launched on Optimism is engineering heavy so we will need to have our engineers build out Rain on Optimism and potentially hire outside consultants. We also plan on offering monetary incentives to encourage teams to build on optimism, specifically a $250 spending credit which is costly but we believe will attract more builders and teams. Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: We first plan on launching out smart contract on Optimism, and then making the proper UI change to enable to use of Optimism on Rain. We then plan on letting the over 170 folks on Rain know about the new Optimism feature and reaching out to the 75 teams on our waitlist building on Optimism. After that we plan on launching marketing initiatives through google and twitter ads( potentially others) sharing the new launch of Rain on Optimism\u2013 we would also reach out to reporters to share this news. Through all of this we would and continue to offer a cash incentive to Optimism teams of a spending credit on Rain ($250). How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here): -40,000 OP towards engineering efforts and the launching OP on Rain -2,500 OP towards marketing efforts to raise awareness of the launch of OP on Rain -2,500 OP for incentives to OP teams when they sign up for Rain (we plan on using our own treasury when this runs out) Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: We would need the 40,000 OP distributed for engineering efforts early on, hopefully upon acceptance. I believe engineering efforts should take 2 months and then we would need the rest of the 5,000 OP distributed for marketing and incentives. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: -Launch smart contract on OP -Start onboarding OP teams from our waitlist -Develop and offering rewards and incentives for OP teams -Marketing initiatives around OP launch Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Our critical milestones would be launching our smart contract on Optimism and integrating Optimism in the UI of Rain to onboard teams. For onboarding it would also include reaching out to OP teams from our waitlist. If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: The rewards and incentives we have for OP teams we plan on using our own treasury to keep supporting if it\u2019s an effective way to onboarding new OP teams. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Our Optimism wallet oeth:0xc6065d0037B4709d71855d8584A7C0726Baa36E7 We plan on creating an Optimism<>Rain Telegram to share updates as well Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Yes, it enables teams to be able to stay on-chain and run a web3 business while interacting with the fiat world. It can also attract talent to their teams knowing they won\u2019t have to use their personal cards for company expenses. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Rain will encourage growth for the Optimism ecosystem in 2 ways. The first way is it will make it easier for current projects to operate which can increase their longevity. The second is that it will attract new projects to build on Optimism since they will have access to more tools that they may not have access to on other chains. Is your project Optimism Native?: Not yet, with the grant we plan on becoming Optimism Native. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes] ",
