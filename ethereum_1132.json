The benefits include:  Increasing the benefits of EIP 1559 as gas prices increase  A) Miners aren\u2019t over paid to secure the network B) High has fees goes to ETH holders and generally benefits the Ethereum community and makes economic abstraction far less relevant C) Misuse and miner collusion becomes quadratically more costly and unlikely D) Miners should always earn more for higher gas prices but decreasingly so. Ie the function slope is always positive but flattens over time. The exact function can perhaps be adjusted by vote within some parameters.

It purposely takes the cost of insane yield farming and gives it back to them. If you want to destroy Ethereum, this will do it single handedly. It will simply grind to a hault as fees go so high that only yield farmers with their rebate will be able to use it. Why is this so urgent? Why not be patient for phase 1.5 and sharding before you send thousands of high cost transactions across the network? I will tell you why, because you are greedy and are only here to line your pockets of poor souls thinking they can make money buying fake yield coins.  You could care less about Ethereum, only that it provides you a vehicle to exploit others. Take a page out of the GPU miners book that have been patiently waiting for almost three years now for the devs to live up to what is in the Ethereum founding yellow paper and remove ASICs from the network. \u201cASICs are a plague\u201d Get in line, learn to be patient.

Wealthy eth users may spend very high gas still, but the burn will benefit the entire eth community & holders. I never launched any farmable tokens (yet), but regardless, dapp token makers provide value that users want, or there\u2019d be no sales. Miners aren\u2019t contributing anything by earning from gas beyond the network\u2019s security requirement. Miner may earn just as much if not more, also, with 1559Q, since eth price rises from burns. ",
