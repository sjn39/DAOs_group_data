Since PAXUSD vault is at 120% liquidation ratio and USDC-A is at 110% I doubt the PAX vault will see much usage. Therefore I ask the community to participate in the following poll: What should the PAXUSD-A Collateralization Ratio be?     120% (No change) 110% 105% 102.5% 101% Abstain     0 voters     Poll will end 2020-09-15T04:00:00Z. If passed, a pull request on github will be created to add an on-chain governance poll to the following week\u2019s governance cycle. ",
