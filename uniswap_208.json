Don\u2019t want to make this a discussion on whether it is feasible or not (I am posting this because I think I have a feasible approach).   Would love to focus this discussion on whether this would be of interest to the community to have, and if so, I could submit a more specific proposal as a temperature check. Best, Alan. ",
