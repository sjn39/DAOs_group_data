Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to get the community aligned on a plan, map it out into a roadmap, then figure out which parts need to be put into the polling system?  Sure. In fact, in refining the new poll, it has become evident to me that the denomination of compensation does not really make that much of a difference.  The community may find out that some of those implementations are not possible. What happens when voters get upset that what they signalled for isn\u2019t the same things as what actually happened? For example, in this poll it\u2019s not clear who is going to custody these funds or how the transactions will take place.  Yeah, how will this happen? I guess I imagined that the Foundation will handle the technical implementation, but I\u2019m not sure specifically who would be responsible. Anybody from the Foundation want to chime in? ",

                    "content": "Thanks hsingh21.   Right now it is simply an issue of tossing out enough reasonable compensation scenarios. My issues are as follows:  Do we just compensate 0-bid vault holders. (where 0-bid means all auctions that claimed < 10% of the tab/1.13).   Scenarios here are how much collateral value 1-25% Do we basically compensate everyone that came up short (relative to the 1-25%) on collateral return during some specified time period.  This includes all auctions that paid full tab but did not return very much (if any collateral). 2a)   If we do this what is the reasonable percentage of collateral makeup 1 up to 25% (so I am running 1-25% numbers in increments of 1%).   Realize even in a well working auction system 24.67% is pretty much the optimal value one can expect and is based on  EDIT ADD:  correction due to maxlev collat ret = (LR-1*LF)/LR = (1.5-1.13)/1.5=24.67% In the above I simply look at this from the perspective of ETH lost and don\u2019t even try to associate a DAI value.   We can deal with this as a seperate issue if people decide they want to figure this out in DAI.   I do have market pricing data. Along with this report has to come an analysis of what happened pre Black Thursday (3/12-3/13), and then between Black Thursday and the governance auction change (3/13-3/16) and then auction data post 3/16. I also want to present something of a general report including totals regarding amount of ETH liquidated, total tab value, liquidation gains, losses, etc.   before breaking that data down into details. The point of this analysis is to give everyone an inside look into the guts of how the auction system is working in the MCD both in good and bad times (black thursday being the worst) and given the current construction of the system (LR, and Liquidation fee) in conjunction with auction performance in terms of market price yield (as a % of market prices on various exchanges at the time as well as OSM) over these dramatically different periods. Excuse the lack of brevity in the reply I am still in the thick of this trying to get everything together.  Once a decision is made on the actual scenario I will produce a vault by vault compensation report. The other thing is I have to add vaults that self liquidated that are also seeking compensation.  If I forget you guys - don\u2019t worry once I get this first run done on the data I will be revisiting all the claims where people self liquidated.  It is my hope that once we figure out how much collateral we will make up people can then look at what they did themselves and determine if what they got back was over or under the level of collateral compensation the community will be looking at. The goal here is that once we decide the class of people who will receive compensation and the level that everyone within that class will be treated equally.  If there are \u2018special\u2019 cases outside of the \u2018class\u2019 we decide these probably will have to be petitioned to governance specially.   Rather than have to vote on each one seperately I think we will want to bundle those. This is just off of the top of my head thinking and notes.   I know a lot of people are watching the status here and if I can get another 4-6hrs uninterrupted time I should be very close to completion of my basic work.   Then I have to actually write up the report noted above. ",

Perfect case no over or underbidding or market deviation this leaves me with .37 x (DAI owed) of collateral and gives .37/1.5 collateral back or 24.67% of the original. Good catch!  I will adjust accordingly.   I see a consistent trend in the data and there is definite scatter higher than 20% but it is good to have the theoretical calculated correctly.

My report goes beyond this and it looks like most of my numbers all done in DAI either match or are exceedingly close (what auctions one calls Black Thursday seems to be the rub - when I am looking at the entire MCD ETH liquidation history in my report as a backdrop).    ournetwork.substack.com    Our Network: Issue #14 Updates on MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, and Set.      Man we should hire this team to really do a full liquidation report.   I wonder what it would have cost. Anyway.   Apolgies for the minor report delay here folks.   My wife and kids are going crazy and my workplace shifted my home work and hours last minute so I am trying to juggle a lot of stuff and get this out.  Data looks decent I just want to adjust a few things for a cleaner presentation and will just have to knuckle under if/when one or more find errors and move on.    Expect updates daily as I feel I am late now on this and under pressure to complete. Be safe and try not to go crazy! ",

Also if BTC appreciates significantly in value while were waiting who\u2019s going to compensate us for that as it is not our fault that this happened? There is a law suit ongoing that i have learned about, i\u2019ve spoken to the attorneys, however that is not my intention, i think Maker DAO has enormous potential and i would like to see and support the ultimate success of the project, so from my side i would just like my ETH or DAI back and thats it no further action from me.
