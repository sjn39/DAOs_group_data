I stumbled upon the Snapshot poll space for DAI this past week, and think it could offer some interesting opportunities to engage with DAI holders and gather user feedback. To test it out, I mirrored the current MKR executive vote as a snapshot poll for DAI holders: https://snapshot.page/#/dai/proposal/Qmbm8rWk85ShYyr3RQgYrvCfJMmPVgTNeoj1SpC8PQbg6b Let me know what you think! I\u2019m hoping if nothing else this will get people more interest in Maker governance. ",

I have long advocated that borrowers and/or DAI holders should have a voice in Maker. One idea in this regard was for Maker in conjunction with oasis vault access to add the following feature in oasis:  When a vault user is borrowing or paying back DAI,  optionally answer feedback questions in their on-chain transactions. I could see this as a useful feature in uniswap and other defi projects as well. ",

Creating a proposal and voting is free no transactions   Proposals and votes are just signed messages, stored on IPFS   Signatures are easily verifiable online it uses the \u201ceth_sign\u201d format   We don\u2019t have any token   It\u2019s free to create a space it takes 5min   Spaces can have their custom domain name   Spaces can have their own skin   Fully open source with MIT license   We don\u2019t use any tracking or ads in our site   EDIT: I am not sure if there is a system that prevents users to:  vote with some account A. move their DAI to account B. vote again using account B. iterate.
