Motivation MIP41 defines Facilitators as \u201caccountable individuals\u201d.  The term individual is defined as \u201ca single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution\u201d (Merriam Webster Dictionary). This potentially limits participants from engaging as facilitators should they want to apply specifically as a liability protected entity. By expanding the definition to \u201cauthorized accounts,\u201d entities will be able to apply as facilitator while specifying accounts that can engage in Maker Governance with the full power of the facilitator, while still retaining the consent of MKR holders. Rather than replacing the Facilitator MIP set, this amendment would allow groups such as LLCs apply to be Facilitators of Core Units with minimum disruption to the current governance process. Governance Facilitators will benefit from still having clear instructions from the DAO on who to listen to, without eroding the importance of the facilitator position.
