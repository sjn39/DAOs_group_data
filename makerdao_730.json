                    "content": "I\u2019ve recently published a new piece of research on a decentralized clearinghouse for stablecoins. I will synthesize it and present the link with MakerDAO in the following of the post.  Introducing the ClearingDAO The idea, codenamed ClearingDAO, is solving 2 important issues:  Providing price equivalence to all major DeFi stablecoins ($1). Moving the supply/demand imbalance from the price to an interest rate stablecoins issuers will pay to each other.  The idea is quite simple, a PSM-like interface that is actually a money-market in the background. You can for instance convert 1 DAI to 1 FEI and, in the background, MakerDAO issue a $1 loan to Tribe Protocol according to a bilateral agreement. There are two differences with a money-market like Aave:  only stablecoins and loans collateralized by more stablecoin (and each loan segregated). This is not an issue for stablecoin issuers who can mint as many stablecoins as needed. Lending 1 DAI against 1 FEI is quite a risk (I will use Fei just as an example in the post), lending 1 DAI against 2 FEI is quite less (and if we don\u2019t trust at all the counterparty, better to not have a loan in the first place). Stablecoins are (or should) be way more liquid and less volatile for liquidation. bilateral agreements that can be cleared by each party. MakerDAO could allow 50M exposure to FEI but close it/liquidate it when it wants (by governance action or from a watchdog smart contract). On Aave, Tribe could borrow all the DAI by providing an infinite amount of FEI and never be liquidated.   Relation to MakerDAO In short, it is similar to a D3M but with more features and a different profile. Like the D3M it allows to delegate the investment part for non-strategic items to other players and focus on other strategic items. Moreover, it\u2019s safer in the sense of being an investment in a diversified portfolio with credit enhancement (but with an idiosyncratic smart-contract and governance risk). The huge value-add is that it is fully one chain. Investing in short-term bonds is off-chain, but the activity of other stablecoin issuers should be mainly on-chain. It is also an element that can be on the liability side (i.e. as a source of funding). Even if I don\u2019t foresee a need of funding in the short term (we actually have more funding than investments), this can change over time. Extra liquidity safety at the least (i.e. having a credit line with other stablecoin issuers but not using it). An illustrative example is given below where MakerDAO extends a loan to Fei Protocol with 2x the notional as FEI collateral.  image885\u00d7607 12.9 KB  From a strategic perspective, it allows other stablecoin protocols to focus more on the investment side (asset) and less on the stablecoin demand. This could be good for DAI even if we can assume that other stablecoin issuers will also try to increase their stablecoin footprint (less dependency, less costly). It fits well with MakerDAO as the decentral bank of DeFi as we will be a funding provider (of last resort and high rate during a crisis?) In the ALM Framework, this would be a short-term maturity item with a low yield (but probably above short-term bonds). The risk will depend on the maturity of stablecoins issuers. I don\u2019t believe that anything will be done in 2022 (it\u2019s early) but I think such a product will be key for DeFi stablecoin to show strength and compete with fiat-backed stablecoin. I will iterate on the idea but wanted to get your thought as a community on this idea.  Is lending to another stablecoin issuer a no-go for you? What would be the criterion to lend to any other stablecoin issuer (i.e. being solvent [this excludes UST, FRAX, \u2026], diversified, good governance or real no governance, stablecoin market size/liquidity\u2026)?

                    "content": "@SebVentures thanks for the post and I look forward to reading the paper.   What is below follows from the post content. Two questions   Regarding liquidity. For example (take any of the stablecoins mentioned) is there liquidity impairment possible? One of the biggest issues I have seen across the DeFI space is potential liquidity crunches brought on buy sudden shifts in markets in certain protocols. This can create unintended risks.   The idea that all stablecoins have the same risk profiles is actually contrary to general monetary theory. This is like saying world governments could lock currency value and still maintain liquidity flows and they all have the same risk profile. Do you think this runs counter to Impossible Trinity or monetary Trilemma?   I think the key issues to be considered regarding stablecoins is: Pricing relative to backing risk: (any currency can experience significant pricing variability for a lot of reasons) Pricing of stables via oracle costs (AFAIK Maker has fixed $1 price PEGs on the stablecoins for PSM operation) the space is going to need good price oracles for stables to make this work. Liquidity issues: How liquid is a stablecoin and does the issuer retain value backing with a real asset treasury or do they print/mint. Centralization issues: Who/what controls the minting contracts and what does the redemeption path look like? Who is in charge of the stablecoin, how? A DAO, a company, ?? Remember Maker doesn\u2019t redeem DAI for anything (except in a ES) vault owners are pledging to buy DAI to pay back loans to get their collateral. A DAI holder has no redemption path and vault owner does. A number of other coins only have value because of their redemption paths to something else of value. I think spreading stablecoin risk is a good idea here but my concern is that given the rates of return and the cost of oracles we may have to bite off quite a bit of risk here for a real pricing cost and small return or even a loss. I appreciate the research on this @SebVentures and will try to take some time to read your paper on the subject. Here is another question for you or anyone else to digest. I was thinking about what \u2018stable\u2019 value means over the past few days and realizing now with inflation running what 7%/yr on USD and probably same on EUR whether there is any possibility of using these PEG mechanics as well as smart contract developments to easily offer a inflation adjusted stable? My point here is that historically currencies have eventually hyper inflated - the reasons are numerous and this has created currencies that basically deflate in purchasing power.  Perhaps Maker should think about spreading the \u2018stable\u2019 risk across a basket of value? I think this is a tough problem btw.   But it does highlight what does \u2018stable\u2019 value mean. What i find interesting here with stablecoins is this approach for fully centralized issuers take currency to mint a stable pegged to the currency value, vs any sort of alogrithmic approach to building a treasury to back the issuance of another coin and using software with collateral management to manage the value of the issued stablecoins. Maker by having reasonably high LRs and liquidation fees on pretty liquid collateral (ETH in the inception case) pretty much has managed pretty significant collateral price drops (50% on ETH) - pretty well against the DAI it manages. It is a growing concern that Maker and DeFI in general is falling into a collateral centralization trap. The demand for growth is outstripping the capacity for collateral to back sustainable growth without significant centralization risk. I am concerned as soon as we start playing the stablecoin musical chairs and start tightly integrating one coins collateral backing with another (very much like DAI has done with USDC, USDP) that we are going to end up with contagion spread.  A single stable liquidity and price event throughout the space causing a systemic event. In crypto there are no governments or liquidity providers of last resort that are going to come in to save the system. How do we not create significant correlation hazards by the space moving in the direction suggested here? High LRs? I think what is clear is that the high demand for stablecoins is creating a lot of projects to fill the gap\u2026 I see more and more algorithmic stables being floated on treasuries of other stables and crypto, maintaining pretty high collateral value to float requirements, but given the nature of the space there is no requirement that any stablecoin maintain anything and during a market collapse event may just start feeding into each other. What becomes clear to me is that growth, centralization, and risk may be forming their own Impossible trinity and the question becomes whether Maker dies by not taking on this risk, and therefore ties its own existence to greater and greater centralization and cross platform systemic risk   Or for Maker to survive and thrive can\u2019t avoid this and therefore there really isn\u2019t a choice other than to plow into this head first and try to do better than everyone else, growing faster, making more money, and managing the risk profiles somehow better. It is looking to me like Maker can\u2019t do all this at once, and neither can the space, something has to give somewhere the question is what? growth, risk, or making money?   To me it is looking like what is being given up is risk, in favor of growth and making money. ",

One of the biggest issues I have seen across the DeFI space is potential liquidity crunches brought on buy sudden shifts in markets in certain protocols. This can create unintended risks.   Yes, even with a 200% CR lending against UST would be crazy (and even anything not Ethereum based). I\u2019m a believer to have a Tier 1 Stablecoin standard (in terms of liquidity and solvency risks). This will not be different from the qualified stablecoin discussed in US regulation (but from a DeFi PoV). Let\u2019s face it, I don\u2019t see many other stablecoins being Tier 1. But the time we move forward with this project, I believe it will be quite different.     MakerMan:  The idea that all stablecoins have the same risk profiles is actually contrary to general monetary theory. This is like saying world governments could lock currency value and still maintain liquidity flows and they all have the same risk profile. Do you think this runs counter to Impossible Trinity or monetary Trilemma?   I don\u2019t see stablecoin as currencies but as broad money. You can read more in a piece I wrote: How money works. But more importantly, I don\u2019t believe at all that all stablecoins have the same risk profile. My point is to move the risk discount from the price to the interest rate. This is part of my stablecoin framework, I\u2019ve published one year ago.  You don\u2019t need Oracles for the price as all are handled at face value. You can (and most likely should in the future) have an Oracle on some solvency and liquidity metrics that can be checked on-chain and activated in a trustless way. Notice also that there are two kinds of loans. One is just usual capital funding (low rate, let\u2019s say 2%) for which the facility will be used fully most of the time. One for liquidity crunch and mismatch (liquidity of last resort more or less) at high rate (9%?) that will be used not a lot.

MakerDAO is the largest solvent and liquid DeFi stablecoin but we shouldn\u2019t frame it as having a monopolistic behavior or having some extra powers. In TradFi, most bank for example relies of interbank short-term funding. Clearinghouses exist without a central bank. Some protocol will have excess reserves (like MakerDAO today, but probably not forever) while some will have a deficit. It\u2019s really about adding source of funding which for stablecoin issuers are:  the stablecoin issuance. this intra DeFi stablecoin issuer money-market repo on trustless money market with sounds collateral (incl. MakerDAO). TribeDAO is actually exploring this route as well term issuance/bond like to secure funding for a medium/long period of time. This is explored by a lot of stablecoin protocols.
