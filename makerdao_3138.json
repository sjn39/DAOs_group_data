                    "content": "This post is in response to the recent Signal Request to Increase the Dust Minimum on Maker vaults. It is my belief that we need to explore other ways to ensure liquidations are profitable for keepers before Liquidations 2.0 is implemented. Otherwise if ETH continues to increase relative to DAI we could easily find ourselves forced to set the dust limit even higher, pricing out more individuals who would otherwise be keen to engage with the Maker Platform. It\u2019s additionally worth noting that many of our competitors in the DeFi space (Aave and Compound for example) have been able to offer collateralized positions similar to our vaults without the high minimums we have at Maker. One \u201ceasy\u201d fix to the problem of smaller vaults not being profitable to liquidate is to offer a rebate on the cost of calling bite on such vaults. Such a rebate would cover the gas fees for keepers that call bite on small vaults, encouraging them to participate in what should be a profitable action. Below is a draft of the code written by @yaronvel that could be implemented to enable such rebates. With this code keepers would call biteWithRebate instead of bite -   gist.github.com   https://gist.github.com/yaronvel/4137f4e6e4b242d17f6350b912bfc456 BiteRebate.sol pragma solidity >=0.5.12;  interface CatLike {     function bite(bytes32 ilk, address urn) external; }  interface VatLike {     function urns(bytes32 ilk, address u) external view returns (uint ink, uint art); }  This file has been truncated. show original        It should also be noted that:  Liquidators could still call the standard bite function (like today) if they want to. A potential bug/failure in this contract will only compromise the funds that were deposited in this contract. And will have no effect on the overall stability of the dss system. This is a temporary patch, until the liquidation 2.0 is deployed. If implemented, MakerDAO only needs to approve the initial fund deposit as there would be no changes in the existing dss or its parameters.  This poll is to gauge if there would be support for funding this rebate program with a small amount of DAI from the surplus buffer. @yaronvel has proposed an initial funding of 10k DAI for gas rebates, with B.Protocol donating 1k DAI to show their support for maintaining smaller vaults while we wait for implementation of Liquidations 2.0.    Would you support 9,000 DAI being pulled from the buffer to create a keeper-rebate program that pays for gas fees on bite calls on small vaults?

It would seem that in that scenario, this protection would be far too small to compensate the keepers.

The bottom line is that it will give a full (mathematical) protection only if the rebate piggy bank will have enough funds to rebate thousands of liquidations. With 10k DAI budget this is not likely to happen, and then it becomes an incentive question. In particular, the cost of a rebate, vs the potential loss/profit for an attacker. In general, the liquidation penalty is bigger than the cost of a bite tx (at least looking at the recent txs). Hence, the DAO can win in such game, but it will have to re-top the rebate piggy bank during such an attack. And the proposed smart contract does not offer an automation for such process. We can consider adjusting it so it will take the rebate directly from the surplus.     g_dip:  Also, assuming that the above issue is addressed, how much gas does it cost to claim this rebate and can it be claimed for all of the keeper\u2019s bids, or do they need to call the claim function for each bid they made on a small vault?   In the proposed contract, the first guy who calls bid get the rebate during the tx. All the others will not get anything. Once bite is called, an attack is no longer be profitable. As a side note, with current ETH value and gas prices, it is hard to see how liquidation 2.0 could offer an incentive for calling bite without enforcing a big dust parameter. I will raise this concern in the liquidation 2.0 thread. ",

While we still fall on different sides of opinion, being more aware of how regulators could see our product offerings is something I need to do. While I\u2019d like to express it a little differently than @flipflopflapdelegate, I also agree that not bending to unnecessary (and unhelpful) practices of CeFi is one of the things that make the DeFi space in general, and Maker in particular, so exciting.     psychonaut:  Worse, MakerDAO is not properly compensated for small vaults. We don\u2019t charge more to small vaults even though small vaults likely represent smaller investors who are more likely to complain loudly when the shit hits the fan   I wanted to focus some push back on this sentiment in particular. I agree fully that our current set up we are not getting compensated for the risk these smaller vaults pose to the protocol. But I think proposals like this poll (which could potentially fund the gas prices for hundreds of liquidations) can offset the risk to make the smaller vaults a benefit to MKR holders. I don\u2019t think the perception that smaller account holders cause more work for the protocol is entirely fair. Larger vault owners have much recourse within the legal system if they feel wronged by Maker and thus pose a different set of dangers. While it\u2019s easy to dismiss complaints people have with being liquidated, having users more willing to engage with us and tell us where are blind spots are is a net positive. After all, this is a DAO and our strength comes from having many different people with many different skill sets contributing to the organization as a whole. If we start pricing out people from the platform we start losing a lot of valuable thoughts and opinions that otherwise would have been happy to stick around and help improve Maker even more. ",

I hope to get support from MKR holders to solutions like this Bite-Rebate contract for keepers acting on small vaults. I\u2019m not sure how much would be enough for our risk team to feel that we have with it offset those important risks we have with small Vaults. Maybe there are still some others solutions out there which could be easily implemented as well, but if this is our best shot it has my full support. If a solution well prepared and analyzed and easy to implement like this goes on-chain and MKR holders oppose to assign a small percent of the Surplus Buffer in order to keep small Vault owners in our system, I hope that some of us like B.Protocol team be happy to support this cause. I\u2019m happy to donate 1k DAI as well to support this initiative if that\u2019s what is needed. I\u2019m also supporting here all those who are in this moment learning about DEFI, and those who will learn about it later. I have too many good friends in Latam who have in last months ask me to share \u201cmy knowledge of DEFI\u201d, I\u2019m not that knowledgeable; but for many out there, creating a wallet in Metamask, understanding the current dapps, understanding what is getting loans to keep your exposure to ETH, leverage positions and many other things that DEFI offers now is \u201ca very complicated matter\u201d. I\u2019m talking here of people well instructed, even many of them with deep understanding of programming\u2026 even though \u201cDEFI is a complicated matter\u201d, \u201cto participate in DEFI you need to study a lot\u201d, and for many of them \u201cDEFI is simply a space that only reach people can use\u201d (biggest issue being here GAS prices of course). I\u2019ve done some \u201cwebinars\u201d  and the first thing I\u2019ve always shown is how to open a Vault in MakerDAO (typically using defisaver.com or Instadapps). Last month I had similar talk, and the 500DAI dust was something that I didn\u2019t mention in that presentation\u2026 later when some of them tried out by themselves, they gave up completely when they knew they had to give their first steps with thousands of dollars instead that with the 100 they wanted to experiment with. Most of the people who give their first steps in DEFI, do it with a few bucks, this is not about how rich or not they are, it is that they don\u2019t want to risk their monthly salary in something they don\u2019t understand very well. Sadly, we\u2019re debating a topic here which will not even give them that possibility to learn.     psychonaut:  My opinion is that we should not encourage small investors to open vaults.   I completely respect your point of view on the matter @psychonaut, but for me this has deeper implications, IMHO this translates to: \u201cwe should not encourage them to interact with MakerDAO\u201d. I\u2019ve loved MakerDAO since I learned about it, and I really want to talk about it to others, to mention what it could be for the future of the financial system, for the future of the world in fact. We\u2019re not simply not encouraging small investors, we\u2019re not encouraging the new wave of \u201cDEFI users\u201d to learn about us, to come to this forum and propose ideas, we\u2019re in fact with what is being discussed in Signal Request to Increase the Dust Minimum closing ourselves to a fluent wave of new members, skilled and valuable people that will add immense potential to our community. In fact, I entered this forum because I opened a Vault!, and I opened a Vault cause Maker was the first saving/lending platform in every list. I really would like to keep that door open, and would like to continue talking about MakerDAO to the commoner in 2021, this could be a very important year for DEFI, if the first thing users see is Compound and Aave for earning interest and borrowing stablecoins, I really think that we\u2019ll loose our current position, our inflow of good and skilled people, and maybe even our complete DAO\u2026 As @flipflopflapdelegate recommended to all of us: Stay Grounded Maker Community. Stay Grounded, which translates to an important phrase in my natal country: \u201cNo dejemos que la fama se nos suba a la cabeza\u201d. ",

Your spirit of moving quickly to improve the protocol was what inspired this to get done so quickly, so I really appreciate hearing you\u2019re happy that this is being brought forward. I\u2019ll try to respond to each of these points as I understand them, though I fully defer to @yaronvel for explaining the technicalities behind it.     ultraschuppi:  what are the projected operational costs for that over time / per vault   Little hard to answer this one as the main factor for determining costs is future gas prices. The nice part is once this that if this is implemented the only operational cost is keeping the contract funded. At current peaks in gas prices, we\u2019re looking at the initial 10k DAI seeding funding between 100 and 200 small vault liquidations.     ultraschuppi:  how is this going to be funded? just by occasional sucks from the vat by governance?   Yes. In the future if this proves to be a viable solution we could set it up to function as a percentage of SFs generated, but the hope is that improvements to our liquidations process make the need for this contract obsolete in the near future.     ultraschuppi:  do we need to keep this with liq2 or is liq2 fixing the issue itself?   A lot of people in the community (myself included) seem to be under the impression that Liquidations 2.0 will fix a large part of the issue at hand. However, @yaronvel posted here that currently it appears calling bite in liq2 is not much cheaper than in 1.2 currently. We\u2019re waiting to hear back if the devs agree.     ultraschuppi:  can\u2019t this be used to game the system (creating small vaults on purpose, if the long does not work out i can self-liquidate me knowing I get a refund of the bite-costs?)   The short answer is no but one could try. Basically the rebate is only given to the first person that kicks off the liquidation (and it only covers the gas fee from doing so). In the event that someone could ensure they would be the first to call it on their own vault and win the bid at a discount (without having to submit further bids that would not have their gas fees refunded) they might be able to recover their own funds close to what they were worth before the auction, but the additional gas fees from separating the position into smaller vaults would make this an expensive endeavor just to break even (not to mention the cost of infrastructure to ensure they could submit the bite first and win the auction). Let me know if that leaves any more questions or if something appears faulty in my explanation! Also wanted to give a huge shout-out to @smaugho!! Your generosity and commitment to keeping Maker accessible literally brings tears to my eyes.     smaugho:  If a solution well prepared and analyzed and easy to implement like this goes on-chain and MKR holders oppose to assign a small percent of the Surplus Buffer in order to keep small Vault owners in our system, I hope that some of us like B.Protocol team be happy to support this cause. I\u2019m happy to donate 1k DAI as well to support this initiative if that\u2019s what is needed.   Just wow. We are so lucky to have people like you in the community and your potential financial support makes this idea even more suitable for testing. ",

So the suggestion here is to just take the subsidy part from liquidation 2.0 and implement it externally to the protocol. That said, now it seems that the subsidy in liquidation 2.0 might also not be able to handle small vaults. So this undermines my original thought of having a temporary patch until liquidation 2.0 is live. ",

I don\u2019t know if you have a moment to share some thoughts on this post Chris, but if you do it would be greatly appreciated! ",

Biting vaults is an issue which will be resolved by LIQ-2.0, but there are many other functions which require altruistic actors to maintain such as spot.poke(), jug.drip(), dcIAM.exec(ilk), and the new PsmFlipper. I\u2019ve created dss-cron to do exactly that. I considered doing a fixed rebate calculation, but that could potentially open up an attack vector which allows anyone to drain funds from the DAO at the highest possible speed. Instead I opted to go with a steady increase of the bounty to enable competition to bid on the lowest price. That being said, I think EIP1559 will be exposing the new base fee which will be very helpful to determine is someone is placing a competitive bid or they are just wasting money. Once that comes out we should be able to do the fixed refund + tiny profit method. ",
