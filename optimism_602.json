DappLooker integration with Optimism network Implementation of network dashboards mentioned above Onboarding of 5 Dapps for their on chain analytics  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?:   Current Problem  Understanding raw web3 data is complex. Data & analytics is in hands of SQL developers and data scientists. Non tech savvy users find web3 analytics hard. No Analytics platform built for both technical and non technical users. Slow Queries, Data refresh issues, Analyze on-chain & offchain together    The current state of the Optimism ecosystem needs a comprehensive platform that enables real-time tracking of usage metrics and statistics.   This absence of a data & analytics tools results in missed opportunities to capture critical information that could help better understand user activity and behavior, such as churn rates, engagement rates, and other KPIs.   A unified platform would make it easier to monitor metrics such as TVL, daily and weekly transfer rates, etc., that could assist in decision-making processes.   Overall, the lack of a analytics platform for monitoring and analyzing data in real-time means that the Optimism ecosystem is missing out on crucial insights that could inform and guide development efforts and identify areas for improvement and growth.   Therefore, a comprehensive analytics and visualization platform for the Optimism ecosystem is imperative.   How does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem?:   No-Code Analytics  Visual SQL - Intuitive and saves time Drag & Drop Dashboard builder    Smart Contract & Subgraph Analytics   Custom transformations framework for faster queries   Analyze on chain & Off chain data together   Export data to CSV/Excel   External Integration - Chart APIs & Embedding   integrate Optimism Network & Index the data from Optimism smart contracts & subgraphs  Doing so enables us to present usage data in a visual format for real-time analytics and visualization. With DappLooker, users will gain access to essential retention metrics, including the number of active users, churn rate, and retention rate. This data will enable better decision-making and drive growth by helping identify improvement areas.    We are developing multiple network dashboard that will provide a snapshot of essential network statistics, such as  Daily/Weekly/Monthly transaction volumes, Daily/Weekly/Monthly gas consumption Daily/Weekly/Monthly TVL and other key metrics    This will allow network participants to monitor network activity and make informed decisions based on the latest information. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:   After Integration, Optimism ecosystem users and community can build charts and dashboards using our drag and drop query builder on Optimism network data.   We understood from multiple Optimism stakeholders and Dapps that there is a strong need for no-code analytics solutions for Optimism Dapp\u2019s owners and developers.   As more and more Dapps join the Optimism network, they must have an analytics solution to which they can reply for effective decision-making.   Create and fork dashboards using the drag-and-drop feature of dashboard builder. Gather info from multiple sources into a single dashboard. Share dashboards on a URL anywhere you need.   Export smart contract data in CSV or Excel   Write SQL queries using an intuitive visual SQL editor on the Optimism project dataset. Users can query, filter, join, and group on the Optimism project dataset. Community analytics can be done on an indexed Optimism dataset.   Analyzing key metrics can help the Optimism ecosystem identify areas to improve and grow. For example,  Tracking the number of active users and their behavior can provide insights into how people use the ecosystem and what features or services are most popular. Analyzing churn and retention rates can help the team understand how many users are leaving the ecosystem and why. If a high percentage of users are churning, the team can investigate the reasons behind it and take steps to address any issues or pain points. A high TVL and transaction volume suggest that people actively use and see value in the ecosystem. Analyzing these key metrics is essential for identifying growth opportunities and understanding user behavior within the Optimism ecosystem. Using these insights to optimize the ecosystem, the team can attract more users, increase adoption, and ultimately achieve long-term success.    How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?:   We are fully committed to building on the Optimism network and contributing to the growth and success of the ecosystem.   Popular Optimism native projects which are already live on DappLooker are Aave, Connext   We recognize the tremendous potential of Optimism\u2019s Layer 2 scaling solution to enable faster and more cost-effective transactions on the Ethereum network. We are excited about the opportunities this presents for dapp developers and users.   Our team has a proven track record of building successful projects on 10+ blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Celo, Polygon, Arbitrum  and more   We are excited to bring this experience and expertise to the Optimism network and believe that we can contribute to the growth and success of the ecosystem by building high-quality tools and resources that can benefit developers and users alike.   Is your project Optimism Native? Yes Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

Could you please restructure your milestones description to follow this structure? Furthermore, I\u2019m a bit concerned about your grant distribution proposal. Although you confirmed, that you are aware of 1yr grant lockup it seems that within your grant distribution plan, you assume that the funds will be released to you upon achieving specific milestones and that you don\u2019t have funding secured for the delivery of the project. Unfortunately, such a distribution is not possible within this grant program. Moreover, you can\u2019t assume a specific OP price at the 1yr lockup end, so you can\u2019t assume that you\u2019ll receive a specific dollar amount within this grant. You can find more information here: Grant Token Lock Explainer. Please fix those points within your proposal. ",
