                    "content": "When vaults are liquidated the collateral is traded for Dai.  This allows the system to repay the Dai debt.  MakerDao currently issues Dai based on a par of $1.00. Anytime the system attempts to liquidate a vault and the Dai price in the market is above $1.00 the system is realizing the instant loss of value between the $1.00 issuance and the current market price (right now lets use $1.04 as an example). In addition to losing the $.04 of value MakerDao is also driving the price of Dai up further in the markets by increasing the demand for Dai.  Please discuss below why you support this behavior or if you are against it what alternative you see as a quality alternative.  Liquidation discussion only please. ",

My reasoning is that if the price is over $1.00 the market balance is currently  demanding additional Dai supply or a reduction in demand to get back to the peg.  MakerDao in such a case would be better off taking ownership of the assets instead of liquidating them.  This way the system itself is not acting to push the peg further out of balance. ",

                    "content": "This is the purpose of the dai buffer. Yes, the dai value increases during market downturns of assets that are a part of the protocol. But also, this is exactly how the system works, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good solution to high demand during market downturns. One solution is onboarding collateral types that are uncorrelated. Then when say eth goes down, more dai would come from usdc, or paxg, or a tinlake token, or some of uncorrelated asset type. If we had a decent buffer, the buffer would also be liquidated when the peg started going off. If we had more powerful tools to shift the price of dai downward that would also help this issue. Overall though it\u2019s not a problem with the system per se, so much as a challenge of trying to maintain a stablecoin. ",
