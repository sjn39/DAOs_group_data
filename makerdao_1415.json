The lengths of task bars are to scale with tasks\u2019 durations. It typically includes two sections: the left side outlines a list of tasks, while the right side has a timeline with schedule bars that visualize work. The Gantt chart can also include the start and end dates of tasks, milestones, dependencies between tasks, and assignments. A visual gantt chart would allow voters and the community to have a high-level view of the project\u2019s most important tasks, task owners and deliverable timelines. Voters can also assess if the poll initiative has been thought through and the team is set up for execution.

Imagine if you will the idea that CES, PECU, RWF, SF all have to come up with this chart they spend a good week-manhrs on this and then the poll is turned down.   How was that a great use of resources of the DAO? What i want to see is the gant charts of what they have on their plates now before we even consider passing another poll forcing them to allocate resources to YET ANOTHER PROJECT we probably won\u2019t be able to complete in a reasonable time because the work queue is so deep? Having sat in a a couple co-ord meetings I can tell you people are pushing pretty hard behind the scenes and there is a lot of work to be done.  HVB for example taking a lot of resources and has a pretty aggressive schedule and I think we are still like 3 months out before seeing a lick of revenue (IF that since more polls have to happen there).

As @MakerMan is saying, this would show work that\u2019s already in the pipeline, which is very much needed.   MIP65 is not owned by the core units but by the external business partner. The external partner can\u2019t determine the planning of the core units. That depends on the on-going work that core units have.   Should core units spend a significant amount of time making estimates for a business partner that hasn\u2019t passed the vote yet? Probably not.   Even if MIP65 were to have a section that contains the core units\u2019 planning, they wouldn\u2019t be able to show a timeline due to dependencies. For example if 3 MIP65s get approved, that\u2019s going to take more time than if only one passes the vote. So how can a planning be made part of the vote if the planning itself depends on the vote\u2019s outcome?   So in summary, I think your ask for an indication of the work that comes with collateral onboarding is very reasonable. However, at the stage of a poll, a Gantt chart isn\u2019t the right tool for this. Better questions would be:   How can we get a rough estimate of the associated work, and therefore cost, of collateral on-boarding MIPs? So that MKR holders and delegates can make an informed decision. (Without spamming CUs)   How can we get the visualization of the process for collateral onboarding right?   How can we better report on the ongoing work of core units?   How can we estimate timelines (forecasts) and get better at estimating?   This is an example for the L2 roadmap:      Collecting information on on-going work will fit within the decentralized operations initiative and the result will be published on the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard These are long-term solutions. In the meantime @gov-comms-core-unit and others have put some time in collecting the ongoing initiatives. It would be great to bring that together in one place until the dashboard can replace that.

From my perspective in Real World Finance only, it is a useful tool to both align with the applicant on the work to be done and timing, as well as a communication tool for RWF to the Maker community. Also, the GANTT chart can flush out experienced from inexperienced counterparties. A skimpy GANTT chart with unrealistic deadlines provides useful information as to the applicant. ",

Gantt charts are great when you really know every task that needs to be performed in the project and make a decent estimation on it. I do like Christian\u2019s point on understanding how the counterparty knows what they are getting into and using that as a first estatement of the work that each side envisions. There is a benefit there for sure, but it can easily lead to micromanagement in the open working mode we have in the DAO. I guess it is just a matter of creating a working culture that prevents micromanagement and inspires openness. ",
