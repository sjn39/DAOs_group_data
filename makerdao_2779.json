                    "content": "Hey folks, we would like to make a small update to the TUSD smart contract and are requesting that the Maker community take a vote to approve it in the adapter. We\u2019ve already contacted the smart contract team and they will be posting an update once they\u2019re finished reviewing the new code. Thanks for your help. Details on the update:   On Sept 16th we upgraded the TUSD smart contract based on feedback from the Maker smart contract team and other protocols. This upgrade massively simplified the TUSD smart contract but also left out one feature which we\u2019re now realizing was important: supporting our legacy (pre-Jan 2019) TUSD smart contract.   The legacy contract was launched in March 2018 before the upgradable proxy pattern was standard, and instead of full upgradability, it included the ability to forward transfer() calls to a new address. We migrated to an upgradable proxy in Jan 2019 with a full announcement and instructions for integrators.   After the on Sept 16th, we were contacted by IDEX who is having the following issue: they were continuing to rely on the legacy TUSD smart contract, and while they are able to integrate the new TUSD smart contract, their smart contract is unable to understand that \u2018old TUSD\u2019 balances are actually now \u2018new TUSD\u2019 balances (of course all balances are moved over, the old smart contract just forwards calls similar to a 301 redirect on the web). This issue with IDEX affects about $130k TUSD.   We want to make sure these IDEX users are taken care of and that\u2019s why we\u2019re requesting this vote.   Of course we would not perform an upgrade without the Maker community taking a vote to approve the new implementation. The new implementation has already been audited, both code and audit are linked below. Thanks for working with us, and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

I just have a hard time seeing any poll or vote on this resolving in a negative outcome. If governance wants to stop using TUSD as a collateral type, they can signal and vote on that directly. There are much better ways of winding down usage (if that even is the desire, and I have no reason to believe that it is) than failing to whitelist a valid and non-malicious new implementation. Given that the outcome is pretty much a no-brainer, and that a negative outcome would actually be damaging,  I\u2019m happy just skipping the poll. Unrelated:     cmooney:  10/02/2020   This confused the hell out of me because date formats. Can we meet in the middle and go with YYYY/MM/DD?

Sorts naturally and always no matter what retains the date code even if the filesystem file creation/edit date is changed as long as you put 0\u2019s in right places. 20200930_0140 - etc. I have argued that people remember better when they did something than the name they gave it in the filesystem much less the place they stuck it.   This gets horrifically bad when one has hundreds of people all doing work on the same machine (commissioning for example) and putting everything in myriads of directories/subdirectories/etc.   We literally can\u2019t find anything related to our commissioning - especially stuff from people who have already left because of the hands off approach to directory and file naming. There are times I have considered writing up a document on this for RFC to try to come up with some form of directory system file naming standardization.    My friend reminded me when I brough this up that the color of a light indicating an on status even on devices isn\u2019t a \u2018standard\u2019 color (look around your house and count the number of colors for lights on devices that just show \u2018on\u2019) so if we can\u2019t standardize that - forget about standardizing anything else. I loath 3/4/2020 as a date code because is the first a day or a month?   And don\u2019t even try to sort or find It was a humbling when he pointed it out the whole \u2018on\u2019 light issue to me.
