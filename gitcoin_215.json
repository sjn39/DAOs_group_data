Scott Moore asks, \u201cwhat if we defined public goods not by their excludability but by the extent to which they produce positive externalities?\u201d. Weigh in here.     From the Governance Forum   \u201c[Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 15\u2026\u201d, by Janine  Janine posted this proposal in the forum requesting that community Stewards ratify the payout matching allocations, and greenlight the payment of grant funds to grantees. There are two options to vote on for the proposal: 1) \u201cRatify the round results\u201d, and 2) Request further deliberation. From Janine: \u201cWe would like to suggest voting on Snapshot to begin on Wednesday, October 5th in advance of payouts being made on Friday, October 14th.\u201d Request for Comment: If you are a Steward, please have a look at this post, and leave comments and questions. Stay tuned for the Snapshot vote!   \u201cThe Future of Moonshot Collective\u201d, by michaelgreen06  With the consent of the Gitcoin Product Collective(GPC) workstream, the Moonshot Collective(MC) workstream has decided to merge with the GPC workstream. michaelgreen06 reviews MC\u2019s origins, and the reasons it was founded, and why MC has chosen to merge with GPC. The tl;dr is that MC was formed during a bull cycle, and, per michaelgreen06, \u201cwhen the bear market hit we\u2026had to shift our focus to advancing the DAO\u2019s essential intents\u201d. As part of GPC, MC will increase GPC\u2019s ability to improve and ship Gitcoin protocols such as Gitcoin Passport, Round Manager, and Grants Hub. Request for Comment: michaelgreen06 has requested feedback on MC\u2019s proposal to merge with GPC.
