Who is the interested party for this collateral application?  Loan Originator: UPRETS Borrower: SolarX REIT Lender: MakerDao Trust: [US Bank or another trust company to be approved by MakerDao governance] Escrow/Closing Agent: [US Bank or another company to be approved by MakerDao governance] Loan Servicer: [Berkadia or another trust company to be approved by MakerDao governance] The main contacts for this application are David Dai ([email\u00a0protected]), Ran Wei ([email\u00a0protected]), Wesley Ma ([email\u00a0protected]) and Nil Larom ([email\u00a0protected])  2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project.  UPRETS will originate, underwrite and deposit 1st lien mortgage loans backed by land and solar farm facilities located on Long Island, New York, which are developed and owned by the borrower, to a trust which MakerDao will be assigned as Trustee. The underlying mortgage loan assets will be used as vault collateral to add diversification to DAI collateral pool and support value of DAI/USD. MakerDao will mint DAI with equal face value of the mortgage loan and deposit newly minted DAI into the escrow account. UPRETS will deliver the loan note and related loan documents into the escrow. At the settlement date, UPRETS will close the loan with SolarX. Simultaneously, MakerDao will instruct the escrow to purchase the loan note with DAI deposited at escrow and escrow will deliver loan note to the trust and later on the purchased RWA will be deposited into MakerDao collateral pool. A specialized and reputable 3rd party commercial real estate servicer will be engaged to service the loan on behalf of MakerDao. UPRETS seeks to enter into a Purchase Agreement with Maker to deliver a series of RWAs that meet Maker\u2019s credit standard and is approved by Maker Risk Assessment team to Maker over the term of such agreement. The total purchase amount is anticipated to be up to 100M DAI. These assets have the following characteristics: \u25cf\tCollateral: Senior acquisition/construction loans \u25cf\tUnderlying Assets: US-Based solar farm plants \u25cf\tAverage Loan Size: $ 10,000,000 \u25cf\tAverage Underlying Property Value: $18,000,000 \u25cf\tMaturity: 2-5 Years \u25cf\tInterest rate charged to Borrowers: 4.50%-7.00% per annum \u25cf\tLien position: 1st lien  Legal Setup  It is anticipated that a Trust (tentatively, US Bank, or another trust company to be approved by MakerDao governance) will be established and Maker will be pointed as Trustee. This Trust will be acting on behalf of Maker in this transaction and entering into the Purchase Agreement with UPRETS. An Escrow/Settlement Agent (tentatively, US Bank, or another bank subject to approval by MakerDAO) will be engaged and facilitate the closing procedures, per the Escrow Agreement. The trust agreement will include provisions stating that:  Trust agreement cannot be changed without a vote from MakerDAO governance with notice of the vote delivered to the trustee. Trust agreement cannot cause a liquidation without getting direction from MakerDAO from etherscan.io or vote.MakerDAO.com.  Servicer will be handling all payment and reporting activities. Monthly principal and interest payments and any other payments described in the Servicing Agreement will be sent to the Trust. Trust will then pass through remaining cashflow after deducting trust fee and any other expenses if applicable to the Trustee. In any credit event, the Servicer will be handling all remedy efforts including foreclosure, liquidation and other credit remedies descripted in the Servicing Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee.

The REIT itself does not develop the solar project or otherwise benefit from the sale of electricity.   How does Solar X determine (a) the actual properties to be acquired, and (b) the project developer to develop the project?   What is the timing between acquisition of a property, selection of the project developer, and construction of the solar facility. This will impact the timing of the rent payments made to the REIT? What is the typical permitting and construction process in NY for solar farms?   What exactly is UPRETS doing? The first sentence under Transaction Structure states: \u201cUprets will source, originate, underwrite and deposit 1st lien mortgage loans backed by land and solar farm facilities located on Long Island, New York, which are developed and owned by the borrower to a trust to be created by Maker that acts on behalf of MakerDAO.\u201d The phrase \u201cmortgage loans backed by land and solar farm facilities\u201d suggests existing facilities or facilities at least in development.

                    "content": "Hi Christian, Thank you for your questions! Please see our response below.  The REIT will only be the lessor of the land to the project developer. The REIT itself does not develop the solar project or otherwise benefit from the sale of electricity.  SolarX REIT is the developer and owner of the 10 solar farms proposed in this application. SolarX will acquire lands, construct the facilities and lease the solar farm plants to a 3rd party specialized operator via a long-term triple-net lease. The lease will be secured by a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with a fixed electricity price, through a collaboration with Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) and the Department of Energy. The 1st lien on such solar farm plants will be held by the lender (to be delivered to the Trust where MakerDao will be the trustee).  How does Solar X determine (a) the actual properties to be acquired, and (b) the project developer to develop the project?  Since SolarX has extensive commercial and industrial real estate investment and development experience and solar farm development expertise, the SolarX management team has performed through diligence process and ensured all identified and proposed properties are meeting preset investment criteria and within acceptable risk parameters. SolarX also contracted with 3rd party appraiser and construction consulting companies to determine the value and cost of development. Uprets, as the originator and underwriter of the mortgage, will perform individual and full cashflow-based underwriting upon origination and the mortgage will only be funded upon credit approval.  What is the timing between acquisition of a property, selection of the project developer, and construction of the solar facility. This will impact the timing of the rent payments made to the REIT? What is the typical permitting and construction process in NY for solar farms?  6-8 months from land acquisition to production start. During acquisition/construction period, a debt service reserve will be required by Uprets and will be fully funded at loan closing to ensure the borrower have sufficient fund to pay monthly P&I payments. Once the construction is completed, the facility will be rented to a 3rd party operator and start collecting rent. Suffolk County government has a streamlined and fast track permit application process. It is a simple application process and fast approval timeline as long as project meet the criteria. SolarX project meets every criteria in the checklist and expect to follow the same process as previous projects. Please see below application requirement from Long Island Power Authority of Suffolk County Government: https://www.suffolkcountyny.gov/portals/0/formsdocs/planning/Publications/SCPCLIPAEnergyr.pdf  What exactly is UPRETS doing? The first sentence under Transaction Structure states: \u201cUprets will source, originate, underwrite and deposit 1st lien mortgage loans backed by land and solar farm facilities located on Long Island, New York, which are developed and owned by the borrower to a trust to be created by Maker that acts on behalf of MakerDAO.\u201d The phrase \u201cmortgage loans backed by land and solar farm facilities\u201d suggests existing facilities or facilities at least in development.  Uprets is a DeFi CRE lender. Uprets as lender will work with SolarX as borrower on their acquisition/construction financing need. Upon closing, Uprets, via escrow closing agent, will deliver loan note, along with other loan documents, to the Trust where MakerDao will be the trustee, pursuant to the proposed mortgage purchase agreement between Uprets and MakerDao. SolarX has identified all 10 facilities and has started developing the 1st facilities with their own equity. Upon closing of the proposed mortgage financing, SolarX will continue acquiring and developing remaining proposed facilities.  Why does UPRETS have a mortgage over the solar facilities? Did it provide financing to the developer for the design, engineering, procurement and installation of the solar farm?  As explained in question #4, Uprets is the originator and lender of SolarX\u2019s Loan Island project. The mortgage will be secured with 1st lien over the solar facilities.  What priority (if any) does the Trust have to revenues of the solar developer for the payment of lease payments? Presumably, the Trust has first priority as an operating expense and before the return of any equity?  Since the Trust will be purchasing and holding 1st liens on these mortgage loans, the Trust will be in the 1st position to receive monthly payments from SolarX, via 3rd party servicer. Each month, the servicer will collect monthly P&I payments, along with other payments such as prepayment premium or late fee if any, and remit the payments to the Trust. The monthly debt service payments are secured by lease and rent payments from the operator. SolarX will be obligated to pay debt service to the Trust before making any equity distribution. In any credit event, the Trust will have the right to foreclose the facilities and also be in the 1st position to receive remedies. ",

Well yes, but what happens if you find a protected environmental or cultural resource on a parcel where impact can\u2019t be avoided? If human remains or an endangered species have to be relocated or impact mitigated, will that impact cash flows in a way that makes it hard to service the debt? Edited to add: Is this a federal undertaking, defined by use of federal funds, land, transmission lines, permits, etc? Usually permits are the one that is hard to avoid.

We have been working significantly with @Daviddai , @UPRETS_Real_Estate @Andy.SolarX, and others to find the best legal structure for this project (and likely for a lot of MakerDAO RWA collaterals going forward). So far we are settling on a Cayman STAR Trust and a Delaware LLC (thanks @christiancdpetersen for the work on this), but this will have to be worked on by law firms (something we should be able to achieve in June). As known since the beginning, the first closing date is expected for the end of June/July (the financing itself will take more time but they need a guarantee to start the process). Per the community comments on the RWA Strateg, the RWF CU is ready to push this project forward to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal and close the deal (assuming everything is fine to our standards and timely on the other side). It\u2019s an ESG project, but the first project will cost $25M of which $20M is expected from MakerDAO (Loan to cost 75%, SF around 5.5%). This is no small amount for a single loan. It remains quite small compared to MakerDAO balance sheet (<0.5%) but this can be one point where people can be uncomfortable. The project will have a 20-year purchase agreement with PSEG ($50B in total assets), Baa1/BBB credit rating, and publicly listed (the MakerDAO credit facility itself would be for 5-7 years). I would say that we are faced mainly with construction risks (and some technological risks). So I wanted to do sentiment polling. This is obviously not the governance poll (for which we need a proper risk assessment). The outcome is informative only but will let us decide whether we should focus on that and deliver or be respectful of our partners and let them know that we pass and that they should work on another financing plan.    Should we finance the SolarX project?  yes no abstain     0 voters     Feel free to comment as well. ",

As part of our continued strategy to build a renewable energy and blockchain driven infrastructure platform, we have entered into a joint venture with a U.S.-based bitcoin mining company to develop an initial 100 Megawatts of zero-carbon bitcoin mining capacity. The partnership will draw upon the strengths of both companies as we collaborate to bridge the potential of clean energy and digital infrastructure assets. We will be sure to keep you updated and hope to reengage with MakerDao in the near future. Andy ",
