Lately I\u2019ve been using it to query my PIE balance in the DSR pot at various old blocknumbers (generally the end of each calendar day). I\u2019ve also been calling the CHI value so I can reconstitute my total DAI in the DSR\u2026 Infura is now charging $250 per month for archive (old) data, so I\u2019m somewhat stuck how to track this stuff. I\u2019ve seen covalenthq.com has an API to call old blocks, transactions, and event logs, which I suppose I can use to track down DRIP events (good for getting CHI values), but that still leaves me unable to query my DSProxy PIE balance at older blocks\u2026 Is there some free/cheap alternative to get this data besides setting up an archive node?

                    "content": "@yaginuma Hi again, Depend on what free tier you get. I have been able to start some Blockchain on AWS and cluster \u2026 Database and there is no limit almost but your wallet\u2026   Database Cluster is the name of the cluster that holds the instances  Database Instances are the names of each instance in the cluster. By default, if you named the instances \u201cmydb\u201d, AWS will append the AZ to the name. So it would become \u201cmydb-us-east-1c\u201d for example.  Database Name is the name of the initial database that will be created within Aurora. Think database like where you will add tables and data. If you do not specify a Database Name, you will just need to create your own - which is likely what you want to do anyway  Ive done all of this with a free tier ",
