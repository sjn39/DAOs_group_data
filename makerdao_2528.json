MKR tokens exist to govern the system as best as possible and delegating your vote doesn\u2019t fit in that description for me. I assume everyone holds MKR to eventually make money on it, by the appreciating value the token is expected to have if the system proves to work. In that regard, delegating your vote is like saying  Here, you do the work, I\u2019ll just be here occasionally watching the value of my holdings rise  I can understand not everyone can spend a huge amount of time on keeping up to date on everything but it should be a goal or ambition for MKR holders. This system simply can not work as intended without a diverse group of people doing their own due diligence on a frequent basis. I really wonder what makes everyone think that people who don\u2019t vote themselves, for whatever reason, are going to bother retracting their delegated MKR when it is being abused (before it is too late)? The whole point of having MKR is that you can vote entirely independent from everyone else and it seems, the second people will have the chance, they will stick it together in large groups? Like I said before, delegation is centralisation in this context. Vote delegation will come but it should not be expected to be the fix-all for a low participation rate. While the number of staked MKR in voting might rise, the actual people engaged with voting might be going down since they won\u2019t need to be paying attention anyway. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but I think it\u2019s worth thinking about. ",

It does seem realistic that they would do enough work to find someone trustworthy though. I really like things around liquid democracy, maybe votes could be even delegated by vote type. More about incentives: people who receive delegated votes will probably care about their reputation. I would expect people who receive a lot of proxy votes to have their real-world identity known, just because I don\u2019t see a significant amount of MKR holders give their vote to someone with no disincentive to burn their investment (such as a completely random person on the internet). After all the people who delegate have something at stake, so even if they don\u2019t have the time to vote themselves (or the belief that they would vote well) they still care a good amount who gets to proxy their vote.

First, let\u2019s think what do we want to optimize, In my opinion that\u2019s are:  Difficulty for bad actor to purposefully vote in a way to destroy MKR Level of information/knowledge that is behind each vote (kind of quality of vote)  How delegation will affect that Ad 1) I think it is obvious that delegation will increase number of MKR\u2019s participating in voting. Therefore it will decrease influence of single whale which is outside delegation. The trick is, what if delegation entity itself is corrupted? And that is valid concern! Why It would want to be corrupted? Well it do not risk own money only delegated one. Why It would not be corrupted? Well in order to be a delegator and gain significant power delegator needs to stand out and can not be anonymous (while whale can) that Increase public responsibility of such entity. Ad 2) I expect that delegation is a valid way of optimizing total time that need to be spended to make informed decision And last but definitely not least argument. Delegation is an volountary not mandatory system and by that it increases utility of MKR for each individual and a level of freedom he has to act. One can disagree, but I believe that more ways for people of organizing and expressing them selves is value on it\u2019s own. ",

So if an entity is voting with 100 MKR up to an additional 100 votes can be delegated to this entity. Also maybe there should be some lock up period where MKR can not be sold just after a vote.

Absolutely agree, the difficulty is ensuring that incentives are aligned.Prediction markets could maybe help solve this? A delegate could bet that MKR would not be printed in the next year, this way they would be separated from direct MKR volatility, but still be on the hook for decisions leading to inflation\u2026 There are probably more insidious ways to harm the system though\u2026 Unfortunately being exposed to MKR risk is the foundation of a governance body that is directly responsible for their choices, if you allow these to be separated, it harms the system.     swakya:  Can I ask your opinion on liquid democracy?   I am pro-liquid democracy. There are lots of sensible ideas in there. I particularly like the idea of being able to undelegate and redelegate as quickly and as easily as you want to. Everyone is unique, and will have their own priorities, these will not always match 1:1 with their delegate or representative. In most legacy representative systems there is limited scope for recalling an elected representative, in liquid democracy representatives (delegates) can be more effectively held to account or replaced. The recognition that different people have different skillsets and levels of expertise in different areas is also very valuable.     swakya:  Can you expand on this (lock up period)?   A lock up period prevents evasion of responsibility by voters. I have no doubt that there will be circumstances where MKR Holders make a decision and then we only find out a year later that we absolutely shouldn\u2019t have done it. This can be used to attack the system, a token holder could help to setup a situation that would lead to delayed consequences and sell before the consequences ocurr. This is also the reason that MKR Holders need to understand the whole of the system really, really well: so they can see through attempts like this. With respect to delegation, I think the idea was that the delegates MKR (in a system where a delegate was required to have their own MKR) would be locked for a time. This would counter their oversized influence with the negative consequence of having their personal MKR \u2018on the hook\u2019 to a greater degree. ",

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  being exposed to MKR risk is the foundation of a governance body that is directly responsible for their choices, if you allow these to be separated, it harms the system.   Very much agreed. I guess my expectation is that most of these problems are solved at the base level by having actual MKR holders collectively careful about who they proxy their vote to, who they lend to, etc\u2026 so any separation of concerns is originated by someone who has a stake in not giving power to a bad actor. That may be a naive take that gets thoroughly falsified in the future though!     LongForWisdom:  I think the idea was that the delegates MKR (in a system where a delegate was required to have their own MKR) would be locked for a time.   I see, but that doesn\u2019t help with a bad actor borrowing MKR? What I mean is that the initial concern is \u201cbad actor gets 100 proxy votes, has no stake\u201d. Then we say : must have 1 MKR to receive 1 additional vote power, and the owned MKR is locked. So the bad actor borrows 50 MKR & receives 50 proxy votes. Same voting power, no exposure to MKR. Thinking more about this, the structure is the same for borrowing and delegation: with borrowing, an actor uses funds to obtain the pure \u201cvote\u201d part of the MKR token; with delegation they use persuasion to the same effect. We can force delegation-based attacks to use a mixed borrowing-delegation strategy, but that doesn\u2019t seem very helpful. ",

I was thinking about this more, and I think there are some parallels to draw with going margin long on MKR. When you go margin long, a decrease in price eats into your deposit before the borrowed funds, this could map to voting in such a way that some of the delegate\u2019s MKR is transferred to the delegators if the price decreases while it\u2019s locked in the voting system. This would mean voting with delegated MKR would be a much larger risk. If the price rises, perhaps the increase in value is split between the delegators and the delegate (In practice this looks like MKR going from delegator to delegate.) Basically I\u2019m imagining some weird combination of the two problems where delegators become lenders and delegates become leveraged long traders. I need to think more about it, but I have an inkling there\u2019s a solution in there somewhere. ",

First, I think these threads are a great way to work through ideas around delegation, its benefits and it\u2019s disadvantages.  Perhaps by the end of this we can at least say, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to delegate your vote, this delegation model is the gold standard.\u201d  To that end, keep the discussion coming. However, to focus the discussion a little, I want to stress this fact: there is no technical way to stop vote delegation with our current system. That is, even if we are repulsed by the idea, or think it would make our ecosystem unhealthy, we cannot stop it from happening.  With this condition in mind, I believe we are best to inform MKR holders that want to delegate what they should be looking for in a delegation system. Some ideas (some solve the same problem):  Only allow a delegate to be in control of some multiplier of their stake.  E.g. if a delegate has 10 MKR, only allow and additional 1x, 2x, or Nx stake to be delegated.  This would result in total values of 10 + 10 = 20, 10 + 20 = 30, or 10 + 10*x respectively. Lock the delegate\u2019s stake up for some timeframe to ensure their MKR is accountable to the results of their vote. Allow a delegating user to withdraw their delegation at any time. Burn or slash the delegate\u2019s MKR if they verifiably vote against a known model.  If you reply to this list with ideas, I will try to keep it up-to-date.  We may want to spin a thread off to discuss the merits of each option at some point. My current interest in this is centered around the idea of risk teams (or funds) insofar as we may decide to delegate our MKR with a risk team based on their models, voting record, and results.  I was particularly captivated by the idea of using a PID controller to drill down on the peg, and I would love to delegate some of my MKR to a PID controller that successfully accomplished this goal. I share the centralization of power concerns that some of you have expressed in the same way that I am concerned about the effect of gravity on me when I fall: both are of concern, but are immutable laws of the system we\u2019re operating within.  To this end, let\u2019s focus on best practices for such a delegate system and hope that MKR holders will not delegate unless such a system possesses those ideal properties.  If we find a good mix of healthy properties for delegation we may be able to make using a system with more relaxed constraints as appalling as sending one\u2019s credit card over HTTP or logging into a remote system with telnet.

For me, this would happen if I was so busy with something else in my life \u2013 work, tragedy, etc. \u2013 that I could not spend time doing the research required for governance.  In this case, I would likely delegate to someone or something I trusted. I am far less likely to trust a human than a mathematical algorithm, but I would be willing to trust a human or a human informed by an algorithm, if there was some balancing of incentives.  To this end, I imagined a delegate informed by a verifiable algorithm.  As others and myself have suggested, we may ask a delegate to stake their MKR so that it\u2019s at risk if they misbehave.  One option for this would be to have a delegate lock their stake for a period of time where they must suffer the fallout from their actions, another option would be to lock it for a period of time so that those delegating could burn/slash the delegate\u2019s stake if they misbehaved.  If the delegate deviated from that algorithm by some unacceptable margin, then those delegating could slash or burn the delegate\u2019s stake.  This is what I meant by a known model. Probably the easiest model as an example would be:  If we are breaking the peg by a percent or more high or low, then a delegate should never vote for an SF change that would increase or decrease the SF respectively, as this would further break the peg in the same direction. In this world, not only do we have a gold standard for a delegate contract, but perhaps a list of rules that would expose the delegate to harm if violated.  This obviously works much better for something like single collateral DAI\u2019s SF change than it would for MCD\u2019s collateral approval process.  In the former we could even delegate to an algorithm, where in the later case we may want to delegate to a risk team (perhaps even a risk team that could disagree with the one making the collateral proposal). I hope this makes the thinking behind that one statement more clear. ",

So thanks for taking the time to write this up.     cmooney:  there is no technical way to stop vote delegation with our current system.   I\u2019d like to comment on this specifically, while there is no technical way to prevent someone from doing this, \u2018social\u2019 incentives do prevent it. Those that want vote delegation are specifically those that are least likely to take an active role in developing vote delegation. It requires time and effort to write up. If all the currently engaged people decide that it\u2019s a bad idea and don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s worth writing the contract, the contract is unlikely to get written. Obviously this is not a hard \u2018this can\u2019t be done\u2019 it is more of a soft: \u2018this is an uphill battle to get this done\u2019     Planet_X:  Because it promotes lazyness. And worse - once somebody gets their hands on MKR votes that do not belong to them the whole idea of 1 MKR = 1 vote starts to deteriorate.   Thanks for clarifying Planet, it\u2019s true that it does allow people to be lazy, but I\u2019d argue those people would be lazy regardless. It think it\u2019s more about having lazy people\u2019s MKR under the control of actively engaged people.     kwadrax:  The people asking for it are basically telling us they want to be less involved and I don\u2019t see why we should prioritise facilitating that.   There\u2019s some truth to this, and I would hate for us to develop delegation and for those people to disappear. As you say, we need more engagement, not less.     kwadrax:  Another question you could start thinking about, let\u2019s say you had voting delegation today, who would you delegate your vote too? You don\u2019t need to name names, I\u2019m not trying to make this into a popularity contest but are there even neutral/reliable options available yet?   Personally if I wanted to delegate I would be looking for someone with the following qualities:  A larger MKR stake than myself (that would be locked in a delegation contract) Past votes make sense to me. Active in the community.      cmooney:  another option would be to lock it for a period of time so that those delegating could burn/slash the delegate\u2019s stake if they misbehaved.   This is an interesting idea that I hadn\u2019t considered. Is there a risk of this being done maliciously though? Would you need to enforce a \u2018burn everything down\u2019 system, where the delegator can burn a smaller amount of his own stake to burn a larger amount of the delegates stake? Or perhaps an \u2018x of y\u2019 voting system within the delegation contract to allow multiple delegators to band together to burn the delegates stake. Is that vulnerable to sybil attacks? Could it be MKR weighted? ",

It would be nice if one could easily see an overview of the voting track record of a specific address/entity. I think I would maybe delegate to an entity with a track record I agreed with. ",
