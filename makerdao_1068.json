Sentence Summary MIP75 proposes the formalization of Task Forces. These groups will be responsible for coordinating high-level business decisions on behalf of the DAO. They may also work with an associated discretionary fund to realize business objectives.  Paragraph Summary MIP75 proposes the formalization of Task Forces. These groups are designed to directly interface with the delegates to coordinate and agree upon terms in advance to provide more autonomy within the Core Units. Task Forces can be formed by anyone, but the ratification process needs to be put to a vote due to discretionary fund requests being attached. Task Forces are free to add or remove members by their own consensus rules.  Component Summary MIP75c1: Task Force Description Task Force description. MIP75c2: Task Force Requirements Task Force compliance guidelines. MIP75c3: Onboard Task Force Task Force submission process component. MIP75c4: Task Forces List List of active Task Forces. MIP75c5: Offboard Task Force Task Force dissolution process component. MIP75c6: Request for Additional Funds Task Force request for additional funds process component.  Motivation There is a need to realize growth opportunities in an agile way, without having to burden the governance process with minutiae and without having to disclose potentially sensitive commercial details in the course of a negotiation. This includes, but is not limited to, commercial opportunities, ability to execute on deals, running DAO-wide offsites and Maker-led conferences like MakerCON/StableCON. Currently the process for getting cross-CU funds goes through the Special Purpose Fund which involves a 2-month period of uncertainty for anything beyond a trivial amount of cash. Additionally there\u2019s no process to discuss agreements with third parties and make decisions without disclosing sensitive information to the community. This MIP aims to provide a group of DAO-domain experts with the ability to transparently deploy cash in a timely manner.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP75c1: Task Force Description Task Forces must maintain a log with explanations of all purchases for the DAO to be able to review unless this would break the confidentiality of an agreement in progress. In addition these Task Forces should be viewed as an expert resource the delegates can directly communicate with to reach advanced consensus before proposals are posted to the forum. This MIP is meant to be a practical first step to get the ball rolling and is not intended to be a long-term solution. As such it is intentionally designed to minimally disrupt the current MIP process, but instead to augment it with informal consensus guidelines. There are other more detailed attempts to organize the governance structure for the long haul. This should be viewed as a pragmatic, interim solution to be replaced by a more robust DAO/Core Unit/Delegate overhaul. Proposals submitted by Task Forces can go through an expedited process if desired to reach advanced consensus ahead of votes and speed up the RFC phase. The expedited process will differ from the regular process with an advanced meeting between the Task Force and top delegates. This part is somewhat informal as the requirements may differ depending on the sensitivity of the deal. For example, if there are sensitive private details the Task Force should not include shadow delegates or low-MKR delegates to minimize the chance of leak. The formal difference between the expedited and regular processes is that the public RFC phase is reduced to at most one week. In total there will be a one-week public Feedback Period and a one-week Frozen Period (which can overlap). The monthly MIP process proceeds normally after this. This is still enough time for the community to halt any possible attack scenario. The goal here is to find a middle ground between trust and governance overhead. Here is an example of the difference with an expedited process:  936\u00d7547 38.5 KB  Most proposals should still go through the regular public process, but this new expedited process will allow us to reach consensus in advance of the vote for proposals being submitted by trusted members of the community.  MIP75c2: Task Force Requirements Task Forces are expected to maintain effective communication with the wider Maker community. Meetings between Task Forces and Delegates should be held whenever necessary, and the recommendations of those meetings should be posted to the forum. Task Forces are free to update their mandate and membership as they see fit with no governance process. This is to avoid governance overhead while pivoting, but Task Forces should always communicate any changes to the community.  MIP75c3: Onboard Task Force This process component is utilized to onboard a new Task Force which goes through the regular monthly cycle of governance.  Subproposal Template MIP75c2 subproposals must use the MIP75c2-Subproposal-Template template.  Subproposal Parameters The parameters for MIP75c2 subproposals are:   Feedback Period: 3 weeks.  Frozen Period: 1 week.  Ratification Polls for MIP75c2 subproposals involving a Task Force Onboarding will require using ranked-choice voting, with the options as follows:  A: Approve Task Force and associated delegated authority to spend funds B: Approve Task Force without associated delegated authority to spend funds C: Reject Task Force D: Abstain  In order for this Ratification Poll to conclude successfully and the contained proposal(s) move to Accepted status, each of the following conditions must be true:  A or B vote-weight must exceed C vote-weight when the poll closes. Winning vote-weight must exceed the Minimum Positive Participation value of 10,000 MKR when the poll closes.   Outcome Task Force is either onboarded or is rejected. If onboarded, a one-time payment of the requested initial funding is sent to the multi-sig. ======= TEMPLATE =======  MIP75c3-SP123: Onboard Task Force  Preamble MIP75c2-SP#: 123 Title: Onboard Task Force - NAME OF TASK FORCE Author(s): Name (@handle) Contributors: Tags: task-force Status: RFC Date Proposed: YYYY-MM-DD Date Ratified: N/A Forum URL: Ratification Poll URL:   Specification   Name: NAME OF TASK FORCE  Members:  Member Name (@handle) - Description of Role   Requested Initial Funding: FUNDING AMOUNT IN DAI  Multi-sig Address (m-of-n): MULTISIG ADDRESS   Mandate Free-form description of the Task Force.

It will serve as an active registry of approved Task Forces. Entries into this list should contain the following information:  Name: The name of the Task Force  Date Added: (yyyy-mm-dd)    Task Forces List  MIP75c5: Offboard Task Force This process component is utilized to offboard Task Forces. Any community member can begin an offboarding process which goes through the regular monthly cycle of governance.  Subproposal Template MIP75c5 subproposals must use the MIP75c5-Subproposal-Template template.  Subproposal Parameters The parameters for MIP75c5 subproposals are:   Feedback Period: 3 weeks.  Frozen Period: 1 week.   Outcome Task Force is either offboarded or they continue as-is. If offboarded, any outstanding unspent funding must be returned to the DAO at the earliest convenience. Upon approval, the subproposal that originally onboarded the Task Force (\u201cTarget SP\u201d in the subproposal template) will be marked as obsolete. ======= TEMPLATE ======= MIP75c5-SP#: 123 Title: Offboard Task Force - NAME OF TASK FORCE Author(s): Name (@handle) Contributors: Tags: task-force Status: RFC Date Proposed: YYYY-MM-DD Date Ratified: N/A Forum URL: Ratification Poll URL:   Specification   Name: NAME OF TASK FORCE  Target SP #: # of the Onboarding Proposal to Offboard   Description Free-form description of why this Task Force should be offboarded. ======= END TEMPLATE =======  MIP75c6: Request for Additional Funds This process component is utilized by Task Forces to request additional funds. Any Task Force member may begin a request for additional funds for their own group which goes through the regular monthly cycle of governance.  Subproposal Template MIP75c6 subproposals must use the MIP75c6-Subproposal-Template template.  Subproposal Parameters   Feedback Period: 3 weeks.  Frozen Period: 1 week.  In the case of an expedited request process, these parameters should be used instead:   Feedback Period: 1 week.  Frozen Period: 1 week.   Outcome In the case of success, funds are transferred to the specified multi-sig at the next available opportunity. If the proposal is rejected then there is no change and the Task Force continues to operate without a funding top up. ======= TEMPLATE ======= MIP75c6-SP#: 123 Title: Request for Additional Funds - NAME OF TASK FORCE Author(s): Name (@handle) Contributors: Tags: task-force Status: RFC Date Proposed: YYYY-MM-DD Date Ratified: N/A Forum URL: Ratification Poll URL:    Specification   Name: NAME OF TASK FORCE  Target SP #: # of the Onboarding Proposal to Offboard  Requested Initial Funding: FUNDING AMOUNT IN DAI  Multi-sig Address (m-of-n): MULTISIG ADDRESS   Description Free-form description of why this Task Force needs more funds. ======= END TEMPLATE ======= ",

Obtain commitment from people to do the work, potentially cross-CU.  Currently, people are employed by a single CU; this proposal aims to make the person-to-mandate mapping 1-to-many instead of 1-to-1. I get that you\u2019re trying to be lighter weight than a MIP39 Core Unit, but I wonder if there should be an option to realign member compensation? For example, successful completion of the Task Force goal(s) might result in a bonus payout to members. Or membership on the Task Force might be compensated and also entail an associated reduction in compensation from the member\u2019s home Core Unit?   Formally hold members accountable to the mandate.  However, there is not much in the current draft about successful or unsuccessful wind-down process. Failure process should probably be simpler than Core Unit offboarding, but similar issues probably need to be addressed. I wouldn\u2019t want to see unplanned MIPXXc4: Offboard Task Force proposals without some attempt to get a wayward Task Force back on track.   Fund the work (like an SPF) Do all this faster than the monthly cycle.  However, the current draft isn\u2019t that much faster.    I don\u2019t have any specific recommendations, but hopefully I\u2019ve raised some useful questions. ",

We don\u2019t expect this to be all or even most deals, but some will require this as we need to be able to apply negotiating tactics such as carrots and sticks with credible enforcement. Having these out in the open does not work as counter-parties can read everything and understand our limits to the DAOs disadvantage. Mandate is just what we focus on. For example, when we solve the stablecoin yield problem it\u2019s no longer an objective and we can move on. ",

It seems like the main justification for creating a new Task Force process is to support the Growth Task Force proposal. However, the main difference from the existing SPF mechanism is slightly less time for deliberation. Why does it even matter how long it takes to get the MIP through governance? It seems to me that once the Growth Task Force is activated then it can act unilaterally with no delay, regardless of whether it uses the existing SPF framework or proposed Task Force framework. So why not just use the existing SPF framework? For the specific case of a Growth Task Force, it would even save time to use the SPF mechanism. Otherwise we have to wait for governance to approve the MIP75 Task Force framework and then wait another governance cycle for the Growth Task Force specific instance. If you want to move fast then make it an SPF. ",

This is to avoid governance overhead while pivoting, but Task Forces should always communicate any changes to the community.   As the Freeze period is almost upon us, I did want to communicate one Governance concern with the wording here. As presented, the community could vote in a Task Force to focus on objective X, only to have the group pivot to objective Y after receiving funding. Since reporting requirements are encouraged but no formal process indicated, it is possible that this shift could be done without the broader community taking notice. However, it is important to note that this issue exists anytime funds are distributed. While Governance has more tools available for reprimanding a Core Unit that shifts their focus away from what was presented, the same lack of recourse exists for funds already distributed. We constantly remind community members to assume good faith until evidence proves otherwise, and assuming applicants might immediately switch a Task Force Mandate is not doing so. Still, as written there is plenty of opportunity to submit a proposal in good faith, only to have MKR voters feel taken advantage of by a naturally  occurring shifting of priorities. More stringent reporting requirements might mitigate this concern, but ultimately it would be up to the MKR holders to decide if they are comfortable with the assurances Task Force applicants offer in the event that this MIP passes.
