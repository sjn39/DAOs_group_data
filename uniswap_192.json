We are a dedicated team that is focused on progressing DeFi. We have ample experience with DeFi through Synthetix and Curve. In order to submit proposals 1% of UNI needs to be held by a Delegate. Once we have reached the 1% goal we will hold meetings on what kind of proposals we should make. So, if you have UNI and would like to participate in governance please consider us for delegation. Delegate and let your voice be heard. Delegate to: 0x15a49309a1d61436dfA67F6dE07ee0235dEBe8Bf ",

For example if you wanted to delegate to myself you would  place 0x15a49309a1d61436dfA67F6dE07ee0235dEBe8Bf in the section Recipient. Screenshot (163) - Copy901\u00d7649 96.1 KB Once you are satisfied with your decision you click on Delegate Votes to complete the process. To increase your delegation you simply increase your UNI holdings. I found this out when I bought some UNI went to increase my voting power and noted that the system had done it for me. As far as removing delegation it seems that there are two ways to go about it do I am only making assumptions. You simply delegate to someone else or move the UNI to another wallet. My UNI seem currently spendable do I might not be correct in this regard. It is not locked in Uniswap such as when liquidity is provided. ",
