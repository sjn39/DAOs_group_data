            "discussion": "",
            "body": "**Authors**: @schlabach & @HelloShreyas from [Llama](https://llama.xyz), @Kyle from Gitcoin\n\n### Summary\n\nWe propose moving $3 million of GTC (~1.2m GTC at time of writing) to a multisig wallet to execute the previously proposed treasury diversification. This will be exchanged for USDC via an agency desk in order to support critical DAO workstream funding needs. Any GTC that remains after the strategic diversification will be returned to the treasury. Given current market conditions and Gitcoin's operating needs, we think this is a prudent action to take.\n\n### State of GitcoinDAO\u2019s Treasury\n\nToday, GitcoinDAO\u2019s [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57a8865cfB1eCEf7253c27da6B4BC3dAEE5Be518) holds 23m GTC (roughly $57.1m). GitcoinDAO\u2019s [Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44aa9c5a034c1499ec27906e2d427b704b567ffe) holds another 26m GTC which will be distributed to the DAO over time.\n\nThe vast majority of the DAO\u2019s treasury is held in GTC, with very little in stablecoins. At the end of May, the DAO held $280k in DAI and USDC.\n\n### Rationale for Exchange\n\nIndividual DAO workstreams have been funded in GTC and are now facing an asset-liability mismatch. Many contributors have wages denominated in USD terms, yet workstreams only have GTC with which to pay said contributors. With the market downturn, workstreams now face an increased risk of not being able to meet these obligations. We wanted to quickly ensure that workstreams can meet their obligations.\n\nWe\u2019re engaging with a reputable agency desk to execute this transaction. The agency desk will utilize a broad range of liquidity sources to execute the transaction with approximately 10 bps of slippage or less. The agency desk will charge 20 bps as a fee and will likely be able to execute the transaction within 3 days. This will ensure that each workstream has the stables needed to meet near term expenses.\n\nWe\u2019ve proposed working with a trusted agency desk on the transaction as an alternative to requiring workstreams to sell GTC on the open market, which would be inefficient, costly, and operationally riskier.\n\n### Other Notes\n\nAny GTC that remains after these two actions will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n### Execution\n\nWe will create the on-chain proposal to transfer GTC from the treasury to a 5/6 multisig. Signers on the multisig will be the the following Gitcoin Stewards:\n\n* Kyle Weiss\n* Annika Lewis\n* Shreyas Hariharan\n* Kris\n* Simona\n* James / Fire Eyes\n\nA Snapshot proposal will be posted to Gitcoin\u2019s Snapshot for a community vote.

                    "content": "Authors from Llama: @schlabach, @0xJosh, @helloshreyas Summary We propose that Gitcoin diversify $15 million of its treasury into stablecoins. $15m constitutes 24% of the vested treasury and 2% of the total treasury (vested + unvested). The goals of the treasury diversification are to de-risk Gitcoin\u2019s treasury, make sure the treasury has sufficient stablecoins to cover one year of operating expenses, and ensure that GTC tokens are held by long-term partners. This post outlines the need and process for the treasury diversification. We are also seeking members to fill four spots in a treasury diversification working group. Please respond to this post if you are interested! Need for Stablecoins in the Gitcoin Treasury As of January 13, Gitcoin\u2019s treasury stood at $62 million, 99% of which was held in GTC tokens. Gitcoin\u2019s treasury vester wallet contains $543 million worth of GTC tokens. Additionally, working group wallets contain a small amount of DAI used to pay contributors. Gitcoin\u2019s operating budget has grown significantly since the launch of the DAO and is now approximately $3-4 million per quarter. This budget is used to fund the FDD working group, Moonshot Collective, Gitcoin\u2019s public goods effort, marketing expenses, Gitcoin decentralization efforts, and the DAO Ops workstream. More details on Gitcoin\u2019s spending can be seen in Llama\u2019s monthly financial statements for the DAO. (s/o to @Elliott) At the same time, Gitcoin\u2019s governance token continues to be volatile. From September 28 to November 27, the price of GTC rose from $6.30 to $28.04, more than quadrupling. Since its high in late November, the token has fallen and now trades around $11.75. This volatility in price affects Gitcoin\u2019s treasury and makes it difficult to forecast and address future spending. Gitcoin\u2019s annual operating budget ($15m) currently constitutes 24% of the vested treasury. If GTC\u2019s price falls by 50%, Gitcoin\u2019s treasury will also decrease by 50%, which would make it difficult to meet or increase operating expenses. Gitcoin\u2019s growth should not be hampered by short term swings in its token price. Gitcoin should have at least 1 year of operating expenses in stablecoins so that it has clarity on its budget and is able to comfortably pay its contributors. Additionally, paying contributors in GTC could put downward pressure on the price of the GTC token. Contributors may choose to sell their tokens at a later date, pushing the price of GTC down. Diversifying a portion of Gitcoin\u2019s treasury will give the following benefits:  De-risk the Gitcoin treasury and lower its volatility Allow Gitcoin workstreams and contributors the option to get paid in stables if they choose Allow Gitcoin to operate from a position of strength in case of a market downturn Lower operational costs required to sell GTC for stables each quarter in order to pay contributors Ensure that GTC tokens are held by long-term partners  Proposal Given the rationale outlined above, we propose that the Gitcoin treasury exchange $15m in GTC for USDC or DAI to strategic partners and individuals chosen by the community. In order to carry out this diversification of the Gitcoin treasury, we propose the following process as an actionable roadmap:  Form a 5-person working group from the DAO to work on the plan for diversifying the Gitcoin treasury. Draft a comprehensive governance forum post, detailing the logistics of the diversification of the Gitcoin treasury and the types of strategic partners desired. Additionally, it will explain how potential strategic partners should express their interest via a response to the forum post. Vet strategic partners based on select criteria established by the DAO and ask these partners to speak to the community (on a platform such as Discord or Twitter Spaces) and elaborate on their interest, their value add, their vision, etc. The working group will deliberate and form a shortlist of potential strategic partners. Share the working group\u2019s shortlist with the community via a forum post to gather input. Come together as a working group to draw up the final details following community feedback. The diversification plan and the proposed new strategic partners will be put to an on-chain governance vote.  This process is purposefully designed with the objective of being open, transparent, and community-led. The Gitcoin community will be involved across the process and is integral to the decision making. Taking this into consideration, the working group will arrive at a price at which to sell GTC to the new strategic partners based on community feedback and market reaction to the announcement. Additionally, the working group will speak with lawyers to incorporate any relevant disclosures in the treasury diversification process. For tax purposes, Gitcoin should set aside a reserve and account for any tax liabilities resulting from the treasury diversification. Potential Strategic Partners Overall, GitcoinDAO is looking for long-term strategic partners that bring a diverse set of experience, competencies, and ideas to the table. They should see this as a partnership, whereby all parties will work together to nurture Gitcoin into the stellar project it aims to be. We invite participation from DAOs, Gitcoin community members, highly integral individuals in the crypto ecosystem, and groups that align with Gitcoin\u2019s mission of funding public goods. We want to cultivate a robust group of entities and individuals from all parts of the crypto landscape. Further detail is to be outlined in a follow-up forum post after forming the working group. Treasury Diversification Working Group As outlined in the Proposal section, the first step is to establish a 5-person working group to focus on the treasury diversification. We ask that interested members please respond to this forum post to submit their candidacy. We welcome and urge members from all walks of the community to apply. If you are interested, please respond to this post with the following: involvement in the Gitcoin community, pertinent knowledge on treasury diversification / strategic partners / DAOs, and valuable experience across crypto and non-crypto roles that may be applicable. We propose that Llama fills one of the five working group seats. Execution Once the treasury diversification working group establishes the details of the process, including execution price and possible new strategic partners, Llama can build smart contracts needed to execute the sale. The contracts will enable GitcoinDAO to enter counterparty addresses, token amounts, and the vesting schedule. The smart contracts will then stream GTC to the strategic partners according to the agreed-upon vesting schedule in exchange for USDC or DAI. These contracts should also immediately unlock the voting power for the new strategic partners for both vested and unvested tokens. This will help Gitcoin execute the diversification entirely on-chain and trustlessly after the governance vote passes. Implementation details may change based on feedback from the Gitcoin community and our strategic partners. Compensation Working group members will be compensated on a basis of $150/hr, with a maximum number of hours for an individual being 30. Additionally, we propose that the working group be compensated for any legal expenses or security audits incurred from the operations pertaining to smart contract engineering and legal review of the process. Conclusion As noted above, this process is designed to be open, transparent, and community-led. Gitcoin is not alone in facing this challenge; many other DAOs are heavily concentrated in their native tokens, resulting in issues with budgeting and paying contributors. A treasury diversification should be a win-win for both the DAO/community and incoming strategic partners. Ideally, Gitcoin\u2019s treasury diversification should serve as a template for other DAOs facing the same challenges.

UMA community and I would be happy to help anywhere we can especially in the design of an instrument for diversification.  I think you are familiar with success tokens.  This would be a good way to raise funds.  Essentially sell GTC with a lock-up and no discount, but in return reward the holder a call option.  This would properly align incentives and ensure cooperation with the strategic partners.  Contracts are all audited and our DAO products such as KPI options have been used by many DeFi projects.  The Gitcoin treasury just needs to decide the parameters and we can deploy. Also, I would be happy to share our experiences diversifying and managing our treasury.  We were fortunate, but did make some good decisions over the last year and a half and have almost $50MM of non-UMA assets accumulated. ",

I\u2019ve been chatting with Stewards about the matter in DMs, so I\u2019m excited it has become a proposal. (Here\u2019s an example of a stable+governance coin strategy I shared with them in December used by SeedClub, found at audio position 3:40 Goodbye bosses, hello voting and crypto pay: A new kind of company is taking hold | WBUR News .) I would like to be part of this WG.   I\u2019m a KERNEL Fellow KB3 and and I\u2019ve been a community member of Gitcoin since August 2021 in various WGs (mostly Public Goods Library).   I\u2019m the (LEETH certified) Chair of LexDAO\u2019s \u201cPerforming Rights DAO\u201d project  that will draft Ethereum metadata standards \u201cbackwards compatible\u201d with DDEX. And I\u2019ll likely be able to access LexDAO\u2019s expertise about treasury diversification if I\u2019m included in this WG (potentially save on legal fees? At least get a second opinion).   I\u2019m the Liaison for the Pluriverse/Multiverse DAO that RaidGuild is building for Gitcoin and, if all goes well, I might have to deal with this issue there as well.   I\u2019m a \u201ctest subject\u201d in that I\u2019m still living month-to-month like many of the contributors most affected by volatility; here\u2019s when I was a test subject in the past, to help explore apartment renting solutions for Web3 contributors https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1459300439422222336 .   I\u2019m helping prepare for https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co , and secured a $10k sponsorship from nfDAO. Additionally, over 50% of the proceeds from the 3D statue https://cheerbot.org 's I\u2019m auctioning at Schelling Point will go to public goods, made possible by grants from nfDAO, dGrants and Schelling Point.   I\u2019m a graduate of New Ventures BC\u2019s Venture Accelerator Program, have a background in corporate music publishing, a JD from Western Law, a BBA in music management from Belmont University, hold a patent in a novel software architecture (\u201cHierarchical Script Database and Database Applications\u201d), created a new kind of software syntax (see https://ape.mirror.zyz ) and discovered multiple mathematical facts including recursive/fractal tilings of the Euclidean plane (e.g. PythagMetal - Alchemy ) and Fibonacci-like integer sequences (e.g. A328604 - OEIS ).   If I am not able to join this WG, I hope that I can in the least be an observer in order to apply what I learn to Gitcoin\u2019s Pluriverse/Metaverse DAO.

The big question is \u201chow do we mesh trust and reputation of the participants who action the funds allocation decisions with the expertise and degeneracy of those who best know what to do?\u201d Here are some ideas: Separate the operations from the subject matter experts The subject matter experts should be one step away from full degen, but are in the process of getting green pilled. Maybe offer payment as a percentage of their effect on the treasury rather than hourly. The working group may include 2 from CSDO and 3-5 SME. Have CSDO control the multisig used for execution When the working group makes a decision, the CSDO can execute it. Why? Because these are all workstream leads with history an reputation with Gitcoin. Plus, they are almost constantly available. They are some of the most active people in the DAO. Get great risk managers/portfolio managers on the SME working group Separating the operations from the decisions can allow for better checks and balances. It will let the SME group do what they do best without needing to administer anything. Take a lesson from traditional finance and have the operations executed separately. I am worried that we might select people who are enthusiastic, successful in other lines of work, and potentially great people for the DAO, but shouldn\u2019t be in this working group unless they have a track record of great trades, proper risk management, and are web 3 native.

After we complete this diversification, we can explore a more permanent working group to focus on managing the overall treasury. All of the execution can be done in a trustless manner after the working group has made its decision - we will build the smart contracts needed to facilitate the swaps and required vesting. There shouldn\u2019t be too much to do operationally (just whitelisting investor addresses). ",

Putting up a new forum post asking partners to share their interest in participating in the diversification. Having conversations with potential partners. Responding to community feedback on the next forum post and incorporating in the decision making process. Choosing final list of partners, allocation sizes, and rationale. Sharing with the community for feedback. Whitelisting the final partners\u2019 addresses. Putting up an on-chain proposal and ensuring execution goes smoothly over the following two weeks.  ",

                    "content": "Congrats to the new Treasury WG !  Let us know how Dao members can support you. And I agree UMA is a great candidate to research regarding treasury management.  I was introduced to them about 5 months ago and have been hanging out a bit in their Discord.  I think their future is pretty good so I signed up to their new SuperUMAn Dao too.  I have access to good content there, but ofc the gist of it is all in the docs online.  I am still learning what they can offer but here is a link to their basic slide deck describing how the KPI tokens work. Please ignore the blank slides in the deck. One more link to a newer UMA products called Success Tokens. I am not sure how the KPI option tokens and Success Tokens compare to other alternatives but I will try to figure it out.  If nothing else I can connect the Gitcoin economists with the UMA economists. I\u2019d be happy to help facilitate any coordination between these groups.  Maybe EthDenver can be the catalyst.  UMA will have a sizeable group at EthDenver I hear. And on another front entirely, 1Hive has partnered with Hedgey Decentralized Options to experiment with some treasury management ideas.  The first round resembled traditional option markets but for round two, which just began, they are trying a different approach.  They have basically grouped the five most common option scenarios into liquidity pools into-which dao members buy/invest with stablecoins.  So the protocol gets to sell some native tokens for stablecoins, and the dao-members get a chance to profit via discounted purchases of those native tokens.  A pic is worth a 1000 words so just take a glance at the website here and you can get the idea.  Just imagine $GTC instead of $HNY, the native token of 1Hive.  Maybe we can reproduce this kind of market for $GTC in-house.  And probably important to mention it they are marketed as way to \u2018go-long\u2019 and support projects while benefiting by effectively locking in lower pricing of a dip.  They are not so much a degen leverage tool.  I can connect you with the Hedgey team if desired. ",
