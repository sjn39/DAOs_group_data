GTC will allow Gitcoin to decentralize, giving community members a voice in the future of Gitcoin, and the future of the open internet. OUR MISSION is to enable communities to build and fund open source, digital public goods. This technology is a superpower, supporting hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity per year. But more importantly open source is the foundation for coordination tools that allow humans to work together for the common good. The more successful we are achieving our mission, the more governance questions come up. We don\u2019t want to make these decisions centrally, which is why we\u2019re taking a giant leap towards decentralizing Gitcoin starting today. Community governance By launching GTC, we are gradually turning Gitcoin governance over to the community. Anyone who holds GTC will be able to participate in governing Gitcoin Grants, help guard Gitcoin against fraud, and decide how the Gitcoin treasury is allocated. And more! Have you ever participated in a project on Gitcoin through Grants, Bounties, KERNEL, or Hackathons? Have you funded public goods through Gitcoin? You may have received GTC today. Find out here: ",

It also formed a de-facto community DAO, and used email as means of validation of past participation. I agree there should be some way for people who missed the window, or were otherwise erroneously missed, to file a claim so to speak. In the case of this other DAO, one thing I noticed is that they posted a \u201cProof of Contribution\u201d form for folks to submit if they didn\u2019t get the airdrop. It\u2019s a pretty simple form, but you\u2019d need people to review the submissions. So it would take a proposal and a vote, and forming a team to carry it out, I guess? I\u2019m new to this stuff \ud83e\udd37\ud83d\ude04 Anyway, here\u2019s a link to the form as a reference: Spork DAO - Proof of Contribution Form Good luck! ",
