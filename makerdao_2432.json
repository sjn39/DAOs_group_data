It is still early but COMP is already gaining a good bit of media buzz. It currently has a marketcap of close to $495MM, and is held by some large institutional investors. Coinbase has already announced support for the token and overall it seems like it may be an interesting token going forward. Given the large usage of compound.finance I would generally be fairly bullish on it personally, and it seems like it would probably be worth discussing a potential collateral addition. What do people think? Is it too early to try and integrate? Is it worth trying to secure a \u201cfirst mover\u201d advantage? Is it just another fad token? ",

However, given the newness of the asset, I see increased volatility (primarily when it lists on Coinbase). If we were to add it right away, I think this increased volatility would warrant a higher stability fee (it\u2019s also important to note liquidity is low at the moment). I came across one person\u2019s DCF of $COMP. And while a DCF is highly subjective, I believe it can give a general base as to where the asset\u2019s fair value is. Given John Todaro\u2019s DCF below, I think it may suggest this $COMP extreme jump in price is a lot of hype. As such, I think it may be better to evaluate $COMP when the hype dies down and we\u2019re able to see the long-term impact, and importance of Compound\u2019s token. At the moment, 95% of all COMP is being claimed by USDT suppliers. This is due to the insanely high yield on USDT. It\u2019s important to note that just as CEXs drive DEX prices (for the time being), OTC desks drive the yields in open finance lending protocols like Compound. The current yields on Tether will eventually come down as more people search for yield in this low interest rate environment and global macro factors ~hopefully~ abate. Once that happens, I may have a little more faith in $COMP. But anything that Tether dominates gives me second thoughts. If we add $COMP, this opens the door to the risk that if Tether flash crashes, $COMP will be negatively affected considering there are 0 Compound reserves at the moment. This could potentially cause massive liquidations in our own backyard. Especially given the number of unique holders is only 2629 individuals EazPauhVcAE_0T91422\u00d7668 93.8 KB ",

One consequence is that submitting a MIP6 should be a very permissive and open process, and I don\u2019t think it should be expected to ask the community for input before making a MIP6 application, even a relatively low effort one - of course it\u2019s great to have a discussion before posting a MIP6 application, but it should also be totally optional and acceptable to just go straight to posting the MIP6 application if you feel like something would be a good collateral type. This is in contrast to actual MIPs, since they can have a binding effect on the system, and it is definitely good manners to give the community a heads up before putting one up for the RFC phase and starting the countdown for a vote.

We have already seen borrowers and lenders in the defi space have little allegiance, so gaining back dominance vs unsustainable policies should not be an issue. We should make sure though that we are competitive in a way that does not exaggerate the real risks. Imo though risk is not factored in very well on our platform or others. Far from being too conservative, it really seems like everyone is being a little irrational. Although I think we\u2019ve managed to hold a more conservative and cautious approach to cryptocurrency risk than competitors. From what I have heard and can tell, the entire mechanics of the COMP token right now seem questionable, certainly with negative effective rates.

Not to say that isn\u2019t a discussion to be had, but it probably warrants a separate thread. Having that out of the way, I really appreciated @RepoTactics providing a bit of context regarding the discounted cash flows. Based on that information I would be of the opinion that COMP at least at the moment seems a bit overpriced. That said i am not exactly sure how much that really matters, as the protocol doesn\u2019t really \u201cpurchase\u201d the collateral when a user opens a vault as much as it enters a repurchase agreement with that user. Diving a bit into my own personal opinions, The protocol provides facilities for users to take levered long positions on collateral that they feel bullish on. It is our responsibility to 1 price the risk that we are taking by providing those facilities (plus some premium so we make a bit of revenue) and 2 determine what is an appropriate level of exposure for the protocol given the rest of our loan portfolio as well as our ability to liquidate the collateral to OTC or exchange markets. All of this is to say that I think even with potentially overvalued collateral there may still be an opportunity given the right stability fee and DC. To that end I guess I\u2019ll ask a few of questions. 1 How much do you disagree with my assessment above? 2 Do we have some mechanism with which we may be able to estimate the volatility of recent ICOs until a reasonable amount of data exists about the token itself. I would imagine that you might be able to get a decent idea by looking at some index similar to the renaissance IPO index. Does anyone know of a similar index for the crypto space? 3 What markets exist (or are planned to exist) where this collateral might be liquidated, and what are the depth of those markets? To my knowledge there are 2 places where COMP holders will be able to sell these tokens in the short term without entering into an OTC trade Uniswap and Coinbase. On uniswap the current liquidity pool is around ~$4MM that\u2019s (10x what we see for the BAT:ETH swap). I imagine that we may be able to estimate what the coinbase market might eventually look like by averaging tokens of a similar size in terms of market cap, but that is going to take a bit more research on my part. TLDR: I can agree that COMP may be a bit overvalued at the moment, but it may still have a part to play in the collateral portfolio with the right stability fee and DC. Personally id be quite comfortable with it as an addition with a DC of around 1.5 ~ 2.5MM even before I went through the effort of determining an appropriate stability fee just to determine the appetite for leverage there.
