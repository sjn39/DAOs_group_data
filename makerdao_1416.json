                    "content": " Request Recognized delegates are currently scored on voting frequently and communicating their reasoning. Right now, the scores consider the lifetime performance of each delegate. This has the benefit that delegates who scored well in the past can afford to take a couple weeks per year off w/o falling below the threshold. But it has the downside that delegates who have a bad score today can never \u201credeem themselves\u201d and reach a good score again. In my case, I haven\u2019t been interested in working as a salaried delegate intially but rather use the delegate position as an activist platform for improving governance and treasury management (examples here and here). However, this work has been more time consuming than I expected and I cannot in good conscience continue w/o any compensation. The easiest path is to also become a salaried delegate, vote only on the matters where I have expertise (such as governance and treasury management), and abstain for the rest. However, with the scores I have accumulated to date I could score perfectly for years and still never qualify for payment. So this model of measuring delegate performance is clearly broken. As a hotfix, I propose resetting my score once. I originally wanted to propose to allow all delegates to reset their scores once per year, but after deliberating with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit, it seems that a generalized rule for delegates would have to pass via MIP whereas a one-time-change can pass via signal request. This request is orthogonal to any more fundamental discussions we\u2019re having about how to incentivize delegates going forward.  Pros and cons Pros:  Hasu\u2019s delegation score would accurately reflect the new commitment, not historic performance Compensation only begins if performance meets MIP61 standards going forward Retain one of the larger MKR delegates  Cons:  Would lead to an increase in DAI expenses for the protocol It becomes harder for prospective delegators to see Hasu\u2019s true voting history Can lead to other delegates requesting a reset before a MIP is formalized   Poll    Reset delegation metrics for Hasu?  Yes, reset delegation metrics for Hasu No, don\u2019t reset delegation metrics for Hasu Abstain     0 voters      Next steps This Signal will run for ~2 weeks, ending on July 23th. If more than 50% of the non-abstaining votes are in favor it will proceed to a governance poll to settle the issue. If Yes does not get a majority in this signal, no Governance action will be taken as a result. ",

What I wanted to see was a change in delegate compensation for a period being tied to the performance in the period as that would have settled many performance issues as well as an idea to take into account that people take vacation and get sick (you know like real jobs account for?!) so perhaps delegates should get some number of free passes they can spend to account for this. Now whether there should be some fraction that is longer term or not idk. I already noted that people with 100% performance records could basically NOT do anything for their last month and still receive full compensation due to their past performance record. So rather than make a delegate specific exemption I would encourage you @Hasu to make a proposal for a systemic change that takes into account such examples vs. asking for an exception that does nothing to fix the basic performance/compensation problem.

Tried to cool down with some race-cycling and playing with my kids - not sure if I am normal again so take all of this with a grain of salt.  I am fine with doing one-offs, if there would be a serious attempt to fix the root cause. I agree that the current system is not ideal. So if you would do a stab at fixing this, I would be more inclined to support this Signal Request. Bonus points for adding a serious penalty if delegates fail to support an official executive without providing a reasons in their platform - one of the last execs was sitting unscheduled for a week (!) because of lack of (also your) support, despite not containing any dangerous contents - or at least nobody was speaking about it. Just a couple of days ago, you stated in discord that you are not interested in providing views for MKR holders (source) - did this change? Asking because the rules of the compensation system are up for quite some time, and you should have been aware of it before. Many of the contributors to MakerDao spend years here, most of them never saw any real compensation. Reputation isn\u2019t built in some weeks. Maybe this is a good opportunity to \u201cfix the system\u201d by proposing a MIP modification?     MakerMan:  I already noted that people with 100% performance records could basically NOT do anything for their last month and still receive full compensation due to their past performance record.

It aims to provide clarity around this Signal Request:   This is a valid SR. It will run for 11 days, until Saturday, July 23. GovAlpha was consulted about this timeline before the SR was posted. We indicated we could accommodate it.   This SR aims to reset the metrics of @Hasu\u2019s performance as Recognized Delegate to impact their compensation.   If approved by > 50% of non-abstain votes, this proposal will be eligible for an on-chain poll on 2022-07-25, which will run for three days. This will be a binary vote. If the reset is ratified, it will be done on 2002-08-01.   GovAlpha is working on formalizing the Recognized Delegate role - including resets on voting metrics (see @prose11\u2019s comment). However, that will not be voted on for a couple of months yet. This is why we recommended the SR route when Hasu expressed that the timing was subpar.   We have assigned this signal as medium impact as it may result in a fairly trivial impact on the Surplus Buffer. Delegate compensation is maxed out currently at 12,000 DAI per month.   ",

Thanks      MakerMan:  So rather than make a delegate specific exemption I would encourage you @Hasu to make a proposal for a systemic change that takes into account such examples vs. asking for an exception that does nothing to fix the basic performance/compensation problem.       ultraschuppi:  I am fine with doing one-offs, if there would be a serious attempt to fix the root cause. I agree that the current system is not ideal. So if you would do a stab at fixing this, I would be more inclined to support this Signal Request.       rspa:  So basically you can build a comfortable or uncomfortable legacy. It would definitely be better to have something like a 60day MA or some other number that reflects actual performance in the period where compensation is paid, but also allows delegates to accrue some buffer for exceptional circumstances.

I am unsure sure why this isn\u2019t pursued first as it is clearly the best option.   GovAlpha is currently working on defining the delegate role and plans to do so with a MIP posted in the next few weeks (voting on in September). We plan to include a component for allowing delegates to reset metrics from time to time, as the criticism of part the current system is quite valid - if something happens to a recognized delegate leaving them unable to vote for an extended period of time they will likely not recover their compensation on any reasonable timeline. Hasu asked if GovAlpha would consider resetting his before the MIP is voted on, as 3 months without compensation (July, August, September before the MIP could be passed) is a long time to be working with nothing in return. I felt this would be inappropriate to apply based solely on my discretion so I encouraged a signal. Also, I think Hasu deserves the credit of thinking about his fellow delegates as he wanted to include this option for all delegates. However, I felt like that was pretty clearly overstepping what a Signal Request is designed to do, and advised him that this would be the appropriate format if he was trying to rectify the situation without a new MIP.     MakerMan:  I got no reset missing 10-15 polls and 1 exec for my wife being sick and in the hospital early on that hurt me.   You could have proposed one though, and I think it\u2019s fair to mention the retroactive Compensation Signal GovAlpha helped put together on your behalf when we changed the comp formula the first time. This is just to say that we have used signals to correct imbalances with the Delegate Comp MIP before  so any comparisons to other instances of non-action should keep this in mind. ",

Wait for the full govalpha delegate proposal to come to the table and be debated.   At that time add a provision allowing for retroactive compensation evaluation starting from a date (let\u2019s say Aug 1.)   Wait for MIP to be ratified.   Once ratified, if a delegate has complied and would have been eligible under the past window, they can apply for payment as per the MIP.    This path achieves 3 things:   Allows for a charitable consideration of Hasu\u2019s circumstance, but applies the same terms even evenhandedly to all delegates.   Places the burden of performance on delegates prior to compensation. This is important in instances of historic underperformance.   It ensures integrity of the MIP system and governance. This path will lead to thorough discussion and evaluation of compensation terms, including retroactive comp. It also ensures engagement with the various issues by all parties (a more robust proposal upon ratification).   ",

I\u2019d invite the DAO to discuss if it wants me involved at all and if yes in what capacity, then come back with a proposal. This has been the only ever proposal to Maker that affected myself in any way and after the experience I will not make another. ",

However, I felt like that was pretty clearly overstepping what a Signal Request is designed to do, and advised him that this would be the appropriate format if he was trying to rectify the situation without a new MIP.   This is an important detail - lots of commentators in this thread have been quick to jump on Hasu for asking for special treatment but it\u2019s clear that he would have preferred a fix to the broader system rather than asking for a one-off ad hoc change. I\u2019d also ask the naysayers to think about the broader picture here. Hasu is one of the most respected researchers and thinkers in the space. He\u2019s proposed some substantive and thoughtful ideas for the direction of governance at Maker, whether you agree with them or not. This signal request is tiny stakes, absolutely negligible impact on Maker. It\u2019s crazy that this thread has erupted with such toxic nastiness in the context of such a minuscule request, particularly given Hasu was given specific advice from GovAlpha to make the signal request about himself rather than all delegates\u2026 ",

                    "content": "    prose11:  You could have proposed one though, and I think it\u2019s fair to mention the retroactive Compensation Signal GovAlpha helped put together on your behalf when we changed the comp formula the first time. This is just to say that we have used signals to correct imbalances with the Delegate Comp MIP before so any comparisons to other instances of non-action should keep this in mind.   Sure I could have proposed something but we already see what the reception is here to someone proposing money for themselves. @PaperImperium proposal for retroactive comp for example. I believe this conceptually sets a bad precedent and the optics are bad for those who will gain to put forward the signal. @aburban90 for example has worked tirelessly for years without any retroactive comp, I know there are many others. Some proposed and got their own retroactive comp @Risk-Core-Unit for example I am not even sure if Vasu got a piece of that (I hope he did). Rather than broaden this discussion further I will narrow it down somewhat. In the case of delegates or any other situation it is my preference is that instead of people coming forward to ask for money for themselves, GovAlpha being somewhat neutral here could reach out with more global proposals based on comments by any DAO participant and include in any proposal for change, who such a change will affect how so that (1) the ramifications of such a proposal to the entire DAO could be assessed (i.e. who will it affect how, and how much the retroactive change will cost). In this case I suspect any change would affect me, @PaperImperium @Hasu I am not sure who else nor for how much. My main point is that changes need to come NOT from the people who will get such compensation, but from a 3rd party who does not gain from such measures being considered or passed. In the case above any change to delegate, performance resets, or changes to delegate compensation could affect all delegates. When these things come forward as Global system changes, from a party that doesn\u2019t gain (GovAlpha), with a list of who they will affect how and the cost involved (if possible to project) this then imho puts forward a neutral proposal where we know \u2018what will be changed\u2019, \u2018how it will affect the group\u2019, \u2018whom it will affect specifically\u2019, \u2018and what it will cost\u2019 vs. a party that stands to gain and is in fact \u2018conflicted\u2019 in terms of interest. This way when the compensation change comes through we probably won\u2019t need a second proposal to pass governance, and can move straight from proposal being adopted with compensation changes going straight to an executive. The above kind of model then makes a DAO with neutral stewards looking out for other people\u2019s interests vs. a DAO of selfish individuals looking to \u2018get something for themselves\u2019. Generally I am for change in this regard as long as the change is system wide, applied universally to those it applies to vs. this specific 1off MakerMan, PaperImperium or Hasu, etc. needs a special disposition. I honestly cringed when my own 1-off came up and I think I abstained from voting on that poll, I can\u2019t speak for Paper but suspect him putting up that request was also awkward, can\u2019t speak for Hasu but I can say neither Paper or myself threatened to \u2018quit\u2019 over such things and to me is disappointing but not unreasonable to expect to hear. The fact delegates get compensated in DAI and don\u2019t get MKR vesting is disappointing so they are treated differently than all CUs/contractors. If this changes will it also be done retroactively and across the board to all affected. Time will tell. @prose11 I have always appreciated GovAlpha looking at these things from a larger perspective and appreciate a MIP being in the works here to correct the situation. If MakerDAO is going to seriously consider this then I respectfully request @PaperImperium and myself be added as well and a general look at who this might affect. If Hasu is in some desperate need for DAI compensation perhaps we can pass a signal request for a compensation loan against future income.  ",

Why does the DAO have to wait for someone to complain and ask for something before it acts vs. noticing there is one or more cases and broad brush equally for all parities concerned vs. doing 1-off deals.

I would recommend contracting with one of these CU that are big boosters of yours, SFCU for example seem like big fans.  They can simply budget some R&D funds for you. The delegate role needs to be neutral bureaucrat, you have already entangled yourself too much with CU and IC in private to credibly meet this requirement. You also failed to fulfill the expectations of a delegate to date and are more interested in drafting proposal ideas than performing the day to day work.

You post really leaves a lot to be desired , and honestly, a little self pitying. Twitter fame does no good here, just merits.  If we look at the delegate metrics, you failed.

A Simple and Easy Remedy Please see the proposed remedy below which has not yet received any response from \u201cyes\u201d voters. It solves the issue in a fair and even handed manner consistent with governance best practices. Perhaps you could find the time to address the substance of the proposal below. I find it the opposite of \u201ctoxic\u201d and actually rather charitable and productive. If there is a problem with it, I would like to hear it so we can move the issue forward toward resolution.      MadShills:  The charitable solution seems simple.  Withdraw this SR (It will not pass). Wait for the full govalpha delegate proposal to come to the table and be debated. At that time add a provision allowing for retroactive compensation evaluation starting from a date (let\u2019s say Aug 1.) Wait for MIP to be ratified. Once ratified, if a delegate has complied and would have been eligible under the past window, they can apply for payment as per the MIP.   This path achieves 3 things:  Allows for a charitable consideration of Hasu\u2019s circumstance, but applies the same terms even evenhandedly to all delegates. Places the burden of performance on delegates prior to compensation. This is important in instances of historic underperformance. It ensures integrity of the MIP system and governance. This path will lead to thorough discussion and evaluation of compensation terms, including retroactive comp. It also ensures engagement with the various issues by all parties (a more robust proposal upon ratification).    ",

Are we going to degenerate into \u2018our favorite, and most respected delegates here\u2019.   No, that\u2019s not the point at all. My point was that Hasu is a respected researcher who has offered a lot to Maker over the last few months, and we shouldn\u2019t immediately assume this request is in bad faith or some kind of opportunistic money grab! Again, he was literally advised not to propose the kind of global/universal reform you say is needed and what everyone would agree is better than ad-hoc proposals for individual delegates.     MakerMan:  Why does the DAO have to wait for someone to complain and ask for something before it acts vs. noticing there is one or more cases and broad brush equally for all parities concerned vs. doing 1-off deals.   Give GovAlpha some credit - this is literally what they are doing already, per @prose11\u2019s post above, with a MIP on its way in the next few weeks. Ironically, it appears from this backlash that Hasu would have been better off ignoring GovAlpha\u2019s advice and pushing for an all-delegate SR to avoid these speculative insinuations that he expects special treatment.     Hasu:  This has been the only ever proposal to Maker that affected myself in any way and after the experience I will not make another.   I can understand why people might vote \u2018no\u2019 on this SR, whether because it sets a bad precedent or whatever else. But using the opportunity to launch into a tirade that the SR shows \"entitlement, \u201cvery poor judgment\u201d and an intention to be compensated on a \u201cboard of directors\u201d is pure bad faith. It\u2019s fine obviously to disagree with a SR or proposed reform, but if the forum descends into personal attacks and insinuations, quality prospective contributors will simply not bother to engage - and who could blame them?

Can you please not speak for the DAO, especially when you are saying things that are so poorly thought out?

Current Compensation Criteria Under the current compensation structure you qualify by participating in polling and executive votes and communicating the rationale consistently. This requires ongoing consideration and attention \u201cday to day\u201d. These are the current criteria for compensation. If we would like to change this, it should go to an MIP vote. This MIP is in presently progress by govalpha.  This signal request is therefore unneeded and premature. We would do best to evaluate this issue as a holistic proposal and MIP set. We can then move forward to treat all delegates equitably. At that time, we can also consider the metric reset and retroactive compensation terms in the context of the entire package. Request for Comment Can someone please explain the problems with this process? This is the approach GovAlpha is taking and endorsed by numerous independent parties on thread. It seems logical and addresses all the issues in a fair and appropriate way. If I have missed something I would like to understand. Please advise.      MadShills:  The charitable solution seems simple.  Withdraw this SR (It will not pass). Wait for the full govalpha delegate proposal to come to the table and be debated. At that time add a provision allowing for retroactive compensation evaluation starting from a date (let\u2019s say Aug 1.) Wait for MIP to be ratified. Once ratified, if a delegate has complied and would have been eligible under the past window, they can apply for payment as per the MIP.   This path achieves 3 things:  Allows for a charitable consideration of Hasu\u2019s circumstance, but applies the same terms even evenhandedly to all delegates. Places the burden of performance on delegates prior to compensation. This is important in instances of historic underperformance. It ensures integrity of the MIP system and governance. This path will lead to thorough discussion and evaluation of compensation terms, including retroactive comp. It also ensures engagement with the various issues by all parties (a more robust proposal upon ratification).    ",
