Paragraph Summary MIP88 onboards a DAI 225M RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 225M of a super senior, front cash flow, AAAsf (or equivalent) rated RMBS on a bespoke basis (see Key Terms below). In addition, the transaction will be structured to provide 15% credit enhancement at closing for the super senior bonds. To maintain a consistent RMBS investment exposure level, a reinvestment program of cashflows into further Redwood Sequoia issuances on a bi-monthly basis is also activated. This includes operationalising a broader relationship with Redwood, including additional investment opportunities and collaborating with Redwood to develop a Clean Money aligned vision for RMBS. The legal, structural, and technical setup will be executed under a strict verification program.  Component Summary MIP88c1: Collateral Design This component contains the proposed collateral, counterparties, key terms and legal structure. MIP88c2: Verification Conditions for Collateral Onboarding This component sets out the verification mechanism and conditions ensuring appropriate collateral is onboarded using an appropriate legal structure and governance framework using an appropriate technical solution. MIP88c3: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding This component contains the technical requirements for unambiguous technical execution of the collateral onboarding MIP88c4: End-Notes This component contains a set of end-notes included at the request of Redwood and referred to throughout the components.  Motivation This MIP accomplishes the following for Maker:  Activates Maker USDC holdings and is anticipated to bring meaningful yield to Maker Diversifies Maker\u2019s base of fixed income holdings beyond US Treasuries to include RMBS in an effort to generate monthly cashflows (c4.2) and expected yield greater than comparable U.S. Treasuries while retaining a high degree of \u201ccash-like\u201d liquidity in the secondary markets Activates a long-term relationship with a strong and credible US financial services partner with a decades-long track-record Provides a mature and fully developed transaction structure and partners with the goal to minimize transaction execution risks Allows Maker to deploy an active reinvestment program to continue a consistent level of exposure to this new fixed income asset class. Allows Maker to have a real impact together with Redwood by collaborating on the concept of Clean Money in a large  category of housing finance   Specification / Proposal Details (c4.3)   843\u00d7475 871 KB  Friesian AI\u2019d by nightcafe  MIP88c1: Collateral Design  c1.1 Counterparty: Redwood Trust, Inc (\u201cRedwood\u201d)  Here in Redwood\u2019s own words, extracted from this more detailed presentation of Redwood: \u2026\"Redwood Trust, Inc. (\u201cRedwood\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d).  Redwood is a specialty finance company focused on housing credit.  Our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \u201cRWT.\u201d  For more information and to review quarterly, annual and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), please visit our website here.  Redwood\u2019s business is organized into three primary segments:  Our Residential Mortgage Banking segment is an aggregation platform focused on purchasing primarily prime jumbo residential mortgage loans from a large cohort of mortgage loan originators.  These loans are held for subsequent sale or for securitization through our Sequoia (SEMT) platform, as further described below.  Our Residential Mortgage Banking business is licensed in thirty-three (33) states to carry out its mortgage business.  More information on these licenses may be found on our website here.  Since Redwood\u2019s founding, we have purchased over $70 billion in loans, with $12.8 billion purchased in 2021 alone. Our Business Purpose Mortgage Banking, operating as CoreVest American Finance Lender, LLC (\u201cCoreVest\u201d), is one of the nation\u2019s leading direct lenders to single-family and multi-family housing investors.  CoreVest was founded in 2014 and has since funded more than $16 billion in loans representing 125,000 housing units.  CoreVest is the largest issuer of business purpose mortgage-backed securities, having issued over $5.1 billion across 19 securitizations. Our Investment Portfolio focuses on mortgage loans and other real estate- related assets sourced through our Residential Mortgage Banking and Business Purpose Mortgage Banking segments and from third parties.  In carrying out our business, Redwood relies on advanced, technology-enabled solutions to serve our customers accurately, efficiently and at scale, and to provide greater transparency and insight to investors in our securitizations. In 2020, we launched our first app (available here) to deliver near real-time data to the mortgage loan originators that sell jumbo mortgage loans to us. Our Residential Mortgage Banking business is currently focused on integrating blockchain technology into all aspects of its operations and, in an industry first, in 2021, we launched a blockchain reporting framework for loans securitized in Sequoia transactions (available here). Redwood\u2019s workforce consists of approximately 350 employees\"\u2026  C1.1.1: The Sequoia RMBS Issuance Platform A further extract from the detailed presentation of Redwood. \u2026\"Since its inception in 1997, Redwood has issued over $60 billion in RMBS across 118 Sequoia (SEMT) securitizations, including ten (10) transactions in the last two years alone.  In fact, in this time our Sequoia platform has become the nation\u2019s largest non-bank sponsored issuance platform for prime jumbo RMBS.  As the table below illustrates, since the RMBS market restarted in 2010, Redwood\u2019s Sequoia platform is, by deal count and issuance, the second largest prime jumbo issuance platform overall, and the largest that is not sponsored by a major bank.  887\u00d7507 110 KB  Data Calculated as of September 7, 2022 based on information available via Bloomberg and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.  1627\u00d7573 301 KB  Data Calculated as of August 2022 based on information available via Bloomberg and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Strong performance of Sequoia RMBS, such as illustrated above, has helped us attract and retain a base of over 200 institutional investors in Sequoia RMBS transactions, including some of the nation\u2019s largest pension funds, insurance companies and professional asset managers. In 2021, the Sequoia platform achieved two major milestones, as the first RMBS prime jumbo platform to integrate blockchain technology and the first such platform to include disclosure on certain ESG topics pursuant to SASB\u2019s Mortgage Finance disclosure framework.  We were honored to be recognized by GlobalCapital as 2021 RMBS issuer of the year, thanks in part to these market-leading innovations and the Redwood team\u2019s commitment to investors in Sequoia RMBS\"\u2026  794\u00d7414 277 KB   c1.2 Structure The Redwood Friesian MIP legal structure is expected to use the same legal entities used for the Monetalis Clydesdale MIP. James Asset (PTC) Limited (\u201cJames PTC\u201d), a company organized in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d), will create a new trust to hold any SEMT RMBS purchased by it (the \u201cNew Trust\u201d). Documentation to establish the New Trust and related/ancillary documentation will be drafted by local BVI counsel to take into consideration applicable U.S. law, as advised by the parties\u2019 U.S. counsels. An investment advisor will be engaged to review any SEMT RMBS transactions proposed from time to time to James PTC, on behalf of the New Trust, and generally provide direction to James PTC on the management of the SEMT RMBS portfolio within its investment mandate. The investment advisor would also confirm that the terms of any proposed SEMT RMBS transaction are consistent with those described in this MIP prior to James PTC, on behalf of the New Trust, purchasing the SEMT RMBS. Please note that the legal structure is subject to further legal and tax review and final documentation for any individual SEMT RMBS transaction .  c1.3 Key Terms c1.3.1 Key Terms of the Initial Sequoia RMBS Issuance     Aspect Key Terms     Issuance Details  (c4.4)  Purchase Amount: Max USD 225M Seniority: Super Senior Transaction structure: senior/subordinate, shifting interest Cash flow designation: front cash flow (FCF) Credit enhancement: 15.00% Coupon: 5%  Priced to deliver expected yield of 100bps above 3Y US Treasury at transaction time of sale (c4.5) Ratings: AAAsf (or equivalent) (c4.6)     Maturity Estimated weighted average life: less than 3 years.   Transaction Closing Date Following approval of this MIP, we would expect the subsequent RMBS transaction to close latest within December 2022, with subsequent issuance on a bi-monthly basis.   Transaction Parties and Documentation Standard Sequoia platform Transaction documentation and counterparties will be used. For details on counterparties, please see the description of counterparties available here Consistent with market standard distribution practices for securities exemption from US SEC registration requirements, such as the Sequoia RMBS, a US registered broker-dealer will function as the initial purchaser of the Sequoia RMBS and then immediately on-sell the securities to James Asset PTC Limited on behalf of the relevant trust. For this transaction, Oasis Pro Markets LLC (a registered broker-dealer) will be the initial purchaser.  Oasis also has the ability to facilitate secondary market liquidity for the Sequoia RMBS on its trading platform.   Transaction Fees and Expenses Fees and expenses payable in connection with the issuance  will initially be paid by Redwood and reflected in final pricing. The hypothetical pricing above reflects assumed transaction fees and expenses.   Reporting Standard transaction reporting and daily payment information (via the transaction\u2019s distributed ledger agent) in accordance with established practice on the Sequoia platform. Monetalis will collate and process this information and report as required for Maker reporting    c1.3.2 Reinvestment Program As this issuance pays down principal and interest on a monthly basis, the cash flows are projected to be substantial (c4.7). To take advantage of this partnership and the attractive economics of this source of fixed income, Monetalis will:  immediately invest all cashflows arriving from this instrument into BlackRock ETF products under the approved strategy of MIP65; and on a bi-monthly basis, via Signal Request, present the Community with the option for reinvesting the received cash flow from this instrument into a new issuance from Redwood/Sequoia.  The Maker Committee can request the accrued cash flow from the issuances be returned to Vault/Surplus Buffer at any time via Signal Request. c1.3.3 Cost & Fees Fees & Costs, not included in the above Key Terms section:     Party Cost/Fees     BVI Trust setup > USD 75K   BVI added Admin ~ USD 36K p.a.   Investment Advisor ~ USD 100K   Monetalis 15% of Yield     c1.4 Cashflow Waterfall & Credit Enhancement c1.4.1 Cashflow Waterfall (c4.8) The transaction will be structured to allocate payments received from the mortgage loan pool each month according to a cashflow waterfall.  As mortgagors make payments each month, those funds are generally allocated first to the most senior class of bonds by virtue of that class\u2019s higher priority in the cashflow waterfall; only after all payments to which the most senior class is entitled to have been made are excess funds then allocated to the next most senior class, and so on. Shortfalls are generally allocated in reverse order, to the most junior, classes first. The lowest priority class is often referred to as the \u2018first loss\u2019 because it is the first to be impacted by any shortfall in monthly payments by mortgagors. As is standard in RMBS, detailed rules governing this distribution of funds each month among the various classes of securities issued in that transaction. The hypothetical waterfall below is intended to illustrate this cashflow, at a high level.  1163\u00d7483 194 KB  c1.4.2 Credit Enhancement (c4.9) The Sequoia RMBS proposed to be onboarded by Maker will be structured to include several credit enhancement features beneficial to investors: Subordination: the transaction\u2019s capital structure will include senior and subordinate classes of bonds.  As illustrated by the cashflow waterfall diagram above, this feature places the most senior classes of bonds at the top of the cashflow waterfall, and generally allocates any shortfall in payments in reverse order of seniority (i.e., to junior classes first and senior classes last). The Sequoia RMBS proposed to be onboarded by Maker will be senior bonds in the capital structure.  Shifting interest: each month, funds will be distributed in accordance with payment priorities described in the transaction\u2019s documents. The transaction will be structured to include a \u2018shifting interest\u2019 mechanism so that, for a period of time, unscheduled payments of principal will be directed to front cash flow (or \u201cFCF\u201d) bonds; during this time, subordinate or last cash flow (or \u201cLCF\u201d) bonds will be entitled only to their pro rata share of interest and scheduled principal payments received. This feature helps preserve subordination during the life of the deal, reducing senior classes\u2019 risk of exposure to losses occurring later in the life of the deal. The tables below demonstrate hypothetical monthly payments over the life of FCF and LCF bonds (c4.10)  736\u00d7757 72.5 KB  Structural credit enhancement: as an additional measure of protection for senior classes of bonds, the transaction will include credit support levels designed to redirect scheduled principal payments to senior classes in the event delinquencies or payment shortfalls exceed certain levels. The credit enhancement level for the Sequoia RMBS proposed to be onboarded by Maker is expected to be 15.00% at closing.  c1.5 Liquidity, Spread & Stress test To appropriately qualify the collateral, the following subjects deserve consideration. c1.5.1 Liquidity The secondary market for RMBS is well-established, with major broker-dealers regularly involved in market making activities (e.g., providing quotes, facilitating secondary market sales and purchases by investors). The following table shows, for illustrative purposes, secondary market trading activity in RMBS (like the proposed Sequoia RMBS) to date in 2022, on both a yearly and weekly average basis, including detail for requests by bank customers to buy or sell RMBS and among dealers themselves.  1180\u00d7200 77.7 KB  While exact timeframes may vary based on idiosyncrasies of a particular trade, secondary market sales of RMBS such as the Sequoia RMBS could occur in as little as two (2) business days after a prospective RMBS seller contacts a broker-dealer to request a quote for a desired sale. For this purpose, Monetalis, will establish accounts with one or more broker-dealers active in the secondary market for RMBS in advance to ensure as rapid a liquidation as possible is available to Maker. Pricing for secondary market sales of RMBS is dependent on market conditions at the time of a desired sale, and may vary from the cashflow adjusted price paid by the investor at the time of purchase. c1.5.2 Spread An RMBS private offering, as the one here contemplated, provides a spread above US Treasuries and MBS ETF products. The table below shows status as of October 11, 2022.(c4.11)  c1.5.3 Stress Scenarios In stressed economic environments, historical Sequoia transactions have performed well, maintaining low delinquency levels. As the table below shows, during the most recent period of economic stress triggered by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, delinquency levels for the pre-COVID Sequoia transactions listed below remained under 5% and so never touched upon the Super Senior tranches.  896\u00d7540 80.3 KB   c1.6 Underlying Mortgage Pool Example This is an example of the type of potential mortgage loan pool that would be underlying the Sequoia RMBS issuance.(c4.12)  1243\u00d7654 141 KB   MIP88c2: Verification Conditions for Collateral Onboarding  c2.1 Legal Structure and Governance Verification Requirements At least one community member, with legal credentials, must, through a public forum post, validated by at least one Facilitator, provide a verification of the legal and governance structure appropriateness for holding a large amount of low-risk real-world asset collateral for Maker.  c2.2 Key Terms Verification Requirements The Strategic Finance Core Unit Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the Key Terms & Risks ensuring the appropriateness of this USDC allocation for Maker and its ALM strategy.  c2.3 Technical Verification Requirements The Collateral Engineering Services Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the technical appropriateness of the MIP21 designed solution in accordance with the Collateral Onboarding process (\u201cCOB\u201d). Should any one of the c2.1, c2.2 and c2.3 verifications not be forthcoming, for whatever reason, this MIP will not move forward in the COB.  c2.4 Closing & Execution Verification Requirements Prior to any purchase of SEMT RMBS by James PTC, on behalf of the New Trust, (i) the investment advisor will confirm that the terms of any SEMT RMBS are consistent with those described in this MIP and will have directed James PTC, on behalf of the New Trust, to purchase the SEMT RMBS and (ii) external legal counsel for Maker and/or a legal facilitator will have finalized the transaction, trust and related/ancillary documentation with the other relevant parties.  MIP88c3: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding The technical implementation must follow the MIP21 framework. Upon Collateral Engineering Services solution Verification in MIP88c2, the relevant smart contracts must be constructed and deployed. The ETH Address emitted by the legal structure specified in MIP88c1 should only be changeable by MakerDAO Governance, and follow the MIP21 framework. These smart contracts must only allow for the generation of Dai or USDC through a vault that is sent to the ETH address of the legal structure as its ultimate destination, and it must not be technically possible to send the Dai or USDC elsewhere, in accordance with MIP21. There must also not be any additional technical features or complexity that goes beyond the minimum necessary smart contracts and dummy constructs to enable the generation of Dai and its transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure. The ability to initiate the generation of Dai or USDC from the vault and trigger their transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure is given to an Ethereum address controlled by Monetalis. This address must have no ability to access the funds. When the collateral onboarding process for MIP88 has progressed to step 7 in the COB, an executive vote must be created (or code must be bundled into a broader executive vote) that activates all permissions for the vault to be onboarded based on the smart contracts specified in MIP88c3. The vault must provide:  Debt Ceiling of DAI 225 million. Stability Fee of 0% (surplus is paid manually through the legal structure, as specified in MIP88c1) All other parameters must be set to ensure they have no functional impact.

If any offer of securities is made, it will be made pursuant to a Preliminary Offering Memorandum and a Final Offering Memorandum in the future, prepared by or on behalf of an issuing entity which will contain material information not contained herein and which will supersede, as to any securities offered, the information provided herein in its entirety. Any decision to invest in the future in any securities offered in the future should be made after reviewing the Final Offering Memorandum, conducting such investigations as Maker as an investor deems necessary and consulting the investor\u2019s own legal, accounting, and tax advisors in order to make an independent determination of the suitability and consequences of an investment in the securities. c4.2 Payments on Sequoia RMBS will be subject to, and determined in accordance with, the transaction\u2019s priority of payments as described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any such Sequoia RMBS. c4.3 LEGAL DISCLAIMER The information contained herein is provided solely for informational purposes to determine preliminary interest in investing in a transaction with the general characteristics described in these responses and is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any security or to participate in any trading strategy. If any offer of securities is made, it will be made pursuant to a preliminary offering memorandum (the \u201cPreliminary Offering Memorandum\u201d) and a final offering memorandum (the \u201cFinal Offering Memorandum\u201d) in the future, prepared by or on behalf of an issuing entity which will contain material information not contained herein and which will supersede, as to any securities offered, the information provided herein in its entirety. Any decision to invest in the future in any securities offered in the future should be made after reviewing the Final Offering Memorandum, conducting such investigations as the Maker community as an investor deems necessary and consulting the investor\u2019s own legal, accounting, and tax advisors in order to make an independent determination of the suitability and consequences of an investment in the securities. We note that (i) any transaction in securities is subject to a risk of loss, and possibly total loss, of principal, (ii) the information contained herein and risks described herein do not purport to identify every possible risk (direct or indirect) or other material considerations, which may be associated with Maker community\u2019s entering into a transaction in the future for the purchase of securities and (iii) any securities offered in the future will not have been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) or the securities laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred unless an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws is available. We note, furthermore, that our responses contain information accurate as of the date of this document. While we welcome comments from and dialogue with the community as our proposal is evaluated, information in this response generally will not be updated and therefore may not reflect the most current information about the subject matter discussed herein. These materials contain statements that are not purely historical in nature, but are \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d These include, among other things, projections, forecasts, estimates of income, yield or return, future performance targets, sample or pro forma portfolio structures or portfolio composition, scenario analysis, specific investment strategies and proposed or pro forma levels of diversification or sector investment. These forward-looking statements are based upon certain assumptions. Actual events are difficult to predict and will be beyond the control of the issuer of any securities that may in the future be offered. Actual events may differ from those assumed. All forward-looking statements included are based on information available on the date hereof and neither Redwood nor any other party assumes any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Some important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements include the actual composition of the collateral, the price at which the collateral is actually purchased by the issuer, any defaults on the collateral, the timing of any defaults and subsequent recoveries, changes in interest rates and any weakening of the specific credits included in the collateral, among others. Other risk factors are also expected to be described in the preliminary offering memorandum and final offering memorandum to be provided in connection with any issuance of securities. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that estimated returns or projections can be realized, that forward-looking statements will materialize or that actual results will not be materially lower than those presented herein. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. c4.4 Hypothetical details based on a hypothetical mortgage loan pool and not a specific Sequoia RMBS offering; terms are presented to give an idea of the types of general characteristics the mortgage loans and future Sequoia RMBS are expected to have (all of which may change materially). Terms for a future transaction will be updated to reflect final mortgage loan pool and current market pricing and will be set forth in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any Sequoia RMBS. The Sequoia RMBS described in this proposal are expected to be issued in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d). As is typical for recently issued RMBS and for the Sequoia platform, any Sequoia RMBS ultimately onboarded will not have been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or qualified under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold except (a) in the United States, to persons that are \u201cqualified institutional buyers\u201d in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act (\u201cQualified Institutional Buyers\u201d) and (b) outside the United States, to persons that are not U.S. persons (\u201cNon-U.S. Persons\u201d (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act)) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. For certain information relating to U.S. federal income tax and certain other regulatory matters (including, but not limited to, the Secondary Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended (\u201cSMMEA\u201d), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and the U.S. credit risk retention rules promulgated by the SEC under 17 C.F.R. Sections 246.1. \u2013 246.22 to implement Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) applicable to a Sequoia RMBS transaction, please consult the offering materials prepared in connection with a specific transaction. c4.5 Actual price and yield to be determined at the time of sale for an actual transaction. c4.6 Redwood will engage at least one (1) nationally recognized statistical ratings organization to review the transaction, and will structure the transaction to achieve credit ratings in the highest category available for RMBS (i.e., \u201cAAAsf\u201d or equivalent) for the super senior bond described above. c4.7 Payments on Sequoia RMBS will be subject to, and determined in accordance with, the transaction\u2019s priority of payments as described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any such Sequoia RMBS. c4.8 The information contained in this section is demonstrative only, and is provided solely for informational purposes to determine preliminary interest in approving Sequoia RMBS as an eligible type of collateral to be onboarded by Maker as part of a future transaction with general characteristics to be described in future offering materials, and is not an offer to buy or sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any security or to participate in any trading strategy. The information contained below is at the initial structuring phase and there may be material changes to the structure prior to any securities being offered. c4.9 Payments on Sequoia RMBS will be subject to, and determined in accordance with, the transaction\u2019s priority of payments as described in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any such Sequoia RMBS. c4.10 Hypothetical cashflow projections have been based on the indicative pricing reflected above, an assumed 15CPR and a hypothetical mortgage loan pool and not a specific Sequoia RMBS offering.  These hypothetical cashflow projections are provided for illustrative purposes only to give an idea of the types of general cashflows future Sequoia RMBS might generate (all of which may change materially). Terms for a future transaction will be updated to reflect final mortgage loan pool and current market pricing and will be set forth in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any Sequoia RMBS. c4.11 The comparative pricing information included in the table titled \u201cMBS ETF Yield Comps\u201d is hypothetical and provided for discussion purposes only.  The values provided in the table titled \u201cMBS ETF Yield Comps\u201d are current as of the date noted, and are not based on any specific pool of mortgage loans or any specific RMBS offering.  Terms for a future transaction will be updated to reflect final mortgage loan pool and current market pricing and will be set forth in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any Sequoia RMBS, and may materially vary from the values provided in the table titled \u201cMBS ETF Yield Comps\u201d. c4.12 The collateral information included in the table titled \u201cSequoia RMBS \u2013 Hypothetical Mortgage Loan Pool\u201d is based on a hypothetical mortgage loan pool and not a specific Sequoia RMBS offering.  The mortgage loan attributes described in this table are provided for illustrative purposes only to give an idea of the types of general collateral characteristics a future Sequoia RMBS mortgage loan pool may have (all of which may change materially). Terms for a future transaction will be updated to reflect a final mortgage loan pool and will be set forth in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and Final Offering Memorandum prepared in connection with the issuance of any Sequoia RMBS.

                    "content": "This is a summary of the contents of this proposal and its impact, from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  This is a valid proposal, eligible to enter the November Governance Cycle. This MIP aims to:  Onboard and activate a 225M DAI vault from RWA to purchase USDC through the PSM. Approve the future purchase of USD 225M of investment grade residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) through Redwood\u2019s Sequoia securitization platform. Initiate a cash reinvestment program on a bi-monthly basis.   The transaction will be structured to provide a 15% credit enhancement on the Super Senior Bonds at closing. The collateral structure and monetalis fee aren\u2019t listed and will be determined during the RFC, although the proposal presents the BVI trust facility and administrative fee, as well as some details based on a hypothetical mortgage loan pool to give an idea of what future Sequoia RMBS will look like. The expected monthly income from the mortgage pool will come from a waterfall of cash flow that puts the highest-ranking bond classes, such as Sequoia\u2019s RMBS, at the top. Monetalis will immediately invest all cash flows from this instrument in BlackRock ETF products and will offer the community the opportunity to reinvest the cash flow received from this instrument in a new Redwood/Sequoia issue every two months via signal request. Maker may request for profits to be returned to the Surplus Buffer at any time via Signal Request. The proposal presents an analysis of the secondary market trading activity in RMBS with a liquidity, spread & stress test. Legal work is required to verify the legality and appropriateness for holding collateral in this structure. This proposal requires technical work based on the structure of MIP21 to develop smart contracts with appropriate permissions and security to enable this lending structure. If this MIP is ratified, a final poll will be submitted before the lending structure and vault permissions in an executive proposal. This will include the results of legal and technical evaluations and a final stability fee agreement. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.

With regards to breaking down the pool\u2014can you please walk us through the proposed weighted-average combined loan-to-value ratio of the pool, the weighted-average borrower FICO score (looks to be 700++) and a weighted-average debt-to-income ratio that your proposing here? Also, the average number of loan per the proposed pool, and average balance.     Allan_Pedersen:  In addition, the transaction will be structured to provide 15% credit enhancement at closing for the super senior bonds.   Does this  indicate that the super-senior tranche will be made-up 85% of the note balance? Not sure I understand (thanks in advance). Or if you can breakdown the definition of the \u201ccredit enhancement\u201d that would be neat!

                    "content": "Hi @flipflopflapdelegate Thanks! Appreciate the questions. First let me just clarify that I can only give stat\u2019s for hypotheticals. This is a liquid market so the actual offered selection will not be precise before very close to actual transaction execution. Which is also why the key terms of this MIP are deliberately made \u201crisk frame controlling\u201d (less than/more than/targets etc) rather than exact. 1. FICO etc The tables below provide additional stratification of the underlying data that makes up the weighted FICO, CLTV and DTI averages for the hypothetical mortgage loan pool referenced in MIP88. The weighted average totals of 768 for FICO, 70% for CLTV, and 36% for DTI represent the aggregate FICO, CLTV, and DTI for all mortgage loans in this hypothetical pool, taking into account each individual borrower\u2019s loan amount. The average unpaid principal balance of all mortgage loans purchased by Redwood is approximately $975,000. In preparing the hypothetical mortgage loan pool referenced in MIP88, it was assumed, that the population of mortgage loans ultimately selected for inclusion in the Sequoia RMBS will be generally consistent with this average, which resulted in 399 distinct loans reflected in the hypothetical loan pool. While these averages vary for each Sequoia transaction in accordance with the actual mortgage loan pool, Redwood will aim to keep the aggregate replines and mortgage loan level details consistent. This ability to achieve homogeneity and consistency is a key hallmark of the Sequoia platform.    2. Credit Enhancement You are pretty much right. The Super Senior classes of Sequoia RMBS are expected to represent 85% of the transaction\u2019s overall notional amount. This means that approximately 15% of transaction is anticipated to be structured as subordinate classes of bonds (often referred to as protection or credit enhancement) with lower seniority than the Super Senior classes. Importantly, in addtion, the Sequoia RMBS will be structured as front cash flow bonds, meaning payments in the cashflow waterfall will be allocated to the Super Senior bond first. This results in a shorter bond and shorter repayment timeline (maturity) allowing for the owner of this class to be repaid first. The below table further describes how Credit Enhancement and seniority are expected to be structured in the Sequoia RMBS:  Screenshot 2022-10-16 07.47.39941\u00d7228 51.8 KB  3. Originators Diversity of mortgage loan sellers included in Sequoia transactions is a key feature of the platform.  In fact, in a typical Sequoia transaction, the top 5 sellers represent approximately 30% percent of a transaction, with the remainder of the mortgage loans originated by sellers contributing low percentages (in many cases 1% or less) of the overall mortgage loan pool. Redwood purchases loans from 180 distinct mortgage loan sellers, each of which has been approved to sell mortgage loans to Redwood in accordance with strict loan acquisition criteria. If interested, you can see more on Redwood\u2019s experience purchasing mortgage loans, including a description of the seller approval process, please see \u201cSequoia Mortgage Background Material\u201d.

In very short: the bond is purchased below par and yield targets are based upon most likely repayment (and other) expectations - should large scale early repayment start (in excess of expectations), for whatever reason, it will enhance the yield (bond purchased below par) and we\u2019d get our investment back fast. I.e. it would be a positive event all in all. As we move to the MetaDAO structure, we can get more nuanced on hedging and investment strategies - so many details we can delve into as an appropriate supporting balance sheet is constructed from many collateral sources. F.x. How big a part of the balance sheet should be held for trading? and held based upon what return logic? how much of the balance sheet should be for hold-to-maturity? what events to hedge - and using what mechanisms and instruments? What liquidity constraints to overlay? What market-value variation constraints to consider -  etc etc. There are so many elements to consider in designing a \u201ccloser to\u201d optimal balance sheet. This is the work that we are looking forward to start with the MetaDAO cluster team and the many great partners that are being onboarded. The skill sets of all the parties involved now, and asset class variety, are starting to be there for us to be able to construct something very unique for Maker. Very exciting times ahead. ",
