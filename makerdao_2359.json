You don\u2019t have to be familiar with the current site \u2013 in fact, it helps if you\u2019re not! All you need to do is follow this link: Welcome | Optimalsort by Optimal Workshop and then follow the instructions. There\u2019s no right or wrong answers and it will give us some really great data to base our information architecture on. Thanks in advance. ",
