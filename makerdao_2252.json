                    "content": " Context Back in September of 2019, the Maker Foundation published a blog post introducing the Oracle V2 architecture that would launch alongside Multi-Collateral Dai, and recommending a series of governance proposals.  Oracle Team Mandate Proposal DeFi Public Feed Proposal Oracle Incentives Restructuring Proposal Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal  These proposals were published in the Maker Forum for review by the MKR Governance community as well as discussed on the Governance Calls on September 5th and September 12th. MKR Governance subsequently ratified the proposals through a sequence of Polling Votes (1, 2, 3, 4). As a result of these proposals, MKR Governance gained several new capabilities, among these:  Launch Oracles for new assets (even if those assets aren\u2019t collateral types in the Maker Protocol) Regulate who can access the Oracle prices through a whitelist Setting an Oracle Fee, the proceeds of which go to MKR token holders.   Proposal Summary The Oracle Team, in accordance with its responsibilities outlined in the Oracle Team Mandate, is proposing the creation of a BTC/USD Oracle. With the DeFi ecosystem\u2019s rapid innovation and expansion into tokenized Bitcoin (WBTC, tBTC, RenBTC) and synthetic Bitcoin derivatives (dYdX, Synthetix), there is significant demand for a BTC/USD Oracle. Furthermore, should this proposal be accepted, Set Protocol and dYdX will be added to the whitelist as the initial set of customers for the BTCUSD Oracle.

                    "content": "@NikKunkel thanks for this proposal. Are you sure that it\u2019s necessary to take the complex approach of using the two BTC/USDT sources and then scaling them by a separate inferred USDT/USD feed? (also, from the way it is written here it kind of looks like the two data models have a dependency loop, so I\u2019m not completely sure how USDT/USD is calculated) In general though, I feel like taking the simpler approach of only using BTC/USD pairs from reputable exchanges like Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Kraken, Gemini, ItBit, and LMAX is a more robust approach. For reference, compare the methodologies used by major derivatives exchanges (which also require robust price feeds) like FTX [1] and Deribit [2]. I also don\u2019t see a strong reason to bother with the BTC/KRW Upbit feed given the complexity involved in KRW/USD scaling as well as the historical tendency for those markets to trade at a premium/discount to USD markets. [1] - https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027668812-Index-Calculation (n.b. that FTX doesn\u2019t use any /USDT markets though they do use some /USDC and /TUSD markets, which is more sensible IMO.) [2] -  https://www.deribit.com/prinx_chart and https://www.deribit.com/pages/docs/general (only /USD markets from reputable exchanges) P.S. another interesting idea to consider from FTX and Deribit index methodologies is that they use median of [last price, bid, ask] and average of bid and ask, respectively. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think setzer only uses last price, so these approaches are woth considering. Obviously this applies to all oracle data models. ",

                    "content": "As  you pointed out there is a a recursion loop with BTC/USD requiring USD/TUSD requiring BTC/USD. We\u2019re considering two different solutions for this. The simple approach is to remove any USDT pairs for BTC. The more complex and somewhat hacky solution is to use coinmarketcap for the USDT/USD value the first time BTC/USD is queried. Subsequent queries for other asset pairs will calculate the USDT/USD price using the USDT/USD model and cached BTC/USD price and therafter cache the calculated USDT/USD price. From this point forwards BTC/USD is calculated using the USDT/USD model rather than coinmarketcap. I digress, it\u2019s a bit of an odd method and we\u2019re still evaluating whether the added complexity is worth it.  I also don\u2019t see a strong reason to bother with the BTC/KRW Upbit feed given the complexity involved in KRW/USD scaling as well as the historical tendency for those markets to trade at a premium/discount to USD markets.  I see your point with Upbit. Due to capital controls, there appears to be quite inefficient arbing between Korean and mainstream western exchanges, with the KRW/USD exchange rate applying extra uncertainty. I had originally approached this from a pov of \u201cthe more exchanges with substantial volume, the better the security model\u201d. However, getting consistent outlier data as a source strikes me as an odd tradeoff. For certain tokens such as BAT where it\u2019s difficult to find a handful of legitimate exchanges that can\u2019t be easily manipulated due to lack of orderbook depth I think it makes sense to use Upbit. In this case however, where as you point out there\u2019s other quality options, I\u2019m inclined to agree with you. I\u2019ve changed the BTCUSD Data Model to replace Upbit with Bittrex BTC/USD.  P.S. another interesting idea to consider from FTX and Deribit index methodologies is that they use median of [last price, bid, ask] and average of bid and ask, respectively. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think  setzer  only uses last price, so these approaches are woth considering. Obviously this applies to all oracle data models.  The team was already implementing a midpoint of the spread but a median which includes the last price is something we hadn\u2019t considered but sounds interesting. Definitely a change we would apply to all past and future Data Models. ",

Vaguely speaking, you probably can\u2019t increasing robustness by making feeds that depend on eachother circularly so I would suspect that there are some very weird dynamics there that could occur, especially in an adversarial context where we imagine someone might be manipulating the price. My gut feeling is that sticking to /USD only markets is better, since at the end of the day there are plenty of great, liquid BTC/USD markets on very reputable exchanges available to choose from.  on all other points.

Governance can vote to create an oracle regardless if it is an approved collateral type. Oracle access is not public, or can be granted by a whitelist. Oracle access can be \u201cmonetized\u201d for other platform\u2019s usage.  I don\u2019t know much about the aspect of technical implementation, looking at this current situation where collateral needs to be added rapidly, is there a set of pre-built oracles already?  Would it be prudent to have out of the box oracle solutions for \u201cprobable\u201d asset types?  If they ended up not being implemented, can this still be an additional revenue stream for the platform? In summary, is it possible to pre-build the $*it out of some oracles, that are on stand-by for onboarding collateral?  My thinking in this is the notion of being prepared for situations rather than fighting fires.  It seems like collateral onboarding since I\u2019ve been participating in the platform has been the result of fighting fires.  I personally place high value on being prepared, and it seems to me as though some \u201cready to go\u201d answers might serve the DAO well.  Both practically and in a sense of building confidence in the Ecosystem. Thoughts, comments from any and all are appreciated. ",

It\u2019s better to plan ahead and have things ready to go than implement them on-the-fly for collateral onboarding. If you take a look at setzer-mcd which is the tool we use to query prices for assets, we\u2019re actually already doing this. We have a bunch of asset pairs ready to go on the technical side. We could go a step further and have Feeds start pushing price updates for these assets to smart contracts, however I think that would be taking it a step too far as the gas costs involved in updating the Oracle smart contracts are not insigificant. In the next few months I expect us to onboard a bunch of Oracles relatively quickly as we have a lot of interested parties and collateral-onboarding seems to be ramping up quickly. ",

When Feeds publish prices to the p2p network the messages have metadata attached that show the version of omnia they are running as well as the individual source prices that reduced to the published price. It\u2019s very simple to verify on the network which version Feeds are running. If Feeds don\u2019t update in a timely manner, they are warned, after a series of warnings, they are relieved of their responsibility as a Feed. Fortunately we haven\u2019t had this occur yet and all Feeds have exhibited good behavior.  I think when they begin to receive a fee, it become important.  Feeds are already receiving a Feed Stipend, however it is currently covered by the Foundation. In time this responsibility will be transferred to MKR governance. ",
