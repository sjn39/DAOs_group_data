He has pioneered work with New Silver (NS) and contributed widely to the crypto ecosystem. But most importantly, he left in this world a lovely wife and two young children. We want to send our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. As a community, I\u2019d like us to consider in which capacity we can assist or support the family navigate this difficult and tragic time. If MKR tokenholders, governance or @Recognized-Delegates have any plans on supporting contributors, we would like to listen to them. All our condolences to the family. On behalf of the RWF team.
