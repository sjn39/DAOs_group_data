From a transparency aspect I like this suggestion because new participants and \u201cregular\u201d participants get to know who are the more active and relevant delegates without reading much (assuming delegates with more voting power participate more, it\u2019s not always the case as we know). Anyway, we can also use the profile details (about me in profile) for this. As example, I would like to see larger delegates using more links in their profile for things like this (instead of a \u201cblank\u201d profile):  polynya.eth - boardroom.io Polynya - Delegate Communication Thread   op-profile-details1121\u00d7352 125 KB  Notes: @polynya don\u2019t take me wrong for using you as example. It\u2019s a suggestion for everyone. The more transparent we are about this better it is for everyone. @diligit thanks for this interesting suggestion.
