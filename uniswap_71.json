As mentioned in Dharma\u2019s earlier proposal, there have been  discussions  on  lowering these thresholds  to make governance more accessible. Since that original proposal, nearly twice as many UNI votes have been delegated, so I don\u2019t believe the current quorum threshold of 40M votes is problematic in any way. However, the UNI token price increase over the past 6 months has made the proposal submission threshold extremely difficult to achieve. I propose that this proposal threshold be lowered. Personally, I\u2019d consider something like 2.5M votes a conservative step in the right direction. But since this is just a temperature check, I\u2019d like to first figure out if there\u2019s support for the idea of lowering the threshold at all. I\u2019ve created a Snapshot vote to gauge the community\u2019s interest in this idea, which will go live on May 28th at 12pm and be open for 3 days: Snapshot Vote ",
