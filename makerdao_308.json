Each of these enhancements serves to shine a light on some aspect of governance, which we hope will increase engagement as well as improve the experience for existing users. Whether it\u2019s illuminating critical pieces of information or helping to identify signal from noise, our aim is to bring the state of Maker governance ever forward! Many of these features evolved from talking to members of the community, or suggestions on our idea board, so please join the conversation on Discord, or provide feedback at https://makergovernance.canny.io/   Featured Changes  Delegate Voting Weight Chart   Screen_Shot_2021-11-07_at_5.29.27_PM.png969\u00d7606 28.3 KB   Starting off, we have a highly requested feature that we're really excited to bring to the delegates page! In an effort to support our mission of making governance more transparent, we've added a chart displaying the amount of MKR a delegate has had delegated to them over time. This will help visualize the flows of MKR moving to and from delegates in order for users to make more informed decisions about which delegate to choose. The drop-down filter allows users to focus on an interval of the past week, month, or year.  Badges for Poll Categories   Screen_Shot_2021-11-08_at_2.16.10_PM.png788\u00d7689 58.2 KB   We want to help users find what they're looking for as quickly as possible. To that end, we've added more improvements to how users can manage the way they filter and view polls. The filter drop-down now shows you the number of filters you have applied. More importantly, the poll cards now display colored badges for the categories the poll is associated with. Clicking one of these tags on the card will also add that category to your list of current filters. Clicking \"Clear filters\" will of course revert back to the default view. As the number of active polls continues to grow, this will be invaluable to reduce noise and help users focus on the particular governance categories they are most interested in.  Show MKR Needed to Pass an Executive Vote   139852363-8cc5eff9-3d31-43c3-a2d5-7caaaf15673c.png1658\u00d7564 69.3 KB   Another highly requested feature, the amount of MKR needed for an executive to pass is now displayed more prominently on the executive card. While this data has always been displayed in the system info pane, this upgrade now makes it visible when viewing the details of an executive vote.  Unique Avatars For Shadow Delegates   Screen_Shot_2021-11-08_at_2.47.42_PM.png962\u00d7103 11.1 KB   Until now, it has been hard to differentiate shadow delegates from one another. So we added a unique avatar for each shadow delegate derived from their address. Using the popular Jazzicon library, we are able to pass an address which then generates deterministic images to use as an avatar. No more accidentally delegating to the wrong shadowy super-coder!  Owner Badge Displayed on Delegate Cards   Screen_Shot_2021-11-08_at_3.03.02_PM.png966\u00d7252 21.9 KB   Our default sorting of delegates is intended to remove any advantage that consistently being presented at the top of the page might provide to a delegate by randomizing the sort order. But for delegates, that can make it difficult to locate your own delegate card. To make it more clear, we now always display your delegate card at the top of the list. We've also added a badge next to the name indicating you are the \"Owner\" of this delegate profile, as well as darkening the border of the card for emphasis. We hope these enhancements will make it easier to locate your delegate profile while navigating the page.  Display MKR Amount Locked in Chief    The system info pane on the right side of the page is there to provide fast data about the protocol, and it changes dynamically based on the current page. Now, when on the executive page, the system info pane displays the amount of MKR currently locked in chief. This allows users to quickly process the state of security of the voting system.  Dai.js SDK Rewritten in TypeScript Last but not least, this is a long time upgrade that we\u2019re extremely happy to include. Dai.js, our in-house SDK that powers the Governance Portal has been rewritten in typescript. This update is part of our initiative to improve the QA process around development and deployment of the portal. It enhances security by making the layer between the Maker protocol and the UI more transparent and easier to use for developers. Additionally, it makes development more efficient by helping devs write safer code more quickly.
