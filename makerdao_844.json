                    "content": "We at Centrifuge have heard questions from many Maker community members about the RWA Market on Aave, and would love to share more about it and also share how we think Maker and Aave can play together. The RWA Market was launched Dec 28 2021 and is the first diversified real world asset market on the Aave Protocol, bridging DeFi to the infinite potential of the real-world. The RWA Market launched with seven pools and allows liquidity providers to deposit USDC. Just as background: the Aave Protocol allows markets to be created where people can borrow tokens by depositing collateral. Interest rates go up and down depending on the utilization of the market.   1400\u00d7620 190 KB   With the RWA Market, when a pool has a need for capital the issuers have an additional method of receiving investments beyond directly from investors on Tinlake: deposit the pool tokens in the Aave protocol and directly borrow from any RWA Market investors. RWA Market investors get a diversified portfolio of senior secured real-world assets of these seven pools. It currently has a market size of US$19.1M, with 10.8M USDC deposited into the market. Out of the 10.8M USDC, 7.5M USDC has been borrowed by our issuers using their respective DROP tokens worth US$8.3M, and there is 3.3M USDC in available liquidity with a utilization rate of 69%.  890\u00d71348 91.1 KB  Four of the pools on the RWA Market are integrated Maker vaults. With Aave and Maker, Centrifuge issuers now have an additional source of liquidity. When issuers feel that they have multiple funding sources in DeFi, it gives them comfort that there are reliable sources of income across multiple fronts, similar to multiple banking relationships that a traditional company might have. That brings stability and longevity, which attracts investors and creates a sustainable ecosystem. In addition, with more credit expertise in DeFi to analyze these deals and perform due diligence on various types of assets, the credibility of the ecosystem will increase with time, taking it mainstream with traditional audiences joining in the fray. On the technical front, like we mentioned during our recent AMA, we think D3M for the RWA Market would be absolutely amazing just for Centrifuge issuers but also for Dai and Maker. This could work if we add Dai as a collateral to the RWA Market. As Maker issues Dai, Maker wants to be able to issue Dai whenever there is demand for more Dai and conversely take it off the market when there isn\u2019t, to maintain the peg. The Aave protocol can be a great counterparty. When people who own Dai want to earn yield, they put it into the RWA Market. That means Maker can correspondingly reduce Dai supply; and vice versa. In this way, it allows for the supply and demand of Dai to balance more naturally. The recent discussion on Aggressive Growth Strategy on RWA is very exciting to us, and we believe that we can scale RWA on-chain together. There is still a lot of work to be done on the RWA Market like onboarding new collateral, creating a governance process for collateral onboarding with Aave token holders, integrating it into different frontends, etc. And there is yet more to be done together with Maker. We believe that a RWA DeFi ecosystem is more than just onboarding collateral, and welcome ideas from the Maker community to make a vibrant RWA DeFi ecosystem a reality! ",
