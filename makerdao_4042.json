                    "content": "Folks as I get my feet wet in Maker stuff again something came to mind regarding all the Legal IP being constructed by our RWA vault seekers. Specifically 6s, and Centrifuge.   A lot of the legal structures (at least on the 6s side) are basically public.  The informational details behind the collateral is private but the paperwork to construct these RWA structures is public. I see this as key IP being constructed by these entities that by posting it publicly we are just giving it away without restrictions or rights.   Honestly I don\u2019t think this stuff is cheap to create and I don\u2019t think we should just be handing it out to the world to fork/copy and compete against Maker and our important partners. So I bring up the questions both to 6s and Centrifuge how we should handle this?   I think it is important for groups of people to review this stuff.   But I also think it is just as important for the information on these structures to be protected somehow legally.   You would be the jurisdictional entities to copy/IP protect these and then the ones to take action.    This really isn\u2019t Maker IP it is 6s/Centrifuge Legal IP. My assumption is both 6s and Centrifuge have thought of this and taken appropriate action but I just wanted to bring this up for comment when we are considering collaborating or Partnering with anyone either for legal reviews or contract audit assistance. Comment/discussion? ",

He is aware that this is a \u2018gift\u2019 to the entire space he is paying for and \u201cwants competition\u201d. So to nip my own thread in the bud and left for posterity. Legal docs have no IP/copyright protection so they are fair game. Honestly given the price to make these things I find it ironic they don\u2019t lol but given they are filed publicly I guess it makes sense.  Make a new legal structure and everyone gets it for free. Legal structures are \u2018forkable\u2019. ",
