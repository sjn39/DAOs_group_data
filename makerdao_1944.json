Details I\u2019ve decided to resign as a MakerDAO Facilitator and Contributor due to a value misalignment. Currently, this project lacks the fundamental qualities of why I committed myself to blockchain, crypto, DeFi and the overall industry. The culmination of the events over the past six weeks made my decision very easy. After 3+ years at MakerDAO, I am complete with this phase of my journey. As of today, I\u2019ll be on hiatus until I determine my next steps. I\u2019m honored to have worked with many wonderful people that displayed a lot of passion and regarded integrity as a key value. It\u2019s all about the journey\u2026and what a journey it has been. I was actively involved with the Endgame since its inception. When asked, \u201cWhere do you see CES in the Endgame?,\u201d my baseline case was always as an Ecosystem Actor (EA). I stated that publically many times and while challenging, I had been trying to figure out the actual details of my stated direction. The EA exploration took me everywhere. CES had been at the heart of all RWA deals so one would think we\u2019d continue to have a significant impact there. We also knew there was a large amount of technical work for the Endgame implementation. That was an obvious target for CES as an EA since there are so few engineers at MakerDAO. During my exploration, I was transparent with my team and we had many brainstorming sessions. At times, an idea would stick, then we\u2019d test the assumptions, make decisions, and move forward, or not. It\u2019s the Agile approach of failing fast to learn fast. We failed a lot but learned a lot too. I\u2019ve always found the Agile or iterative methodologies to be aligned with DAO philosophy since it\u2019s based upon collaboration and transparency. Along the way, I had many private conversations with the Head of MakerDAO sharing my thoughts and discoveries. Some we agreed upon and others we agreed to disagree. Based upon my experience, this was a typical process to drive towards consensus for a plan. It felt normal until the conversations stopped. Before Devcon, the Head of MakerDAO reached out to a Contributor on my team and started a conversation to form a new organization for the Endgame. In turn, the Contributor made verbal offers to certain people in CES. I learned about this plan last Tuesday, Nov 15th. Later, I confirmed with the three additional participants their intention to join the new organization. Last Thursday, Nov 17th, during my conversation with the Head of MakerDAO, I learned of his decision to offboard the CES core unit while giving support to the newly formed team birthed under his guidance. During my conversation with the Head of MakerDAO, he asked me to be professional, to help his new EA team form/onboard, and to wind down the CES core unit. I assured him I would be very professional in my next actions and as I have done with the published MIPs. The plan I designed that is being executed provides minimal disruption to current core unit work. Competent Interim Facilitators have been nominated and are ready to take over the core unit\u2019s responsibility until ratification of the offboarding is complete. I want to reassure the community a comprehensive plan is in place. I also ask you to work with the interim facilitators and assist them in providing business continuity. I\u2019ve made business choices consistent with the behaviors of the involved individuals as well as the remaining contributors within the CES core unit. Some individuals were terminated for \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of their Contributor agreements. Others received a severance, a triggering of their retention bonus, an accelerated MKR vesting package, and/or provision(s) for outstanding expenses or invoices due. The execution of this plan is within my powers of a ratified MakerDAO Core Unit Facilitator. I wish everyone the best with your future endeavours.  Deliverables and responsibilities Four categories represent CES-001 deliverables and responsibilities:  Contractual Obligations Ongoing Core Unit Mandate Work Infrastructure and IT Financial Obligations   Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Work Per MIP41c5, the co-Interim Facilitators will retain the necessary minimum powers as listed in MIP39c2-SP37. 1. Contractual Obligations Upon ratification of CES-001, an entity was created to provide work to the core unit. All contributors were contracted for their services through this entity. Due to the CES-001 core unit and facilitator offboardings, all entity contracts have been terminated. Some of these contracts were terminated for \u201cmaterial breach\u201d and the contributor(s) removed from both the entity and the CES core unit. The co-Interim Facilitators will decide whether to contract the same services from the terminated contributors. Upon ratification of this MIP, the co-Interim Facilitators will terminate all outstanding contracts and ensure obligations are met. 2. Ongoing Core Unit Mandate Work The co-Interim Facilitators will decide how to complete the current Work In Progress (WIP) and additional work to be completed to fulfill the current mandate until the ratification of this MIP. Both facilitators have direct daily experience and understand the workflow and priorities for the core unit deliverables. Upon ratification of this MIP, the co-Interim Facilitators will transition all remaining work to the appropriate entities within MakerDAO. 3. Infrastructure and IT All infrastructure and services will be transferred in an orderly manner in order to prevent disruption to the CES-001 core unit. This included pertinent data and procedures to run the core unit. Upon ratification of this MIP, the co-Interim Facilitators will cancel all contracted services and transition surviving services to the appropriate entities within MakerDAO.  Core Unit Unwinding \u2013 Funds 4. Financial Obligations At the time of this posting, all financial obligations of CES-001 have been resolved or provisions made to continue with normal operations. co-Interim Facilitators are signers on the CES-001 multisig operations wallet. Retiring Facilitator needs to be removed on the CES-001 multisig auditors wallet. Other than the normal administrative work for setting up a core unit, regular financial and business operations will continue as usual. Upon ratification of this MIP, the co-Interim Facilitators will pay all outstanding obligations and return remaining operational wallet funds to the auditors wallet.  Possible remedy to avoid offboarding Given the source of this offboarding and after continued attempts, I do not see any remedies.  Core Unit ID CES-001 ",

I confirm that I am willing to serve as a co-interim facilitator for CES, with an intention to continue delivering outstanding deliverables until such time when MIP39c3-SP6 is ratified, and to wind down the CU. I personally commit to perform my role in a professional manner and am knowledgable enough both on the technical and business perspectives with respect to CESs operations and MakerDao governance to perform the necessary tasks as a co-interim facilitator effectively. All of the foregoing based on the assumption this will require a 2 month minimum commitment with the option to renew. ",
