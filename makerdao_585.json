                    "content": " Summary After a discussion and a signal-request the Debt Ceiling of TUSD-A was set to 0 DAI one year ago. Since then, the DAI from TUSD-A hasn\u2019t changed a lot - there is still about ~26MM DAI outstanding debt and even an increase of the Stability Fee to 1% hasn\u2019t changed anything.  This Signal Request is to find out if the community wants to do something about it or just keep it as it is.  Options  TUSD-PSM with 0 Debt Ceiling One option that was already discussed one year ago was to  set up a PSM for TUSD with a Debt Ceiling of 0 pay back the outstanding debt in the TUSD-A vaults pushing the backing collateral 1:1 into this new PSM  The result would be a permissionless PSM like we already have for USDC and GUSD so anyone could swap their DAI for TUSD until the PSM is drained. As the primary motivation for us is to get rid of the TUSD, a tout of 0 would encourage arbitrageurs to make use of it.  Pros  as this will not only create effort on PECU for setting up the PSM but also for adding the code to do the liquidation into the PSM, we could make use of this code for future use like liquidating USDC-A or GUSD-A    Cons  we are just making it easier for TUSD to get removed from the protocol, but might end up in no change on the debt   Activate Liquidations TUSD-A is running with deactivated Liquidations (like most other stable-coin ilks) - most of the vaults are already undercollateralized:  If we would activate Liquidations on TUSD-A keepers could just take care of the offboarding. Keepers would probably use curve.fi for recycling the collateral - resulting in at least 80k DAI loss which would be absorbed by the System Surplus.   Pros  would just use existing mechanisms just a configuration change smart-contract wise maybe adds some effort on the keeper implementations (as TUSD is not covered yet)   Cons  would result in a bit of loss for the protocol   Which course of action shall we take for TUSD-A?     Offloading to a new TUSD-PSM with DC 0 Activate Liquidations Do nothing Abstain     0 voters     FYI @Protocol-Engineering  Next steps The Poll will run until 2022-02-03T23:00:00Z , its outcome will result in an on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Adding a regular PSM will very likely result in the TUSD just being moved over to the PSM and sitting there. My expectation is that TUSD will not drain until USDC and possibly even USDP drains first. The only way to get this off the books quickly with a PSM is to implement a negative fee on the PSM which will require dev time probably in excess of the 100k or so it costs to just activate the liquidations. Not to mention we are paying for the fee as well which is comparable to the loss from auctions. These are not terribly large sums of money, so I think just doing the easiest thing is probably best. Setting up a stablecoin Curve keeper won\u2019t be too much work, and probably should exist anyways. ",

I honestly don\u2019t think liquidating it is the best option. I see no reason to just let this sit (which is how I voted) until we can get a back end mechanism to convert these stables into $$ that can buy other collateral (say treasuries). Is there some pressing reason to get this off the books?   BTW:   Governance itself could use DAI slated for say oracles to purchase TUSD which then buys ETH to pull this TUSD off the books (effectively liquidating underwater vaults manually at either 1:1 or some other price) and using it to buy ETH for oracles. Personally given what I am hearing about work overload it would be better to just add dealing with this to a Maker To-Do list and deal with these in order of risk, cost, and manpower to accomplish as manpower becomes available.
