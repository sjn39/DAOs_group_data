We want to be close to 100% sure this is safe from technical standpoint. Otherwise I would prefer to start with a Debt Ceiling of 3m for PSM-USDC-A and if everything runs smoothly, governance can increase the Debt Ceiling at the next possible executive vote. The level of 3m would be proposed because the surplus buffer can still protect Maker against any potential losses. The financial risks are high here, but I can evaluate them only in relation to SC risks where I can only rely on external opinion. @hexonaut thoughts? ",

Because the psm is built on existing Maker code it is fairly safe imo as we are protected by the already tested code. We have the audit in place to give that extra level of safety which should be considered a stronger guarantee than the smart contracts team looking things over. I get that there is a (well deserved) level of trust people put into the Foundation SC team, but they are human and there are no guarantees about any new piece of code. Personally I think we are good to go at a 500M debt ceiling, but I\u2019ll defer to risk if they want to start with a test ceiling. I will aim to push the spell out tomorrow so we have a day to think on this. ",

Delaying a 500m DC for PSM for a minimum period of testing is still my preferred position. If we can signal that increasing PSM DC to fix the peg is still the main plan, but only got delayed slightly because Maker tests in prod wisely, it should be fine. Of course I should have proposed this earlier, but I think I also got a bit influenced by this peg obsession in the community lately, where everybody wanted to solve it as soon as possible. So we rushed through this December to make it happen and forgot about what Maker represents. How ever you may interpret this, I proposed what is best for Maker from my standpoint. That said, I don\u2019t want to be in the role of a blocker as no individual that cares about DAO wants to be. ",

I\u2019ll try to go into my personal logic: The reason I wanted to start with a non-test DC is because my understanding from previous conversations is that we wanted to maximize fee collection - hence why I built the lerp module. This in conjunction with uncertainty with whether MKR holders wanted to lower the stablecoin SFs to 0% gave me a sense of urgency with getting this done and getting vault holders to voluntarily switch over to the PSM. I believe this was the same sense of urgency that Primoz was feeling as well. This is not even to mention the urgency of fixing the peg in the first place which has no longer become relevant due to people front-running the PSM. All in all it was blinding us a bit to the risk here, and we were taking an excessive leap when a small one would work just fine. As the lead smart contracts person on this project it was my mistake to not recommend starting with a test DC. This is clear to me now, and I apologize to @Primoz for the position I put him in making that call alone on Saturday. ",
