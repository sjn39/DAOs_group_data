Abstract A validator client contributes to the consensus of the Eth2 blockchain by signing proposals and attestations of blocks, using a BLS private key which must be available to this client at all times. The BLS remote signer API is designed to be consumed by validator clients, looking for a more secure avenue to store their BLS12-381 private key(s), enabling them to run in more permissive and scalable environments.

But one thing that has to be considered is the latency that gets introduced during the process of remote signing, e.g., usually 200ms - 1000ms, which reduces the actual time that validator can spend on processing transactions/blocks.
