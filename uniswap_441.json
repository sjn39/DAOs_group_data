During a live-streamed community chat today, we (including Nadav of Dharma) came to the conclusion that there may be better ways to solve the issues of disenfranchisement raised by Dharma other than a straight-up airdrop. We also discussed the negative impact of rushing proposals through governance before it\u2019s fully matured. With that knowledge, do you believe that Dharma should still launch their well-publicized airdrop proposal on Fri, Oct 23? Or do you believe that they should postpone it to allow for further discussion and potential development of alternative solutions by the community?    Should Dharma launch its proposal on Friday, or postpone it?  Launch it Postpone it No opinion     0 voters     ",

At the heart of it, this proposal will always be a retroactive airdrop to proxy users from the community treasury - I doubt people will be convinced further as to whether or not to support an action like that, and no \u2018redesign\u2019 will change what the proposal is at its core. What would more time give anyone? I think the vote happening as soon as possible is the best thing for the ecosystem, its a fairly hallmark event where either outcome will shape attitudes towards voting going forward. I think that\u2019s a fundamentally good thing for the growing maturity of Uniswap governance. And in the interests of transparency: I have never used Dharma or any proxy. I strongly disagree with the proposal and any proposal that retroactively rewards a limited, centralized group from treasury funds. I don\u2019t see how the token or the ecosystem is benefited from the proposal. I would like to see the proposal defeated. ",
