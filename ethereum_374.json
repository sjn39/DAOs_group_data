This means that if you\u2019re scanning incoming txns to an address to update its balance, you won\u2019t process withdrawal balance updates   We saw this bug on MetaMask during the Sepolia fork, but others probably have the same issue. Here\u2019s a bug report for them: [Bug]: ETH balance not updating after Beacon Chain Withdrawals \u00b7 Issue #17936 \u00b7 MetaMask/metamask-extension \u00b7 GitHub   Withdrawals are processed similarly to PoW emission: they are added to the addresses\u2019 balance \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, at the end of block execution. See the State Transition section here: EIP-4895: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations   If you want to run your own validator to test this, you can do so on Zhejiang: https://zhejiang.ethpandaops.io Alternatively, you can track the Sepolia validators and their periodic withdrawals. Goerli date fork isn\u2019t set yet, but we\u2019ll likely do so on ACDE this Thursday.  ",
