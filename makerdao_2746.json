                    "content": "Hey all, We talked about a lower liquidation ratio ETH-B vault on governance call about two weeks ago and I want to start a discussion here before we proceed to implementing it. Our proposal to governance was to implement a lower liquidation ratio ETH-B Vault with initially low debt ceiling due to risks related to OSM attacks (minting unbacked DAI due to old ETH price system uses because of OSM configuration). OSM attacks can become severe if low LR Vaults would have a high amount of unutilized debt ceiling. Fortunately or hopefully we should be able to expect quite some demand for usage of such vault types due to farm related DAI minting from current ETH Vaults. This means debt ceilings might get utilized quickly if we set them lower. It also means such vaults might be less risky from a liquidation risks standpoint, as most of the users might be farmers who are long DAI rather than ETH leverage traders that need to perform trades when unwinding their debt position. Note that the ultimate goal of ETH-B is to attract new capital and generate additional DAI. Our indicative results for 130% LR for ETH-B Vault shows that risk premium would be twice as high or around 8%, compared to 4% calculated for ETH-A base case scenario. This calculation is based on higher ETH Vault debt exposures, which means that risk premium is likely much lower if we start with only 10m debt of debt ceiling for ETH-B. We also think 130% LR might be conservative enough that hedges from OSM attacks. Assuming 8% risk premium, currently this represents SF of 8% if Base Rate stays at 0%. This rate would be though higher than the one on Aave (+6%) or Compound (+4% or even negative including COMP rewards). Proposal from our side would be to have a sandbox approach, initially start with lower DC in the range of 10m-30m for a 130% LR ETH-B Vault type, test demand with higher SF in range between 4% to 8% and see what kind of Vault users we attract. As said, having long DAI Vaults is less risky for portfolio exposure. I also think this will be important test, to finally give us some feedback how sensitive ETH Vault users are on rates. If the general strategy is sound we should soon proceed to Signal request and have a on-chain vote after next week. ",

Any of these ideas are significantly better than pausing liquidations. I do like the idea of an ETH-B vault with a lower LR and higher RP than the ETH-A vault. I would probably set the RP to 6%, or even 5.5% or 5.75% to outcompete Aave. This will be a good test before liquidations v2. Once the auction system is improved I could even see us lowering these RPs to just below the competition (3.5% or so, I do not think we should compete with yield farming) and moving toward heavier use of the ETH-B vault. Having lower LRs should improve the peg due to greater capital efficiency in dai minting. ",

The risk of a vault being <100% collateralized during the OSM delay and minting Dai up to the debt ceiling for that asset (as you outline above). IMO a 23% drop in one hour in these volatile assets is just too likely to occur to have something like this without a super tight debt ceiling. Are there any potential solutions to the OSM delay that could only prevent new minting and not impact liquidations? Maybe @NikKunkel has some input? ",

Primoz:  Note that the ultimate goal of ETH-B is to attract new capital and generate additional DAI.   I think if the purpose is narrowed to conduct an \u201cexperiment\u201d as a sort of \u201cchampion-challenger\u201d strategy against ETH-A this sounds like a good idea. I am not 100% sure whether \u201cattracting new capital\u201d relates to that intention and to what extent we are planning to measure effectiveness of the experiment, @Primoz. Happy to brainstorm this with you.     Primoz:  Our indicative results for 130% LR for ETH-B Vault shows that risk premium would be twice as high or around 8%, compared to 4% calculated for ETH-A base case scenario   This sandbox approach working with only 2 parameters (LR, RP) seems pretty sound for an initial experiment. I would recommend just setting a few milestone \u201cchecks\u201d on success of experiment before raising up debt ceilings further, because that would add an extra variable in the calculation (DC), which may require adjustments to RP or LR. Testing one change at a time would be ideal imo.     Primoz:  This rate would be though higher than the one on Aave (+6%) or Compound (+4% or even negative including COMP rewards).   I think the competitive rates are a good benchmarking to be observed in the experiment. But due to initial narrow approach of ETH-B (DC will be less than 2% of all ETH debt exposure), I think this is of a lesser concern in guiding the actions on the experiment initially. If the experiment (\u201cchallenger\u201d) became one day the main issuer of DAI (\u201cchampion\u201d) then competition benchmarks may become more relevant. ",

                    "content": "Hm if for instance there is 5m unutilized DC and there is a 25% hourly OSM drop and people would make a so called OSM attack, I think around 125k DAI or 2.5% loss would be made for Maker on these vaults, before proceeding to auction. At 30% drop, loss would be 450k DAI or 9% and so on. Outcome of an auction can be either additional loss but potentially also a profit if price rebounds. It also depends when these vaults would get liquidated because having such drops probably means box gets filled by other vault types getting liquidated? ",
