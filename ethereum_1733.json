                    "content": "Hi all, There does not currently exist, as far as I know, a canonical reference for a contract\u2019s ABI/Metadata. There are projects/repositories that try to catalog them (the ethereum-lists/contracts repository is one that comes to mind), but it stores metadata on a centralized platform. Providing a canonical reference to IPFS or some other alternative storage platform could resolve this. In my experiments, I\u2019ve been implementing an abiURI() public view returns (string memory) function that provides a URI to this metadata which is configured as part of the constructor, but could be configured by way of another function call. I\u2019ve been trying to create something around this because I feel that attaching it to the contract itself would be the best place to look. Let me know if this is something worth working towards or if I missed something in trying to find a solution. Thank you! - rebeccajae ",
