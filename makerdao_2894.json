Ratio (e.g., 150% for ETH) should provide enough \u2018insurance\u2019 except on catastrophic events. Setting the Col. Ratio properly is the job of the Risk Team(s). On the one hand, buying a Put Option might severely reduce the gains of MakerDAO. On the other hand, with Put Options we might significantly reduce the Col. Ratio because we are insured anyways if the price falls below certain limits. And this might attract more users. I guess it all depends on what decentralised option providers are available, how their products concretely work and their inherent risk. EDIT: put options on stablecoins would be extremely useful (much more than for ETH), since the Col. Ratio for them is 101% and this makes MakerDAO extremely exposed to the failure of any of the supported stablecoins).    catflip.co    Catflip MakerDAO system parameters      ",

But it should be easy   Yeah this is the underlying question for me. I think re the rolling design/costs, the way I envision it is that there should be a simple user interface located at the point you create and manage the CDP, this way you don\u2019t need to go to another site, connect with your wallet, etc. You simply create the CDP and there is an \u2018insurance option\u2019 with an associated cost on it.     iammeeoh:  are you aware of a decentralised (put) option provider   I would suggest Hegic since it has the flexibility and the liquidity to make something like this work (for ETH). Opyn is another provider but has a lot less liquidity and more limited option contract specifications.  buying a Put Option might severely reduce the gains of MakerDAO  Yes they might, but I wonder if there is an appetite from those that wish to also reduce their CR/risk profile. By collateralizing an option, you can potentially also avoid liquidation risk altogether (since the value of the insurance will increase and cover downside on the underlying)  put options on stablecoins would be extremely useful  Interesting thought, but unaware if these exist anywhere\u2026 ",
