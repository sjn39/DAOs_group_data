                    "content": "TL;DR: No Executive Votes planned for the next TWO Fridays (2022/02/11 + 2022/02/18) Hello folks! Wanted to provide an update for transparency and to sync expectations. Yesterday the mandated actors discussed upcoming executives and came to the conclusion that we will not be planning on having an executive vote for the next two weeks.  2022/02/18 This topic came up originally due to bandwidth concerns for the 2022/02/18 Executive, which would otherwise be taking place during the heart of ETHDenver. Barring anything urgent, this seems like an easy decision given the lack of crucial items that would otherwise be ready to go next week.  2022/02/11 The decision to not have an executive this week perhaps carries a little more weight, given the plan to skip on the 18th. However with only one item potentially needing an exec this week (TUSD-A Offloading), it doesn\u2019t make sense to spend the resources for a full executive, and there is a chance the resulting TUSD poll will require extra domain work before an executive can take place.  Closing thoughts The PE team has been grinding away full speed since we resumed in January, and I would like to take a moment to thank them for their diligence and dedication. GovAlpha will still be running polls as they are ready during this time frame, so we expect to have plenty to bundle when executive proposals resume on the 25th. Please comment below or reach out to me directly if you have questions or concerns. ",
