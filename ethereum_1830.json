A Vault Contract sits between an account and wallet and stores private account information; private keys. Similar to a bank vault, a Vault Contract is not supposed to be unlocked often yet when it is it is easy. Accounts have the ability to set security standards on the Vault: 2FA, biometrics, co-signer, security questions, or passwords. In short, the account has control over where their private keys are stored and has control over security management. This is still a rough idea but I would love to collect your thoughts and feedback to know if I should pursue this further. ",
