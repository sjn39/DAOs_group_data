Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): Pickle Finance was the first yield aggregator to launch on Optimism in January (Eternal Optimism. Pickle Finance launches on Optimisim! | by Pickle Finance | Medium). We want to give Optimism users the best yield farming opportunities possible. Since our launch we have continued to roll out various  farming opportunities for Optimism users and see great opportunity to build more with our yield aggregation skills. Specifically, we have identified a key opportunity in building out our Uniswap V3, auto-rebalancing Jars on Optimism as continued trading activity increases. In this bear market, users are looking for high %APY opportunities, and will go to the chain that makes this a possibility. Our auto-compounding Jar strategies, PICKLE token emissions and OP rewards can attract these users to Optimism. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? OP tokens will be distributed as duel rewards on all our existing Optimism Jars, and any new Optimism Jars for 200 days. This means 1000 OP will be distributed a day - roughly $450/ day at an OP price of $0.45. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Duel rewards have been proven to bootstrap and attract new liquidity to an ecosystem. We ran a similar program with Polygon Chain when they first launched. Our Polygon TVL increased to $10m at its peak during this phase (our total TVL got to $150m). Combine these OP rewards with the launch of our highly successful Uniswap V3 Jars (currently on Mainnet and Polygon), and we expect a similar amount of new capital will flock to gain this attractive APY. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? There are two reasons we are confident liquidity will remain after the OP incentives run out  We will be simultaneously incentivising our OP Jars with our native PICKLE token emissions. Therefore APYs will still be boosted for these Optimism Jars even after the OP rewards stop. When we launched our duel rewards on Polygon at the start of 2021 we only saw a 10% decrease in TVL the month after the MATIC duel rewards ended. While our TVL on Polygon has since decreased over this time, we put this down to capital moving to the plethora of new chains that launched over the past 18 months, and the severe bear market we are experiencing.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? As stated above the OP tokens will be distributed over 200 days, only for our Optimism Jars. This will ensure a good APY boost, while also keeping TVL within the Optimism ecosystem over an extended period of time. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Pickle Finance will launch 10% PICKLE emissions on Optimism for our Jars and Farms, at current prices ($1.1/PICKLE) that is roughly $475 of emissions per day for those in our Optimism Jars. These emissions will continue past the 200 days of OP rewards to retain a nice incentive for staying in our these strategies. ",

PICKLE can be locked for DILL to boost yield on our Jars so there will be incentive to hold the PICKLE and vote for where Jar boosts should go on Optimism.   We are launching our Uniswap V3 auto-rebalancing Jars. These Jars automatically keeps users in range in a Uniswap V3 pool to earn higher fees and not have to manually rebalance, saving time and gas.   We feel with these two launches on Optimism users will stick with Pickle Finance. The 100 days would incentivise liquidity as we continue to build out our offering on Optimism. If you think these rewards should be spread out over a longer period the happy to take on that feedback. Maz ",

Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.  For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application.  For marketing and content creation (for example 80% Marketing proposal of Kromatika Proposal): - This depends on content creator(s), if they are \u2026     ",

Pickle Finance has been building quality vaults before, been early to Optimism and the mentioned Uni V3 auto-rebalancing Jars make especially sense in a low-transaction-cost environment such as Optimism. Duel incentives have indeed been proven to attract liquidity initially and we expect this resulting in users & community moving to Optimism. Echoing other commenters, we also hope to see some long-term programs and more sticky liquidity on Optimism. ",
