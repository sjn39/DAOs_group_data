                    "content": "Project Name: Summa (by Tracy & Associates Accounting) Author Name: @Axel_T (Axel Tracy, https://www.linkedin.com/in/axeltracy/) While Summa is a new organization, here are a few locations to facilitate research: Website: https://tracyassociates.com.au (Current business website) Twitter: https://twitter.com/TracyAssociates (Current business Twitter) Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tracyassociates/ (Current business Instagram) YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/accofina (Older, but still active, business YouTube Channel) Github: https://github.com/axel-t81 (Personal GitHub) Number of OP tokens requested: 2,000,000 (think permanence, not just the next 12-month runway or a payoff for an initial build) L2 Recipient Address: 0xa22662B3Cdd67B6f8aEB13755F180723508190b0 Relevant Usage Metrics:  N/A, new project. Although the key concepts of the project have been percolating in my mind and conversations for a good few years now. 500+ Email List subscribers and 6,600+ YouTube Channel subscribers from current, other ventures. Associate of the Institute of Public Accountants (AIPA AFA), Member of the Australian Bookkeepers Association, Certified Xero Advisor and Certified Quickbooks Online (Advanced) ProAdvisor. Registered BAS Agent. BBus (UTS) and GradCertFinPlan (Kaplan).  Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation): Intro: A professional bookkeeper & qualified accountant wants to introduce and embed Optimism to the accounting industry, its clients, professional associations, and software providers \u2026and change the world for the better in the process! Key Theme: Accounting data (in accounting systems) and accounting information (via financial reports and statements) are a critical public good for the private sector. They help businesses, investors and other stakeholders make key financial and life decisions. To date, the accounting industry has been underserved by the crypto space (outside of taxation advice and corporate consultancy services). We need a professional accountants to introduce the mainstream industry to the benefits of this technology, while breaking down entrenched power and generational gatekeepers. This can be done via Ethereum and Optimism. Initial Product Concepts: a) Community currency for the industry b) Crypto payroll apps for accounting software stack c) Crypto bill and invoice payments services within accounting software stack d) B2B credit checking platform using Ethereum blockchain e) Financial statements on Ethereum blockchain for transparency f) Taxation savings automation for small businesses Conclusion: I genuinely think the accounting sector is a perfect fit & ripe for crypto & Optimism, and will eventually be as impactful as DeFi is to financial services. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): >>> How will the OP tokens be distributed?  Accounting community currency, i.e. opt-in incentives for accountants, professional associations and software providers (25%) External app developer partners, i.e. akin to an accounting-focussed Ecosystem fund (20%) Summa Management and Team, i.e. core contributors, structure & team building, and operations (20%) Summa Treasury, i.e. wealth fund to shield Summa (20%) Future External Investors and Capital Raising Activities (15%)  >>> How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Overall: Considering we are trying to influence mainstream society at large and drive their adoption, Summa will adhere to all applicable regulations. To attract the masses we need to make adoption as reassuring as possible. As a regulated bookkeeper and qualified accountant running a compliant firm in a highly regulated industry, and having founded other successful companies, I am confident that applicable regulation will be adhered to by Summa. A compliant organisation, indistinguible from any other business, will incentivise usage in the mainstream population (our targets) and not only appeal to crypto insiders. Community currency allocation (1), i.e. Initial Product Concept (a): Taking on board the structure & timing of allocations (see other sections), driving optimal outcomes should be locked in. The community currency is for accounting firms, professional associations and software providers. That is, those allocated the community currency at no cost, will be inherently incentivised to see OP flourish. A zero cost, liquid asset with growth potential will be enough of an incentive over time, even as allocations halve. They will be driven to give their OP utility, and create its value, via unique offers for those who wish to transact in OP, and will also be incentivised to communicate about OP. External partners and Summa team allocations (2 and 3), via the Initial Product Concepts (b - f): b) Regulated payroll services and/or custom payroll software that both distributes wages in cryptocurrency and integrates with major payroll software packages. This can incentivise the use of OP by making the availability of the product limited to OP holders/stakers or SaaS payments in OP. c) Pay bills or collect invoice payments with crypto inside the Xero and QuickBooks Online app ecosystems: OP usage and liquidity can be incentivised by making OP the featured currency within the payment platform. It can be featured by design or by limiting other competing altcoins available. d) B2B Credit checking via public blockchain records and smart contracts. That is, have payment terms and timeframes (both within accounting software) fire events on Ethereum that can then be trawled or collated by our software/external apps: OP incentivised by making OP the required payment medium, via transaction fees, to write data. e) Financial statements of public companies and significant entities (or any business wanting transparency) being recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, all translated into a universal currency: OP. These records would be a public good available to anyone to use or build upon: OP is incentivised by making it the universal currency of all financial statements, i.e. the common currency all global financial statements are translated into. f) Taxation savings automation for small businesses. Businesses who collect sales tax could use an intermediary token as a payment mechanism that has smart contract logic to segregate business funds and amounts to be relayed onto taxation agencies. OP can be incentivised as it could be the only currency to offer an on & off ramp to the intermediary token. Summa Team (i.e. business operations), Treasury and Capital Raising allocations (3, 4 and 5): This is all about the longevity of the Summa organisation. Decent levels of funds for multi-year, many market cycle operations are required, and capacity to secure investment within the mainstream business community. Finally, only Treasury fund returns will be utilised, and ultimately the principal shields Summa. >>> Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Those allocated the community currency will have the same incentives as they did before incentives dry up (or diminish). They will already have their allocation, they will already be emotionally/financially invested in OP based on past transactions and current holdings (See earlier section about community currency incentives). The Summa team will be fairly and compliantly paid in mainstream fiat. Any direct OP payments will supplement their standard remuneration. Thus, they will see their OP as an asset to hold, rather than to liquidate for daily needs. Any external investors will be vetted to ensure that any allocations of OP will not simply be liquidated. Ideally lock up will be included in shareholders agreements. Summa management and external app partners will fundamentally #StayOptimistic. There will be inherent reasons why we commit our money, time and lives to working with the Collective.  >>> Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Accounting community currency : 10-years, with a halving of allocations every quarter (i.e. similar to Bitcoin miners\u2019 incentive). External app partners: Minimum 5-years Summa team: Minimum 5-years Summa treasury: No lockup period, but will be managed sensibly. This fund will be a diversified crypto and fiat based portfolio, i.e. minimise risk by decoupling. Future capital raising: Minimum 2-years.  >>> How much will your project match in co-incentives? The project is new and has zero funds. But from personally, I\u2019ll contribute OP, ETH, BTC and BNB equivalent to AUD $25,000. Depending on your own perspective this may or may not sound like much, but from my own current financial position this is a significant personal commitment to this project. PROPOSAL UPDATE (2022-06-17):  Edits above to meet word count limit.  This addition: Based on the feedback of a fellow Proposal (Raptor), Summa will buy back Optimism Tokens on the open market at each end of quarter (EOQ) using 5% of all revenue from the Payroll & Payment apps. We will also verifiably burn these OP tokens at EOQ and report these activities in a Gitbook. Like Raptor, burning OP Tokens will reduce circulating supply increasing its value.  ",

                    "content": "Hi @Robor2b102 TLDR: Initial Product Concept (a): Marketing/onboarding approach. Initial Product Concept (b) and (c): Centralised app, but does interact with Optimism Network. Initial Product Concept (d), (e) and (f): True DApps and the blue sky ideas for Optimism and Ethereum. FULL RESPONSE: Firstly, thanks for your question, it\u2019s a good one too. It\u2019s a good question, because the above proposal is a grouping of ideas I\u2019ve had for a few years involving crypto and the accounting industry. That is, this grouping means that I have both, DApp concepts, and an approach to use OP as a marketing (and ultimately onboarding) technique for the industry. To go into more detail\u2026 1) The community currency using OP is an onboarding/marketing (just let me call it onboarding?) approach. The idea here is that so few accountants know how the technology works outside of what they see on mainstream media or read in a Koinly report (if they even know what Koinly is). They may know how crypto impacts a tax return, but they\u2019ve never held it themselves let alone been exposed to Web3. So the OP acts an incentive to get industry participants to jump through a few hoops to access their free OP rewards. First they\u2019ll have to opt-in, and then they\u2019ll have to be able to negotiate how to access and use their OP, etc. You only get the gold, if you learn how to use the pick & shovel. The key idea here is is that we can nudge or encourage a very wide group of professionals to learn the basics of OP, Layer 2 tech and Ethereum. And these aren\u2019t just professionals, they can be very influential professionals as trusted financial and advice partners of individuals and businesses who use their service (often high net worth individuals and their businesses). So if the accountants become comfortable with the tech, they will feel more comfortable advising their clients about it. My assumption is that 85%+ of practising accountants could only name BTC as an example of a cryptocurrency, or possibly BTC and ETH. My goal is that we make OP the third name/example in their memory banks as they discuss crypto with their colleagues and clients, or indeed that OP is known as \u2018the cryptocurrency that accountants use\u2019. Okay, there\u2019s more to this, and I could talk about it more, but there isn\u2019t the time in one reply. Ask for more detail if you want? 2)    As for \u201cInitial Product Concepts\u201d (b) and (c), the payroll and payments software. These aren\u2019t really DApps, but instead they are centralised apps that reside within the accounting software stack ecosystem \u2026BUT they will interact with the Optimism Network to carry out their functionality. That is, you\u2019ll find that most small businesses and accounting firms don\u2019t just use one piece of \u201caccounting software\u201d. Instead they use an accounting software stack. So they may start with Xero or Intuit Quickbooks Online (QBO) and then they\u2019ll have a number of other apps that integrate with the core accounting data inside Xero/QBO/etc. For example, you may use Dear software for your inventory management and connect that to Xero or QBO, or you may use Stripe software for invoice payments and again, connect that to your Xero or QBO. Some of these add-ons are small apps from specialist app developers, and some add-ons like PayPal are giant business that use the accounting software packages to tap into the global small business market. Yep? So for \u2018Initial Product Concept\u2019 (b) and (c) I want to build these types of apps (1) for payroll and (2) for billing & invoice payments and have them inside the Xero App Store and QBO App Store. But the key idea here is that these app functions will interact with the Optimism Network. So they\u2019re not completely DApps, and instead reside as Xero and QBO add-ons, but they will interact with Optimism to carry out payroll functions (i.e. pay staff in OP and other bridged tokens) and for payment services (i.e. send an invoice from inside Xero/QBO and the invoice will have a \u2018Pay by Crypto/OP\u2019 option where receiving business can pay these invoices in OP or other bridged tokens). EDIT (I just re-read your question): While this software will be for any business, you\u2019ll find that most people who actually work with this software are indeed the bookkeepers and accountants, and thus it can onboard them to Optimism. 3) As for \u201cInitial Product Concepts\u201d (d), (e), and (f), these ARE the true DApps. These are the long-term, blue sky ideas. This is less about building new accounting apps or onboarding accountants, and more about creating platforms that Summa and I end up having very little to do with (i.e. they\u2019ll operate on their own with a global community). Full transparency, full honesty: I\u2019m a bookkeeper & accountant, and not a bleeding edge Web3 developer. So how these final ideas turn from concept, to build, to self-sufficiency, is something that hasn\u2019t been nailed down yet or at least can\u2019t be nailed down by me alone. But over time I think they are real-world applications of blockchain technology. Optimism allows us to interact with Ethereum at low cost, and I think Ethereum is the best blockchain for these ideas. If you\u2019d like I can describe each of the concepts in more detail, but the overarching idea across all 3 of the concepts is that we can somehow link the data in accounting software, or batch payment files from accounting software, or simply public financial reports and push it (or small elements of it) onto the Ethereum blockchain. And if Ethereum really does become the world\u2019s programmable blockchain that stores particular data forever and is immutable, then we might be able to get Ethereum to accept particular types of accounting-specific data (cheaply via Optimism) such as financial statements (like Ethereum recording XBRL data) or merely (late) payment events/timing. And from this pool of accounting-specific data points, some pretty groundbreaking DApps and use cases can be built from it. EDIT (I just re-read your question): While these DApp will be for anyone at all, you\u2019ll find that most people who are interested in financial statements, credit checks and taxation payments do indeed have an accounting background, and thus it can again onboard them to Optimism. In conclusion:  You can see via both this reply and my original draft, a whole bunch of things are crammed together. I\u2019d like to build or implement all of them, but you can probably see that while the vision is larger as the numbered points in this reply increment, the complexity also increases from (1), to (2), and then again to the highest complexity at (3). But this is still a draft, and I\u2019m still a team of 1(!) without great deal of colleagues in the crypto space, so I\u2019m definitely open to suggestions, tips and guidance on how to approach this elephant meal I called the Initial Product Concepts listed in my proposal. So please, feel free to make comments or suggestions, or provide advice if you think I\u2019m doing things wrong.  Thanks for your time, and thanks again for your question. It was great to get Q1  Kind regards, Axel ",

There\u2019s no such thing a bad question, right? To answer your Q1 I will refer you to my Reply to Robor2b102\u2019s own question above. I wrote both a TLDR version and a Full Response version to questions that are similar to your Q1. To answer your Q2 I will again refer you to both my Draft Proposal and my Reply to Robor2b102. If you need any clarification (from either of your Q1 or Q2) then perhaps you could ask a more acute question or refer to my earlier proposal/reply and explain what I\u2019m not making clear? The new forum content I add here, in regards to Q2, is that:  My end users will be accountants, their clients and small businesses (but will also involve accounting professional associations and accounting software providers). This will add value to the OP ecosystem as these end users will either hold, or ideally buy to hold & transact with OP for use with the built apps (in the case of the products) or for to create custom \u2018value creating\u2019 marketing offers & benefits for their own firms (in the case of the accountants community currency). A second-wave benefit is that a whole new cohort of mainstream society will become exposed to OP and become adept at working with Web3, Ethereum and Layer 2 solutions, and this will ideally give them reassurance to integrate these technologies into their everyday businesses, and in the case of accountants, their client advice.  EDIT: Yes, these ideas might be a little hard to grasp at the start, as they are indeed unique (if you\u2019re not a bookkeeper or accountant). They are not just another DEX, another Lending Protocol, another Yield product, or just another Aggregator of these. Not that Defi isn\u2019t potentially the most disruptive and transformative tech sector of our generation, but these app and Dapp ideas I have in my Roadmap are a whole new product category. And this is another reason why they will add value to the OP ecosystem. That is, they will onboard a whole new demographic to OP and Ethereum, and not just appeal to, or cannibalize, the same group of crypto enthusiasts.  To answer your Q3 and Q4 I will refer you to my, as yet unwritten, Reply to solarcurve. Both of you have implied the same idea, so I will address the size and timing of the token request in my Reply to his post. Thanks again for your question. I can pick up that your hesitant about my Proposal but you appear to be seeking more info before making a final decision, and I can\u2019t really ask for much more of a chance than that. So thanks, and have a good day. Kind regards, Axel ",

                    "content": "Hi @solarcurve thanks for your patience with my reply. I\u2019m going to frame my response, and why my Tokens Requested isn\u2019t too high, but breaking it down into 4x Sections. 1) The Governance Fund as a whole The Governance Fund has 230,000,000 OP that it will be distributing over the next six months (Optimism Gateway). Now that equates to about 13 fortnightly Phases. Which in turns means that each Phase should allocate approx 17,500,000 OP, if the Governance Fund is to meet its objectives. You\u2019ll see from the Proposals in Phase 0 and 1 that this target isn\u2019t being met at the current rate of allocations. Thus, my argument is that 2,000,000 fits neatly into the targeted allocation rate over the 6-months Governance Fund. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to argue that the full 230,000,000 shouldn\u2019t be allocated. What, do we just burn the unallocated OP?! Because if that\u2019s the best argument not to allocate all OP from the fund then why don\u2019t we just cancel the whole process and burn the lot? It would make the current holders much wealthier in the short term, but it would fundamentally counter the Optimism Collective\u2019s vision. That is, let\u2019s make sure we allocate all these OP in the next 6-months as was, and is, the goal of the Fund. Secondly, my Token Request is 0.87% of the total Governance Fund. This means that approx 115 other projects with a similar sized token request could be successfully proposed to the Governance Fund. That\u2019s a great deal of start up investments in that quasi-portfolio. My argument is that 0.87% of the total fund, allowing 115 other equivalent investments, is not overweight or too high for one proposal. In particular when you add this argument to the one from the prior paragraph about the rate of Governance Fund OP allocations. 2) Seed (or Pre-Seed) Funding for Start Up Projects You said\u2026     solarcurve:  This is a brand new totally unproven project that you\u2019re asking us to basically fund for you   And my shortest response is: \u201cKind of, yes\u201d. But I view this as a seed funding round. I don\u2019t believe I myself am totally unproven. I\u2019m a mature, middle aged person, with more than a decade of professional experience in my field, I have very high levels of both academic and professional qualifications and credentials, and I have founded and run multiple small businesses that put me through studies and support me and my family now. So, I\u2019m not exactly a a kid with no life experience but a bright idea asking for a bucket of others people\u2019s money. But I\u2019ll concede that my proposal is based on a concept. A concept that needs Seed Funding, or Pre-Seed Funding (whatever terminology you prefer). If you search around, you\u2019ll find the current average Seed or Pre-Seed Funding Round is anywhere between USD $3,000,000 to USD $5,000,000 (The current state of 2022 pre/seed investing | by Trace Cohen | May, 2022 | Medium) (A Guide to Raising Seed Funding in 2022). At today\u2019s OP USD price, I\u2019m asking for the OP equivalent of USD $1,030,000. Thus my argument is that my seed or pre-seed funding request is well below the lower bands of the average Seed or Pre-Seed Funding round in 2022, and thus not too great an ask. Finally in this section, I see that you, yourself via Balancer had raised USD $3,000,000 Seed Capital in March of 2020 (Balancer Labs Raises $3M to Supercharge Programmable Liquidity | by Fernando Martinelli | Balancer Protocol | Medium), when Balancer was still indeed \u201cvery much a beta product\u201d (New Balancer Token More Than Doubles in Price as COMP Drops Sharply). So while I\u2019ll try not to call it hypocritical when you do this type of seed raise, but then 2-years later say:     solarcurve:  I strongly prefer projects to make multiple proposals over time rather than hand you 2M OP and hope for the best.   I will instead try to appeal to you as someone who was in my position only a few years ago. That is, you knew why you asked for $3,000,000 and not something smaller, or something that was conditional. You knew what you needed to make the numbers add up. You knew how a successful, decently sized Seed Round could assist you implement your vision and really make Balancer a success. My argument is that I now ask for the same faith from this Optimism Collective community that Accomplice and Placeholder showed you. 3) Risk It was mentioned earlier that there would be a \u2018hoping for the best\u2019. Well, yes, that is true. It\u2019s true for all Proposals in all Phases and indeed all investments. We all hope for the best once we hand over our funds, and have to accept our given level of risk. And yes, there is risk. But I argue that a lower token request actually increases the risk of my and some other projects. Too few tokens actually incentivizes fly-by-night capital, where small to medium sums are handed over, it\u2019s churned through in three to six months, nothing gets traction, and bang! All the tokens are gone, and the team moves back to their old lives, or to the next short-term, ticking runway/minefield. A higher token ask increases responsibility and incentivises longer term thinking and plans. It creates a state of permanent dedication, not a \u2018well lets so how this goes, and I\u2019ll just go back to my old job in the new year if it doesn\u2019t work out\u2019 mentality. As for the risk of just vanishing with the OP, or rugging my tokens, or doing other dodgy stuff, etc I argue thats why I\u2019ve doxxed myself. I have a professional and personal reputation to protect and I also don\u2019t want to be the most hated person in crypto. There is a risk that my concepts fail, but by doxxing myself and being public & transparent means there is little to no risk of me acting nefariously. And finally for this section. Yes all these concepts and project might still all just go to s*** in the end. I never want to convey a guarantee of success. I can though offer my dedication, my full effort and I won\u2019t let this project fail without a hell of a fight   But if you want to help me minimise this risk of failure, please see the conclusion. 4) Conclusion  Based on all the above arguments I believe my token request is fair, reasonable and importantly will be effective. In the same vein, I believe that other Proposals are asking for too few tokens. Tokens shouldn\u2019t just be handed over as a bribe for established products to come over to Optimism, and new projects should fund themselves adequately for the long term and not just provide a quasi-salary to a lone developer to work on something for six months. I\u2019m no longer frightened of asking for the tokens that I am, because at its core, I really want my project to shake things up in a very big way for very many people. And if I don\u2019t have the courage to make the initial ask, how will I ever change the accounting industry and the world at large the way I want to, if I can realise the Summa vision. The Tokens Requested will also not be lowered to 100,000 as @solarcurve recommended, as even he admits that probably wouldn\u2019t change his position on the vote. Note: I am open to others who have similar recommendations, but a different outcome. E.g. \u201cAxel, I\u2019m an Against at 2M, but at 1M I\u2019d become a For\u201d. So, I\u2019m interested to hear feedback if anyone fits into this category. And finally, if you want to help me minimise the risk of this new project, then get involved! I\u2019m open to advice from people who have been there and done that. And there\u2019s safety in numbers, so even if you can\u2019t provide specialist advice, then please get involved and become a supporter or follower or whatever. Welcome aboard, it\u2019s Summa time    Thanks for your time with this long post. Kind regards, Axel ",

Thus, my advice to you would be to go raise a seed round, prove your idea works, then return here and ask for OP incentives to pour additional fuel on that fire so to speak. Happy for someone from Optimism to chime in and say I\u2019m totally wrong, we have a desperate need to give out tokens, and using these funds as \u201cseed round investments\u201d is a good idea. Barring that I have to continue to be against this. ",

I do not think that my comments on Kromatika\u2019s proposal are inconsistent with my feedback on your proposal. Here is why: Kromatika\u2019s proposal calls for marketing and LP incentives, along with a small retro to early users of an existing protocol (please note that I am not a Kromatika early user \u2013 I had not heard of it until I read their proposal).  Your proposal calls for 25% toward incentivizing future users and the rest (numbers 2-5) on your proposal goes toward early business development activities and insiders of a protocol that you will develop in the future.  The two proposals are fundamentally different proposals. Please keep in mind that I am expressing my own candid evaluation of your proposal.  I\u2019m one person with small voting power and I do not speak for the Optimism team.

I can\u2019t really find any evaluation criteria, so I am curious how you all plan to evaluate proposals.  The OPerating Manual suggests that distributions \u201cproactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities\u201d which is pretty broad.  The standard template questions narrow this down much further by specifically asking proposers to explain how their proposal will \u201cincentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism\u201d.

Firstly, I want to say sorry for my last reply, as it was a reactive response that wasn\u2019t well thought it. So I really appreciate your tolerance and your time to explain your briefer replies in more detail. I was initially confused when you said you were \"particularly drawn to using the tokens for marketing campaigns\" as I believed you were referring to the other proposal using 70% of their token request for affiliate & influencer marketing, but you have now clarified that you were referring to the other 30% for LP Incentives and the Retro to Early Users. The final thing I\u2019ll say, to again explain my poor reaction, is that I don\u2019t think that:     Justin:  Your proposal calls for 25% toward incentivizing future users and the rest (numbers 2-5) on your proposal goes toward early business development activities and insiders   is again not the best way to describe my allocation. I think a better way to briefly describe the allocation is:  25% is for \"using the tokens for marketing campaigns to onboard new users\u2026efforts could reach beyond the mercenaries and lead to increased adoption\". The community currency is all about incentivising education about & the adoption of OP, Ethereum and crypto as a whole. 20% is for the team and insiders. 35% is for project stability, longevity and long-term planning (ring-fenced from the team/insiders). And the final 20% is again for incentivising usage and liquidity by accelerating product development (via external/outsiders teams) for the onboarding of a whole new cohort of the business community.  Thanks for your time, and thanks for letting me again clarify (or at least have a right of reply) to the way things had been described. All the best with your voting activities, and still feel free to AMA if you need any clarification or concepts fleshed out. Kind regards, Axel ",

For the record, while I\u2019ll sleep on it, I\u2019m looking into incorporating a Lock Up Period for 50% of the Requested OP, similar to Optimistic Railway & what we discussed earlier. This will be to increase transparency, incentivise cost control within Summa, and (ultimately) to calm the nerves and lower the risks of my comparatively large number of OP Requested. I\u2019m going to sleep on it (it\u2019s 10.20pm here now), and if I update the Draft tomorrow I\u2019ll post it in #gov-temp-check on Discord to \u2018ping\u2019 anyone that the Draft had been changed. Thanks again for all your input over the past week or so. If I\u2019m successful in the vote then I look forward to bringing lots of accountants onboard into the ecosystem, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help you get up to speed with your accounting knowledge  Cheers, Axel ",

As per my earlier discussed \u2018overnight thinking\u2019, I\u2019ve decided against trying to offer a 50% Lock Up Period. This is because of the centralisation implications of trying to manage this. What would originally be a straight up & down vote would transform into a negotiation with 1 or 2 Delegates, or Optimism Foundation members, etc. It would be best to let my proposal stand or fall on its own, letting the community decide this, and not have 50% decided by the community and 50% decided by OP insiders only. Overall, thanks for all you feedback. Here we go! I\u2019m still here to answer questions until Voting closes. And if the Proposal in successful, then I definitely plan to be active in the community. I hope we can all Stay Optimistic in our voting, and allow the realisation of the decentralised Web3 future (including all possible impacted industries) that we\u2019re aiming for!

I WISH TO MAKE A HUMBLE REQUEST If you did not engage at all with my Proposal for the past three weeks since it first went into Draft mode, whether here in this forum or the #gov-temp-check Discord channel, then please, I request you to NOT provide negative Replies here, in particular after you\u2019ve already committed your vote. This request is aimed at not receiving harsh news delivered fresh to my Gmail inbox on a semi-regular basis. The time to provide your wisdom, insight and feedback was during the two weeks that this proposal was up online as a Draft, i.e. so I could possibly incorporate your views and possibly improve the proposal. The time for your first ever engagement with me or this Proposal is not now, after it has been set as Ready and is being voted on. If however your feel particularly important and must share, influence other voters, or justify (to me?) why you\u2019ve voted No, then please use the following thread: Voting Cycle #2: Roundup - #40 by nogahev839 If you use this suggested thread to eviscerate my Proposal, then at least I won\u2019t get your Reply pop up in my work Gmail and punch me in the gut. Thank you in advance if you could adhere to this request  Note: If you have positive news/feedback or did indeed engage with me and my Proposal while it was still in Draft mode, then this request does not apply to you. You\u2019ll either let good news be sent to my inbox or we\u2019re already mates and I can handle your frank feedback. 2. IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY VOTED If you have not already voted and want a TLDR review of everything above, everything throughout this forum, the Discord, the web, my CV, my business experience, etc then here is all you need to know:  Poor build Skinny Lacks great physical stature and strength Lacks mobility and ability to avoid the rush Lacks a really strong arm Can\u2019t drive the ball downfield Does not throw a really tight spiral A system-type player who can get exposed if forced to ad-lib Gets knocked down easy.

You\u2019re clearly very motivated by the idea and have put in a decent amount of time explaining it, but it is equally clear that it is very unique and from a specialized field that most of us delegates have very limited understanding of. You may well be able to educate us further on how this would work and why it would be beneficial, take on board some suggestions and resubmit in a couple of weeks or months. Just wanted to reassure you really that this isn\u2019t a \u2018one chance\u2019 type operation and lack of success on this phase should have little or no bearing on your opportunities for future proposals. Learn from this process, bring us along with your vision, and try again in the future. MinimalGravitas ",

If not for that I would have voted NO since the amount is very high (~$1,040,000) and since I am not really sure what the proposal wants to achieve as I only see some product concept proposals and no indication you have the ability to deliver on them.

                    "content": "Hello OP Community, Now that the vote has concluded, I wish to express my dear thanks for all those that voted \u2018Yes\u2019 to this proposal. While the final count was a bit of a landslide, I did note that many individual voters had backed the Summa project. For this I can\u2019t thank you enough! I really appreciate the support you showed me and the project. I\u2019ll never forget it, and will continue to work hard to repay the faith you showed me. On the whole though, it has been a hard loss in the final count. I\u2019m only left to thank all those that participated and took the time to vote and understand the project, even if you did vote \u2018No\u2019 or \u2018Abstain\u2019. The final result, and the accompanying feedback has been noted, and will be taken on board for any future ventures inside or outside the Optimism Collective. So while I couldn\u2019t convince a majority of you, I hope there are no hard feelings from either of our ends. And if other web3 projects are pursued down the track then we might still be able to work positively together in the community in the future. One vote & one project should never dictate a relationship or friendship in perpetuity. Ultimately, while the loss was difficult (and I think I\u2019ve passed through the 5 stages of grief by now, ha!), I wanted to thank the Optimism Collective as a whole. I\u2019ve had a few ventures in the past that have been shot down before, by powerful people who held the purse strings. But I can honestly say that this process, while not perfect, has given me the fairest chance to get backing that I\u2019ve ever received. There were open forums, over 1000 words to explain my concept and it wasn\u2019t 4 or 5 people deciding my fate behind closed doors in a boardroom. Instead, I had 5,385 have their say on whether this project should proceed  So when I reflect on this, it\u2019s much easier to \u2018stay optimistic\u2019 for the future, whether it\u2019s for my own ideas or any other high-impact decisions that could benefit from bottom-up governance. Thanks for your time, and best of success! Kind regards, Axel ",
