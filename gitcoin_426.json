This Snapshot vote is proposed by _  (Fire Eyes DAO), and looks to finalize a decision around the AKITA tokens. There are 7 proposals the snapshot vote compares; 1; Proposal from @HelloShreyas outlining a short/medium/long term strategy  to sell 10% of Gitcoin\u2019s AKITA balance and place 90% of its AKITA balance in a Sablier contract unlocked over 2 years. 2; Proposal from @castall proposing the Gitcoin community use AKITA as part of the next quadratic matching pool (in current and future rounds). 3; Proposal from @lightnode to deposit 100% of AKITA tokens to the Based market 4; Proposal from @relic to burn all AKITA tokens held by the Gitcoin Multisig except for 5% and leaving 5% to stimulate progress between both communities. 5; Proposal from @cryptowanderer to burn 100% of AKITA tokens to 0x0 6; Proposal from @tjayrush proposing the Gitcoin community return the AKITA funds to their source (Vitalik\u2019s sending address). 7; Proposal from @androolloyd to liquidate 100% of AKITA for ETH This Snapshot vote aims to summarize the majority of AKITA related proposals from the Gitcoin community, allowing the community to signal and ultimately make a decision on what to do with the AKITA tokens held by Gitcoin.

I agree with @lefterisjp\u2019s continued assertion that the mission is to fund opensource projects and with @androolloyd\u2019s proposal to create a treasury management workstream that should be charged with these type of decisions moving forward. With that in mind, it seems that any option which disposes of the AKITA tokens in an inefficient manner, or that leaves the treasure with a disproportionally large speculative position in AKITA, is unacceptable. Specific feedback for each of the proposals listed above:  unacceptable \u2013 disproportional speculative position in AKITA, locked tokens are unproductive. unacceptable \u2013 disproportional speculative position in AKITA unacceptable \u2013 disproportional speculative position in AKITA unacceptable \u2013 inefficient disposal of assets unacceptable \u2013 inefficient disposal of assets unacceptable \u2013 inefficient disposal of assets unacceptable \u2013 too vague  Of all of the proposals, I lean most towards 7. But would would need it to be more clearly defined before voting in favor of it. Specifically, what is the method of liquidation? Over what period of time is the position liquidated? A combination of both of the liquidation strategies suggested by @HelloShreyas may be a good place to start. ",

So in some sense if you believe the community should vote to sell, for short term purposes (say in the next 3-6 months) a proposal to sell 10% is equivalent to a proposal to sell 100% just without removing the potential for future disposition. Of course just to remain unbiased, I think not selling at all is also a valid approach as other proposals have outlined. ",
