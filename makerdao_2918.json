INDEXcoop is a decentralised organisation initiated by TokenSets and DeFi pulse This application is made by @overanalyser and @DarkForestCapital two members of the INDEXcoop community. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. $DPI is an ERC20 index fund. It represents 100% asset ownership of the underlying tokens. The intention of the fund is to allow ownership of key governance protocols within the DeFi Space. This could be thought of as wrapped DeFi (wDeFi). Such a structure has the benefit of providing asset exposure while minimising the downside risk due to individual projects failing. Entry into the reference index is governed by DeFi Pulse with a formal methodology in place . The Smart contracts used are developed by TokenSets TokensSets are ERC20 tokens that directly represent a basket of the underlying components, which are fully collateralized (assets held in 1:1 collateralization in a smart contract like Wrapped Ether). The supply of the DPI token is based on issue and redemption. Tokens can be issued by depositing the underlying collateral to mint and can be redeemed by burning the Token and retrieving the underlying constituents. TokenSet pools can be rebalanced, where constituents and weights can be adjusted through trades on DEXes. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. $DPI was launched in mid September 2020 as a joint project between DeFi Pulse and Token sets. On the 6th October the INDEXcoop was launched to produce a community managed organisation focusing on the creation and adoption of Index funds. Set labs and DeFi Pulse are founding members of INDEXcoop with vested holdings (28% and 2% respectively). The remaining INDEX tokens are are being distributed to the community (1% to DPI holders on 3rd October, 9% as liquidity mining DPI:ETH pair) or being held as community treasury. The fund is currently composed of 11 governance tokens based on their circulating market capitalisation  :  864\u00d7478 35.6 KB   844\u00d7464 11.2 KB  The current market cap for $DPI is ~$18 M USD vs $3 Billion for the underlying tokens. As the fund is based on a market cap allocation it currently contains ~ 0.4% of the circulating tokens for each and every underlying component (e.g. 4,400 $MKR, 145 $YFI\u2026)  865\u00d7456 14.5 KB  The key benefits of using $DPI as collateral is that it can be directly redeemed to the underlying tokens (worth a combined $3 Billion USD) while being protected from the downside of a single project failure. This means that the DPI token should smooth out the overall performance and the volatility of the underlying tokens.

The v2 Set protocol smart contract design pooled structure of the fund means that collapse of a single component can not result in the pool being drained of the other tokens. Rather the combined value of the pool would drop based on the affected tokens value. This is unlike Balancer or Uniswap pools where price collapse results in draining / rug pulls. Intrinsic productivity The INDEX community is currently looking at ways of releasing some of the potential yield contained within the underlying governance tokens. This may include taking part of the total DPI underlying assets and staking governance contracts (e.g. YFI), or lending it via other protocols (e.g. cUNI, aREN\u2026). If such a change to the fund structure takes place it will add some smart contract and liquidity risks compared to just holding the native tokens. Current discussions are looking at a combination of lock ins of $DPI and INDEX staking as risk management strategies if we decide to take this route:    The Index Coop \u2013 27 Oct 20    [Ongoing Draft] Current state of discussions around DPI product upgrades Thanks to the quality of discussion by the community in @overanalyser\u2019s 2% Cash Grab and my earlier DPI as a productive asset post, we now have a clearer picture on the tradeoffs between various upgrades proposed by the community.

Governance of underlying tokens As proxy holders of a significant proportion of available tokens, the INDEXCoop community has the opportunity to participate in the governance of other protocols. This is currently being discussed within the community.

How is the applying collateral type currently used? At the moment the collateral is mainly used as a diversification tool for passive ownership of the underlying tokens. $DPI has been listed as collateral on CREAM.  The INDEX community is applying to other communities (Compound, Aave) to have it added as collateral to make the DPI a more productive asset to encourage long term ownership and growth of AUV. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The primary market is by the issue and redemption of DPI from the underlying tokens via the Tokensets contracts. TokenSets - Asset Management Simplified The main secondary market is on the ETH-DPI pair on uniswap.  this currently has a $23 M pool depth (obviously boosted by the liquidity mining programme in operation until 6th December). The primary and secondary markets are linked by arbitrage, including flash loan transactions. see here for a description of the arbitrage opportunities for such index funds. The Concourse team has an open source version of an arbitrage bot that mints and redeems automatically. There are other secondary markets  and the Community is working on further listings. 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. N/A 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. N/A 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Many of the assets in the DeFi Pulse Index are already supported by MakerDAO oracles. There are two options for oracles: having a dedicated feed for the DPI itself or taking the sum of the underlying.

I guess you\u2019d be looking at Cream for a gauge of potential demand on Maker? Once the farming ends on Dec 6th we would expect holders to find their way to Cream and hopefully Maker as they look to put the token to work. As you and SebVentures mentioned, DPI makes great collateral for a few reasons and we are working as Index Coop to try and communicate this. I think as more users realise DPI offers lower volatility compared to the individual constituent tokens, it\u2019s use case as collateral will strengthen. I don\u2019t know of any specific requests from within the Index Coop for leverage/credit but I\u2019m sure OverAnalyser will be along soon and might have more info. Of course if DPI gets added to Maker that paves the way for a potential Yearn vault strategy which will increase deposits\u2026 ",

Once the INDEX  incentives end in December, I would expect some pull back from the liquidity pool and an overall reduction in total DPI holdings. However, the opportunity to used in a Maker Vault (or Cream collateral), makes holding DPI more attractive for some people. How large that opportunity is, I don\u2019t know. However, I think DPI has many attractive features for holders and vaults. ",

As many users do not have a high degree of trust with CREAM yet, the larger actors have not moved to draw out DAI. That said, one thing we\u2019re thinking is working with YYFI or creating a strategy ourselves that takes DPI, draws DAI, and then leverage farms with the DAI. Based on anecdotal sources, there may be enough demand to generate a few million in DAI. ",

AUM has steadily grown over the last 6 months with issued tokens increasing from ~250 k to ~440 k and we now have $156 m AUM. L1 liquidity is still focused on Uniswap v2 @ $48 m (Incentivised by INDEX tokens), with smaller pools on uni v3 and Sushiswap.  The main on chain depth is still on v2, but we are looking to encourage liquidity to move to v3 and to be tighter to the market price.

Now we have 80% outside of the incentivised pool (with ~20% on Cream as collateral). DPI contains MKR which makes it less attractive as MKR is the ultimate backstop for DAI. Price oracles are difficult as the compositions changes over time (now 15 tokens with more to come). There is a theoretical exploit around rebalancing to a pump and dump coin and getting liquidated. Other than Kucoin we don\u2019t have many exchange listings yet.  Combined, they all mean that there are easier / more attractive collaterals to be added. However,  that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see DPI added in the future. ",

Due to the construction of DPI on tokensets if MKR collapses DPI will only loose ~14% of it\u2019s total value, so it\u2019s possible to modify the collateral parameters to zero rate the MKR component (so 150% collateral ratio becomes 150/0.86 = 174%).
