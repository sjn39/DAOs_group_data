                    "content": "This document is a suggested process for developing and advancing Uniswap Governance Proposals. It is a living document intended to be owned, modified and enforced by the Uniswap community. Note: Autonomous proposals are a recent addition to Governance, not yet considered in this document. A process and policy around this proposal type should be created and implemented by the community. Process: Several governance venues available to Uniswap governance are mentioned, each serving its own particular purpose.  gov.uniswap.org  Gov.uniswap.org is a Discourse forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts. New members are required to enter 4 topics and read 15 posts over the course of 10 minutes before they are permitted to post themselves.  Snapshot  Snapshot is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of UNI delegated to the address used to vote.  Governance portals  A governance portal can be accessed through the Uniswap interface. Votes can be delegated and cast through this portal. There are also several other governance interfaces that users can use to cast their votes*:  https://custody.coinbase.com/ http://unigov.eth.link/#/ap https://app.boardroom.info/  *Note: this is not a complete list, and should be updated by the community frequently. Below is a preliminary draft for the Uniswap governance process, detailing exactly where these venues fit in. These processes are subject to change according to feedback from the Uniswap community. Phase 1: Temperature Check \u2014 Discourse/Snapshot The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. To create a Temperature Check:   Ask a general, non-biased question to the community on gov.uniswap.org about a potential change (example: \u201cShould Uniswap governance add liquidity mining for XYZ token?\u201d). Forum posts should be labeled as follows: \u201cTemperature Check - [Your Title Here]\u201d. The forum post should include a link to the associated Snapshot poll.   Voters use Snapshot to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage. Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 3 days.   That\u2019s it! You\u2019ve just started the process of gaining support for a proposal. At the end of the 3 days, a majority vote with a 25k UNI yes-vote threshold wins. If the Temperature check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site. If the Temperature Check does suggest a change, proceed to Stage 2: Consensus Check. Phase 2: Consensus Check \u2014 Discourse/Snapshot The purpose of the Consensus Check is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal. To create a Consensus Check:   Use feedback from the Temperature Check post and create a new Snapshot poll which covers the options which have gained support. This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but should include the option \u201cMake no change\u201d or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.   Create a new topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cConsensus Check \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d. This will alert the community that this topic has already passed Temperature Check. Any topics beginning with Consensus Check that have not passed Temperature Check should be immediately be removed by community moderators. Make sure that the discussion thread links to the new Snapshot poll and the Temperature Check thread.   Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to vote on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Consensus Check topic. Share your view point, although try to remain as impartial as possible.   At the end of 5 days, whichever option has the majority of votes wins, and can be included in a governance proposal for Stage 3. A 50k UNI yes-vote quorum is required for the Consensus Check to pass. If the option \u201cMake no change\u201d wins, the Consensus Check topic should be closed by community moderators. Phase 3: Governance Proposal \u2014 Governance Portal Phase 3 \u2014 Governance Proposal \u2014 is the final step of the governance process. The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the Consensus Check and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal. To create a Governance Proposal:   Write the code for your proposal, which can be voted on through any Governance Portal. More resources can be found here. All proposed code should be audited by a professional auditor. This auditing process could be paid or reimbursed by the community treasury.   Ensure at least 10 million UNI is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated UNI to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.   Create a topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cGovernance Proposal [Proposal Number] \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d and link to any relevant Snapshot polls/discussion threads as well as the code audit report. Proposal numbers should be in a \u201cUP###\u201d format. For example, the first Uniswap Proposal should be titled UP001, the second UP002, and so on. Topics that begin with \u201cGovernance Proposal\u201d that have not successfully passed the Temperature Check and Consensus Check stages should be removed by community moderators.   Call the propose() function of the Governor Alpha to deploy your proposal.   Once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place in the gov.uniswap.org forum. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed. Soft governance: The process described above lays out a structure for those wishing to host a formal vote on a particular issue. However, governance systems also require a degree of \u201cmetagovernance\u201d discussions that inform the direction of and the implementation processes behind policy, but which don\u2019t qualify as policy themselves. The community may discuss new ideas and strategies for governance \u2014 including changes to the process outlined above \u2014 in the \u201cGovernance-Meta\u201d category. On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes. Governance Glossary:   UNI: An ERC-20 token that designates the weight of a user\u2019s voting rights. The more UNI a user has in their wallet, the more weight their delegation or vote on a proposal holds.   Delegation: UNI holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder\u2019s own address. Note that delegation does not lock tokens; it simply adds votes to the chosen delegation address.   Proposal: A proposal is code that is executed by the governance contract through timelock. It can replace the governance contract, transfer tokens from the community treasury, or perform an almost infinite range of other on-chain actions. In order to create a proposal, an address must have at least 1% (10M UNI) of all UNI delegated to their address. Proposals are stored in the \u201cproposals\u201d mapping of the Governor smart contract. All proposals are subject to a 7-day voting period. If the proposer does not maintain their vote weight balance throughout the voting period, the proposal may be canceled by anyone.   Quorum: In order for a vote to pass, at least 4% of all UNI (40M) must vote in the affirmative. The purpose of this quorum is to ensure that the only measures that pass have adequate voter participation.   Voting: Users can vote for or against single proposals once they have voting rights delegated to their address. Votes can be cast while a proposal is in the \u201cActive\u201d state. Votes can be submitted immediately using \u201ccastVote\u201d or submitted later with \u201ccastVoteBySig\u201d (For more info on castVoteBySig and offline signatures, see EIP-712). If the majority of votes (and a 4% quorum of UNI) vote for a proposal, the proposal may be queued in the Timelock.   Voting Period: Once a proposal has been put forward, Uniswap community members will have a seven day period (the Voting Period) to cast their votes.   Timelock: All governance actions are delayed for a minimum of 2 days by the timelock contract before they can be executed.   ",

I\u2019m linking a topic I made regarding an idea I have for a more organic way to promote and develop proposals that will be voted on, improvements to the overall Governance UI experience, and a novel way of staking votes for ideas that users would like to see become proposals. One of the great benefits we can take from this community governance is the formation of ad-hocs to quickly and efficiently perform Uniswap legislation (and also make it fun to do so). Similar to how Augur has a prediction market, I am picturing a \u201cLegislative Market\u201d of sorts being a step forward in community governance. Using the staking mechanism logic behind liquidity pools in a competitive manner where YES and NO tokens that only work within the Governance UI are staked against each other in an attempt to push proposal ideas either forward or out.     Percent Dominance Staking as a Pipeline for Proposals Consensus Check       I think there\u2019s a more organic way to get quality ideas turned into proposals, I would like to outline it for you and get any feedback, as I am currently working on a UI to showcase as a demo. This is something that I have been thinking about a LOT regarding how voting takes place, particularly since I first saw the \u201cUniPig\u201d page\u2026  First off, we don\u2019t want to turn this system into the one we\u2019re trying to step away from.

I\u2019m not ready to take a big loan vai crypto because of the market volatility. But if stable coins work as intended I\u2019d be more open to it. I\u2019d like a fixed term and floating and fixed interest options and understand securing the loan is important too so I\u2019m happy to do so. Uniswap has been awesome for investor\u2019s but I\u2019ve only heard about the horror stories so far about borrowers. Is uniswap capable of attracting borrowers? Automatic market makers create liquidity but doesn\u2019t solve the equation until I\u2019d like to see borrowers enter a contract with low interest rates and get the greatest not for risking capital but for returning value over the amount lent. Can you see how balancing this equation maybe impossible with automatic market makers. ",

It is a living document intended to be owned, modified and enforced by the Uniswap community. Note: Autonomous proposals are a recent addition to Governance, not yet considered in this document. A process and policy around this proposal type should be created and implemented by the community. Process: Several governance venues available to Uniswap governance are mentioned, each serving its own particular purpose.  gov.uniswap.org  Gov.uniswap.org is a Discourse forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before sharing or liking posts. New members are required to enter 4 topics and read 15 posts over the course of 10 minutes before they are permitted to post themselves.  Snapshot  Snapshot is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of UNI delegated to the address used to vote.  Governance portals  A governance portal can be accessed through the Uniswap interface. Votes can be delegated and cast through this portal. There are also several other governance interfaces that users can use to cast their votes*:  https://custody.coinbase.com/ http://unigov.eth.link/#/ap https://app.boardroom.info/  *Note: this is not a complete list, and should be updated by the community frequently. Below is a preliminary draft for the Uniswap governance process, detailing exactly where these venues fit in. These processes are subject to change according to feedback from the Uniswap community. Phase 1: Temperature Check \u2014 Discourse/Snapshot The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. To create a Temperature Check:   Ask a general, non-biased question to the community on gov.uniswap.org about a potential change (example: \u201cShould Uniswap governance add liquidity mining for XYZ token?\u201d). Forum posts should be labeled as follows: \u201cTemperature Check - [Your Title Here]\u201d. The forum post should include a link to the associated Snapshot poll.   Voters use Snapshot to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage. Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 3 days.   That\u2019s it! You\u2019ve just started the process of gaining support for a proposal. At the end of the 3 days, a majority vote with a 25k UNI yes-vote threshold wins. If the Temperature check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site. If the Temperature Check does suggest a change, proceed to Stage 2: Consensus Check. Phase 2: Consensus Check \u2014 Discourse/Snapshot The purpose of the Consensus Check is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal. To create a Consensus Check:   Use feedback from the Temperature Check post and create a new Snapshot poll which covers the options which have gained support. This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but should include the option \u201cMake no change\u201d or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.   Create a new topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cConsensus Check \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d. This will alert the community that this topic has already passed Temperature Check. Any topics beginning with Consensus Check that have not passed Temperature Check should be immediately be removed by community moderators. Make sure that the discussion thread links to the new Snapshot poll and the Temperature Check thread.   Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to vote on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Consensus Check topic. Share your view point, although try to remain as impartial as possible.   At the end of 5 days, whichever option has the majority of votes wins, and can be included in a governance proposal for Stage 3. A 50k UNI yes-vote quorum is required for the Consensus Check to pass. If the option \u201cMake no change\u201d wins, the Consensus Check topic should be closed by community moderators. Phase 3: Governance Proposal \u2014 Governance Portal Phase 3 \u2014 Governance Proposal \u2014 is the final step of the governance process. The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the Consensus Check and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal. To create a Governance Proposal:   Write the code for your proposal, which can be voted on through any Governance Portal. More resources can be found here. All proposed code should be audited by a professional auditor. This auditing process could be paid or reimbursed by the community treasury.   Ensure at least 10 million UNI is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated UNI to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.   Create a topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cGovernance Proposal [Proposal Number] \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d and link to any relevant Snapshot polls/discussion threads as well as the code audit report. Proposal numbers should be in a \u201cUP###\u201d format. For example, the first Uniswap Proposal should be titled UP001, the second UP002, and so on. Topics that begin with \u201cGovernance Proposal\u201d that have not successfully passed the Temperature Check and Consensus Check stages should be removed by community moderators.   Call the propose() function of the Governor Alpha to deploy your proposal.   Once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place in the gov.uniswap.org forum. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed. Soft governance: The process described above lays out a structure for those wishing to host a formal vote on a particular issue. However, governance systems also require a degree of \u201cmetagovernance\u201d discussions that inform the direction of and the implementation processes behind policy, but which don\u2019t qualify as policy themselves. The community may discuss new ideas and strategies for governance \u2014 including changes to the process outlined above \u2014 in the \u201cGovernance-Meta\u201d category. On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes. Governance Glossary:   UNI: An ERC-20 token that designates the weight of a user\u2019s voting rights. The more UNI a user has in their wallet, the more weight their delegation or vote on a proposal holds.   Delegation: UNI holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder\u2019s own address. Note that delegation does not lock tokens; it simply adds votes to the chosen delegation address.   Proposal: A proposal is code that is executed by the governance contract through timelock. It can replace the governance contract, transfer tokens from the community treasury, or perform an almost infinite range of other on-chain actions. In order to create a proposal, an address must have at least 1% (10M UNI) of all UNI delegated to their address. Proposals are stored in the \u201cproposals\u201d mapping of the Governor smart contract. All proposals are subject to a 7-day voting period. If the proposer does not maintain their vote weight balance throughout the voting period, the proposal may be canceled by anyone.   Quorum: In order for a vote to pass, at least 4% of all UNI (40M) must vote in the affirmative. The purpose of this quorum is to ensure that the only measures that pass have adequate voter participation.   Voting: Users can vote for or against single proposals once they have voting rights delegated to their address. Votes can be cast while a proposal is in the \u201cActive\u201d state. Votes can be submitted immediately using \u201ccastVote\u201d or submitted later with \u201ccastVoteBySig\u201d (For more info on castVoteBySig and offline signatures, see EIP-712). If the majority of votes (and a 4% quorum of UNI) vote for a proposal, the proposal may be queued in the Timelock.   Voting Period: Once a proposal has been put forward, Uniswap community members will have a seven day period (the Voting Period) to cast their votes.   Timelock: All governance actions are delayed for a minimum of 2 days by the timelock contract before they can be executed.     strong text[quote=\u201cashleigh, post:1, topic:7732, full:true\u201d] This document is a suggested process for developing and advancing Uniswap Governance Proposals.

If the Temperature check does not suggest a change from the status quo, the topic will be closed on the governance site. If the Temperature Check does suggest a change, proceed to Stage 2: Consensus Check. Phase 2: Consensus Check \u2014 Discourse/Snapshot The purpose of the Consensus Check is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal. To create a Consensus Check:   Use feedback from the Temperature Check post and create a new Snapshot poll which covers the options which have gained support. This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but should include the option \u201cMake no change\u201d or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.   Create a new topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cConsensus Check \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d. This will alert the community that this topic has already passed Temperature Check. Any topics beginning with Consensus Check that have not passed Temperature Check should be immediately be removed by community moderators. Make sure that the discussion thread links to the new Snapshot poll and the Temperature Check thread.   Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to vote on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Consensus Check topic. Share your view point, although try to remain as impartial as possible.   At the end of 5 days, whichever option has the majority of votes wins, and can be included in a governance proposal for Stage 3. A 50k UNI yes-vote quorum is required for the Consensus Check to pass. If the option \u201cMake no change\u201d wins, the Consensus Check topic should be closed by community moderators. Phase 3: Governance Proposal \u2014 Governance Portal Phase 3 \u2014 Governance Proposal \u2014 is the final step of the governance process. The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the Consensus Check and can consist of one or multiple actions, up to a maximum of 10 actions per proposal. To create a Governance Proposal:   Write the code for your proposal, which can be voted on through any Governance Portal. More resources can be found here. All proposed code should be audited by a professional auditor. This auditing process could be paid or reimbursed by the community treasury.   Ensure at least 10 million UNI is delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find a delegate who has enough delegated UNI to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf.   Create a topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org titled \u201cGovernance Proposal [Proposal Number] \u2014 [Your Title Here]\u201d and link to any relevant Snapshot polls/discussion threads as well as the code audit report. Proposal numbers should be in a \u201cUP###\u201d format. For example, the first Uniswap Proposal should be titled UP001, the second UP002, and so on. Topics that begin with \u201cGovernance Proposal\u201d that have not successfully passed the Temperature Check and Consensus Check stages should be removed by community moderators.   Call the propose() function of the Governor Alpha to deploy your proposal.   Once the propose() function has been called, a seven day voting period is started. Ongoing discussion can take place in the gov.uniswap.org forum. If the proposal passes successfully, a two day timelock will follow before the proposed code is executed. Soft governance: The process described above lays out a structure for those wishing to host a formal vote on a particular issue. However, governance systems also require a degree of \u201cmetagovernance\u201d discussions that inform the direction of and the implementation processes behind policy, but which don\u2019t qualify as policy themselves. The community may discuss new ideas and strategies for governance \u2014 including changes to the process outlined above \u2014 in the \u201cGovernance-Meta\u201d category. On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes. Governance Glossary:   UNI: An ERC-20 token that designates the weight of a user\u2019s voting rights. The more UNI a user has in their wallet, the more weight their delegation or vote on a proposal holds.   Delegation: UNI holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder\u2019s own address. Note that delegation does not lock tokens; it simply adds votes to the chosen delegation address.   Proposal: A proposal is code that is executed by the governance contract through timelock. It can replace the governance contract, transfer tokens from the community treasury, or perform an almost infinite range of other on-chain actions. In order to create a proposal, an address must have at least 1% (10M UNI) of all UNI delegated to their address. Proposals are stored in the \u201cproposals\u201d mapping of the Governor smart contract. All proposals are subject to a 7-day voting period. If the proposer does not maintain their vote weight balance throughout the voting period, the proposal may be canceled by anyone.   Quorum: In order for a vote to pass, at least 4% of all UNI (40M) must vote in the affirmative. The purpose of this quorum is to ensure that the only measures that pass have adequate voter participation.   Voting: Users can vote for or against single proposals once they have voting rights delegated to their address. Votes can be cast while a proposal is in the \u201cActive\u201d state. Votes can be submitted immediately using \u201ccastVote\u201d or submitted later with \u201ccastVoteBySig\u201d (For more info on castVoteBySig and offline signatures, see EIP-712). If the majority of votes (and a 4% quorum of UNI) vote for a proposal, the proposal may be queued in the Timelock.   Voting Period: Once a proposal has been put forward, Uniswap community members will have a seven day period (the Voting Period) to cast their votes.   Timelock: All governance actions are delayed for a minimum of 2 days by the timelock contract before they can be executed. [/quote]    ",

This allows you to lend and borrow in a way where you can hedge assets during a bull market, gain passive, sustainable, safe returns on your collateral, and in some cases put that capital to use while it\u2019s being lended. I know this is an old post, but you never know! Cheers. ",
