                    "content": " BASE SUMMARY Gitcoin is DAO that makes Gitcoin Grants - a suite of protocols for distributing capital to any EVM based community.  It\u2019s protocols include  Gitcoin Passport - a protocol for creating sybil resistence Gitcoin Grants Registry - a grants storage/retrieval protocol Gitcoin Grants Round Manager - a protocol for easy CLR Funding for any DAO  In addition to Gitcoin Grants protocols, Gitcoin also offers a funding programs - basically Gitcoin Grants protocol as a service. Gitcoin has reinvented itself as a DAO instead of a company.  It now has nearly 100% turnover of talent, governance, model, code from its days as a company in 2020.  BULL CASE  Gitcoin Grants The bull case for GTC is that Gitcoin could be a \u201cback office\u201d tool or protocol for community capital allocation any EVM community out there.  That means any L1, L2, DAO, DeFi Protocol, NFT Project, etc could use Gitcoin\u2019s protocols to supercharge their ecosystem development. According to DeepDAO there is roughly $8 billion in assets in DAO treasuries.   According to CoinGecko there is at least $200 billion in market cap for EVM chains.  According to coincodex there is $7 billion in market cap for NFTs. According to CMC there is $38 billion in market cap for DEFI. In total that is $8 + $200 + $7 + $38 = $253 billion.    Assume 10x growth over the next 5 years, and thats $2.5 trillion in Total Addressable Market.  Assume 0.1% of this market cap is allocated for incentivizing community participation within these markets on a yearly basis, that is roughly $2.5 billion in serviceable market yearly - about 300x-1000x higher than what Gitcoin is doing now.  Gitcoin Passport Gitcoin Passport is a tool for creating sybil resistance on Gitcoin Grants, but also the wider EVM world.  It relies on verifiable credentials to create scoring of each unique identity on a basis of how human each user is. Sybil Resistance is quite a small web3 market at this time, so it is hard to quantify.  But sybil resistance is a hard problem that has eluded computer science researchers for decades.  Similar hard problems being solved are breakthroughs and often have lead to commercial breakthroughs for the people that solve them.  Just as likely is that someone else commercializes a breakthrough and the original persons who addressed the problem is left behind. I think the upside case for Gitcoin Passport is that an ecosystem of sybil resistant dApps are built on top of Passport.  I do not know how to quantify that.  Real world identity is a very foundational part of the state based economy - There is a similar opportunity to become foundational important part of the web3 economy. I think Gitcoin is well positioned to address the sybil resistance problem because it has so much more experience & so much more data to do it than any other web3 project.  Social Capital Gitcoin has a lot of social capital.  With A list personalities like Vitalik talking about Gitcoin comes a lot of legitimacy.  With the funding of A list projects like Uniswap also comes a lot of legitimacy.  Being a leading brand in the ReFi space brings a lot of legitimacy. This social capital is probably Gitcoin\u2019s biggest asset right now.  It is hard to quantify this social capital. There is probably a way to protect, extend, and monetize this social capital - especially if Gitcoin continues to grow.  GTC In my opinion, the bull case for GTC basically boils down to:  Grants will be successful & have $billions/year in capital going through it. Passport will be the foundation of a new sybil resistant economy in web3. Governance rights to manage these systems will somehow become valuable. GitcoinDAO will survive to get to that point.   BEAR CASE There is 1 bull case.  I think there are several bear cases, which I will go through individually below.  Each bear case I think is independent from each other, and the more bear cases Gitcoin can avoid the more likely I think the bull case is.   Gitcoin needs to keep perpetually fundraising to fund it\u2019s matching pool and no recurring source of funding has been found.  This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.   Gitcoin Grants relies on sybil resistence, a hard problem that there is no solution for yet. As long as there is capital to be made by doing so, Gitcoin will keep getting attacked by sybil attackers.  This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.   Gitcoin has a quite large team working for it.  The team is illegible and opaque to outsiders, expensive, and slow to ship useful software.  At times it can seem to me as an outsider that the team misses basic things in their product and go-to-market or seems the team almost tripping over itself.   DAO Governance is hard but important, running a DAO is new territory, and it is not clear that Gitcoin has figured it out yet.  Gitcoin has not explained its competitive positioning publicly or published its 2023 roadmap (like I said its illegible to outsiders) so I am operating with limited information here.   Gitcoin Grants and Gitcoin Passport need to find protocol market fit.  The old product hosted at gitcoin.co showed it can do $6.5 million / quarter in funding.  When will the new protocols flippen the old products in market?  When will they find protocol market fit?  Can they reach the $2.5 billion in serviceable market yearly I identify above?   The bear market will be long and so far has not been kind to GTC.  GTC is required to keep the lights on at GitcoinDAO, and it is not clear where new buyers are going to come from.  The token keeps going down.  Finding a floor for GTC means creating a credible narrative of why GTC is valuable medium and long term and so far is not on track - at least to as outsider.  There is presently no clear narrative or use case for GTC in sight, other than being used to dump on market and fund operations.  This is also an uphill battle.   Of these bear cases, i think number 5 is the most pressing.  Gitcoin\u2019s continued operation depends on the reflexive belief that GTC has value.  Reflexive = Directed back on itself.   Ryan Selkis covers this in the 2023 Messari trends report, heres what he wrote:  \u201cYou might think DeFi protocols are financially set for life, but a deeper look into the com- position of each treasury suggests the opposite. The vast majority of the \u201cvalue\u201d in these token treasuries is coming from the reflexive belief that the market will always absorb the new supply. That may happen in bull markets, but things can unwind sharply when volumes subside. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what happened during May\u2019s market crash.\u201d  If GTC goes to 50-75 cents, then Gitcoin might have a shorter runway than the bear market may last (2-3 years).  Conclusion I was attracted to Gitcoin because it seemed different than many other projects and it seemed like a fun challenge to try and value it. I wrote this post to explain how I as a fan of Gitcoin view it in market.  I am rooting for your success and I hope that these steel-mans of both the bull and bear case are helpful to others too. I wish you success in 2023 Gitcoin! ",

Some minor notes I had:     a33titude:  Gitcoin needs to keep perpetually fundraising to fund it\u2019s matching pool and no recurring source of funding has been found. This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.   To my understanding (and I could be wrong), as Gitcoin shifts from cGrants to the Grants Protocol, it will no longer be Gitcoin\u2019s responsibility to find funding for the matching pool, rather, those running grants programs on the protocol will bear that responsibility for themselves. Now, of course, if Gitcoin continues to run its own rounds on the protocol (which it seems is very likely), Gitcoin will have to figure out where that money is coming from (which may be what you are referring to here).     a33titude:  Gitcoin Grants relies on sybil resistence, a hard problem that there is no solution for yet. As long as there is capital to be made by doing so, Gitcoin will keep getting attacked by sybil attackers. This is an uphill battle, but one that Gitcoin has demonstrated competency at at small scales.   In addition to passports, Gitcoin has the FDD workstream that has experience in active sybil detection. I personally don\u2019t know how they work, but from the reputation they have, it seems they are incredibly competent. Just want to point this out as a method Gitcoin uses to counter the sybil problem.     a33titude:  The bear market will be long and so far has not been kind to GTC. GTC is required to keep the lights on at GitcoinDAO, and it is not clear where new buyers are going to come from. The token keeps going down.

There is presently no clear narrative or use case for GTC in sight, other than being used to dump on market and fund operations. This is also an uphill battle.   Within the same vein as this \u201cbear\u201d but not explicitly mentioned is that Gitcoin has yet to identify a reliable and sufficient stream of revenue, which will be critical to keeping the lights on even if Gitcoin finds some way to make token go up. I\u2019d also add one last challenge for Gitcoin. Within Gitcoin\u2019s mission is to create massive value for the Ethereum ecosystem; however, the more we succeed in this goal, the more attractive it will be for attackers to try and manipulate/influence the DAO. Right now, under the current token voting model, we are incredibly vulnerable to centralized takeover by wealthy attackers. I do not believe that GTC token holdership is super diverse. As in, a large amount of GTC is held by a small group of benevolent actors. Would that be fair to say? @DisruptionJoe @shawn16400 ",

I think there used to be a weekly Grants 2.0 update thread about 6 months ago.  I used to skim those, it was a good sign that the protocols were close to ready.

I\u2019m glad to hear a 2023 roadmap is in the works, but this leads me to another line of questioning. Gitcoin seems to work different than other DAOs I follow.  Instead of working out the roadmap in public on the governance forums, there is somewhere else that a core team does the core work & it happens without community input - then it is posted to the gov forum.  Why are the drafts written behind closed doors?  Don\u2019t you want community input?

Click here     chaselb:  What do you think the difference is between the way the internal contributors view Gitcoin and the way GTC holders (and perhaps other stakeholders) view Gitcoin?   From spending a lot of time researching on the forum, here are my observations: Insiders seem to have a lot more context than GTC holders (eg there is a 2023 roadmap that has not been made public yet).   In a DAO without these information asymmetries there would be no non-public context because all the contributors work in public. Insiders have a lot more ability to navigate the DAO\u2019s resources than outsiders.  Theres a lot of info that isnt listed on the gitcoin.co navigation.  For example , I only found docs.passport.gitcoin.co and showcase.passport.gitcoin.co bc I asked a dev friend to do some diligence on Gitcoin with me.  How do I spin up a Grants instance?  Where are the docs for it?  Why aren\u2019t these resources accessible in the main nav?     From this post series it seems there is friction between insiders who want higher compensation, whereas some GTC holders who want to be more frugal or want to see more progress for the GTC given before giving higher compensation. There seems to be a higher sense of urgency to turn around the declining token price from outside GTC holders than from insiders. There is generally a lot of visioning and thoughtleadering that goes on on the gov forums, but not a lot of execution visible.  How is the DAO doing against it\u2019s purpose and essential intents?  Against it\u2019s competitors?  I have no idea, insiders don\u2019t publish that information - so thats why I do here and here. For insiders, GTC Holders are seen as dispensable whereas insiders are not.  For GTC Holders, there is no alternative to just going along with insiders.  There is no competition or market for DAO leadership.  Want an alternative approach to software development?  Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with GPC and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to fraud defense?  Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with FDD and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to marketing?  Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with MMM and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to partnerships?  Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with PGF and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to DAO Operations?  Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with DAO-OPS and it\u2019s leadership.  ",

Voting really occurs on Snapshot and then Stewards move that vote on-chain (through Tally) according to the decision produced by Snapshot.

I think the internal contributors are realizing what you are describing and trying harder, but in my opinion, it is ridiculously hard to get context within the GitcoinDAO, which does not bode well for a community-governed project. I think part of the conflict as well is that it is unclear what the decision-making jurisdiction is of the core contributors (CSDO and the Workstreams), and what is under the jurisdiction of the community (Steward Council, Stewards, Token holders, non-holding community members). If you (or anyone else) are interested, I think creating a guide on where to find this context (if it is known, or getting it from internal contributors if it isn\u2019t) would be a worthy project that I\u2019d want to help out with.

This is not just a problem for Gitcoin but for pretty much all DAOs in general.

Instead of working out the roadmap in public on the governance forums, there is somewhere else that a core team does the core work & it happens without community input - then it is posted to the gov forum. Why are the drafts written behind closed doors? Don\u2019t you want community input? [These 2 questions apply for the roadmap, but more broadly too!]   You\u2019re totally right. This work is not happening here in the forum. A lot is happening in CSDO, or collaboration channels in Discord. The Discord roles for these channels appear to be set to DAO-Core (about 90 folks), so again, confirmation that this is the DAO in-group that\u2019s workshopping much of this material that is then presented on the forum mostly for ratification. Given you\u2019re across the current attempts that are being made to broadcast the in-group work as it happens (CSDO Notes, etc.) and you\u2019re still feeling like Gitcoin is operating like a black box, I think you\u2019re finding the best way to get involved and inject debate into this process with your posts here. This feels somewhat unsatisfying, and I\u2019d like to see us do better to source input from GTC holders like yourself. I can see 2 options:  Find ways to bring folks like yourself into the more real-time work that CSDO and the DAO-Core team are doing. These could be via the existing Community Calls or special open sessions with the CSDO.

I am transparency / decentralize maxi and I have come to see both as a journey - which I am not sure any DAO has gotten quite right just yet.  But hey, DAOs all still a new experiment so I tend to dial back my natural impatience and nudge every chance I get. Recall that we do spend quite some time developing our Gitcoin Steward network where the stewards are given monthly updates, do deep dive critiques on draft budgets, and ask questions direct to workstream leaders.  Also a feature of that meeting is open air time where a steward can ask any pending questions they like.   We also turn to those same stewards to vote on proposals and help determine the future of Gitcoin. Becoming a steward is open to every(single)person and we welcome anyone with (or without) GTC.   We strive to make that venue as helpful as possible to all stewards - but as said, we are on a journey and we still have lots to learn. Become a steward here!    Introducing Stewards Governance \ud83e\udd16 DAO Governance and Vision       Over the last two rounds of Gitcoin Grants, we\u2019ve brought in a number of grantees and contributors in the community to help us think about how to better fund digital public goods and serve the web3 community, whether by stopping sybil attacks, improving grants discoverability, or more precisely defining the kinds of public goods that can be funded.

                    "content": "I think the biggest thing that we are missing in a mutual grants focus is that we have workstreams currently thinking about how to create revenue, but no plan on how to invest in their unique knowledge. Workstreams which have been efficient and properly managed their treasury would be great candidates for building for profit businesses on top of the protocol. The current expectation is that revenue from a workstream should go to the DAO treasury, but a less considered option is that it could be kept by the workstream and contractually seen as a SAFE/SAFT type investment allowing the workstream to spin out a subDAO or corp that is profitable AND dependent on grants/project/passport protocols. Why is this better? At the end of the day, for-profit businesses using the protocol will have incentive to pay for the sustainability of the protocol. Giving the DAO more runway doesn\u2019t have the same effect. Imagine we are building a city. We want people to move in, but there are no grocery stores or gas stations. We could subsidize the businesses to startup when they will be at a loss, but hoping more people will move in when the necessary services are there. My suggestion is that we encourage our workstreams to spin out for profit businesses. If we can create a model to successfully spin out for profit businesses, we will:  Extend runway by having less contributor salaries in the DAO. Workstreams are incentivized to get their own revenue and become sustainable. Use SAFE/SAFT investment to keep stake in ventures (We could sell this if it discourages competition in the future) Shift GitcoinDAO internal public goods funding to be fully governed by GTC holders. As workstreams spin out they create an aqueduct to partially fund the main program and partially fund GitcoinDAO specific needs.  Protocol fees could go back to the DAO treasury or to an aqueduct which drives continuous GTC token holders decisions on the program and which protocol public goods to fund. It doesn\u2019t have to be that no revenue goes back to DAO treasury, just that workstream generated revenue could be used as investment rather than extended runway. Think about it, if we need the extended runway cause there aren\u2019t for-profit businesses using it already, we probably already lost\u2026 Most importantly, we need to reset our essential intents ASAP. They weren\u2019t designed for staying forever. They should be updated every 6 months or so. This conversation has a little more of my thoughts on the essential intents.

This feels a lot like a Mutual Grant, which I just learned has been shelved.  It sounds like some parts of Gitcoin have their foot on the gas + some have it on the brake  In this scenario, what happens to the $2.4 million* that Gitcoin has already put into a workstream like FDD?

At the end of the day, for-profit businesses using the protocol will have incentive to pay for the sustainability of the protocol. Giving the DAO more runway doesn\u2019t have the same effect.   Has the DAO done a detailed analysis of GTC Utility and financial sustainability they can share?  This thread is all over the place.     DisruptionJoe:  Most importantly, we need to reset our essential intents ASAP.   I don\u2019t see anyone in the DAO advocating for this except you.

It sounds like some parts of Gitcoin have their foot on the gas + some have it on the brake    Yes. However, the mutual grants that were considered were totally new startups or DAOs (DeveloperDAO, PrimeDAO, Wonderverse) or exchange of governance and holdings (Radical). My thinking is that we didn\u2019t subsidize businesses the users of the protocol would need like:  a good way to scale grant reviews a way to benefit from economies of scale in grant reviews an evaluation ecosystem for grant or user reviews an appeals insurance for users and grants freemium sybil defense with upgraded features  Which brings to the next point:     a33titude:  In this scenario, what happens to the $2.4 million* that Gitcoin has already put into a workstream like FDD? Is that part of the SAFE/SAFT? *estimating this amount $400k/quarter for 6 quarters. $400k * 6 = $2.4 million [but the actual amount may be different as the budgets have fluctuated a lot]   I don\u2019t think it is about the $$$ already given, though I\u2019m sure some disagree. i think it is about the following scenarios  a workstream manages their treasury well and makes profit a workstream applies for a grant outside of gitcoin that overlaps with gitcoin work a workstream finds and sells revenue generating services  Instead of returning these to the DAO treasury, these funds should be the future investment. Basically, anything you make while the DAO is still subsidizing your business. That said, I think workstreams should try to spin out profit generators with their knowledge and expertise, but the workstreams may still exist until their core problem is solved.     a33titude:  Has the DAO done a detailed analysis of GTC Utility and financial sustainability they can share? This thread is all over the place.   Not that I know of for GTC utility. There are a few good ideas and some modeling for specific ideas, but it isn\u2019t like we aren\u2019t sharing them publicly\u2026 they are just ideas between some people that haven\u2019t gained traction to the level of publicly sharing. Some even come from supporters, but not contributors. I\u2019m comfortable sharing half-baked ideas, but not everyone is.     a33titude:  I don\u2019t see anyone in the DAO advocating for this except you. Is there broad consensus around this in the DAO and if so when is it happening?   I know there are others. CSDO has been putting it off the last couple months, but I believe we have this on the schedule to address soon. And like last time, it will be debated on the forum. ",

I am grateful for Gitcoin and the thoughtful team that has enabled so much impact to be achieved. That said. There\u2019s a step back to give to understand what does value mean. If we are here for speculating with the economic return GTC can provide to holders, then it\u2019s the path ahead. But what if value is something different? Honest questions, I\u2019d appreciate getting answers from others: Does Gitcoin need to speculate with GTC to survive? Can Gitcoin maintain itself with other ways, such as a fee for the stewarding and promotion of funding campaigns, or working group units that compete and collaborate to deliver value to the ecosystem? A blessed 2023 for all you champs who are using your living time to do good in the world. ",

I think you have an excellent view on things and I personally loved the way you \u201czoomed in\u201d on some issues like 3, while also \u201czooming out\u201d on others like 4. Idk why my intuition tells me that we will have a big positive surprise this year in store for GTC. I think that the team didn\u2019t want 2 attach a use case for GTC, just to create utility in a kinda \u201cforced\u201d and web2ish way. My view is that there are 3 scenarios that could take place:  Extended bear market in which GTC could go as low as 0.1$ Mixed sentiment market, meaning that the bears and bulls will fight until the next halving (2024) in which case GTC could go to 0.25-0.75 $ range. Pseudo bull market, GTC goes over 2$  GTC use case is not an easy one, but I\u2019m sure that the contributors, WS leads, SC and stewards(like me) are actively strategizing, thinking, etc ",
