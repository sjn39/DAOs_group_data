                    "content": "Hello, just wondering if derivatives contracts were ever thought of as a viable option for collateral. For example, short contracts on the price of ETH could help keep the system stable during price swings. I\u2019m unsure of the array of options with derivatives these days\u2026 I used to trade on centralized deriv exchanges back in the day but wondering if decentralized token-based deriv exchanges have emerged which could be viable. I guess my question is: Are there tokenized deriv contracts that exist yet which can be held in smart contracts which could be used as collateral in the MKRDAO system? If not, could the MKR governance team somehow create accounts on centralized exchanges like FTX/Bitmex/etc and hold contracts there in a semi-trustless or accountable way? ",

Derivatives can run the gamut from extremely risky 100x long/shorts to extremely tame 1x long/shorts. 1x short contracts on BTC, ETH would be a great balance to BTC, ETH collateral that MKR already has. The only issue with derivatives is trusting a third party (and oracle) to correctly officiate the settlements. That\u2019s why I brought up both centralized deriv exchanges (custodial trust required) as well as decentralized programmatic deriv options which only require an on-chain price oracle and are relatively trustless. But I\u2019m unaware of any decentralized options existing at this point. Theoretically, short contracts could replace the need for stablecoin-based collateral in the future. ",
