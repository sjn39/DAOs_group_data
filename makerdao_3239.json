I wish to continue in this role and be paid by the Maker Protocol. Core Unit ID GovAlpha (GOV-001) Facilitator Name and Information Name: @LongForWisdom Permissioned Address: 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69 Note that this permission address should not be used directly for budget implementations, but rather as a keyholder in a relevant multi-sig wallet that distributes the Core Unit Budget. Facilitator Commitment Plans and Goals Quarterly Goal Setting and Review Rather than provide upfront plans of what I intend to achieve as a Facilitator, I feel that it makes more sense to remain flexible and set and review goals on a more regular basis. You can find an example of this approach in the first GovAlpha budget proposal. The cryptocurrency and DeFi space is evolving rapidly, and I don\u2019t believe that setting goals for MakerDAO or for GovAlpha beyond that horizon makes sense at this time. With each budget proposal for GovAlpha, I will aim to produce a set of quarterly goals, and a review of the previous quarter\u2019s goals, and how successful the Core Unit was at achieving them. Future Growth A key longer-term goal is the growth of GovAlpha. There is already more governance work than can be comfortably covered by one person alone. Onboarding additional facilitators and contributors will allow GovAlpha to tackle a greater number of projects and improvements to governance at MakerDAO. Flexibility Due to the stated goal of onboarding additional facilitators to GovAlpha, any personal goals I have for the Core Unit will need to be tempered by the input of others, and likewise, other facilitators will have their own goals and priorities that I will need to accommodate. I believe this will result in a stronger and more focused Core Unit overall. Transparency Transparency has always been a key consideration when I have taken action as a Governance Facilitator in the past, possibly to the point of frustration for some members of the community. I will aim to continue this trend in the operations of GovAlpha. In addition to the quarterly goals discussed above, any spending from the Core Unit budget will be recorded and publicized. Additionally, I have recently been reserving an hour each week for the Governance QA Meeting. This gives any participant in MakerDAO a chance to engage with me directly and ask questions and discuss any concerns they may have. I will continue these meetings in the future, as despite the inconsistent and low turnout, I have felt them to be valuable for those that have attended. As a Core Unit Facilitator of GovAlpha, I will of course continue to be accessible on the regularly used communication channels including Rocket Chat and the official forum. I will also consistently attend the weekly Governance and Risk Meetings, even if I am not running the meeting myself. Credentials  Long-standing member of the MakerDAO Governance Community Contributor credits on multiple core governance MIPs.

My dedication and commitment also include:  I will never lose sight of the main role of the facilitator which is to assist the Risk Core Unit deliver thorough risk analysis, as well as an open window of communication of such analysis to the community. I will make myself available to the community as much as possible. My presence and commitment will be a motivating and guiding factor for the community. The ability to work with different groups of individuals who may at times have different beliefs, ideas, and expectations. I will represent the Risk Core Unit in weekly community calls. Remove the Admin workload for the Risk Core Unit to enable our Team to focus and deliver. Provide the risk management framework, processes, and responsibilities in order to keep the Team consistent, continuous, and truthful. Documentation detailing analysis, execution of risk management practices, planned work and upcoming targets. Maintain and organize a roadmap of the Risk Core Unit intended path of execution. Encourage community participation as much as possible. The best weapon of a facilitator is to ask a lot of questions. I will remain humble and position myself to always answers questions to the best of my ability. As facilitator I will create bridges between the Community and the Risk Core Unit.     Motivation  I have been a motivated and dedicated Risk Domain Lead since October 2020 and worked on various risk related tasks at Maker since early 2019. Since then, I have been passionate providing Risk Parameters analysis for the greater good of the Maker Community. My aim is to provide recommendations and discuss how to approach risk and uncertainty to support decision-making. With the support of my fellow Risk Core Unit teammates, my approach will bring a humble attitude to risk and the possession of the truth. I believe a good facilitator builds trust with those he/she is working with. For creative ideas to emerge, trust and openness should exist. I also believe that facilitators should develop a strategy and a plan that addresses the MakerDAO needs, and works towards attaining the overall goal. As the facilitator for the Risk Core Unit, I will deliver this commitment and devotion to the Maker Community.
