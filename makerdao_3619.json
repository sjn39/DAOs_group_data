For more information on the changes to this MIP, please see:  Collateral Onboarding Core Unit Update Collateral Onboarding Core Unit Launch Pod Session   Specification  Motivation MakerDAO and the ecosystem is faced with several critical supply side issues. The pace of innovation in the cryptocurrency industry is outstripping the protocol\u2019s ability to keep up with it. To thrive in today\u2019s market, we not only have to maintain our first mover position, we need to continue increase the velocity of innovation to prevent an existential threat lurking amongst current DeFi players, the multichain future, and entry by traditional finance. And how do we systematically attract and onboard the trillions of dollars of assets represented in the real world? We are off to a good start as the community is experimenting in different asset classes, with more approaches in the pipeline. Overall, the future growth and long-term success of the protocol is dependent upon the inclusion of a wide range of off-chain assets. In my opinion, one of the highest priority is to have a Core Unit solely focused on the productization of collateral for the Maker protocol. Since the Multi-collateral Dai launch and with adoption of the collateral onboarding process by the community, we have done a great job with the resources available to us. Now, it\u2019s time to greatly improve upon our capabilities to reach one trillion Dai and beyond. Focus is the only way to reach and exceed our supply goals.  Mission  Scale the Dai supply and manage the product collateral lifecycle.   Vision  Provide product management, engineering, & technical services for onboarding and offboarding collateral. The Mission and Vision involves two mandates:  Productization of collateral Building a sustainable Core Unit    Core Unit ID CES-001  Core Unit Name Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit  Proposed Core Unit Facilitator @monkey.irish  Core Unit Mandate The Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES) is a crucial service for growing the supply of the MakerDAO ecosystem and central to the protocol\u2019s success. What follows is an explanation of the Core Unit mandates.  Productization of collateral  The mandate of productization contributes to the protocol\u2019s success as we follow best practices in software Product Management.  If the goal is decentralization, and it is still a goal at this present moment, then Core Unit diversity and parallelization is a key part of that strategy. A one-to-one translation of teams from the Foundation into the DAO is the first logical step. Currently, you\u2019re seeing a lot of this happening. So, what\u2019s the next step? It\u2019s the product oriented, holistic approach called \u201cproductization\u201d. The implementation leads to consolidating the collateral product and technical functions into one Core Unit. It\u2019s really simple to say and a little more challenging to implement. Some of you might have worked on teams where cross-functional value was delivered with each software development iteration. I\u2019m referring to a Product Team where you take a holistic approach in delivering incremental features. You can think of these features as specific collateral or collateral classes as they collectively roll up into the Product. As more Core Units adopt the Product Team approach, this leads to parallel development efforts on the same code base. CES plans to assist and leverage the work the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES) is undertaking to enable a scalable approach to support parallelization. This work will help create more diversity and reduce bottlenecks and dependencies on any one Core Unit. All products have a lifecycle and need to be continuously assessed and managed. Our collateral is no different. The health of a product will also be tracked using metrics and dashboards to read out current statuses. For clarity, some of the best practices of Product Management are:  Collaborative ownership of the product vision Managing the product roadmap Scoping and estimation with engineering teams Managing the product and iteration backlogs KPIs, OKRs, and reporting Communication and collaboration with stakeholders  I\u2019d also like to make sure I am very clear on one point. This Core Unit is a highly-collaborative effort and it\u2019s a partnership, not competition, with the key stakeholders in the DAO. CES will continuously work with Protocol Engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real World Finance, and other critical stakeholders to:  Identify and determine CES technical responsibilities Manage ongoing priorities with the product vision and roadmap Develop processes that work for all stakeholders Build competency, quality, and trust with the MakerDAO ecosystem  Key Takeaway  Productization is the way we scale the Dai supply.   Building a sustainable Core Unit  The mandate of sustainability is to ensure CES is a profitable entity for business continuity.  Managing our supply and collateral is the foundational activity that makes everything about the protocol work. It is important not to lose sight of this and to be grounded in the realities of what is required to create a sustainable, systematic, and repeatable practice. This is a top priority for the Core Unit. One of the key aspects of every Core Unit is that of business continuity. As we know, some Core Units carry a high degree of risk if they do not operate properly. The question is, how do we architect a level of Core Unit stability as volatility continues to hit our industry and markets? The solution is to look at Core Units as a regular business. Something to point out before we move forward. Functions within every business, entity, or organization, regardless of structure, have two general categories: 1) cost centers and 2) revenue generators. CES is specifically focused on supporting revenue generation for MakerDAO. This is an important point since future compensation, incentive, profitability, and sustainability models will be explored based upon performance. As a business, the top operational aspects are:  Product-market fit Attract and retain the team Expense management Profitability  Product-Market Fit Since CES is a revenue generating function within MakerDAO, it is critical we have product-market fit for our collateral. Citing the article above, the top four reasons a new company fails are:  No market need Ran out of cash Not the right team Got outcompeted  The first and fourth bullets are addressed with the productization mandate. The second and third are addressed by building a sustainable Core Unit. Attract and Retain the Team With a decentralized workforce, the challenge is to attract team members while organizing around a common mission and vision relating to the mandates of the Core Unit. I will also mention aligning with generally accepted MakerDAO objectives is also helpful. The cohesion of the team and support of the mission and vision are critical elements in retaining the best people. The challenge CES faces is hiring permanent team members with a background in software architecture and/or software engineering with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain fundamentals, security architecture, consensus algorithms, formal modeling and verification, and smart contract Solidity/Ethereum development experience. We seek to balance the needs of the community, collateral objectives/outcomes, and the Core Unit to attract, hire, and retain top talent as it relates to compensation and incentive structures. While individual incentives are important, incentivizing someone to achieve something, especially as a team, is much more sticky and can lead to better retention. As we establish CES, incentive models based upon contribution and performance will be presented to the community. Expense Management Runway is a critical aspect with a new business venture since it gives a team time to execute on the vision and strategy. Controlling expenses while building the right product-market fit is a delicate balance. CES will operate on a funding model where the DAO allocates funds for periods of time. For example, an initial funding allocation for the first six months of operation then quarterly, semi-annual, or yearly after. The first tranche of funds will go into business formation, establishing the CES team, and productizing the collateral. See MIP40 for additional detail. Generally speaking, month-to-month employee relationships are more costly and can introduce volatility. The goal is to move away from the transactional nature of a group of contractors to a model where the Core Unit has a shared vision and common goals along with incentive systems that support teamwork. Funding and runway are also incentives to retain the team. Due to the shortage of qualified engineers in DeFi, we will be looking to attract product people and senior developers from outside of crypto and blockchain. Many people from other industries will find it challenging to commit to a month-to-month relationship with CES. Therefore the CES runway will introduce more stability and help as a recruiting and retention tool. Profitability As the CES team and business model is established, the Core Unit will focus on profitability. Only when a business entity is profitable and has the necessary reserves does it have a chance to survive a prolonged downturn in the market or industry. Given the importance of CES and having the necessary reserves, in the way of profit, leads to business continuity and sustainability. See MIP40 for additional detail. Key Takeaway  CES is a business venture that becomes a profitable entity.

I mean, I experienced the challenges first hand so I get it. So, this is a new team. Based upon the team I build will determine what is possible with crypto native and RWF onboarding. Yes, right now, just about everything is different. We have to get past everything being a one off and build an assembly line for onboarding collateral. This isn\u2019t going to happen overnight and all the work the RWF team and others are doing are very important to figure out that model. First priority, we\u2019ve got to get the crypto native assets onboarded in a systematic way. And everything changes with our current collateral types so we have to keep up with that too. That alone is a lot of work and it can happen in parallel with all the experimentation with real world assets. ",

Initially, there is a heavy collaboration between multiple core units and then a migration of identified responsibilities into the COB once trust and competency are built between the two teams. As an example, when I spoke with Nik and Marc-Andre about their feedback, they would still be doing the code reviews since it\u2019s their asses on the line if something happens. As trust builds, we\u2019ll determine what makes sense for the COB to take over. The same would be true of Risk and Smart Contracts. Would you be able to share with the community open-source/transparent work that has been done during these years? This has been rolling out for a while. When Cyrus left, a community Risk team was formed. The Mandated Actors was another move. The Collateral Onboarding guides that were published not so long ago is another data point. The current collateral onboarding process was an iteration of what we created internally at the Foundation. It\u2019s pretty much all out in the public source. As for me, I\u2019ve been in the middle of the collateral onboarding during my tenure at the Foundation. My role as an onboarder of a core unit and Facilitator is about organizing, facilitating, building, and leading the COB. I\u2019ve been doing this work for three decades. ",

Otherwise, your team will just add to the current backlog.   I want to react specifically to this point because it is a common misunderstanding. I added the silent assumption here. This problem does not have to be. The reason is simply because no one has seriously looked into making smart contracts work parallelizable. What we do know, is that there is most likely some low hanging fruit there that should unblock a big chunk of the bottleneck. In the case of collateral onboarding, it is particularly easy to create sandboxes that make it relatively safe for multiple development teams to deploy code. PE Engineering can design the sandbox so that it\u2019s secure and guaranteed to remove tail end risk. Others can then plug into it with limited permissions. We\u2019re still working on our risks & opportunities analysis, but SES is most likely going to make this a priority, because we believe it may be the number one hurdle to scaling the ecosystem today. It is perfectly possible to prepare for this by the time a core unit of this size is spun up. I would say that if we haven\u2019t done it by then, we\u2019re not doing well in terms of competition because other protocols definitely will. We haven\u2019t published much details yet, but this status update from a month ago should give a rough idea. ",

But this way of thinking doesn\u2019t hold water considering that even Rain and Lev - literally the two greatest geniuses in all of crypto who basically built the entire maker protocol by themselves - made some serious mistakes with the emergency shutdown module. The solution is to move past branding specific people as special infallible genius devs (which im sure nobody actually wants to be), and instead opening up and branching out by relying on open, scalable processes and external audits by top tier auditing firms (which the genius devs can help identify and vet). For collateral onboarding I think it can be quite simple such as: At least 1 audit and 2 weeks bug bounty for a small debt ceiling, 2 audits and 1 month live bug bounty for a large debt ceiling and 3 audits + 3 months liveness and bug bounty for unlimited debt ceiling (unlimited here meaning the risk team can set the parameters they want without worrying about technical risk factors related to the adapter, oracle, liquidation setup and other things related to the technical collateral onboarding itself). That is of course just a basic example, but this kind of hypothetical process can be extremely scalable, and also be supported and improved by simultaneously making sure we have plenty of super geniuses in the ecosystem that also review and take part in the process - but we can\u2019t put all of our trust in specific individuals, we have to put our trust in open processes because otherwise we will never scale, and then as we stretch everyone thin running on single thread mistakes will start to happen.

The past six months, I\u2019ve been facilitating the Foundation\u2019s dissolution. My roles have been 100% internal focused so I haven\u2019t had a lot of community participation\u2026until now.  While there are some technical challenges (there always are), there is another one with our current governance process as it relates to moving collateral through the system. There is a element of autonomy that is needed, with guardrails, in order for us to scale the collateral onboarding process. To scale, it\u2019s a function of three things: the COB team, the parallel development work (infrastructure), and changes to the governance process that allow for a much quicker, iterative approach when adding collateral. To me, the biggest challenge is attracting, hiring, and retaining the COB team since solving any problem first starts with the people side of the equation. I\u2019ve been doing that for 30 years so I feel pretty comfortable taking that challenge on. ",

I believe we still need those genius senior devs. It\u2019s just the right tool for the right job. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve also proposed using the COB as a training ground for newer devs into the Maker ecosystem. As an example, working with SES using a feeder system to allow new devs to cut their teeth on the protocol. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity for those folks to work on classes of collateral that have already been figured out and are more mechanical. For those new collateral types where innovation is required, we\u2019ll need our best people on the job to figure it out then pass the work onto less experienced devs. ",

What I think you are proposing is a unit composed of approximately 1/3 Engineering, 1/3 Oracles, and 1/3 Risk, which then (hopefully) are able to turn the collateral onboarding process from creating unique pieces of art into something more similar to serial production. Initial thoughts from my side - mostly just brainstorming  Right now Maker has a collateral onboarding pace of about 2 types per month, but as far as I know, nobody has done any serious attempt to debottleneck the existing process. So since you propose this CU it must be assumed that either debottlenecking will not happen or that the results will be poor - otherwise this CU makes no sense. Thoughts? Possibly you will have to wait with growing this CU until the market crashes and more devs will be available I guess you have probed around for support on this CU, but I think what would convince people would be a description of the process flow of the as-is situation, and then a description of the process flow within your proposed CU. Right now you are just promising to employ more people?  ",

Overall, what I am proposing is an iterative process. When I managed collateral onboarding within the Foundation, it exposed the almost the same issues we\u2019re having today in the community. Today, it\u2019s more important than ever we figure out how scale the process. There is a low probability our current collateral onboarding system will meet our long-term needs. The strategy involves three components: building and retaining the team, scaling the infrastructure, and creating autonomy. I appreciate your thoughts around the team. Right now, we have a number of dependencies within other Core Units and this creates the bottlenecks. The team I am proposing to build will have elements from all three groups in order to streamline the process. I want to be clear this is a collaborative effort between the Oracle, PE, and Risk Core Units. There are always challenges in hiring people in any market. The goal is to focus on what\u2019s best for the protocol. On the infrastructure, it\u2019s critical to take a holistic approach in developing our products. I think that is one thing missing to date. My background is delivering software with a product orientation. Functional approaches are important and make sense in some situations. In this case, we\u2019re going to need to figure out how to have multiple teams working at the same time on smart contract functionality. My feeling is that the whole project will be in jeopardy if we don\u2019t do this one thing. Plus, it\u2019s really important to diversify responsibilities within the DAO. When it comes to autonomy, all decisions are structured to go through Governance today. This alone will prevent the entire protocol from scaling. How do we modify our structure to accommodate a higher level of growth, while working under reasonable guardrails, and without introducing unreasonable risk into the system? Collateral onboarding provides a great opportunity for us to figure this out since debt ceilings are an automatic limiter of the system. Please keep your comments coming as it\u2019s going to be a collective effort to make all of us successful. ",

                    "content": "Hey @monkey.irish, in general I think having a Core Unit to focus on collateral onboarding is a good idea, will hold my thoughts on that to the end. Initially I\u2019m just going to focus on and hopefully provide some useful comments to the contents of this MIP.     monkey.irish:   Uphold the MakerDAO core principles.    I don\u2019t really understand how some of these principles are directly relevant to collateral onboarding.     monkey.irish:  Driving Dai Adoption \u2013 The inclusion of diverse and desirable collateral types in the Maker Protocol increases the supply, attractiveness, market usage, and ultimately, the demand for the Dai stablecoin.   Collateral Onboarding isn\u2019t really very related to DAI adoption. The one tenuous connection is that it exposes those wanting to take leverage on that collateral to DAI. The rest: supply, attractiveness and market usage either don\u2019t drive DAI adoption or aren\u2019t really addressed by collateral onboarding.     monkey.irish:  Scientific Governance \u2013 The diversity of the collateral assets of the Maker protocol reduce the portfolio\u2019s risk inherent in relying heavily on a single collateral type. The natural byproduct of diversity helps maintain the stability of Dai.   This doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with scientific governance?     monkey.irish:  Gradual Decentralization \u2013 By deploying MakerDAO capital to build, scale, and leverage the collateral onboarding infrastructure, we normalize the process and costs associated with onboarding collateral.   Again, not sure what the statement has to do with gradual decentralization. Feels a little like you had the principles in front of you and are trying to fit them to the collateral onboarding unit. Imo it would be better to just say: We want to really push and support pillars 4 and 5 in these ways. Rather than trying to connect 2 and 3 to this unit when they are only tangentially related.     monkey.irish:  The growth will not happen organically. If so, we will lose the competitive edge of our first mover advantage as we\u2019ve all grown to know and love.   Not sure this makes sense back-to-back? \u2018If so\u2019 - what are you referring to?     monkey.irish:  The heart of attracting individuals and organizations to the protocol is a strong incentive system. If high-quality collateral is onboarded, compensation is made when demand kicks in which leads to growth. No demand, no growth, and no payment.   Not sure this really says much? In what way is high-quality collateral connected to a strong incentive system? What does compensation have to do with demand have to do with growth?     monkey.irish:  What is high-quality collateral? The question can be answered when looking at the asset economics, risk, and DAO principles. The Collateral Onboarding is the core guardian of how collateral makes its way into the protocol.   This is more of a \u2018content\u2019 comment rather than a \u2018presentation\u2019 comment. I\u2019m not sure that we want a single core unit that is the guardian of how collateral makes its way into the protocol? This doesn\u2019t sound like a decentralized solution. Like, you mentioned economics, risk and the DAO principles, but are you trying to claim that this unit should have the final say on levels of risk, economics and how the DAO principles apply?     monkey.irish:  At times, this will be competitive and that competition is encouraged.   Why is it good to encourage competition in this instance? Competition leads to a race to the bottom, and sacrificing long-term stability for short-term gain. If you turn collateral onboarding into a competition, you misalign the incentives of the risk-evaluation portion of collateral onboarding.     monkey.irish:  At the present moment, the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit plans to use the five DAO principles voted on during the time the Foundation was formed. These principles will serve as a lense to shape our decision making relating to collateral onboarding. Part of the Collateral Onboarding Core Unit\u2019s mission is to be a guardian of the principles to ensure we are being true to our community and stated mandates.   This is problematic, imo, for a number of reasons. First, those principles are old as hell, and very rarely referenced by anyone in the community at this point. Second, that vote took place at a time when MKR was much more centralized than it is now, and had different owners. Third, why exactly is this a part of the collateral onboarding mandate? Being a \u2018guardian\u2019 of these principles has nothing to do with collateral onboarding. The part about being \u2018true to our community\u2019 rings a bit false to me personally too, as you haven\u2019t exactly been heavily involved in the community up to this point - at least not that I\u2019ve noticed.     monkey.irish:  The Collateral Onboarding Core Unit will continuously work with Protocol Engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real World Finance, and other critical stakeholders to identify the initial and future key responsibilities for this Core Unit.   Have each of the core units mentioned here explicitly agreed to work with this core unit in this way?     monkey.irish:  This activity will happen once the initial responsibilities and timeline is agreed upon by the critical stakeholders.   Feels like agreeing this with critical stakeholders should be a prerequisite rather than something you figure out as you go? Like, what if critical stakeholders aren\u2019t cooperative?  To summarize my thoughts after reading this, I would say that this seems like a good idea, but I am less sure of the execution. If I personally wanted to setup this core unit, I would do the following:  Speak to PE, Oracles, Risk and GovAlpha and express my desire to help coordinate the collateral onboarding process and seek to get their buy-in to do this on a trial basis. Setup a meeting each week that covers collateral onboarding that includes the above stakeholders. Provide value to those stakeholders and make their jobs around collateral onboarding as easy as possible by providing coordination, setting expectations and handling communication with the community and collateral partners. Become indispensable to the process. Start hiring individuals to perform the more mundane duties that the existing stakeholders don\u2019t want to handle. Expand the team to take over more and more of the process.  I would probably do a core unit proposal around step 3/4, initially budgeting only for my own time on a 3-month budget, then adding to the budget and responsibilities as I was able to hire. The tl;dr of this is that I would actively provide value, and make myself indispensable to the process, and propose a budget that supported myself doing that, before attempting to onboard additional contributors.

While there could be an opportunity for competition in collateral onboarding, I was more referring to overall competition in the ecosystem. I hoping teams and core units will be selected based upon a variety of factors where hard costs are only one of the components. Generally, there is so much work to be done today, it will take a bit of time before we see real competition. Right now, diversification, like having multiple smart contract core units, appears to be our next step.

If it\u2019s possible to implement a model like this, it could allow us to really scale the system and normalize the hard costs for the core unit. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your question! It\u2019s an interesting one to address. I\u2019ll try to give you as direct of an answer as possible at this time. I\u2019m taking a little extra space to elaborate for the greater good. In short, CES is an engineering services core unit which means that we have the technical ability to execute a variety of engineering functions (smart contract) within collateral management. We offload and consolidate the product management of the collateral functions from the other core units. The actual scope of the work is driven by the roadmap and product backlog. The roadmap and backlog is created based upon feedback and input from key stakeholders of the Maker protocol. Right now, the current backlog is listed in the Collateral Framework and will be expanded upon based upon the needs and prioritization of the stakeholders. The key benefits are to allow for better prioritization, communication, and collaboration and to reduce the bottlenecks. To scale this process, we\u2019ll be enabling third parties, with the appropriate incentives, to onboard collateral and expand the supply of Dai. Bottom line, we\u2019re thinking 100\u2019s of billions and trillions since that is the only way we\u2019re going to scale our protocol with the limited resources available to us. I\u2019m happy to talk with you (or anyone else) directly about the concepts I\u2019m proposing or if there are terms that need further clarification. The longer version\u2026 The main goal of the core unit is to scale the Dai supply and manage the product collateral lifecycle. Inside of that, there are two areas of focus: crypto native and real world assets. The part I believe you are asking about is the crypto native assets. Currently, collateral management is distributed amongst several core units. Since collateral is such an important part of the protocol, the PE, Oracles, and Risk team spend a lot of time in this area. So it makes sense to consolidate product management into one core unit to free the other teams to work on more innovative work. That\u2019s the initial CES priority\u2026as well as to build the team. As far as the innovative work is concerned, you\u2019ve mentioned some of it in your reply. There is also the innovative work in real world assets. Since we are an engineering services group, we\u2019ll have the talent on team and the ability to do the work. I\u2019d love to say, we\u2019ll handle all the innovative work but it\u2019s not that easy. What needs to be worked out is which team feels best equipped to take on the innovative work that comes forward. This will be balanced based upon the workload, domain knowledge, and priority of the collateral type based upon Dai generation or other strategic factors. This is the second priority. Ideally, we need to scale our collateral management and that can only be done by enabling and leveraging third parties and partners. And the incentive models need to be there too. If CES tries to do everything, we\u2019ll become a silo of centralization inside of a decentralized system. So, this will lead to a lot of experimentation which allows us to learn and refine the patterns to enable a wider audience than just the core units to onboard new collateral types. This is the third priority. With all this said, I believe the core of your question deals with the collateral roadmap. Most of what you mention is on the table for consideration although I\u2019m not quite sure about onboarding Dai into other Layer 1s. Roadmaps are driven by product backlogs and this is part of what product management provides. The roadmap will be visible to all and build off of the current collateral onboarding and polling processes. Roadmaps and backlogs are a highly collaborative process and involve the feedback and input from a variety of stakeholders. It\u2019s also an iterative process where priorities change. What we focus on shifts a little on each iteration and that\u2019s by design. It allows the core unit and protocol to respond to the ever changing aspects of our industry. This is a best practice brings forward the learning each and every time we deliver value in our software. Now, let\u2019s dig a little deeper. Where are the HUGE pockets of assets we can turn into collateral? Is it with Alternative Collaterals or elsewhere? How do we want to invest our precious time in onboarding and managing collateral? And how/who has access to these reservoirs of assets? We work in millions and talk in 100\u2019s of billions and trillions. Let\u2019s use the saying, \u201cact as if\u201d, and own our destiny. Only by setting the Trillions Intention and having a concrete plan to move forward will we realize the protocol\u2019s future. I\u2019m enjoying the conversation! Please keep it going and make sure you vote! ",

Many of the concerns raised above are valid, and we can understand why the community leaned \u201cNO.\u201d However, we worry that there may be unintended implications for social norms and expectations around governance (beyond this individual MIP). Some high-level observations:  Onboarding ex-foundation teams was relatively easy. Onboarding entirely new teams feels like a more complex problem; the first attempts may be messy & imperfect processes.  This is generally true of all new ventures \u2013 things feel way messier on the inside than they may appear externally, and that is okay.   Need to balance a high bar for quality with an encouraging environment for new contributors. Trending too far in either direction is suboptimal: should be prudent without \u201cgatekeeping\u201d. Maker governance should hold contributors to account. They need to demonstrate they are executing on their mandates and adding value to continue receiving funding.  Specific to this proposal:  Compensation may feel high but the market for engineers is hyper-competitive. Maker should bias towards over vs. under compensating (within reason), both to frame working for the DAO as prestigious, and to compensate for the novelty risk (relative to a traditional startup). It feels unrealistic to expect that new teams will be able to come in \u201cfully baked,\u201d like the ex-foundation teams were \u2014 anchoring to that norm would limit Maker\u2019s ability to onboard new contributors. Some of the points raised about operational details feel like things for which the DAO should figure out general policies (e.g., multi-sig control & audit responsibilities). They are not existential risks, so bikeshedding them at the level of individual proposals stalls progress and discourages future proposals.  Ultimately, a Collateral Engineering Services team seems like a potentially useful function, this CU proposal feels like a credible attempt to try out new models of contributor onboarding (hiring), and we worry that rejection may discourage potential contributors from making proposals in the future. As a result, we (Paradigm) voted \u201cYES\u201d, but not in such a way as to determine the outcome. We\u2019d be excited to see the CES team incorporate the feedback in this thread into another iteration of their proposal! If anyone would like to discuss the issue further, you can reach us here on the forums, on Telegram @csnoyes, or over email ([charlie, dan]@paradigm.xyz). ",

Still, as a future delegate, I voted \u201cNo\u201d to this proposal. I will now explain why. It had nothing to do with the proposed compensation, nor that the team would need some time to get up to speed. The reason was the operational overlap created where the proposed CES would take over some activities presently in the domain of three CUs - Risk, Oracles and Protocol Engineering. OK - so what? Out in the real world companies reorganize the whole time. Well, I feel the world of crypto might be slightly different with the decentralized nature of the teams making loyalties to some degree more centered on the local group people are working with daily. This has the implication of making overlaps, usually avoided in any organization, especially problematic. If you look at the majority of Maker Core Units, the daily operations have, to the meager extent of my knowledge, been remarkably free of friction when taking into account the high stakes and the dynamic environment. The few cases where I have noticed some sparks have been exactly where there has been some overlap in activities. The proposed Collateral Engineering Services team would not only have some overlap but in seeking to place itself into substantial parts of the domain of three existing and functional Core Units, the overlap and potential friction would be a minimum 3x, likely quite a bit more. Right now I feel that is not such a good idea. Maybe 12-18 months from now it will be different. That is why I voted \u201cNo\u201d to this specific proposal. ",

Leaving this specific proposal aside, my abstract concern is that things have been (relatively) smooth so far because most teams transitioned into the DAO out of the foundation. Of course, there are a finite number of those teams and we won\u2019t have that luxury going forward. Onboarding wholly new teams, especially into cross-functional roles, is going to be higher friction. This is something that every organization struggles with \u2013 from early-stage companies to 1k+ headcount orgs. Maker is the first project to run the decentralized organizational model experiment at scale and that will kind of mean figuring it out as we go along. At the highest level, my point above is that Maker should remain open-minded and bias towards action over indecision, even in the absence of perfect solutions (or potential friction). Again, these are general thoughts, not specific to this or any other individual proposal. ",
