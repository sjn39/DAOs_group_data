                    "content": "As I mentioned on AllCoreDevs #62 I feel there is a potential change in the EIP ProgPow that must be done before deployment.  This stems from a concern voiced by Vitalik on AllCoreDevs #60.  I forwarded my concerns to Hudson so he could forward it to the team conducting the audit, but since there has been discussion of deploying ProgPow without a finished audit then this issue and possible remediations should be discussed outside the audit. In short, at the transition block, 1/3 (or less) of the ethash hash power could be used to stall the progression of the chain.  There are one of two things we could change to fix it. Since ProgPow hashes produce 50% (or less) of the number of hashes per device than Ethash the total difficulty would rise at a slower rate, 50% or less.  To mount this attack the byzantine Ethash hashers would then focus their efforts on publishing new pre-fork blocks with higher and higher difficulties.  Because the byzantine actors produce hashes at twice the rate the pre-fork block could have higher total difficulty with less effort and honest miners may then re-org to the block just prior to the fork.  Emissions are irregular so this may not be able to hold things off forever, but in essence a 33% device pool could mount a 50% hashrate attack aimed at stalling the chain.  This is different from a normal 50% attack in that one generation of blocks has their difficulty measured differently than another generation, and the prior generation can be manipulated. I see two alternate mitigations.  A \u201cdifficulty multiplier\u201d can be applied to the ProgPow blocks when calculating total difficulty.  Either 2x to account for the twice as hard memory access or a (much?) larger multiplier to give heavy weight to progpow blocks. A finality gadget, or on-chain checkpoint. This would be like the beacon chain finality gadget except it would be driven by a multi-sig contract.  However that raises governance issues as to who signs the contract and what hash is chosen.  With the beacon chain it is economic interest driving the selection.  Now I may not have my head fully wrapped around uncles and the modified GHOST implementation that was once in the spec, which is why I want people more versed in the mining process to weigh in. ",

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable. Let\u2019s assume they have 100% hashpower. After 14s, they find a good enough block. After 14s more, they find another good enough block, that may or may not be better. They can\u2019t add these two difficulties together, which is why a chain that actually progresses (and adds block difficulties from N blocks) will always beat one that stands still and just polishes a block. However, a separate concern is:  At fork-time, let\u2019s assume 25% drops off (asics). Also, the difficulty at fork-time will be too high, and needs to adjust. Before adjustment, it will be less ROI to mine ether, and perhaps better spent somewhere else. So let\u2019s assume that another 25% drops off due to bad ROI.  This leaves us with 50% of the hashpower, trying to mine on a chain where the \u201ctuning\u201d between hashpower and diifficulty is 4x (2x for the dropoff, 2x because progpow is harder to mine). This leads to an even longer period before this imbalance will settle. Remember \u2013 miners do not compete directly with eachother, so other miners dropping off does not help the ones remaining (in the short term), they compete with the difficulty threshold. I haven\u2019t checked how long time it will take before the difficulty can re-adjust. One way to solve this problem can be to, at fork block, add a division by 2, so that for that particular block, the difficulty is divided by two. This would instead lead to a short period where it\u2019s more lucrative to mine ether, and would have the opposite effect (which would be good), and not drive miners away from the chain at the forkblock. Also, the \u201cperiod of imbalance\u201d will adjust faster if the imbalance is in favour of the miners than if the imbalance is in the other direction (faster as in wall-time, not number of blocks) ",

The risks of the \u201chairy fork\u201d comes in with the miners, if they take these new higher TDs to mine their blocks off of then we get multiple competing heads.     holiman:  However, a separate concern is:  At fork-time, let\u2019s assume 25% drops off (asics). Also, the difficulty at fork-time will be too high, and needs to adjust. Before adjustment, it will be less ROI to mine ether, and perhaps better spent somewhere else. So let\u2019s assume that another 25% drops off due to bad ROI.  This leaves us with 50% of the hashpower, trying to mine on a chain where the \u201ctuning\u201d between hashpower and diifficulty is 4x (2x for the dropoff, 2x because progpow is harder to mine). This leads to an even longer period before this imbalance will settle. Remember \u2013 miners do not compete directly with eachother, so other miners dropping off does not help the ones remaining (in the short term), they compete with the difficulty threshold. I haven\u2019t checked how long time it will take before the difficulty can re-adjust.   @OhGodAGirl has discussed this issue several times.  It\u2019s about 3 hours.  And the impact on the ice age is that it moves closer 2 weeks per halving.     holiman:  One way to solve this problem can be to, at fork block, add a division by 2, so that for that particular block, the difficulty is divided by two. This would instead lead to a short period where it\u2019s more lucrative to mine ether, and would have the opposite effect (which would be good), and not drive miners away from the chain at the forkblock. Also, the \u201cperiod of imbalance\u201d will adjust faster if the imbalance is in favour of the miners than if the imbalance is in the other direction (faster as in wall-time, not number of blocks)   A solution I presented at AllCoreDevs Berlin, the one time difficulty adjustment.  This won\u2019t address the slower growth of total difficulty under ProgPow.  The slower TD growth isn\u2019t a problem if we can avoid the \u201chairy fork.\u201d ",

Over time they will have better and better blocks, but the new chain gets to keep all the work it\u2019s found, it doesn\u2019t have to discard their old work like the attack block would have to.

The slow down would be worse if the new chain had to \u201cburn down\u201d it\u2019s target difficulty, especially if we let the difficulty burn down naturally.  So a one time difficulty cut of 50% at the fork block would allow the new chain to grow at the  same block per minute rates as before if the same hardware was pointed at the chain. A one time difficulty adjustment also would reduce the impact to normal users, regardless of the potential stalling efforts of old hash power. ",

What you\u2019re talking about is what could be called \u201cthe true difficulty\u201d, which is the combination block\u2019s hash with it\u2019s nonce. What Ethereum uses as difficulty is a function of of the parent\u2019s difficulty and the time. Under the hood, we then check that the true difficulty is above the threshold. So basically the total difficulty is the sum of all \u201cthreshold difficulties\u201d (not the sum of all \u201ctrue difficulties\u201d). So it\u2019s not possible to \u201cpolish a block\u201d indefinitely. The difficulty for block N is already given by block N-1, but if you re-mine block N-1 with an earlier timestamp, you can get a higher difficulty for block N (but only higher by a certain amount).

Needless to point to her bitcointalk trust page and many other pages, it\u2019s all fitting. (there are plenty of links in this other thread, I won\u2019t post them again. DYOR) https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/progpow-audit-delay-issue/3309  talking about the issue on All Core Dev calls  Together with two anonymous people (Mr. Def and Mr. Else). The naivety of the core devs to not even check that, let alone question any of the narratives brought forward, will remain as a lesson how not to do it.  The client developers all decided there was sufficient technical benefits  That says a lot about their understanding of both ASICs and mining economics. The hardware audit will show (actually several independent audits have shown already), that ProgPoW\u2019s promised \u201casic resistance\u201d, lately framed as \u201cclosing the efficiency gap\u201d does not exist.  There was significant benchmarking and testing done over the past year  All of it nice Nvidia marketing material. They didn\u2019t even bother to change their bar charts to make them look more \u201ccommunity like\u201d. It was enough to make the core devs believe, so well done!  and an audit is currently in process, the end result of which will hopefully show the algorithm is technically sound and meets it\u2019s intended goals  Of course not. We can expect the software audit to mostly look at the algorithm as a cryptographic algorithm, as we have seen with the four RandomX audits. The PoW-part of the algorithm is a hardware assessment. The hardware audit will show that the promised benefits (\u201c1.2x instead of 2x\u201d) do not exist. The one effect ProgPoW has is from the PoW change itself, that\u2019s very disruptive and benefits the large farm of the EIP 1057 author whose contracts with Nvidia we don\u2019t know. A PoW change is like an ICO, it\u2019s fitting that the people behind ProgPoW have a deep ICO history.  which means no \u201chijacking\u201d occured.  It was hijacked from the beginning, and persists until today. The motivation behind EIP-1057 is entirely different from what is stated in the EIP text. Welcome to the real world.  ProgPoW seems to have sufficient amount of community support  What was actually measured in these votes - hashrate, distinct human beings, mining pools, capital? Since the votes came out largely in favor of ProgPoW, what does this mean about centralization? Wouldn\u2019t a large majority, in some cases 100%, say something about the state of centralization? On the day this proposal was made (2018-05-03), Ethash hashrate was 265.97 TH at a profitability of 6.22 US cents/MH/day. Happy old days! Today, Ethash hashrate is 178.83 TH at a profitability of 1.51 US cents/MH/day. (numbers from bitinfocharts.com) There probably were never more than a few TH of ASICs on Ethash, and Ethash ASICs haven\u2019t been on sale for a year. I did math to walk through mining economics in the other thread. So if ASICs played a small role in Ethash 15 months ago when EIP 1057 was launched, and are not economical to sell since then, why is there continued pressure to switch to ProgPoW urgently? You cannot think about this hard enough. Will ProgPoW accelerate centralization?  I would actually be most in favor of a soft fork approach (with a threshold of over 90%), as that allows the community to expressly show it\u2019s final opinion through the number of full node clients who enable this change, which is the most \u201cdemocratic\u201d option we have available to us in a decentralized system with no identity layer  It would be far healthier for the Ethereum ecosystem to uncover and investigate the background story of ProgPoW:  Why is the \u201canti-asic\u201d effect less than promised, if supposedly so many \u201cexperts\u201d from Nvidia and AMD were involved. Is it an error in judgment, or is there some other story going on? Who are Mr. Def and Mr. Else? If they are Nvidia employees and Nvidia was trying to exclude Bitmain, Samsung and others, what else does Nvidia plan? Are Mr. Def and Mr. Else engineers, or marketing people? Is it acceptable that fully anonymous people participate in major Ethereum decision making processes? If the authors of ProgPoW are anonymous, what does this mean in terms of copyright or patent claims? Why is the EIP-1057 author working with Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright, and what does this mean for ProgPoW? How many TH Ethash does Squire/Core Scientific control today? What are the contracts between Nvidia and the company of the EIP 1057 author, as well as Squire (Calvin Ayre/Craig Wright company)? Is it possible that Nvidia sells chips at a discount to the EIP 1057 author in return for excluding competitors? Does ProgPoW help with decentralization, or help with centralization?  I think the attack from Nvidia and partners (Core Scientific, Squire) is sophisticated, the largest corporate attack on a coin ever. The Ethereum Foundation needs support in that they managed to at least put order to the process by bringing in independent auditors for both software and hardware. Too bad noone can audit the contracts of the company of the EIP 1057 author\u2026 The EIP-1057 author is already trying to discredit the hardware auditor (\u201cI do have some concerns that someone who has not built crossbars for GPUs will be doing a hardware audit on the ability to build a crossbar in an ASIC - but given the lack of choice due to CoI this seems fitting.\u201d), but hey, she is a hard worker. Looking forward to the audits! Hope Least Authority and Bob Rao crush some of that dark corporate stuff. ",

I hope I am wrong but based on Bob Rao\u2019s credentials, I\u2019m not expecting a lot from the audit. He is a silicon manufacturing and process engineer. Mr Bob Rao doesn\u2019t seem have any GPU\u2019s, SIMD or crypto ASIC design experience. Without some deep expertise in this areas, the results of the audit would be suspect. To support my observations, I point to the following information from some web searches: The only patent I could find in Mr. Rao\u2019s name is DIE WITH INTEGRATED MICROPHONE DEVICE USING THROUGH-SILICON VIAS from 2014 which is unrelated to GPU\u2019s, SIMD processing cores or crypto ASIC design. Here\u2019s his bio from an article in EE Times from year 2002. He has progressed to become an Intel Fellow and the director of an analytical and microsystems technologies at Intel\u2019s technology and manufacturing group. He is responsible for directing the development of advanced analytical tools and methods for microprocessor performance characterization, silicon debug and yield enhancement. Rao also directs Intel\u2019s microsystems and MEMS research and development activities. ",

You first need to identify the liar. The discovery, and innovation, of ProgPoW was that if most of the audience relies on a very small amount of a posteriori knowledge in some field (here: PoW and ASICs), while for the most part having to rely on a priori knowledge, then the best strategy is to aggressively promote one\u2019s own credibility and experience, while discrediting everyone else. This sets the stage for the successful adoption of a hidden agenda, because a posteriori knowledge is the only way to reliably identify the liar. The key mechanism of the attack is neither identified nor understood, and there seems to be limited motivation to change that so far. Maybe the audits will re-energize such efforts. Instead, core devs believe a form of technocracy where numbers, ideas and codes are pushed through some process will lead to the best possible result. ProgPoW is successful these last 15 months not because of their technology, which sucks, plain and simple. They are successful because they have managed to draw attention away from things that are of high relevance to most people, and towards things that are of low relevance to most people. ",

As an outsider, the entire hardware audit process seems rather secretive and nefarious compared to the open process used in the software audit. The hardware auditor was selected early June but the name was not disclosed until July 26 was per the following medium post. https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/progpow-audit-update-july-2019-ee17718550d The goals and methodology for the hardware audit have yet to be published or made available for community input. Contrast the hardware auditor\u2019s approach with the software audit. Clear goals and processes have been identified and published on both Least Authority\u2019s Github and Medium post, along with having multiple people conduct the audit. https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/progpow-audit-update-july-2019-ee17718550d Which begs the question, why is the hardware process not transparent and why is the Ethereum community not leveraging the expertise of the broader hardware community? Why is there only 1 auditor for such a complex study?     fubuloubu:  Based on his experience, I am sure Bob is smart enough to work through things from a first principles perspective and see if anything smells fishy.   I seriously doubt the one single person can conduct an audit which they are not a domain expert in. That\u2019s like saying because I took economics in school that I can audit the effectiveness of Jerome Powell and the US Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policy in depth and make recommendations to circumvent a potential Trump inflicted recession. How does Bob know when something smells fishy and who is he going to consult? It\u2019s not like Nvidia or AMD publish their register specs or will reveal the weakness in their architectures? Or that Bob has any idea on the future roadmap of Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPU\u2019s. Or is the Ethereum community okay with a backward looking audit that only considers old GPU\u2019s? How is Bob going to prove or refute Linzhi\u2019s Open Chip Design? It\u2019s technically true that math blocks are easy to design but the cores will stall without an efficient cache architecture.    Medium \u2013 29 Mar 19    EIP 1057 (ProgPoW): Open Chip Design for only 1% cost/power increase EIP 1057... How to add ProgPoW to your ASIC. Reading time: 4 min read       Will Bob know how to model the characteristics of ASIC\u2019s designed for TSMC, GF, Samsung, SMIC, UMC, etc. IP and tools when his primary expertise is a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) process (ie. not standard process). Intel fab processes are unique and their foundries have not attracted many fabless semiconductor firms away from the likes of TSMC.     fubuloubu:  Sure, he might miss some nuanced thing that only those with deep expertise might know, but all things considered the audit should be quality enough to tell us if anything is obviously wrong about the implementation that conflicts with design goals, which is the point.   I disagree with the comment because (the collective) you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. Intel and Microsoft are classic examples of companies using industry collaboration for technology migration, specification development and feasibility studies. With each version of DirectX, Microsoft would confer with AMD, Intel and Nvidia for months to understand the impact of each addition or change to the spec/release. While there was fierce competition amongst each company, Microsoft did their best to ensure a level playing field and understand the key issues around the the DX spec and PPA (Performance, Power, Area) impact on the ASIC.     fubuloubu:  I am sure if the audit comes out clean, we will hear all sorts of grief about this, but I would take the results seriously instead of disparaging his credentials.   How do one know the audit is clean (whatever clean means)? With Bob, you are relying on one person to understand GPU and ASIC architectures and 3rd party foundries. What are the checks and balances in the hardware audit to ensure that the conclusions are correct and what is the mechanism to dispute/resolve deficiencies or gaps?     fubuloubu:  I think it was very difficult finding an experienced person without any sort of CoI in this matter, so this may indeed be the best we get.   The only thing difficult in selecting the hardware auditor is that the Ethereum Cat Herders didn\u2019t seem to have a clear criteria on what was needed. For a list of GPU and ASIC experts, all ECH had to do was ask on a public forum or alternatively I could have introduced Charles to dozens of people from Intel, Nvidia or AMD or a variety of professors in this space. There are hundreds of people who can do the work without an invested interest or conflict of interest. The best way to do that is to get multiple PoV (like Microsoft) and make an informed conclusion. Here is a list of GPU and ASIC experts from Academia that have the right credentials. And any one of us from Nvidia, AMD, Intel could have helped write the research funding grants for the Ethereum Foundation, be available to answer questions or potentially write Verilog code to synthesize certain functional blocks.

If the security of the Ethereum chain is so important, is it not worth a thorough audit with the right people with the right domain knowledge? Why even publish the audit if you\u2019re not going to hear counterpoints or have the hardware community post their issues? Isn\u2019t that how the open source community works? Or the process confined to software companies who don\u2019t have a vested interest? Here\u2019s an example of a customer funded audit on an ePIC Blockchain ASIC conducted by DA Integrated (DAI). DAI is an ASIC design shop in Canada with 24 employees and over 500+ ASIC designs. https://www.da-integrated.com/projects To view the audit, refer to this link. https://pixeldrain.com/l/o3hi6WtF#item=0 Notice that the auditors did not conduct an in-depth review of the architecture despite having some domain expertise. Even though ePIC had extensive docs (architecture, chip specs, simulations, timing analysis, multiple chip layouts, etc.), the auditors excluded a comprehensive architecture review citing their assessment would not be sufficient despite their domain expertise in memory controllers, 3D and accelerator cores (aka GPU). So I\u2019ll ask, why Bob and ECH is comfortable with a one man audit without domain expertise when DAI, with 24 ASIC designers, graphics expertise and works with all the independent semiconductor foundries, wasn\u2019t comfortable providing a full architecture audit.     fubuloubu:  Lastly, anyone who does not respect the findings of the audit for this proposal absolutely has an ulterior motive and should not be trusted to be telling the truth in further discussion.   I welcome the audit if it will get to the truth using industry experts, as well as, sound methodology and thorough analysis. If the audit has major flaws, then it is not worthy of respect. The flaws may not materially affect the Ethereum community or it could be a disaster. We will never know if the process is not open and not comprehensive. Let me close my long post with the following question \u2026 Would you be satisfied with the process and results of the software audit if one person, who was iOS developer (ie. not domain expert) did all the analysis AND the goals, methodology and constructs were not revealed until the report was done?

I\u2019ve published a crypto algorithm myself (for purely academic purposes) and when it was shown to have less than the intended strength for keys larger than 128 bits, I didn\u2019t do a quick fix and sweep the issue under the rug (even though I had already disclaimed its security from the beginning). SHA-1 will always be broken, so will my algorithm, and so will ProgPoW. You can\u2019t use the same name for an algorithm that produces different results. Especially after being in the wild for so long. The way forward is to choose a new algorithm and deploy it in a reasonable amount of time, not to invoke Schneier\u2019s Law or argue semantics about which rectangle-shaped openings are doors and which are holes.

For reference, I believe that the bitcoin network\u2019s total work per second recently peaked at around 2^67 (140 exahash) per second. So it would require a mining pool with 0.00002% (1 / 2^22) the power of the bitcoin network to exploit. For a very rough idea of the kind of resources we\u2019re talking about, 0.00002% of bitcoin\u2019s current market cap is about $50,000. And Moore\u2019s Law is still in effect for this kind of parallel computing. Is there a good reference for this exploit being minor? EDIT: I\u2019m not aware of the exploit requiring 2^64 storage, but at $15 a terabyte and let\u2019s say 8 bytes per slot, that would cost about $2.2 billion, or 5% of Ethereum\u2019s market cap or 0.015% of China\u2019s 2019 GDP.
