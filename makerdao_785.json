Paragraph Summary The Events Core Unit will handle planning, organization, and execution of MakerDAO branded events.  Our vision is to use an exhaustive list of themes, visuals, set dressing, technology and branding to carry out events to the highest standards for the MakerDAO community.  Specification  Motivation  The Absence of Maker It has been identified that MakerDAO currently has no event presence at crypto conferences.  This lack of presence has a negative impact on Maker\u2019s brand.  Maker as a Household Name MakerDAO must have an outward presence at crypto events.  This must be a more strategic approach than previous events.  The events must include outward branding of Maker and its products creating a unique experience utilizing various set dress branding techniques such as physical logos, artwork, LED light installations, branded visual content, projection mapping, and digital promotion.  Everyone who attends the event will leave knowing they were at a MakerDAO event. An additional advantage of these events will be the large and highly visible brand awareness towards the crypto developer community in attendance.  Core Unit ID EVENTS-001  Core Unit Name Events  Core Unit Mandate  Mission To provide the best MakerDAO branded event experience to the crypto & Maker community including industry professionals, influencers, and enthusiasts.  Vision EVENTS-001 is a team of passionate creative professionals with extensive experience in event organization and a high level of technical experience in LED Lighting, Visual Installations/Animation, and branding. The team will leverage these skills to elevate the industry knowledge and awareness of MakerDAO and its products through a series of events held at various international locations.  Strategy The Events team approach is to execute 5 MakerDAO events per year.  Three of these events will be considered \u201cmajor\u201d events.  A major event is targeted at high attendance conferences.  The major events will focus on new branded themes utilizing visual animations, LED lighting installations, projection mapping, LED logos, and internationally recognized artists.  Apart from the organization and promotion of the event, there will be a high focus on seamless integration of visuals, lighting, and music to create a high-level event experience. Also included in our strategy are two \u201cminor\u201d events.  The target of these events is to host at a time in between major events.  The focus will still be outward branding, music, and visual elements but will be a scaled-down version of the major events.  The team would reuse visual themes and LED elements from the major events.  The musical element would utilize a local artist to keep the cost and scale of the event down. Branding visuals is a large focus of our strategy at these events.  Some examples of these elements the team plans to implement at the events are as follows:  BPM sync branded visual animations for use with LED video panels or traditional projection LED branded logos Synchronized LED wristbands to the visual and music elements 3D LED pixel mapping,  create the effect of a 3D hologram type effect which will include branding elements Addressable LED lighting installations Projection mapping of branded elements Complete synchronization and integration of LED Logos, house lighting, and installations with visual and music elements   Launch Pad The events can also serve as a launch pad for new Maker products.  The Events CU can assist the promotion of products by adding the branding or incorporating the product launch into the theme.  During the event planning, we would work closely with any CU\u2019s which wish to take advantage of this to assist in the success of their product launch.  Event Documentation  Photos Event documentation plays a big part in contributing to the CU strategy. For each event, a photographer will be hired to photograph the night/attendees. The photos will be used for event recaps and future promotion on social media platforms. An example of these photos can be found here, which were captured from the Maker ETH Denver event.  Videos For Major events, a videography team will be hired and coordinated to capture the event. The based output from the videographers will be  3 fully edited recaps of the night. A one-minute recap and two- thirty-second recaps.  These would be used on social media as a post-event recap and also for future event promotion.  The video team hired for the Maker ETH Denver event produced the following three videos. One-minute recap: Maker Daivinity Promo 1 - YouTube Thirty seconds recap 1: Maker DAIvinity Promo 2 - YouTube Thirty seconds recap 2: Maker DAIvinity Promo 3 - YouTube  Pilot Event  ETH Denver Summary During the 2022 ETH Denver conference, the first MakerDAO branded event \u201cDAIvinity\u201d was trialed at The Church Nightclub to great fanfare.  The team planned and executed an event full of Maker branding including LED logos, digital Maker & DAI branded animations to the attendance of 1.000 people.  Additionally two internationally recognized DJs were curated for the night, Miss Monique & Sean Tyas.  Since the event, the buzz from the community has been unanimously lauding, with Bankless even giving the event a formidable shout out.  Venue ETH Denver gave a great opportunity to host the MakerDAO event at the famous Church venue.  The venue is internationally acclaimed and recognized in the DJ community.  1334\u00d71999 180 KB   LED Branding The event included strategically placed Maker and DAI LED logos throughout the venue.  964\u00d71280 177 KB   699\u00d7816 542 KB   Visuals & LED Bracelets  The Church featured LED video screens throughout the entire venue, offering the team a great branding opportunity for MakerDAO.  At the DAIvinity event, the team hired and coordinated with a visual animator to create custom Maker & DAI branded animations as well as a library of more abstract sequences for the night. Mapped to video screens lining the main venue floor on 3 sides the visuals created a panoramic experience that was controlled live through the entire event to closely sync the music, visuals, and custom procedural effects and content. In addition to the visuals, DMX-controlled LED bracelets were given to the guests.  These LED brackets were completely synced with the music and the colours of the visual content.  The bracelets can be seen featured in the recap videos.  2022/2023 Planning To achieve the CU mandate of 3 major events and 2 minor events the following are the proposed locations for the 2022/2023 fiscal year.  Major Events The major events are targeted to the largest attended conferences.  These have been identified as the following;  ETHCC - July 19-21, 2022 DEVcon (Bogot\u00e1, Colombia) - Oct 11-14, 2022 ETH Denver - Feb 2023  Note that these locations are only proposed and not final.  If CU\u2019s agree that a major event should be moved to another conference then the Events CU will update accordingly.  CU\u2019s will need to request a change of location with a minimum of 3 months in advance due to the logistical planning required for a major event.  Minor Events The 2 minor events are planned in between the major events.  The Events team will consult closely with the Maker community and other Core Units to determine the most effective locations. Attendance to minor conferences is uncertain until 1 to 2 months before the conference so the Events team will have to adjust accordingly.  During the incubation of this Core Unit, ETH Amsterdam was identified as a minor event location.  The event is currently being planned and executed during the date range of April 20-24, 2022.  Partnerships The Events CU plans to leverage partnerships with other protocols for these events.  The partnerships will allow for cross-promotion and cost offsetting of the CU budget.  From the cross-promotion aspect Maker will be able to tap into the partners\u2019 audience,  this will allow for broader exposure and interaction with a different audience Maker may draw by itself.  The partners for the event would be expected to cost split the event sub budgets with the Events CU.  The split ratio would be discussed before the event during the planning phase.  Maker would always retain a majority share to ensure the event is Maker focused.  Creative and operation control would always remain with the Events CU.  An example of the potential cost reduction impact to the CU budget is highlighted in the DAI budget MIP40c3-SP66 under the Partnerships section.  Core Unit Team The Events CU team has been carefully curated to include expertise and skills to execute the ambitious vision of the MakerDAO events.  First and foremost is precision organization and execution of all aspects related to the events.  The Event Manager must be highly effective at communication and planning while remaining flexible to accommodate and resolve any unforeseen issues during the event execution.  The Event Manager will be the first point contact for event personnel and contractors.  This will ensure communication is consistent, clear and effective. The goal of the Events team is to be as vertically integrated as possible which is why the team has included a mechanical engineer role in the CU.  The engineer will be responsible for all technical aspects and coordination of visual elements, LED lighting and other event installations.  The engineer will additionally be responsible for the design and manufacturing of set dress, including LED lighting.   Safety analysis of rigging/installations would be performed by the engineer to ensure compliance with any local safety requirements or authorities.

Adding together, it comes out to be around $250,000 per event\u2026 Is this industry standard?   Maybe the team mentioned in the proposal but in case where big events are difficult to host especially due to external factors like a new pandemic, would the team modify the budget to be smaller?

What I\u2019m curious is if there is any reason a CU set up is not optimal in adverse market environments like pandemic lockdowns, harsh bear markets where protocol/team budgets are cut for travel/attending events (hopefully neither comes true). If the CU event budget is dynamic where we can reduce if necessary (i.e 3 events vs 5 or magnitude of the type of event based on the reality of the market for events) then I think the CU pros well outweigh the need to a hire an on-demand/agency set up. But overall supportive of this team. ",

I have mixed views of doing another CU unit.  The first is that Maker is rapidly approaching higher expenses than revenues and if this trend doesn\u2019t change rapidly Maker could find itself deciding how to find funds.   The second is that decent public relations events do tend to help spread the word so I feel like these are important to consider from a Maker marketing strategy and perhaps from a community happiness perspective. The question is whether such events could be handled by Strategic Happiness\u2026 Also as others have asked what is going to be the flexibility of budgeting here.   I expect this and other CUs are going to have to figure out approaches to create significant budgetary flexibility while still being able to supply the required functionality. So how is this CU going to be able to function if it only gets 1/2 or 1/4 of the funding it wanted?  Can it? I think this same question is going to be needed of all CUs btw. ",

Sentence Summary The purpose of this sub proposal is to allocate 50,000 DAI for the MakerDAO event in Amsterdam scheduled between April 20-24 20\u2026     You may see the costs in this SPF proposal to produce the event above ($80,000.00 / event). You may compare them to the proposed core unit budget proposal ($250,000.00 / event) to see the per event cost discrepancies (+$170,000.00 / event). You can also see there is no comparable solicitation or market comparables from other providers in that spf request. The core unit proposal and budget includes the additional cost of full time Dai wages and a significant MKR budget for two parties.The core unit budget retains two people full time to produce events for the DAO. They are paid at market rate on top of actual production costs, which we presume are comparable to that EthAmsterdam SPF proposal. It seems a bit unorthodox to hire two people full time to do events. Not saying it isn\u2019t a lot of work, simply that, the usual arrangement would be an outside contractor managed by existing CU/ CU budget or a SPF fund.  Note, this is the exact structure we see above and used to great success. This approach is a better fit,  has more appropriate costs and does not burden the DAO with ongoing obligations. Why fix something that isn\u2019t broken? Core units come with obligations. We just saw the headache of offboarding a core unit, let\u2019s be pragmatic in reviewing core units. Core units are one tool in our toolbox. No need to use a hammer on a screw when we have a screwdriver. If there are more reasonable ways to structure arrangements to meet our objectives, let\u2019s do that. ",

                    "content": "@Doo_StableLab, let me address your questions; \u201cWhy does the team want to be a CU instead of consulting entity?\u201d Post-DAIvinity there was a discussion with some of the Maker team of the best direction forward to continue hosting Maker events.  The scope of the events being planned requires a full-time commitment from the team.  One original proposal was to incorporate the budget and team into an existing core unit.  It was determined due to the scope of budget and already high workload of existing CUs that the best path forward is to create a new CU.  That way we can have a secure budget and full focus on these events. \u201cIn terms of budget, thank you for the detailed break down. Adding together, it comes out to be around $250,000 per event\u2026 Is this industry standard?\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure how your $250,000 per event figure was derived.  If you look at our proposed DAI budget the annual total with contingency is $898,150.  The contingency is there only to act as an emergency buffer.  For the following calculation, I will remove the 15% contingency as more than likely this will be returned to the DAO.  What I calculate is 781,000 divided by 5 events, $156,000 in a nutshell.  Now, this is presented as a worst-case scenario, there will be opportunities to save during the event planning.  One example was at DAIvinity the artist budget was $20,000 and after negotiation with the artist management the cost ended up being $15,000. Also as I mention on the budget MIP there is the possibility to partner with other protocols for these events.  We can determine their share of the expense and offset the cost of the event.  Any unused funds would be returned to the DAO. \u201cMaybe the team mentioned in the proposal but in case where big events are difficult to host especially due to external factors like a new pandemic, would the team modify the budget to be smaller?\u201d Yes if there is the issue of a new pandemic/strain that affects the ability to host larger events then we can determine the best strategy forward such as scaling down events and adjusting the budget accordingly.  As @jenn touches on in the post below the budget/events can be scaled due to unforeseen circumstances.  Ideally, this is not the case and at this point, we remain positive and plan for a world transitioning into the post-pandemic. ",

So if you divide by 5, that\u2019s $242,750. Which is close to $250k. But if the team believes that it should be more within 150k range that the team proposes, the team should edit the budget to fit that.

Branding is notoriously hard to get direct metrics of effectiveness, but there are effects none-the-less. As someone who was at ETH Denver I can tell you first hand how much people were talking about DAIvinity. Associating Maker with positive thoughts in the minds of the industry is the goal of these events. It gets people thinking and talking about Maker which can indirectly lead to many downstream benefits such as hiring, getting on podcasts, etc. I understand we are in a bear market with revenues drying up, but this is not the time to let off the gas. Instead we need to aggressively grow revenues (will be releasing a plan for this soon) and increase spending for growth along with it. Running killer events is one of the many things we need to be doing to remain relevant. ",

I can provide a more detailed line by line if you would like but would need some time to convert to a Markdown table.     Category Budget Amount (DAI) Actual Amount (DAI)     Travel (5 People) $4,500.00 $5,471.98   Accommodations/Food (5 People) $3,500.00 $3,858.85   Set Dress (Venue Branding, LED Logos/Installations, DJ Equitment Rental, Lighting Rental, New Visual 3D & 2D Stock, Visual Renderfarm, Plugins/Software) $12,250.00 $12,026.71   Labor (Event Manager, 4 Contractors) $10,750.00 $10,750.00   Venue/Hospitality $25,000.00 $26,450.86   Music/Photography/Videography $20,000.00 $15,000.00   Misc (Shipping, COVID Tests, Onsite Tools/Equipment, Overhead $4,000.00 $5,530.00   Total $80,000.00 $79,088.40    There are a few things to note with this budget;   The labour paid is not aligned with the actual work put into this event.  As @hexonaut has stated we have been friends for many years.  The event scope started simply as a need to have an event at the ETH Denver conference.  @leggevents quoted his labour based on something simple.  After discussion with the maker team, the event concept quickly evolved into a larger scope than originally anticipated.  I ended up joining the event team to assist @leggevents.  I was paid as a contractor but again not the correct rate for the work that was involved.  To create DAIvinity it took @leggevents and me 3 months of solid work to organize and create the branding experience everyone witnessed.  This is not meant to be a complaint at all as there are no regrets from our end on the additional work as it has brought us to this proposal of continuing to support MakerDOA in future events.  I just want to highlight the effort and discrepancy you will see between this budget and the CU budget.  The CU budget has to be aligned to reflect the actual costs and labour of such events.   DAIvinity would be considered a major event under our proposal.  The sub budget for major events is 110,000.  30,000 higher than DAIvinity.  The reason is after reviewing costs from DAIvinity and anticipating future events I have allocated more money.  These events will be held in different locations around the world and potentiall more expensive cities.  As such higher costs of travel/accommodations, venue rental, currency exchange and contingency needs to be accounted for to have a one size fits all solution.  But in cases where we host another event at ETH Denver, it is anticipated that the event would not cost 110,000.  In turn, returning unused funds to the DAO.   I don\u2019t have the breakdown of which CUs contributed how much.  @hexonaut would be able to provide this. \"So how is this CU going to be able to function if it only gets 1/2 or 1/4 of the funding it wanted? Can it?\" I assume this refers to the possibility of an extreme bear market where certain measures may need to be taken to protect MakerDAO by reducing budgets.  As a half budget, yes in theory this could be accomplished.  The result would have to be a scaled-back qty of events such as 1 major and 1 minor.  Or say 3 minor events you could get around 1/2 budget.  This would not be ideal from our perspective as the lower qty of events might not give Maker the same benefit as more consistent events. As a 1/4 funding in this situation, I would say no it would not work as FTE would have to be scaled back to part-time and in turn, could create an employee retention issue. ",

I gave some feedback to @PonJerry, together with the other contributors.  Regarding the MKR framework we developed, here are all the details. TL;DR: using this framework, contributors can reprice their MKR if the price was to fall, up to 30% (similar to quitting and rejoining). They would lose the unvested MKR, though. So Governance needs to know the maximum amount of MKR that the Core Unit using this framework would cost. ",

(Okay, I get it a little\u2026  ) Organizing an event from the US, thousands of miles away, is not reasonable or cost effective to me. It\u2019s more reasonable to do local parties with a local event organizer than to travel the whole thing around the world. There are professionals everywhere, you just have to find them when you need them. Don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t shy away from the money. Since the protocol started generating revenue, there has been a widespread perception of relying on the revenue side and not dealing with the expense side. And I think we should. This whole system is too new, too young to put a massive strain on the expenditure side in such an uncertain market. Not yet. And it\u2019s important to plan a sensible, prudent, long-term, sustainable expenditure side. Just some ideas here: for example, we could share these party costs: lets do a joint party with the Ethereum guys, or with one of the DEX partners. Half the cost, double the fun.  Or, (I don\u2019t know how to do it) somehow generate revenue from the party, for example by allowing the organizers to generate revenue during the event. Remember that if we overrun the costs, the party is over.  And when the party\u2019s over, nobody wants to pay\u2026 ",

I would like to bring to light the amount of foresight and preparation that goes into an industry leading event. If you want to throw an event that will have impact on the industry (DAIvinity) you need to plan months in advance. One factor is booking the venue. This must be done way ahead of even an inkling of interest for an event and have multiple backup options in place. If a venue is worthy of hosting a Maker event, be assured that the dates are in overwhelming competition. This is not just within the crypto industry, but also competing with all musical/corporate events in the area. Without the venue secured there is little an outsourced events company can do on short notice (without the DAO paying an extortionate amount to compensate or to the demise of the Maker brand due to a poorly planned event).

There is coordination and planning involved in securing a venue and managing other contractors. Hence, this is why defining a budget in advance specific to each event is necessary. Regardless of whether an internal or external party is planning the event, planning is required. This planning is complimentary with the use of an SPF and the appropriate proposal/RFP process. Using a proposal process secures fair economic terms for both Maker and the events vendor. No bid contracts are not normal in events. In any professional organization or under federal grants, you would be required to engage in a vendor selection process, which includes proposals, sourcing quotes, and a justification for the final selection. Any time a vendor is given a no bid contract, a sole source justification must be filed. These sole source justifications are the exception, not the norm, and are reviewed with scrutiny. There are a small set of circumstances where a sole source justification may be appropriate and a no bid process used. These are, for example, when there is a special skillset required, special technology, secret / top secret clearance, logistical constraints, etc. None of those conditions apply under a case like this for recreational commercial event production. MakerDAO does not need an events core unit. As far as this thread goes, there has still been no reasonable response as to why you need to be onboarded as a core unit, rather than as a vendor as you have been to date. Additionally,  the economics of the proposal do not seem to make sense as presented. These numbers are far off from your own past performance ($250,000 vs 80,000), and still inexplicable after you adjusted your previous numbers to meet the new proposed rates ($250,000 vs $156,000). To be more clear, this budget leaves $376,000.00 per year in additional compensation for two core unit members. Please bear in mind, this ~$376,000.00 of comp is in addition to your base comp, which is already included in the $156,000.00. These numbers would make you the best compensated nontechnical contributors in the DAO, beyond Gov Alpha, Risk, SES, etc. As you can imagine, these numbers are also quite far from market comparables for event production. Stick with what works and be positive. We have already seen positive results at a generous and practical spend from your proposed team. It does not make sense for Maker and MKR holders to lock in two full time employees on top of these production budgets.  Maker does not yet know its own demand for events. Moving forward, I would suggest continuing to use the SPF framework collaborating with other CU as you have been to great success. There is no evident business case under which this core unit proposal makes sense, especially when considering both the underlying economics and the actual present needs of MakerDAO. Your best bet to succeed is not to ride one early success, but instead to build a track record as a long term, reliable partner of the DAO. ",

                    "content": "    MadShills:  The current method produced the Daivinity event to great effect, why fix what isn\u2019t broken. Appropriate Costs You suggest Daivinity would have cost 110k instead of 80k. That is fine, so long as Maker doesn\u2019t  have to hire you as a core unit\u2013that is the real issue. The costs of a core unit are still not justified and do not work out (250k vs 110k), plus the additional soft costs, e.g. the headache and governance overhead/risk of being a CU.   To touch on this point first.  I didn\u2019t claim DAIvinity would have cost 110k all in, I apologize if I was not clear on this.  DAIvinity falls into the 110k major sub budget of our proposal.  This sub budget in the DAI proposal does not include compensation for FTEs or Visual Animations contractors.  The actual paid out to our team by the DAO was 80k for DAIvinity.  As stated above there were misalignments on quoted labour vs actual work.  As a result, this leads to people not being compensated properly.  We acknowledge our error but must correct it for future events.  There\u2019s no hard feeling about this on our team as overall it was a positive result and has allowed us to work with MakerDAO to organize these events and participate in Makers\u2019 growth. If I back out the labour cost DAIvinity hard cost was around 72k.  Which is 38k under our major buget sub proposal.  Which if this event in theory was run under the proposed CU budget we would be returning 38k to the DAO, which is fantastic. Thats if this event was run under the propsed CU framework but it wasn\u2019t so we must ask a few question. Could you hold an event exactly like DAIvinity on an 80k budget again? The answer is no.  Moving forward we must ensure everyone involved is compensated properly and the missed cost captured in future budgets. How much should DAIvinity have cost on a pro-rated basis?  This I can highlight with the following table.  For the labour cost, I have prorated the FTEs time involved based on our proposed DAI budget.  Additionally, there were material costs in the set dress budget that are not captured correctly on my actuals posted earlier.  The materials, facilities and tools we used from different employers the team involved current works at.  Some examples were CNC machines, LED tape, Computer-aided design software, Wire/Harnessing and fabrication facilities.  I have highlighted these costs in the table ideally the cost should have been passed onto Maker but instead was offered for free.  Moving forward we need to capture this in our budget as in the future we will not have this luxury.     Category Actual Amount DAIvinity (DAI)     Travel (5 People) $5,471.98   Accommodations/Food (5 People) $3,858.85   Set Dress (Venue Branding, LED Logos/Installations, DJ Equitment Rental, Lighting Rental, New Visual 3D & 2D Stock, Visual Renderfarm, Plugins/Software, Added $5000 from DAIvinity costs for free materials, Tools & facilities provided by contractors) $17,026.71   Labor (Event Manager, Engineer, Visual Artist, 2 Contractors), Pro Rate for Actual Labour based on Events MIP Budget  $88,250.00   Venue/Hospitality $26,450.86   Music/Photography/Videography $15,000.00   Misc (Shipping, COVID Tests, Onsite Tools/Equipment, Overhead $5,530.00   Total $156,057.54    Would any professional contracted events company quote 156k for an event exactly like DAIvinity?  Again this answer is no.  We are not an events company, we are a team of highly talented and qualified individuals from backgrounds such as Event Management, Engineering and Visual Animation. We have come together to offer our talent to MakerDAO.  As DAIvinity showed we can deliver on high-quality branded events which are impactful and beneficial to Maker. How much would a contracted experiential agency charge for DAIvinity? That\u2019s a harder number to determine as only an experiential agency could give you a proper number.  An experiential agency would automatically markup any final cost problem in the realm of 30 percent.  Additional services which are vertically integrated into our team such as branded Visual Animations, LED logos, DMX controlled lighting and bracelets would have to be outsourced by any agency.  The rates on these would be much higher than our team produces because as @MadShills highlighted contractors/freelances demand a premium.  My rates as a contracted engineer when i do work like this is $150/h, yes very high (The FTE compensation in the DAI budget is not based on this rate).  The visuals involved with DAIvinity would normally cost 75k to produce directly through an animation studio (sourced from our animator).  If the experiential agency is coordinating this then they usually add a %15 production fee to the animation studio rate.  Since DAIvinity included international DJs generally an agency would contract this out to a talent agency,  again having a higher cost than our team was able to achieve by direct communication with artist management. Highlighting these additional costs my educated guess would be around 300k-350k. I apologize if this is getting long-winded but there is much to cover. There has been mention of using a local contracted events company (in fact you want an experiential agency) as a more cost-effective solution.  This would limit the ability for Maker to host effectively branded events.  We feel this is not a good approach for several reasons.  One is due to the cost stated above contracting out an event like DAIvinity to an experiential agency.  Another issue is due to the varity of event lcoations it is difficult to source an agency that can handle the coordination of multiple events worldwide, again demanding a premium price if this agency was found.  The result could be Maker hiring a different agency each time losing continuity of events and would essentially need to pay for all branded content all over again. We feel that an internal Event CU is the best and most cost-effective solution for Maker to move forward with the vision of holding multiple branded events though out the year.  From a content side, the team can ensure consistent and effective branded content at these events.  From the cost side having an internal team save all the markup and high agency fee associated with an event like DAIvinity.  Our team can work closely with other CU to ensure the consistency, quality and integration of product launches into events globally.     MadShills:  The costs of a core unit are still not justified and do not work out (250k vs 110k), plus the additional soft costs, e.g. the headache and governance overhead/risk of being a CU.   Could you please clarify your 250k vs 80 comment.  I guess i fail to understand what this is refering to.     MadShills:  To be more clear, this budget leaves $376,000.00 per year in additional compensation for two core unit members. Please bear in mind, this ~$376,000.00 of comp is in addition to your base comp, which is already included in the $156,000.00.   Again if you can clarify as it is not clear where this number is coming from. ",

                    "content": "Perhaps I can add some colour as someone who was involved with coordination for the previous event. First and foremost I would say that the status quo is unacceptable. Currently we have almost no presence at any of these events. At most a Maker-only event was being hosted (which was awesome and I loved it!), but these type of events do not help at all with outward brand presence. Furthermore these types of things need to be coordinated and organized by the other core units which often falls outside their mandate. The status quo leaves core units picking up the slack with teams that are already completely overworked. Being able to offload this work to a talented group is invaluable not only for doing a quality job, but also the resources it frees from other core units that were previously needing to deal with this out of necessity. It is my view that not only should we have an Events core unit, we should be looking to expand the team to cover all things involved with in-person events. We currently have no booths, no sponsorships, minimal speakers at all of these crypto conferences. This is very basic stuff that is currently falling through the cracks. If you haven\u2019t worked in a company of this size before these numbers may seem large, but our expenditure on marketing and brand awareness is currently basically zero and this will increase it to only 1% of recurring revenues. This is still way outside the norm. I think it\u2019s easy to write a post on here throwing out an idea of hiring contractors to do this, but who is actually going to do this? These sort of problems need to be solved now and we have 2 talented individuals who are here right now to solve this problem. Is the cost too much? I happen to think it is reasonable after seeing what was involved and the reaction of the people who attended, but obviously that can be debated. In general what the DAO needs right now is talent and a lot more of it. We do not get there by cutting costs. We get there by making strategic investments in people who can deliver quality results. I get that times are a little tough with the bear market right now, but I still happen to believe Maker is in a great position for the RWA explosion that is coming. We need to be preparing for 10x\u2019ing our revenues instead of worrying about what is sustainable based on current revenues / expenses being projected out 4 years. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your analysis, yes we are all here trying to discuss what is best for the DAO.  That is what is great about this protocol. Ok lots of math here, I like math. (Does that make me weird, probably) Let me first start by saying I believe there are some errors in the calculations presented and the interpretation of the budgets.  So please allow me to highlight;     MadShills:  Projected Cost of Daivinity by Internal Events Team, Dai including FTE Time: 110,000.00   This statement of $110,000 with FTE labour for DAIvinity is incorrect, I believe this is the second time I have had to correct this.  The 110,000 figure is from the major event sub budget within our main Dai budget.  This does not include FTE costs.  As stated previously the pro-rated DAIvinity cost with FTE labour was 156k.  The only way you can run DAIvinity within a 110k budget is if you do not pay anyone which is not a very professional approach.     MadShills:  Quarterly Dai Budget (with contingency): $224,537.50 Annual Dai budget: $ 898,150.00 Annual MKR Budget assumed at 2k/MKR (121.3 * 2000): $242,600.00 Total Annual Budget (Dai + MKR w/ contingency): $1,140,750. 00 Projected Cost of Daivinity by Internal Events Team, Dai including FTE Time: 110,000.00 Spend retained by core unit per event, dai (Quarterly): $114, 537.00 Spend retained by core unit ( dai + MKR annually w/ contingency): $700,748.00 Excess compensation per core unit FTE (dai + MKR with contingency) : $350,374.00   \u201cAnnual MKR Budget assumed at 2k/MKR (121.3 * 2000): $242,600.00\u201d This is incorrect Please let me explain, If you refer to MIP40c3-SP66 this highlights our vesting schedule.  The 121.3MKR you reference is the MKR Expenditure Cap (Annual).  This is not actually what is being paid out to FTEs.  This is a value that is derived based on a formula in the SES document here.  Now it is my understanding that this value is used by governance as allocation of maximum.  This includes potential new hire, wage increase etc.  Perhaps I should not be listing this number, I am new to this so I am following the formula set out in the SES document and other MKR budgets.  Someone, please correct me if I am wrong. The actual MKR being requested is 40.6 MKR per year, so 20.3 MKR per FTE.  Again this number was derived from the SES document.  Is this too high or low? maybe I can not say, if others want to give feedback on this number please do.  I am just following a preset formula. Saying that I must adjust your numbers to reflect the correct use of the MKR budget. Annual MKR Budget assumed at 2k/MKR (40.6 * 2000): $81,200 I will honour your opinion of the fair market value of 2k per MKR for the rest of this post,  true value around $1,750 today and probably dropping since this is the market trend these days.     MadShills:  Four (4) Major events are assumed per year.   We must correct this statements as if you refer to the proposal above and the Dai budget we are proposing 3 major events and 2 minor events.  So 5 total,  this would change you calculations you present above. First, let\u2019s look at this from a pure DAI budget perspective and then look at it with the MKR. We have a couple of ways of looking at this. 1)  If we assume the worst and all the events sub budget, Overhead and contingency are used.  Worst case scenario and highly unlikely in my opinion. Formula:  Net Event Cost=  Total Budget w/contengency / Number of events; =$898,150/5 Net Event Cost = $179,630 2) Let us look at this if we back out the contingency as this is just added in for emergency purposes. This idea is this won\u2019t be used and returned back to the DAO.  Also in the scenario, let\u2019s assume all the event sub budgets are consumed entirely.  Still unlikely in my opinion but still could be the result Formula:  Net Event Cost=  (Total Budget - contingency) / Number of events; =($898,150-117,150)/5 Net Event Cost = $156,200 3)  Again let\u2019s back out the contingency and assume the best case that all major event budgets came in at the same hard cost as DAIvinity (best case).  As stated earlier DAIvinity was a major event that came hard cost (no labour) of $72,000,  so this reflects a saving of $38,000 per major event.  For the minor event, I have no benchmark so will use the entire sub budget here.  This scenario represents a more best-case outcome of this CU operating costs for the year. Formula:  Net Event Cost=  (Total Budget - contingency - 3($38,000 event savings))  / Number of events; =($898,150-117,150 - 3($38,000))/5 Net Event Cost = $133,400 | | I will present the same calculations above with the correct $81,200 MKR per year added to the cost burden.  The results are; Case 1) $195,870 Case 2) $172,440 Case 3) $149,640     MadShills:  Relative costs to outside vendor Projected Cost of Daivinity if contracted by a third party: 300,000.00 Difference between internal core unit costs and third party production costs ($285,187. 50- $300,000.00): $14,812.50   Now the above calculation would modify your result to a range (Including the MKR); $300,000-$195,870 (Worst case)= $104,130 per event savings as a CU vs outside agency $300,000-$149,640 (Best case)= $150,360 per event savings as a CU vs outside agency     MadShills:  The numbers as presented suggest an outside vendor would be preferred. The figures in your proposed budget suggest that this arrangement does not make economic sense or business sense. There are costs to an internal team, and not likely offset by saving 14,000 per event. There are also others downsides for the DAO in having an internal team and risk.   Now as I have shown in my corrections to your analysis I feel this does in fact demonstrate that it is extremely beneficial to the DAO to have an internal Events CU.  In all cases, savings can be realized. ",

Many of the community members and MKR holders here would probably disagree with your claim that the \u201ctrue value\u201d of MKR is 1,750 or below. Many held their tokens through the peak of the bull because of their long-term belief in the project. Objective Data. The above analysis is appreciated, but the core point remains. Those numbers are not \u201creal\u201d numbers, but numbers you have provided. We only have two true numbers to work from: The amount Maker paid for Daivinity: $80,000.00 The amount you are requesting for EthAmsterdam: $80,000.00 Everything else is flower without fruit. Moving forward. If I were in your place, and I was attached to being a core unit, I would prepare the following proposal:   Identify MakerDAO\u2019s actual events needs (qualitative interviews and quantitative figures from core units, including establishing an actual need from the CU roadmaps, get CU budget commitments on long term spend, etc.);   Identify how you could pragmatically meet these needs, what it would take, staff, events, etc, not blank check ceilings and guesstimates;   Produce honest and objective market review of comparables to produce similar events from other providers   Perform a critical but objective review of the competing proposals.   Present a clear over under of your proposal versus competitors as well as the cost benefit in quality, service, etc.   Regardless of whether the cost is over/under, describe what MakerDAO gains and loses from your services.   Clearly define and acknowledge the cons of your proposal and downsides to the DAO.   Prepare a budget that fairly meets MakerDAOs needs based on the above analysis and explains how it may also afford the flexibility a DAO requires.    Business needs come first. If you do the above, it will be a fair deal that naturally makes sense to ratify. You will not need to convince people or be constantly changing numbers, arguing about numbers. The case will be made objectively and factually. As it stands, the main issue is that this proposal has not really demonstrated a need for the products as described. Nobody on this thread has been able to make a clear case for the value of the product (parties) against the significant spend (~$1mm). It seems what is missing may be a fundamental understanding of MakerDAO business needs as well as an acknowledgement of the present market climate. Function follows Form. Without first establishing the business case, nothing else matters. Once there is an understanding of the needs, Maker needs objective data to calibrate your deal. How can it be confident you are offering a good deal without data?  Scientific governance requires real data. In the absence of real data, no analysis can be done, and MKR holders cannot come to a determination. This is why no bid contracts are not usually done in the real world. Remember A good deal sells itself\u2026 ",

Circling back, as MKR vesting is removed, it is of course more attractive to consider. $898,150.00/5 = $179,630 per event. And if they conduct partnerships with other protocols, based on their projection, $113,600 per event which in reality might be higher though as assuming this won\u2019t be so common. So around $130k per event seems fair but going to assume higher cost for this calculation.    MIP40c3-SP66: Events Core Unit DAI Budget (EVENTS-001)   Partnerships The Events CU plans to leverage partnerships with other protocols to offset the event costs. Our goal for each event is to partner with other protocols to cost split. As an example 50%-MakerDao, 25%-Partner 1, 25%-Partner 2. MakerDao would always retain a 50% share minimum and have complete control over the creative direction and the event itself.   For 898,150 in budget to be justified, assuming stability fee of 3%, that will require 30 million Dai minted in vault to match the cost. And We have at max around 4200 + 1200 = 5400 attendees.    MIP40c3-SP66: Events Core Unit DAI Budget (EVENTS-001)   A major event aims to cater to 1200 to 1400 attendees.      MIP40c3-SP66: Events Core Unit DAI Budget (EVENTS-001)   Minor events are to be held at major or minor ETH conferences. A minor event aims to cater to 300 to 400 attendees.   For this consideration, I am going to also put the impact of the event from 1.5x to 3x. So 8,100-16,200 people are positively impacted by the events. I think it\u2019s fair to assume 5% of them might have open up vaults so 405 - 810 users. But as the minimum vault size is big, reducing it to 50% so around 202-405 users. Applying 80-20 rule, I am going to assume top 40-80 of these users have the same as the rest. And we are going to assume minimum at 30k Dai vault each. So 4,860,000 Dai -9,720,000 Dai for the rest and if combined, it\u2019s  9,720,000 to 19,440,000 Dai. But then this will likely to be higher as vaults\u2019 size increases dramatically as it goes up. So doubling it would give 19,440,000 to 38,880,000 Dai minted. There\u2019s also likelihood of potential large RWA or institutional vault user via this kind of event that would end up larger Dai minted. So taking a higher end of the range estimate seems reasonable. So I would support Event Core Unit with the current budget and vote Yes if presented. However, will continue to encourage the team for ways to reduce the cost while increasing the impact. Edit: I realized I accidentally calculated max attendees as 3 major events and 3 minor events instead of 3 major events and 2 minor events. So the result would be 7.4% lower. ",

What about the lucky tail-ends, like some high-impact decision maker being positively influenced because they know Maker or were at an event? What about the value of running experiments? Calculations like this are very useful but the caveat is that they don\u2019t tell the full story. And it\u2019s almost a research project in its own right to come up with good models. I\u2019m a fan as long as we are aware of the limitations. For example: Maker is notoriously un-memeable today. If it\u2019s our strategy to push efforts towards changing this, it may easily be a \u201cgradually then suddenly\u201d thing. You will see no results until the dam breaks and then the impact is suddenly massive. This is why strategy matters, and within that frame we\u2019d want to try and measure things while (1) recognizing the areas that are not included in the calculation and (2) recognizing that there are diminishing returns on more and more complicated models in themselves. At one point it becomes better (cheaper, massively more accurate) to just run an experiment rather than to make too many assumptions in too complex prediction models. Numbers are good, but let\u2019s not make the mistake to think that they capture everything. In some situations they are the most reliable method. The methodology itself and its limitations need however be explicitly stated or we run the risk of being blindly reductionist. The other typical misconception is that numbers are more scientific because they are exact. The scientific approach is about hypothesis, repeatable experiments and validation. A numerical model that isn\u2019t tested, may be way more unscientific than principled reasoning without quantification. And the way to test it is to run experiments\u2026 just saying. It\u2019s entirely possible that the numeric assumptions are all wrong, and no calculation may be better than a misleading calculation. Note: I have not looked into the details of this CU, so this isn\u2019t a recommendation for or against. I just wanted to comment on the \u201ccalculate everything\u201d approach. ",

It is common from companies to nonprofits to even governments to conduct such analysis as resources are limited. Even for US government with $6.8 trillion yearly budget. And in the US government, when a new bill is presented, various sides have to examine impacts and etc. If there\u2019s a bill that cost $85 billion but no such assessment and just run it for experiment, wouldn\u2019t you agree that there will be discontent from the citizens and law makers? $85 billion is 1.25% of total budget for the US government, and Events Core Unit\u2019s current requested budget also accounts for 1.25% of projected yearly spending (based on Makerburn). While I agree that not everything is easily calculated, they should be considered (from both sides, supporting and against certain initiative) to help the community make more informed choices. In fact, in the real world, abstract values ranging from brand value, reputation, to national security, and even human lives are calculated in order for the society to make better decisions especially if it accounts for more than 1% of total spending.

DAIvinity has been the culmination of cross-CU collaboration that was initiated at ETH Lisbon in October 2021. It was observed that our brand presence at the 2 previous conferences was virtually non-existent. You would not know we are the largest DeFi protocol. We wanted to change that. Work began on DAIvinity in November. Denver was to be the trial run for the new team, and I will say they knocked it out of the park. People at the event were blown away. Quotes I heard were \u201cthis was the best crypto event ever\u201d and \u201cthis is a rAAVE-level event\u201d. David Hoffman (who later invited us onto Bankless podcast) said it all with his quote \u201cMaker is cool again\u201d. Andrew Burban at ETH Rio said everyone was asking when the next DAIvinity is. We are a hot commodity in the minds of crypto-folks. This is a good thing. I would like to address some of the concerns I heard come up:  What is the benefit of these events? Branding, branding, branding. We have the whos-who of the crypto elite, influencers, devs, other protocol teams in a room for 4-5 hours staring at Maker and DAI branded visuals while they have the time of their lives. This will lead to positive association and ultimately partnerships.  We need a marketing plan first Growth has stated the to-be formed Maker Brand team will not be dealing with the conference event side of things. I think this is smart. This frees them up to focus soley on our user-facing side. Promoting Maker products along with DAI. The Events CU can focus not just on DAIvinity, but also eventually expanding to cover all things involved with in-person events. Sponsorships, hackathons, etc.  Can we do this with less spend? Absolutely. We have already received many requests to co-sponsor this event from Maker-aligned partners such as Oasis and DeFi Saver. We are confident that the sticker price can be halved through co-sponsorship with Maker retaining full creative control. @PonJerry has provided a breakdown with actual expected costs. We need to be prepared to pay for the whole thing, but as a KPI delegates can track from event to event and see how much was saved. Excess funds can be returned to the surplus buffer right after the event is settled. There is always the option to adjust the budget later to reduce the number and/or size of the events in the future.  Can we use another structure than a CU? The options of running this under another CU, contractor or SPF were all discussed. I\u2019ll run over the reasons why we felt a new CU was the best choice available. Running under Growth CU was originally discussed, but this is not really their mandate and it would cause overhead for @Nadia and her already overworked team. Due to the frequency of the events, @Leggevents and @PonJerry need to commit full time to make this happen. Each event requires 2-3 months of up front planning. Both of these guys have full time jobs that they will need to quit, so they need certainty that they will get paid. This is not conducive to a contractor or SPF setup. The SPF in particular requires 2 months for > 50k, so this requires a 5-6 month lead time before the event, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to determine which events will be good candidates that far in advance. For example, ETH Amsterdam was not clear to be a big event until around mid-Feb. A new Events CU was landed on as the best option possible. Furthermore I personally think this Events CU should be expanded in the future to cover all in-person event stuff such that this slack is not being picked up by other CUs.  Freeing up other CUs Related to the spend I want to emphasize that by not hiring this team, the work will once again fall on other CUs to pick up the slack. This saves work hours of other teams to focus on what their mandate is.  Summary DAIvinity has been a successful experiment. Let\u2019s continue the multi-front effort that is pushing Maker and DAI back into the spotlight. I worry that by not passing this proposal we will be destroying all the progress made so far. It\u2019s time to step on the gas instead of the brake. LFG!    ",

As far as we can see Maker is struggling with its image at the moment, and direct contact to people is the most effective way to let others see the amazing talent and discipline that are available in MakerDAO. For event material: LED Installations look amazing, really stellar job. Swag! Everybody loves swag.
