I wanted to make a post to call Stewards\u2019 attention to this call for proposals Other Internet is conducting in collaboration with Gitcoin. The open call seeks writing at 1200 words that makes the case for a future or an existing public goods project (within or beyond the crypto space). Submissions can be sent here by August 17th. The best responses will be awarded 1ETH. We are conducting this project because we\u2019d love to see more values-based public goods that, per our research, create positive externalities, proposed by Stewards and people they know. This proposal is not limited to people working in the crypto space. We\u2019ve got a very diverse approval board and would like to see orgs outside of crypto who are working in the public\u2019s benefit applying. If you\u2019re involved in Gitcoin, it\u2019s likely you have friends and colleagues who are doing something relevant. Please tell them about the RFP and encourage them to apply! And of course, we encourage you to apply with your own ideas as well, responding to the linked prompt. See the linked post for more details!
