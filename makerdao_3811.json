Who are those people that put up 2.2 Billion USDC to generate less DAI and pay interest for that? What is the point of this? ",

Yes, the PSM is basically a type of guarantee that is not linked to a vault, therefore it is not linked to a user, but free and anyone in proportion may give DAI for USDC or USDC for DAI. Maker\u2019s earnings for this module is based on trading commissions of 0.1% I believe it is, unlike Vaults which is from stability fees. Therefore, I believe they do not enter into liquidations, I have not investigated further if MakerDAO can do anything with the USDC that are there. ",
