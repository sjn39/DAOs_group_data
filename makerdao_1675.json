I do not regularly attend Endgame meetings.  Levels of Detail This summary is organized into sections summarizing the same information in different levels of detail.  LOD0 represents the most-simplified and abstracted version of this concept LOD1 is more complex and more accurate. LOD2 is a direct summary of Rune\u2019s post. Runes post could be considered LOD3, with the highest level of detail and explanation.  Lower numbers = Easier to grasp and understand. Higher numbers = More complex but more accurate.    Endgame V3 - Active Dai Supply/Demand Levers  Level of Detail - 0 Four mechanisms can be used by MakerCore to influence DAI demand and supply under the Endgame plan. Dai Savings Rate (DSR)  Allows users to earn a simple yield on holding Dai funded directly from the Surplus Buffer.  Stability Fee Base Rate (SFBR)  Increases the stability fee of some or all vaults.  Target Rate (TR)  Can be thought of as negative interest rates for DAI. Once engaged, Dai will no longer be pegged 1:1 to USD, and will float away from that peg over time. Powerful tool with extreme cost. Once the peg has been broken, the 1 Dai equals 1 Dollar meme can never be regained.  Protocol owned vault  A special Maker Vault only usable by Maker Governance. Holds ETHD as collateral and generates Dai against this collateral to increase supply.     LOD1  Level of Detail - 1 Four mechanisms can be used by MakerCore to influence DAI demand and supply under the Endgame plan. Dai Savings Rate (DSR)  Allows users to earn a simple yield on holding Dai funded directly from the Surplus Buffer. Increasing DSR increases Dai demand  Stability Fee Base Rate (SFBR)  Increases the stability fee of some or all vaults. Also increases protocol income which can help fund the DSR. Increasing SFBR decreases Dai supply  Target Rate (TR)  A mechanism that continuously changes the Target Price of Dai over time. Once engaged, Dai will no longer be pegged 1:1 to USD, and will float away from that peg over time. Powerful tool with extreme cost. Once the peg has been broken, the 1 Dai equals 1 Dollar meme can never be regained. Positive TR increases demand for Dai and reduces supply (theoretically). Negative TR reduces demand for Dai, and increases supply.  Protocol owned vault  A special Maker Vault only usable by Maker Governance. Holds ETHD as collateral and generates Dai against this collateral. Cannot be liquidated, no stability fee. A large scale Protocol Owned Vault makes it safer to activate a negative target rate. Generating DAI and selling it increases Dai supply Purchasing DAI and burning it decreases Dai supply      LOD2  Level of Detail - 2  Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and Stability Fee Base Rate (SFBR)  Help protect the DAI peg from downside risk. DSR allows users to earn a simple yield on holding Dai funded directly from the Surplus Buffer SFBR increases the stability fee of some or all vaults, increasing income to help fund the DSR.  Result: Increasing these has upward Pressure on DAI Price  Target Rate (TR)  A mechanism that continuously changes the Target Price of Dai over time.  Once engaged, Dai will free float away 1:1 with USD by gradually changing its price over time according to the target rate. PSMs and liquidations will follow the Target Price when determining their prices.   Extremely powerful tool that enables Maker to put a hard limit on RWA exposure while encouraging more Dai generation from decentralized collateral. However the cost is very high and permanent. Once the peg has been broken, the 1 Dai equals 1 Dollar meme can never be regained. Endgame Plan assumes that a regulatory crackdown on RWA collateral is likely to happen eventually.  Resilience in this case relies on breaking the 1:1 peg. This will have immediate and severe ramifictions, leading to a large outflow in users.   Ultimately worth it as a differentiator against centralized stablecoins.  Results:  Positive TR increases demand for Dai and reduces supply of Dai (theoretically). A negative TR has the opposite effect, it reduces demand for Dai, and increases supply.**   Protocol owned vault  Very different mechanism. Synergetic with negative TR. A special Maker Vault only usable by Maker Governance.  Holds ETHD and potentially other decentralized assets as collateral. Generates Dai against this collateral. Cannot be liquidated and has no Stability Fee.   Used to generate more Dai and purchase ETHD with the newly generated Dai. Directly increases the share of Dai backed by decentralized collateral. A large scale Protocol Owned Vault makes it must safer to activate a negative TR and free float Dai.  It can step in to generate more Dai if the TR gets overly negative. Benefits users of Dai while also allowing the Maker Protocol to earn significant yield both from ETH staking and exposure to debt with negative rates.     ",

                    "GPT-summary": "The post explains the Endgame V3 plan proposed by MakerCore to influence DAI demand and supply. The plan includes four mechanisms: Dai Savings Rate, Stability Fee Base Rate, Target Rate, and Protocol owned vault. The post provides different levels of detail for each mechanism, with LOD0 being the most simplified and LOD3 being the most detailed. The post also discusses the potential risks and benefits of the plan, including the possibility of breaking the 1:1 peg between Dai and USD. The post does not advertise or ask for collaboration on the proposal.",
