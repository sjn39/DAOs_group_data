                    "content": " Oxytocin ( ox.ytocin.eth ) Delegation Thread (Delegate commitment) Onchain voting station I\u2019ve found that Delegate Communication threads are some of the most interesting threads to follow in the forums, as it not only allows me to see the reasoning of other delegates, but the discussion delegates have with other users are also super insightful. I\u2019m looking to make this delegate communication follow along these lines, and make it not only a noticeboard of my votes , but also a place to discuss the reasoning behind these votes and maybe a bit of metagovernance. Feel free to join in, and if you enjoy the discussion don\u2019t hesitate to delegate some OP! In addition to here, due to also being part of the ParaSwap protocol delegates, I will be communicating my thoughts over the ParaSwap Discord, which I recommend to join if you want to chat on how the ParaSwap delegation should vote! ParaSwap   Season 3  - Cycle 10  This is the first cycle that I am actively involved it as a Delegate instead of just a grantee on behalf of ParaSwap, so I apologise if any of this information has been discussed before extensively. I\u2019m separating my thoughts on grants metagovernance (no comments on the grants application themselves as the council is handling those) and the other governance points.  Trends in Growth Experiments I\u2019ve had a brief look at the grants that have qualified for the  Preliminary Review , and I personally find it worrying how most of these plans don\u2019t extend beyond instant rewards for using the application on either Liquidity Mining or LPing their token.  I leave this decision to the council of course, but I personally worry on how sustainable these rewards might be to keep users for the long term. I personally suggest incentivising the allocation of OP for the projects that keep the rewards for actions that are more likely to keep the capital locked in the longer term, or lead to better synergies with the rest of the ecosystem. One example of this I really liked from this round is Giveth. I\u2019m not very familiar with the project, but them requesting most of their grant to give to other Optimism projects as well as building protocol-owned liquidity feels a lot stickier than instantly claimable rewards.  Bedrock Update From my understanding, this is the only major vote for non-council non-badgeholder delegates this cycle, and I see little reason not to vote for. Of course, as somebody less tech based this comes with a massive assumption of trust that Bedrock has all the features described like lower fees. However, the biggest reason to vote for in my opinion is how this sets the foundation for better Fraud Proofs. I really believe that, after Bedrock, the next Protocol Upgrades should be focussing on deploying decentralised sequencers and fraud proofs as soon as possible. It would also be neat to start brainstorming of ways that OP and the Protocol can be more closely tied together, but that\u2019s not nearly as urgent as the last point.  Onchain Voting Beta and Delegate Centralisation Gonna keep this one short as this post has already been going for a while, but I\u2019ve submitted my onchain vote on Agora, and here\u2019s some general thoughts on the experience:  The creation process for the Delegate Commitment page was enjoyable. I like how much easier it is to modify than the legacy version, and how it keeps track of voter stats. Voting itself was also fairly painless, the interface is pretty, and I enjoy how easy it is to read the justifications on the page. Finally, one big concern for me is the Delegates page. Currently, the only two filters are sorting by number of votes delegated and number of delegations (both giving similar results).  Because of this last point, discoverability of new Delegates has now gone significantly down. Most of the visible votes are delegates which have been here from Season 0, with the most \u2018recent\u2019 delegates being from a month after that. Of course, all of these people are incredible and have earned their top spots, but I worry that with the current system we will be encouraging new people entering the collective to delegate to the top ~20 delegates, snowballing their voting power. This could mean not only a significantly higher burden on those individual delegates, but a more difficult fight for new Delegates to acquire visibility and power. I\u2019d love to discuss with others what ways we could avoid this centralisation, while also leading users to candidates to trustworthy and high-quality Delegates. Some random ideas that come to mind:  Allow delegates with more than x% supply to hide their delegation from results. This action could be rewarded in someway to encourage it on active delegates, or could be automatically enforced after a threshold is reached. Introduce the option to filter by delegate age (only allow delegates that have voted for either more or less than x months) Maybe allow citizen badgeholders to select \u2018recommended delegates\u2019 that currently have low delegation, but might be worth highlighting. This is my favourite idea, as it gives a further tie to the bicameral system, makes the selections flexible, and allows some critical curation.  ",

Name: Diego Ortiz Mayorca Address or ENS: Saludiego201.eth Discord username: Saludiego201#9643 Verification (Tally profile or tweet): Tally | Saludiego201.eth I have read and understood the Delegate Commitment Process: Yes, sir.  I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes, sir.  My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: In my family there is a saying that goes \u201cIf you have an idea that can contribute, say it, and if not learn how to contribute\u201d for a while I followed closely and with interest the governance of optimism, I delegated some assets to some acquaintances and I feel that it is time to contribute myself. My view on the Optimistic Vision: The pillars of a DAO should always be the diversity of opinions and speed in decision making, I feel that optimism and its collective are making great strides in demonstrating that in such a diverse world we can connect with a common mission, for a dream or an idea. Experienced or not, the optimism collective allows many users to access the largest exchange of information and value in real time, while rewarding and benefiting the creation of use cases, with constant feedback, that\u2019s what I find fascinating. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: They describe the fundamental foundations of a model of digital democracy that seeks to drive the growth and development of a decentralized ecosystem. I find exciting the idea that we can create a digital reality in which citizens have control and authority. The fact that this is being approached as a \u201cworking constitution\u201d and that the importance of experimentation and evolution over time is being recognized demonstrates a humility and sensitivity to the changing dynamics of these environments. In addition, it is encouraging to see a balancing of short- and long-term incentives. While there may be some voices that disagree with a foundation behind Optimism, it is necessary in its initial steps to develop the necessary incentives to slowly decentralize. Optimism offers an inspiring and ambitious vision for a future in which digital democracy and a decentralized economy play a crucial role in the lives of individuals and communities.
