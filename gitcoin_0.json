We haven\u2019t explored using LaaS for this diversification as we\u2019re focused on finding the right long term strategic partners for Gitcoin DAO, which we feel can be best accomplished through the WG. Echoing Kyle, it\u2019d be great to hear more about what you\u2019re thinking. Could you elaborate on how you see LaaS fitting into our goals here? GTC trades about $20m of volume daily so liquidity hasn\u2019t been a huge concern. ",
