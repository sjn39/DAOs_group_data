Motivation While we had a lot of liquidity and few large scale collaterals to onboard at the beginning of the year, we are now in the reverse situation. There is now a lot of high quality collaterals looking for scale and not enough capital. SF CU is committed to help MKR holders understand the consequences of their actions and have a framework to model their thinkings.  Build your MakerDAO ALM Model You can find the model spreadsheet here. Best way is to start by making a copy of the spreadsheet so you can edit it. The cells in light yellow can be edited (you can always change the rest as well at your own risk). They are prefilled for a example but it should be taken as an advise from SF CU or anyone. The top part is the dashboard presenting the outcome (with a few input on the top left).  image1165\u00d7646 84.1 KB  Item 1 is a simplified income statement. Item 2 shows the Surplus Buffer coverage. As already discussed in the ALM Forecast, the Surplus Buffer is quite a limitation on the amount of risk we can take. Nevertheless, not taking risk is not an option neither as we are loss making and the situation is only getting worse with time. Governance will have to find a balance here. Item 3 is a list of condition that should be met. An acceptable solution (from an ALM Framework standpoint only, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good solution)  should have no red lights here. You should not invest more than you have, you should keep ample short-term liquidity (on the bottom right chart the purple line should always be above 0 and you shouldn\u2019t have more than SB + 25% of DAI in private credit (point to be discussed by Governance as well, it\u2019s just a filler here). The bottom part list all assets list all possible collaterals (at least proposed, those not approved are in grey). MIP82 was set to 0 as the current off-chain crypto backed loans is difficult. All expected return over assets (RoA) and Capital at Risk (CaR) are indicative and some work is needed to update them. But they give a first view.  image1403\u00d7722 26.4 KB  You can see that the USDC PSM line has a red box, that\u2019s because the current situation is that we have more proposal than available capital. So some decision will have to be made by MKR holders.  Keys points  The Surplus Buffer is a limitation without any obvious solution. We don\u2019t have enough capital for all the current proposals (and expect many more soon to land)   Next steps Should some delegate need help to inform their decision using this spreadsheet, SF CU stay happy to provide support. This version is still work in progress and we will continue to build following usage of it.  References  MakerDAO ALM forecast from July Modeling DAI maturity ALM Framework  ",

In normal capital allocations, lower amounts (exposure) seem to return higher yields and greater exposure and vice versa. This does not seem to be the case for Maker. Seems to be no rhyme or reason:  This was constructed using the above data. It is interesting to consider this chart - and the lack of a clear curve - as well as the limitation of the PSM when evaluating future RWA proposals. Also seems to highlight our exposure. Looks like credit and crypto are the major asset classes. Thanks for illuminating key, actionable insights. ",

Whereas startups with no experience in the RWA Cash like spacing are charging flat pricing. For the cash like deals -  I think it wouldnt be excessive to only consider deals with performance based pricing - especially as this ALM analysis indicates that our appetite is more limited. ",

The reason being - what is the incentive if you receive 2/3 of the spread above SOFR? Find the highest-yielding (typically riskiest/most illiquid) bond that is eligible for purchase and generate the highest return for yourself. In the pure AUM management fee, this incentive to go for the highest-yielding asset does not exist. You optimize for what the customer, Maker, wants - which is principal preservation, good risk-adjusted returns, and immediate (or semi-immediate) liquidity. That being said - I could be wrong or missing something! This is a convo I\u2019ve had with many in the Maker community\u2026we feel pretty strongly about our view, but very open to discussing where we may be wrong. ",

                    "content": "@fig @dbkcan I think part of the answer is that there are other factors than scale and performance. Vaults that are the most mispriced are crypto-backed vaults, yet they are the core of our business and have a very long Lindy effect. Such a discussion is maybe needed but there are plenty of pro and cons. Then you have MIP81 and GUSD, those provide instant liquidity. The yield is of secondary importance here. Some flagship or landmark collaterals could explain a lower rate. Best example being OFH which was way above mispricing (87% below market rates today!!). But those have very little importance regarding their size. They all provided insane value by allowing us to be where we are now. As I stated 5 months ago, any DAI invested below SOFR is a failure for MakerDAO. Now reality is obviously a bit more nuanced and complicated. But we should get there asap in my personal opinion. I also been vocal for more than a year that we should focus on short-term bonds/MMF (acknowledging again that situation is always more nuanced). I don\u2019t believe in performance based pricing for such investments and don\u2019t see much tier 1 asset managers doing that.

Can USDC in the USDC-PSM go to zero?    You have it on the right which is based on DAI Maturity profile.   I have to stress that this considers a somewhat normal context (history, even as it was bumpy, was quite kind to DAI so far). Which is why, even if maturity might be longer, most assets should be able to be sold in a somewhat short period of time with a discount embedded in the CaR. There is no engagement of DAI being redeemable outside of the Emergency Shutdown, but there might be an expectation. Up to Maker Governance to fix the threshold here. As a simple rule, at least 1/3 of DAI should be very short term (meaning on-chain and operated, if needed, in a permissionless way as governance is too slow). If you go below 25%, then you sell the next bucket of liquidity (short-term bonds) to refill it. The USDC-PSM can go to 0, but that would be bad. I recommend to size MIP81 so there is always at least 200M in the USDC-PSM and having a smart contract to move USDC from MIP81 to the PSM as needed (assuming MIP81 with a smart contract solution).

All of the company\u2019s short-term Treasury assets will be phased into the fund, though the cash reserve \u2013 about 20% of the total \u2013 will still be held in partner banks, Fox-Geen said, because it allows for customers to more easily redeem USDC around the clock. But that\u2019s a temporary measure, he explained, because the ultimate goal is for BlackRock to apply \u2013 in time \u2013 to get the fund into the Federal Reserve\u2019s reverse-repo program. Such funds are usually granted that access, so Fox-Geen said he hopes to see the cash portion of Circle\u2019s reserve eventually held at the Fed.   coindesk.com \u2013 3 Nov 22    Circle Begins Putting Reserves Into New BlackRock Fund The assets backing Circle Internet Financial\u2019s USDC will finish moving into an SEC-regulated money market fund early next year.      Can you imagine DAI on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet? ",

                    "content": "Maker Forum Post: An institutional opinion - long time listener first time caller. I\u2019ve been lurking for awhile on the forums and feel like this is a good place to make some comments that I\u2019ve been thinking about for awhile. Just to highlight my bias up front: I\u2019m part of RFA who is working towards an RWA deal with Maker and Centrifuge, however, I\u2019ve been a serial entrepreneur for a long time and been a crypto enthusiast since the 2012 era. In 2019 when we were able to acquire a bank in Canada my crypto brain really started to crank up into high gear. Business Model and Focus: If I had to rank the priorities of Maker I would say simplistically they should be (caveat being that decentralization is the overarching theme):  Security / Trust / Reputation - if we don\u2019t have trust in the protocol we don\u2019t have a business, especially in this current environment. Liquidity - If we have a run on assets and DAI depegs we ruin number 1 Ecosystem Growth - Amazon lost more market share YTD than the entire crypto market. If we want to succeed and change the way the world works we need to get more people over the Chasm - at this stage we need to build it before they will come, then do everything we can to entice them to come into DeFi. This is where current RWA lending has the biggest impact opportunity. Yield / Profitability - we need to make enough money so that we\u2019re not burning and able to contribute to the growth of 1-3. Again, RWA meets this need nicely, we just have the challenge of pricing it appropriately to maximize 1-3.  All RWAs aren\u2019t the same:   I\u2019ve seen a lot of different models for RWAs over the last few years in crypto and while the yields are all pretty similar the risks and models are very different. Some thoughts below:  Overarching themes:  Capital position: Simplistically put: what is the chance of losing capital? Counterparty risk: Who are you working with, what is the size of their balance sheet, are they regulated? What jurisdiction, who are the management team, etc. Operational risk: RWAs are heavily geared to the engine that is originating the assets. Deploying capital to be invested is a different risk profile than deploying capital to purchase a bond securitization. Lots of operational buckets of different risk that should be considered when deploying and creating appropriate diversification within RWAs.   Some thoughts on current deals and forgive me if highlighting the obvious:    HVB - this deal is putting capital at risk. I think it\u2019s a great initiative to build out the ecosystem but I don\u2019t see Maker needing to take on any risk to still earn an appropriate net interest margin (NIM) to achieve Number 4. This deal definitely helps with number 3, likely number 1 and if successful could be a great earner for number 4. .   SocGen - this deal was all about Number 3 while ticking number 1 and 2 - makes sense   BlockTower - This deal is a good mix of all 4 - different to the HVB deal in that there is a 30% first loss which is very significant in tradfi with a portfolio approach. While lots of banter on yield I think it is actually priced appropriately to onboard institutional capital - more on this later.   Monetalis - Love the ability for Maker to access yield from tradfi through low risk high liquidity products. It\u2019s a great short term solution but hope that at some point Maker can just buy this stuff directly on chain - one can dream!   RFA (again, highlighting my bias - but\u2026) this ticks all the boxes and is uniquely different from the other investments made and in queue. RFA has these assets on the balance sheet at any given point and time, which eliminates a lengthy origination and deployment period. Here I would highlight the difference between buying a bond backed by assets (Asset-Backed Securitization) vs. extending a credit facility to a counterparty to originate / purchase assets that meet the stated requirements. The other major difference is that RFA has the assembly line built and finely tuned, originating upwards of $50m a day in Canadian residential mortgages.   DAI interest Rates - for term deposits -  Our bank has just over $2b in assets funded entirely through customer GICs (same instrument as [CD](Certificates of Deposit (CDs) | Investor.gov in the US) Number 2 (liquidity) is a big issue and one that I think can be mitigated with better duration matching. In my job I sell 1-year GIC of X and buy a 1-year asset for Y - pretty simple - my goal is to make around 200-250 bps as a Net Interest Margin (NIM). I\u2019ve seen some chatter on offering yield with DAI through the DSR - could a yielding DAI product have a fixed duration? If you offered a 1-year DAI GIC type product paying 2.5% and were able to put that money into a 1-year RWA paying 5%, you\u2019re growing the ecosystem of DAI, RWAs and fixed income\u2013all while making a 250 bps NIM.  Just more on NIM and how fortunate Maker is in their position vs existing Tradfi banks. My 1 year GIC is around 5%, therefore, simplistically (not including leverage and risk weighted return) I need to originate assets closer to 7-8% to hit our target NIM. Maker has a 500 bps head start vs most Banks - that is an enormous competitive advantage and an incredible privilege to be able to attract institutions to come into DeFi.   You could also facilitate the secondary market for liquidity of fixed DAI as another revenue generator.  @Deco-Core-Unit is already building the basis for fixed-rates products within Maker and this should offer a complementary product to pair with RWA or other term lending deals.  Institutional Mindset:  There have been a lot of pretty bad MIP6 applications that I\u2019ve seen, often from those that appear to be \u201cborrowers of last resort\u201d i.e. they could not find capital elsewhere. Maker should lend to those that don\u2019t need the money but want it at a better price than they get in TradFi. Highlighting above the 500 bps head start vs Tradfi banks, Maker can be extremely picky about those they want to work with and what asset classes they want exposure to, by the simple fact that Maker can out bid anyone except maybe the FED   I view Maker\u2019s involvement in RWAs as bridge builders to the Institutions of the world - Q1 of 2022 the \u201ctoll\u201d that DeFi needs to pay to convince institutions to come over the bridge was X, when Luna and 3 Arrows went down that toll went to X+1%, and now after FTX (and potentially Genesis) that toll is now X+2%. The cost will come down over time, but the FUD adds frictions today. Large institutions are mostly run by career executives who have very little upside to taking risk and a ton of downside. Talking to those at various different Canadian pension funds that invested in Celsius and FTX, the sentiment is they\u2019re not touching crypto for a long time as it\u2019s seen as career suicide if it goes wrong. Maker needs to thus increase the buffer to get more institutions into the space with a nice carrot of cheaper and more efficient capital than in Tradfi - these people are literally putting their jobs on the line to try and move the space forward. Over time that delta will come down naturally, but at the moment number 3 (ecosystem building) is greater than number 4 (bottom line).  To sum it up: Maker has a lot of advantages going for it when it comes to term lending, and that advantage should be used to build up Maker\u2019s ecosystem today. Eventually everything will come on-chain and enter the world of DeFi, but until then, the community should fine tune its RWA lending with a long-term perspective of where the market is going. Smart deal structuring and fixed-rate deposit offerings are the best tools Maker has here. ",
