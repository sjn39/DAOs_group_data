                    "content": " Build the Maker Brand team   We are requesting to build the Maker Brand team and ecosystem of tier 1 providers to build a strong and reputable brand for MakerDAO and engage with our users and broader audience. . This effort would be first incubated within the Growth Core Unit until the Maker Brand team is ready to make a proposal for an independent CU to the community. The problem - Maker\u2019s reputation and brand awareness are not consistent with its leading position in the Defi scene. The protocol does not have a clear branding and communication strategy, which represents a significant opportunity cost for the protocol to accelerate its growth and outperform the competition. The organizational environment in DAO also presents challenges in creating a consistent brand, a common message and coordination in the execution of the strategy. The ambition - Maker Brand team has the ambition to build a strong brand image consistent with the value the protocol brings to the Defi market and broader. Maker must be the top-of-mind Defi protocol and the first choice of users willing to get leverage on their crypto/ real-world assets and/ or own a stablecoin (i.e.DAI). Means to achieve the ambition - The Maker Brand team\u2019s effort will be structured around 4 key activities being: Brand Research, Content, PR & Comms, and Strategic Initiatives. These activities will help achieve 5 core missions: 1. Define brand strategy and implementation plan for new strategic partnerships. 2. Communicate on the protocol\u2019s updates (i.e. products, ecosystem). 3. Build brand awareness of MakerDao. 4. Own and develop the protocol\u2019s intangible assets of communication. 5. Build strategic activations with providers (incl. one-off products). Ressources to be set-up for success - We will build a strong team with experienced members in Branding and Product Marketing and develop an ecosystem of leading providers to support our effort. Being mindful of the budget, our structure around an ecosystem of providers will allow us to keep our fixed costs low and adjust our variable costs according to market dynamics and needs. KPIs to monitor progress and performance - We believe that the 4 macros KPIs below are a good start to monitoring our activities\u2019 performance. They may change over time depending on their relevance: 1. Number of announcements 2. Twitter metrics 3. Social Media Sentiment Analysis 4. Dai Holders (in line with the strategic activations) We are building a more granular set of KPIs to have the right level of monitoring of our work. Immediate next steps - We will onboard the Branding, PR, and Design Agencies to start developing the strategy around announcements and communications. We will hire the key team members (Brand Lead, Comms Lead) and implement the key internal processes.  What is not within the scope of the Maker Brand team? Below are the activities that are not included in the scope of Maker Brand:  Events: e.g., live events, hackathons, parties, side events. Activities that are not of a commercial nature: e.g., marketing, branding, or communications activities that are specific to core units or internal to the DAO (unless there is a commercial intention and the Maker Brand team agrees).   Why incubate the Maker Brand team within the Growth CU? Maker Brand will start as a team inside the Growth CU to have the right support to hire and onboard the team and implement the internal business processes. Growth has already been supporting brand initiatives with some of our key providers and has started developing branding initiatives for the protocol, but it\u2019s not part of its primary objective. The Growth CU wants to incubate the Brand team until it\u2019s ready to propose an independent CU.  Context: Brand recognition is how well your target audience, and potential customers, can recall your company\u2019s brand and identify your products. It\u2019s an indicator of how well your audience differentiates your product from those of competitors. MakerDAO has never worked with a clear strategy towards this goal, in a structured and coordinated way. We benefited from the first moving advantage in Defi, which helped us develop a reputation. However, our reputation has been fading over time, leaving room for the competition to take more space in the various media channels and leaving very limited visibility for MakerDao, although it is the oldest DAO in the whole crypto industry. Another notable challenge is the one that comes with the DAO organization. Since DAOs are something new, there is no history or playbook on the development and implementation of branding activities in a DAO. The Maker Brand team will therefore need experienced members in the DAO to be able to achieve the team\u2019s ambition while facing the DAO challenges (non exhaustive list):   Definition and implementation of cross-CUs processes, requiring good coordination between different stakeholders of the DAO. Execution of the plan in accordance with the key dates when involving different stakeholders. Development of coherent and consistent communication. Manager dual communication, i.e. internal communication within the community and external communication.   What are the key missions to achieve our ambition? Branding is the process of creating, developing, and building a brand. When we talk about a brand, people believe that we are only talking about a logo, and the brand is not just a logo but has to do with what people say, feel or think about a product or a service, it mostly involves the intangible: what the brand is, what it represents, its values, its DNA, its spirit. To put it in a word, it is the soul of everything. In order to efficiently develop and execute this mission, it is necessary to generate mechanisms and processes that serve to coordinate all the participants involved in each new activity/launch/update that happens in the DAO. The objective is to position Maker as the \u201ctop of mind\u201d Defi solution for users. Therefore, the Maker Brand team\u2019s effort will be structured around Brand Research, Content, PR & Comms and Strategic Initiatives. These activities will help achieve the 5 core missions below: 1. Communicate on new strategic partnerships (from ideation to announcements) 2. Coordinate and communicate on the protocol\u2019s updates (i.e. products, ecosystem) 3. Develop and communicate on the Brand of MakerDao. 4. Ownership and development of protocol communications and Intangible assets. 5. Idea, development, and implementation of promotional opportunities for one-off products.   How do we successfully achieve our ambition? To achieve our missions and be set up for success, we will build a team of experienced members in Branding and Product Marketing and develop an ecosystem of leading providers.  Team with experienced members:  Maker Brand team will consist of 5.5 FTEs:  1 FTE - Team Leader 1 FTE - Brand & Comms Lead 1 FTE - Brand & Comms associate 1 FTE - Product Marketing Lead 1 FTE - Product Marketing associate 0.5 FTE in charge of administrative tasks   1600\u00d7516 331 KB . Ecosystem of leading providers (On-Demand Services): Maker Brand Core Unit is aware of the reality that the DAO is going through in terms of budget requests & approvals, that is why we propose a model based on maximizing the contracting of services that can be canceled at any time to avoid developing a high fixed operating cost and thus be able to have financial flexibility. This gives us a high response capacity for operational needs while maintaining a high-quality standard. The advantages are:  High efficiency (cost and time efficient) High flexibility to focus on priority topics Highly skilled resources   Focus on our 5 missions:  1) Define brand strategy and implementation plan for new strategic partnerships. Unlike other marketing proposals that we saw in the past where much of what was presented as a marketing action fell into a black box, the idea of this core unit is to work together with Growth for the idea and development of strategic initiatives that can mean a broad competitive development for the DAO. This strategic initiative and the necessary budget for it will be communicated to the DAO via MIP, where the negotiations with the chosen partner will be detailed point by point. In this way there are no black boxes and the community can be aware of future actions to be taken by Maker Brand CU These strategic initiatives will be the most important for both Maker Growth and the Maker Brand since they will only be developed for very special cases that can give the protocol a specific advantage over the competition. These will be developed and supervised by both core units so that they can be framed within a general plan of strategic initiatives. For example: : Strategic initiatives of DAI Supply: helping leading companies in the industry to develop an interface and a dedicated service for Institutions to access Maker Vaults. This will increase Maker Vaults usage from institutions. Strategic initiatives of DAI Demand: cocreate a campaign with one of the leading crypto bank companies in the world to offer to their users one year of the biggest cashback program when using the Debit Card and paying with Dai. This will increase the number of DAI holders. These types of initiatives are complex and will require long coordination between Brand, Growth, and the Partner and may also include other Core units of the DAO, you can read more about what are Strategic Initiatives in Marketing in this link. We are currently in conversation via Growth with 4 Tier 1 Partners to develop these strategies.  2) Coordinate and communicate on the protocol\u2019s updates (i.e. products, ecosystem) Both for strategic initiatives and for any news to communicate about the DAO or the protocol, at the Maker Brand Core unit level, coordination is necessary to create the assets and comply with a high-quality standard in our communications. These assets can be any multimedia element or third-party services to enrich the final message and be able to achieve the impact we need, all framed within a specific plan for the announcement, knowing that each one of these involves different strategies. MakerDAO has historically underperformed on key announcements, and this is because we presented several pain points when planning and implementing a product communication strategy.  MakerDAO is a protocol without its own Front End. Partners with different roadmaps and backlogs. Uncoordinated Core Units.  These 3 points are the main reasons why it is a complicated task (not impossible) to be able to make impressive announcements with good ROI for the MakerDAO brand. Maker Brand Core unit will develop a coordination framework to be able to improve the process and identify special situations to have the necessary solutions available. Within the announcement process, apart from the multimedia assets, a clear Public Relations plan must also be developed, where the purpose is to help outline the key objectives for the organization and how we want our brand to position itself in the market. Public relations helps manage perception by giving the brand clear business objectives by developing and driving the main stories to be told. Being a guest on podcasts and television appearances are just a few examples where these stories can be told, as there is a wide range of media coverage opportunities. We will select and work with people from the community to be the spokesperson for specific subjects. We will coordinate with everyone in advance to find the right resource. Each announcement will be taken as a mini-project where resources will be assigned with a specific cost limit for each element. These elements will form \u201cpackages\u201d that range from a simple tweet to videos, twitter spaces, and other activities to coordinate with communication agencies that we will hire. Over time we will be able to optimally allocate the costs of each moving part in order to generate the greatest impact at the lowest cost. It is key to identify the starting points of the information flow in the DAO in order to start coordinating the necessary points. We currently identify 4 points.  Growth CU Flow: The announcement comes from a specific deal generated in Growth CU MIP Flow: The announcement comes from a MIP. Core Units with Gov: The announcement comes from the proposal of a Core Unit and said the proposal must go through Governance. RWA example. Core Unit without Gov: Critical update of the protocol proposed by PECU.  From Maker Brand CU we develop a specific process for each of these sources and thus be able to have scalability in the development of Marketing activities.  3) Develop and communicate on the Brand of MakerDao. The purpose of brand awareness and perception assessments is to track changes in the aforementioned fields of an organization\u2019s brand, often relative to competing brands. These evaluations are conducted over an extended period of time to inform business strategy and marketing tactics to follow. Maker Brand Core unit will have ownership related to these investigations and will communicate to the DAO what are the specific courses of action to improve the following points.  Brand Loyalty Brand Awareness Perceived Quality Brand Associations  These courses of action must be developed in a long time frame in order to see the desired results, as well as there must be a commitment from other core units to adopt the specific guidelines at this point in order to have a message cohesion with impact and meaning.  4) Ownership and development of protocol communications and Intangible assets. This is a continuation of the previous point, but more focused on the channels through which the courses of action of the branding plan come to life. The two most important channels that the DAO currently has are the Twitter handle and the web, from Maker Brand we will start designing all the communications and processes related to Twitter to be able to take over time other intangible assets such as the Web.  5) Idea, development, and implementation of promotional opportunities for one-off products. For the one-off opportunities section, it is also necessary to define a scope of what the Maker Brand core unit can do since many of these initiatives depend on having access to the client-facing \u201cproduct\u201d and today that product is in the hands of OASIS (Frontend), which is not something that the DAO can control, so we need to find a way to create things that keeps the conversation about Maker going on, for this let\u2019s analyze the 4Ps Marketing Mix to find where we can act.  Price Product Promotion Place  Price is related to the work of Risk CU, Product is related to whether or not we will ever have a Core Unit dedicated to creating another front for MakerDAO, something that at the moment is not possible in the short term, so in the end we are only able to develop things related to promotions or place. These two options may allow us to create specific one-off actions where awareness is intended to be generated, these campaigns may or may not be developed in conjunction with a partner, the important thing is that they have to be impactful enough to generate buzz. Example: Joint advertising action with a partner in a sporting event. In Argentina, we developed a similar action where we led a television event to raise money for the Red Cross.  800\u00d7450 382 KB  This event was a massive success, with more than 1 Millon total viewers putting DAI on par with international brands and generating great demand in the country. The key to the success of this type of action is to detect the opportunity and act quickly.  1105\u00d7500 217 KB   Why are the one-off actions important? Emotional connection with the brand Quality content directed at a well-defined target audience can impact users and excite the audience. These feelings are associated with the image of the brand and the impression that consumers receive, making them remember it. Quality content attracts new customers Quality content attracts users because they seek information on digital platforms. Therefore, if Maker brand is making original and relevant content, we will be able to establish contact with new potential customers. Brand personality By regularly creating quality content, the personality of Maker brand is defined, which acquires an identity that differentiates it from the competition. Lead capture Generating quality content allows the collection of leads (potential customers). Thanks to this act, we will be able to implement conversion strategies (With Growth CU) with the aim of closing more and better partnerships.  What are we doing now? Given the pace of development in Maker, we believe that it is time to act now, that is why we are currently working with the following providers for the development of upcoming announcements and actions.

Events seem like a huge component of overall branding and messaging\u2026   Thanks Katie. The reasons Maker Brand does not want to focus on events are:   The brand awareness needs to be spread more towards the \u2018outside\u2019 audience, this means - TradFi, institutional players, and generally more non-crypto native projects and people. Conference side events, parties and hackathons normally have a niche audience of crypto-native projects which are more or less familiar with MakerDAO and/or collaborate with us already. The PR efforts of Maker Brand will be directed towards expanding brand awareness beyond the web3 crowd to path the way to new partnerships and deals as well. Maker has been the largest lending protocol by TVL on Ethereum for quite some time and our community knows that - but those outside of the community don\u2019t. So Maker needs to spread the message through the right channels (e.g. TradFi players or mainstream media representatives generally don\u2019t go to ETH conferences/hackathons, hence PR needs to be done differently for that audience.)   There has been a proposal regarding adding an Events Core Unit recently, added by @PonJerry, willing to take over that job. So at this point it makes sense for Maker Brand to focus on the other PR & branding needs.       Doo_StableLab:  Can you clarify the part about \u201cmarketing, branding, or communications\u201d? Also, what\u2019s the difference between commercial and non-commercial in this case?   Commercial marketing/branding/comms refers to activities that have a higher potential for ROI. Non-commercial activities are internal comms, sponsoring events or initiatives with the lowest potential for attracting new partnerships or deals. For example - Maker Brand will use the new visual assets created by a production agency for external communication (such as article banners, twitter posts, video ads, etc.) - hence distributed to a broader audience; but not for internal comms within the DAO.

There are already members at Growth that focus on content, research, and managing certain social media like Twitter. Is this transfer of these members into potentially this new Core Unit? Or would this involve completely new hires.   Events CU or GovComm\u2019s new PR initiative, which are both not yet onboarded are heavily related to Makreting and PR and also Maker\u2019s Brand. So even if the team believes that such should be seperate, wouldn\u2019t it be redundant or even counter effective to have different CUs working on it? If they exist together, how would the new CU coordinate or direct them for improving the brand?   ",

For example, here we can make a shortlist of users that can be identified according to how they use the protocol.  Vault Users. PSM Arbitration. Dai Holders RWA  Each of these users has a different set of interests/needs when it comes to DAI (or any other stablecoin), and is its Maker Brand\u2019s task to identify these needs and develop the proper communication/strategies to catch their attention, but wait\u2026do we have unlimited resources to pursue each and every possible client? Of course not, we need to prioritize and make the most out of every single DAI we have in the budget. That is why it is vitally important to have in mind the revenue of MakerDAO products in order to establish an expense parameter per strategy for each type of client/user. For example, we think that the multichain strategy can be the return of Retail Vault users for the protocol, a type of client that we haven\u2019t talked about since the beginning of 2018, which will need us to develop a branding and communication strategy that needs to be up to what MakerDAO needs. The same for RWA, it is a segment that speaks its own language, and we are seeing it even from how the MIPs are being developed, each segment has a particularity that has to be identified and understood in order to deliver the actions effectively.

As you mentioned in the Growth CU call yesterday, we currently don\u2019t have a clear action focus on \u201cjob to be done with a well defined roadmap\u201d. Getting this right is key. I have so many questions (I am excited !) but here are a couple if you could shine some light on please     MarianoDP:  MakerDAO has historically underperformed on key announcements, and this is because we presented several pain points when planning and implementing a product communication strategy.  MakerDAO is a protocol without its own Front End. Partners with different roadmaps and backlogs. Uncoordinated Core Units.     When you say without its own Front End, are you referring to a section on the MakerDAO websites where we send traffic to?      MarianoDP:  KPIs to monitor progress and performance - We believe that the 4 macros KPIs below are a good start to monitoring our activities\u2019 performance. They may change over time depending on their relevance: 1. Number of announcements 2. Twitter metrics 3. Social Media Sentiment Analysis 4. Dai Holders (in line with the strategic activations) We are building a more granular set of KPIs to have the right level of monitoring of our work.    Who is going to be in charge of developing the measurement framework for KPIs? i.e. how we measure the impact of increased Twitter activity for example. One example comes to mind, for brand-focused activities \u201csentiment analysis\u201d and \u201cbrand health\u201d are good measures to look at. Will we use co-ordinate with internal CU such as the Data Science?      MarianoDP:  Given the pace of development in Maker, we believe that it is time to act now, that is why we are currently working with the following providers for the development of upcoming announcements and actions.    From my many years of working in Marcomms agencies, I know that agency relationship maintenance is a crucial point to get the best out of the work done. This is highly dependent on the scope of work contract. Unclear SOW has budgetary implications and quite easily put a halt to the work being done. Is this already in place or will you be working on this? A good brief is perhaps the most important piece for an agency to provide the right level of support. Can we have a read of the brief if it\u2019s already been done?  Many thanks in advance! ",

I believe that we need to propel the idea of Vaults as the product that gets the \u201cfeatures and updates\u201d instead of  \u201cthe Maker protocol\u201d so we can change the technical approach to a service approach. Also, this is why I was the first to propose having a MakerDAO Ethereum staking service directly implemented in our Vaults, because it allows us to keep improving the features of the vaults while also we are much more closer to the ETH Collateral. This is important because the further away we are from the actual ETH, the higher the dependence we have on other protocols , and dependency is something that we should try to avoid at all cost from a product perspective.
