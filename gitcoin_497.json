I was directed to the support channel on discord but for days i was begging for help and nobody reached out to help me. Luckly with determination i managed to figure it out but i feel sorry for the many many people who probably didnt get any help. I think we should have more active support members in the discord number #1. Also I realized alot of companies use Telegram. Gitcoin should start a Telegram group for sure ",
