In this game, the main character is leading us through each of the 5 levels, starting with level 1 - where you can read about The Greatest LARP in Comic book form, level 2-4 which are NFT auctions, and level 5 which is the \u201cyou win\u201d level.  The game starts with \u201cMoloch is winning\u201d and ends with \u201cthe good guys win\u201d.  The whole point of the game is the community has to coordinate to win the game. Read more about the game mechanics  here in this twitter thread.  Or checkout this video of Kevin announcing this game on stage here Here\u2019s what the levels look like:  FCOeqrKX0AASOwh1746\u00d7408 59 KB  Level 2 is an NFT auction on a bonding curve.   Here\u2019s how to play according to the copy on the site.  Moloch is made of coordination failures, and the only way to beat a monster like that \u2026 is more coordination. ETHBots are built to coordinate. They are configured by the community they serve to create coordination. They are the vessels through which humanity coordinates to defeat Moloch. To play this level, launch a new hero into the world by minting their NFT. Once 200 Digital ETHBots are minted (155 minted so far), and 3 Statue ETHBots are minted(4 minted so far), humanity can begin its fight against Moloch.  OK so TLDR - once 200 ETHBots are minted, then the community can get to the next level.  Awesome, we\u2019re 76% there right? Well\u2026 if you look at the price function on the level, youll see that the price grows exponentially over time as more units are sold.  Screen Shot 2021-10-22 at 4.14.13 AM1304\u00d7800 47.2 KB  Lets zoom in on where the community is now, at 155 units sold:  Screen Shot 2021-10-22 at 4.22.53 AM1284\u00d7778 65.8 KB  Looks like the current price for one of these ETHBots is 1.34 ETH, and the price will increasing to 6.6 ETH by the time 200 bots are minted. Will the community want too pay 1-6.6 ETH per NFT for the next 45 NFTs in order to beat the level?  womp womp womp Well, thats a great question.  And thats why the community built in a mechanism we call the \u201cwomp womp\u201d mechanism.  The \u201cwomp womp\u201d mechanism reduces the price by 10%.  Checkout the code here.  We call it womp womp because we think using the mechanism sounds like a sad trombone. Here\u2019s what the price curve looks like with 1 womp womp.  Screen Shot 2021-10-22 at 4.30.48 AM1284\u00d7796 65.7 KB  and here\u2019s what itd look like if womp womp\u2019s were applied every few days, but the community still purchased the NFTs every few days too.  Screen Shot 2021-10-22 at 4.31.10 AM1284\u00d7760 72.1 KB  TLDR: This mechanism is effectively a way to counter-balance the upward pressure of the price curve.  It is a release valve in case the curve is too steep.  How do we  use it? Which leaves us with the question:  should we use it?  if so, how should we use it? We\u2019d like to leave that question up to governance - at least getting rough consensus on how it should be used. To ground the discussion in the goals of the GreatestLARP project (and of broader GitcoinDAO, these are the stated goal of the project  spread the message as far and wide as possible raise money for public goods.  So far so good on both fronts, the project has raised $180k in funding for public goods and the comic has been read 100s of times. Some options for how the DAO proceeds on using \u201cwomp womp\u201d:  don\u2019t use it at all.  if the community doesnt consume the NFTs on current price curve, don\u2019t pass the level.  don\u2019t meet moloch. use it whenever there is not a sale for 24 hours. use it whenever there is not a sale for 7 days. some other proposal (pls comment below)  ",

Its possible that the final boss will happen at night time, or during a holiday (US Thanksgiving is coming up). Some ppl have come to me and told me that its important that for sale optics, it is important that we are able to co-market the final level together when the final boss goes live. This leads me to the following poll.  What should the final boss go-live policy be?     goes live as soon as level 3 is beaten. goes live the next business day, at 9am MST. goes live after 2 business days, at 9am MST. goes live after 3 business days, at 9am MST. goes live after 4 business days, at 9am MST. launch at the next moonshow collective monthly call on the 6th at 1pm MST     0 voters     For the purposes of the poll above, lets assume that holidays as defined by this calendar are not business days.  And that weekend days are not business days. ",
