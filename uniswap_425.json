                    "content": "Anyone read this story from Decrypt? https://decrypt.co/45060/defi-drama-defi-uniswap-governance-proposal-sparks-controversy Maybe I didn\u2019t look hard enough, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone mentioning it or discussing what\u2019s in Decrypts article. The future/direction of UNI may be at stake. If not UNI\u2019s future/direction at the very least the way UNI is governed and by whom. From the article: \u201cDharma on Monday proposed to lower the threshold for submitting a proposal to alter the network from 10 million UNI (about $31 million, or a tenth of the market cap) to 3 million (about $1 million). It also wants to lower the amount of UNI the community must stake to pass a vote from 40 million UNI (~$120 million) to 30 million (about $90 million).\u201d \u201cThe fear was that, should the proposal pass, Dharma, with backing from Gauntlet, would have enough power to follow through on its plans to use Uniswap\u2019s treasury funds to pay its own community.\u201d \u201cDharma says its users are entitled to the money.\u201d   Dharma wants to make it easier for Uniswap\u2019s community to govern the protocol.   But concerns abounded that this would let Dharma form a cartel.   \u201cYet others said, should the proposal pass when voting closes on October 19, it would be easier for Dharma and the other major proponent of the proposal, blockchain simulation company Gauntlet, to pass proposals, if they work together. That\u2019s because Dharma and Gauntlet are big bagholders of UNI.\u201d Both Dharma and Gauntlet have NOT responded to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment. In other words Uniswaps competitors may form a cartel and control Uniswaps future. How\u2019s those delegation votes given to Uniswaps competitors working out? Contact Decrypt if you have questions. I\u2019m just relaying what they wrote. ",
