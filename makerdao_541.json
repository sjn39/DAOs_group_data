Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  3F Delegate announces their vote and reasoning behind the support for RBLD Chime in your opinion on who should get the 10B Dai NFT!  Should RWF return their excess budget in Dai or MKR?    ICYMI - Announcements Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions - Real World Finance presents methodological criteria to evaluate the MIP6 structured finance transactions. It is intended to capture \u201cbest practice\u201d in the structured finance market and may be considered appropriate for onboarding real-world collateral into Maker vaults. The criteria are intended to guide potential applicants and the operational core units of Maker DAO. These criteria remain subject to change and further input from the Maker community. Please visit the post to view a complete breakdown of the criteria provided. Implementation of the new Data API - Data Insights announce their new Data API! They refactored the MCD Vault Tracker API and added cool new features. The team will resume an additional month of maintenance for the old API to allow migration. Some of the changes include: Back-end:  Improved experience and a more consistent and performant API The endpoint /vaults_list has been deprecated in favor of /current_state. The functionality remains the same; you can get the current state of a single or all vaults. The new endpoint /vault_snapshot allows you to query the state at a specific time in the past. In future releases, we will also allow for querying multiple vaults.  Data Query:  Governance: executives, polls, staking, proxies and delegates. Vaults: current & historical states as well as any transaction type. Liquidations: barks (liquidation triggers), auctions themselves and their evolution.  Their next steps are to increase the Protocol Parameter dataset, which will also be available via the API. Unified Auctions UI Release v0.5.1 - January 14th, 2022 - Sidestream Auction Services delivers another update for the Unified Auctions UI; They added UI support to the Goerli network and underwent some back-end clean up. In addition, they laid the foundation for additional services such as a new dashboard page that displays auction-related figures and parameters and further automation to the CI/CD pipeline.

You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Justin Sun borrowed 24k MKR from Aave - What began with Justin Sun borrowing 24,000 aMKRv2 only to suspiciously return it leads to a thread discussion on improving governance risk and voting requirements. This event also helped DUX develop a potential idea for the Governance Portal, which should help bring awareness and visibility to situations that might pose a danger to Maker governance. Follow the post for additional updates. Closing in on 10B, who should get the NFT? - As we inch closer to 10B Dai, one question remains\u2026 Who should get the 10B Dai NFT!? Many community members submitted their opinions and ideas, such as fractionalizing the NFT to Dai holders, distributing it to Dai minters, single-winner meme competition, and more! Chime in the discussion if you have any ideas on who should get the NFT. Returning excess budget from RWF in DAI or MKR? - A significant amount of liquidation triggered slippage on flap auction during December 4th, 2021. In response, mandated actors were suggested to withdraw funds to avoid more \u201cbad flap.\u201d Real World Finance used their funds to buy approximately 100 MKR, which converted those DAI at a much better rate than all-around flap auctions. @SebVentures now asks the community whether they should convert the MKR back to DAI and send them to the Surplus Buffer, which would incur a 5% slippage when burned, or send them to the DSPauseProxy for future use (or burn) by the DAO. The Utility of Collateral Applications (MIP6) and Greenlight Polls (MIP9) - @LongForWisdom creates a thread continuing the discussion from the Compound D3M Risk Assessment stating that GovAlpha believes delegates have the option to remove MIP6 and/or MIP9 using MIP4c4 if they feel that applications and greenlight polls are no longer useful. However, GovAlpha believes that there is a misunderstanding of the intentions and objectives of Community Greenlight Polls, which are supposed to help support Core Unit teams working on the asset(s). Product Discussion: NFTs as MakerDAO Collateral - Risk publishes a comprehensive overview of opportunities for Maker to begin serving the NFT lending market. By now, we all understand the significant market opportunity in the NFT space, which has seen incredible growth in 2021. However, NFTs are still second-class citizens within the DeFi space with sparse lending and collateral support, which presents an opportunity for Maker to capture market share in a lending sector likely to see high growth in the coming years. @monet-supply discusses the large addressable market that rivals some of Maker\u2019s key collateral assets and presents a simulation table of potential DAI generated through this approach. He also brings up the potential effects of tax implications on current NFT investors who may drive additional borrowing demand and portfolio rebalancing without selling their NFT holdings. The competition for NFTs as collateral is still low, which gives us an edge if we were to take on this opportunity. In addition, being a stablecoin protocol eliminates some of the liquidity issue mechanics that NFT owners face, which provides us a liquidity advantage. These are just some of many points presented by @monet-supply, who also discusses the challenges, NFT lending framework, system requirements, and more! Check out the post for an incredible and informative read on the NFT lending market.  Ongoing Discussions: \u2018Who said discussions should end after a week!?\u2019     Why are you passionate about Maker? Miscellaneous       Frank\u2013I heard that you want to be a delegate.

Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial - Signal Request Ends January 31st - \"The initial Signal Request that approved the Delegate Compensation Trial implemented a three-month trial period. During the trial period, we recognized that initial parameter requirements were too harsh and subsequently introduced the Performance Modifier to the trial via Signal Request, and this has been added to MIP61. As things stand, MIP61 has not been submitted for Formal Submission, as there are still a few changes being discussed. Consequently, January 2022 is the final month currently covered by the trial, and compensation for Recognized Delegates would cease after this month.\" In response to these events, @Patrick_J signals to the community by asking whether we should extend the Delegate Compensation Trial by a maximum of 6-months but end if MIP61 is approved.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

A public PDF version of this post is available here.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  Check out an analysis on the performance of the Collateral and Surplus auctions during Flappy Friday. Please, welcome the new Incubating Core Unit, Maker Academy!  Take a look and leave your feedback for the Governance-Boosted MKR token proposal.     ICYMI - Announcements Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 2022-01-27 With the outcome of recent events and volatility in the crypto market, it\u2019s important to bring light to today\u2019s Parameter Changes Proposal. Competitive Rates in DeFi have been pretty stable until last week\u2019s crash but have dropped significantly since then as borrowers deleverage their debt positions to protect against getting liquidated or reduce their long exposure in anticipation of bearish market sentiment. Similarly, funding rates on Centralized exchanges fell and are holding close to 2 years lows at 3.07% currently on Binance. Aside from the changes on the overall Lending Market, there has also been a huge DAI supply through the USDC-PSM, pushing the stablecoin ratio from ~50% to ~62%, and we, therefore, propose to lower the rates across the board for non-stable-assets and LP-vault-types to stimulate DAI minting. Below are the proposed changes: (Please visit the original post for more information on these proposed changes)  ETH-A: decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 2.50% to 2.25% WBTC-A: decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 4.00% to 3.75% ETH-B: decrease Stability Fee by 2.50% from 6.50% to 4.00% WBTC-B: decrease Stability Fee by 2.00% from 7.00% to 5.00% WBTC-C: decrease Stability Fee by 0.75% from 1.50% to 0.75% AAVE-D3M: decrease Target Borrow Rate (bar) by 0.25% from 3.75% to 3.50% WSTETH-A: decrease Stability Fee by 0.50% from 3.00% to 2.50% GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: decrease Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 500 MM to 100 MM GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A: decrease Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.50% to 0.25%, increase Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 500 MM to 750 MM, and increase Target Available Debt (gap) from 10 MM to 50 MM UNIV2DAIETH-A: decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 2.00% to 1.00% UNIV2WBTCETH-A: decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 3.00% to 2.00% UNIV2USDCETH-A: decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 2.50% to 1.50% TUSD-A: decrease Stability Fee by 1.00% from 1.00% to 0.00%  Revenue Effects: The PPG anticipate the effect on annualized revenue - assuming stable levels of utilization - to be:  -5.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on ETH-A -2.4 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-A -1.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on ETH-B -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-B -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WBTC-C +2.5 MM by the Target Borrow Rate decrease on AAVE-D3M -0.2 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on WSTETH-A -0.1 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2DAIETH-A -0.0 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2WBTCETH-A -0.1 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on UNIV2USDCETH-A -0.3 MM by the Stability Fee decrease on TUSD-A (note: is already undercollateralized and will be negated as soon the vaults are liquidated)  The proposed changes, if confirmed, should decrease yearly revenue by about 6.7 MM DAI. Data API 1.1.0: Introducing Protocol Parameters @data-insights-cu have a freshly baked dataset that focuses on the parameters of the protocol. From collateral-specific parameters to system-wide parameters. You can filter the data by parameter name, collateral, or by date, allowing you to answer the following questions and more:  What were the protocol parameters at this date? What impact or changes did this executive vote have on the protocol? What were the historical values of this parameter for this collateral?  They provided three new endpoints:  parameter_list: list of all available parameters parameter_snapshot: the value of the parameter parameter_events: the change in value for the parameter  You can pair any of your datasets and analyses with a good glass wine the parameters dataset to understand the effect of spells on the protocol. They have improved the governance dataset and provided a dedicated endpoint for spells. We\u2019ve included an item called \u201cimpact,\u201d which lets you know how many protocol parameters it has impacted. Other additions to the API include a new executives endpoint; while the original one allows you to get all events related to the executive, the new one acts as a summary of all available executives, including their human-readable title! On the State of the Auctions UIs These past days of high market volatility (i.e., Flappy Friday) have painfully pointed out that the state of UIs built for interacting with auctions (CLIP, FLAP, and FLOP auctions) is fragmented, somewhat deprecated, and clunky. With this thread, we hope to clarify the state of these UIs, where they are going and lastly, announce some short-term measures to increase the discoverability of the appropriate UIs for end-users. Right now, there are three UIs in the MakerDAO ecosystem that allows for interacting with auctions\u2014varying in functionality and user-friendliness. This is confusing to users, especially given the lack of documentation/clarity on how/when to use these UIs, which are detailed in the original post. While @sidestream-core-unit is building out their new Unified Auctions UI during this transition period, it is yet a feature parity. By identifying this transitionary period, @dux-core-unit decided to target the low-hanging fruit of improving the discoverability of UIs; In collaboration with @lukass of the @sidestream-core-unit, the @dux-core-unit have defined a couple of short-term measures that would increase the discoverability of the right UIs for end-users.   @dux-core-unit adds a banner to the old Liquidations Portal, informing users of the newly built Unified Auctions UI.  @sidestream-core-unit adds banners/indicators to ilks that are not yet supported by the new Unified Auctions UI, redirecting users to the old Liquidations Portal. Throughout MakerDAO\u2019s websites and documentation, @dux-core-unit makes sure to point users to the Unified Auctions UI 4\u2014this page serves as a landing page for all things auctions, given that it includes explainers and up-to-date links to all relevant resources. This includes makerdao.com, makerdao.world, vote.makerdao.com, etc. Through the Collateral Management for OnChain (CMON) initiative, the @dux-core-unit continues to work through this transition phase until @sidestream-core-unit is ready to fully own the domain of auction UIs\u2014@dux-core-unit can then decide on the fate of the older UIs and their URLs.  Visit the original post for some more details on the new Unified Auctions UI. Flappy Friday - CLIP and FLAP Analysis Friday was one for the history books, another stress test of the liquidation system, not dissimilar to the COVID market meltdown of March 2020. The protocol performed quite well, processing $134MM of liquidations through the improved Liquidations 2.0 system without any major issue. This liquidation event was the largest in MakerDAO\u2019s history. As a result, approximately 15.5MM in penalty fees were collected and sent to the Surplus Buffer. During this time, a few Core Units took the opportunity to claim their budgets while the rest of the excess surplus was sent to buy and burn MKR through Surplus Auctions. The RISK Core Unit put out a timely analysis on the performance of the Collateral and Surplus auctions showing:  \u2026that collateral auctions performance was good in terms of outcome for Maker as all penalty fees got collected, but less efficient when looking at the amount of collateral received back by certain larger vault owners that got liquidated. As for FLAP\u2019s (surplus auctions), the slippage or the auction inefficiency was much lower than initially expected, thanks to community bidding through Flap UI and helping protocol avoid 0 bids.  The report covers many specific details of Friday\u2019s auctions, including specific coverage of the largest concern early in the day regarding the 7-siblings vault owner that had 632m debt at risk, as well as the eventual Flap Auction performance that incurred larger-than-acceptable slippage.  the (surplus auction) bids were not as efficient as they normally are (on average, about 3-4% slippage measured historically). The effective slippage of these auctions was 19.55% which means protocol overspent about 2.5m DAI for MKR collected. Assuming regular slippage of 3-4%, the inefficiency cost of this event measures about 2.1m.  Follow-up governance actions are pending. Recognized Delegate, @Ultraschuppi posted an Urgent Signal Request to temporarily deactivate MKR burn by setting the Surplus Buffer to 250MM. This is intended as a short-term action to buy the DAO time for determining the wisest next steps. Some options include; rate-limiting surplus auctions, converting them to the dutch auction mechanism(Liquidations 2.0), and longer-term solutions like reconsidering the tokenomics of the burn mechanism itself. Cayman Islands and the EU AML High Risk Third Countries List The Maker protocol\u2019s Real World Finance program continues to attract potential asset originators from Europe and other jurisdictions. As the Real World Finance Core Unit, with the support of Legal, reviews potential structures to adopt real-world assets into the Maker vault, @Real-World-Finance will need to be attuned to regulatory developments in various jurisdictions. The European Union recently proposed to add the Cayman Islands to the list of \u201chigh-risk countries.\u201d As noted in the Maples link provided below: \u201cAmendments made to the EU Securitisation Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 on April 9th, 2021 affect the use of special purpose vehicles (\u201cSPVs\u201d) established in non-EU jurisdictions included on the EU AML List. Accordingly, specific advice should be taken by affected EU entities concerning securitizations (defined in the EU Securitisation Regulation) which use Cayman Islands SPVs.\u201d Maker Academy: New Incubating Core Unit Maker Academy is a new incubating core unit under SES\u2019s incubation program. Core Unit Introduction:  Maker Academy will strive to be the go-to source of education regarding MakerDAO. Learners of MakerDAO will no longer be presented with a conflicting, fragmented, and unorganized body of information. Maker Academy will become an essential part of onboarding by leveraging its future, active community of MakerDAO learners to create a pool of potential hires. Maker Academy will also specialize in making onboarding content for each core unit. Maker Academy plans to both produce educational content and facilitate the production of it. Maker Academy will guide creators in making exceptionally clear and concise content, accomplished by following the highest standards of communication and pedagogy. Maker Academy will encourage knowledge-sharing amongst the core units to aggregate their documentation, new discoveries, and other relevant information in one easy-to-find place.  Facilitator Introduction:  Colby Anderson has a strong background in pedagogy/education, previous experience in project management, and in-depth technical knowledge of computer science and finance that gives me the ability to create and curate the highest quality educational material about blockchains/DeFi. 4 years studying pedagogy/epistemology, three years studying computer science and blockchains, two years studying finance/DeFi, two years in project management, 0.5 years with MakerDAO Discord: colbyanderson#8887  What\u2019s Next?  Our first goal is to create the Maker Academy website that will host all of our educational material. Maker Academy plans to already have a few pieces of content when they release our MVP. They will have a more official introduction of our core unit after the release of the MVP. If the MVP generates a positive response, they plan to move forward with our MIP submissions.  Call to Action:  Maker Academy needs more employees to accomplish our goals. They need a front end developer and a content producer.

Collateral Management Lifecycle (CML) Since the inception of CES, managing Maker protocol collateral as a product has become a central theme: MIP39c2-SP12, MIP39c2-SP20, and Collateral Engineering Services Product Plan. Now that @collateral-core-unit has successfully hired a team and is operational, the focus shifts to the formation and execution of the product plan. To achieve the CES mandate, \u201cScale the Dai supply by enabling anyone to onboard collateral in a stable and cost-effective manner,\u201d it is imperative @collateral-core-unit manage collateral as a product and introduce what we refer to as the Collateral Management Lifecycle (CML). When @collateral-core-unit reduces the CML to the basics, several distinct Lifecycle Initiatives reinforce the Maker protocol\u2019s CES mandate and continuing requirements.  Support the ongoing onboarding needs of On Chain (crypto native) collateral. Architect and implement Off-Chain (real-world assets) collateral solutions to aggressively onboard and scale Dai. Enable a portion of prospective collateral to be onboarded using individuals, partners, and/or intermediaries. Maintain and operationalize all collateral within the Maker protocol. Support the entire collateral lifecycle with Product Management best practices.  Currently, the Maker protocol comprises two main types of collateral: on-chain and off-chain. It is important to note while both types of collateral follow the same CML, there are differences in the implementation details, and with that in mind, @collateral-core-unit are developing the CML to encompass all collateral types while addressing the specific needs of the assets. Check out the original post for a thorough breakdown of the CML\u2019s processes, deliverables, operations, and goals.  Looking for more posts and updates?

You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 [Informal Poll] RWA Borrowers to Pay for Maker\u2019s External Legal Costs It is a common market practice that the borrower pays for the lender\u2019s counsel to prepare financing documents. These amounts may be subsequently financed under the financing documents, enabling the borrower to finance such external legal costs. If the financing never closes, the borrower assumes these external legal costs at its risk. As the Maker community seeks to scale the Real World Finance program, the Real World Finance Core Unit and the Maker community must support external counsel. This is commercially standard practice. To that end, this Poll seeks Maker community support of the approach that borrowers be required to pay for Maker\u2019s external legal support. To manage the borrower\u2019s costs, it is proposed that overall transaction legal fees be divided as follows:  Fees incurred by Maker: External legal review of agreements relating to legal entities specific to interacting with the Maker protocol (e.g., Delaware statutory trust or similar legal entity required for financing through the Maker protocol). Fees incurred by Borrower: All other external legal reviews associated with the transaction (e.g., legal due diligence, financing agreements, etc.). External counsel can easily allocate their time on the above basis. Borrowers may object to this approach to add to their transaction costs. However, it is common market practice. Further, it will ensure that borrowers carefully review their budgets and structures before engaging with Maker. Borrowers may want to have an external counsel of their choice. This is not acceptable. Borrowers may be incentivized to find low-cost, inexperienced counsel.  In the first instance, there can be more recommendations for the borrowers to consider. It may also be acceptable for borrowers to present two or more law firms for consideration regarding any transaction. In any event, the final selection should have lender alignment. As we continue to provide legal support to the Real World Finance Core Unit, we will coordinate with the Real World Finance Core Unit to review the proposed firms and together will reach a collaborative decision on which firm to choose based on (1) relevant lawyer transaction experience, (2) comparative cost, and (3) ability to execute a transaction on the proposed timeline. Thoughts on increasing the difficulty of a successful governance attack With everything that has happened, it\u2019s easy to forget that just last week, we were shown that a sufficiently motivated actor with enough collateral could at a low cost get hold of enough MKR to be able to affect the governance process and, in some cases even get enough to dictate it. This is detrimental to the long-term stability of Maker. The recent routs in the markets have only lowered these costs and made it easier to borrow most tokens and buy the rest. The following gives an overview of MKR in governance at the time of writing:  Around 75k MKR usually decides proposals. Most of the votes are cast by the recognized delegates. Between them, recognized delegates have 77k MKR  There is a total of 9 recognized delegates The largest Delegate controls 42% of all recognized delegate votes, the second-largest 26%, and the third-largest 13%   Shadow delegates have 21k MKR between them  There are a total of 11 shadow delegates The largest shadow delegate controls 8% of all delegated votes, the second-largest 6%, and the third-largest 5% Shadow delegates vote infrequently   Votes coming from outside delegates are minuscule compared to delegated vote, rarely breaking 2k MKR.  As we saw, gaining 40k MKR is easily possible in the open market. This means that such an actor alone, with support from a few actors inside the protocol, could sway the vote in whatever direction desired. It also means that decisions are largely determined by what the three largest delegates determine. Overall that leaves very few failure points for this vector of attack. The long-term solution is to increase the incentives for MKR holders to get involved in governance. There has been one great thread discussing that, and there has also been discussion about lock-in periods or giving MKR more voting power for being locked up longer. My opinion is that the root cause is still too many disincentives for the MKR holder to have it participate in governance. While we address the root cause, we think there might be a shorter-term solution to make the protocol more robust in the face of governance attacks. The key is in the MKR treasury. We could utilize MKR held in the treasury by placing it in some form of delegation. Some of the MKR in treasury is committed for vesting, but at least 50k is freely available in the short and medium-term (2-3 years). Delegation does not transfer any ownership and is freely able to be withdrawn for practical purposes should the need arise. I\u2019ve thought of several possible configurations.  Delegating parts of the treasury to Recognized Delegates as an even sum per Delegate. As an example, 3k MKR. Immediately increases the barrier to governance attack by 27k MKR Decreases the relative voting power between the delegates Must make provisions for what happens when new delegates join or quit and whether there should be other requirements to qualify (i.e., performance metrics, length of time served, the minimum number of MKR delegated) Increases relative voting power to recognized delegates at the expense of shadow delegates and undelegated actors Must maintain a reserve of MKR in the treasury to add more delegates or redistribute at certain points. Delegating parts of the treasury to recognized delegates on a pro-rate to the numbers they already have delegated. Example 30k MKR total, 42% to largest Delegate, 26% to second largest, etc.  Immediately increases the barrier to governance attacks by 30k Maintains the relative voting power between delegates Must make provisions for what happens when new delegates join or quit, when delegates either get more or less MKR delegated, and whether there should be other criteria to qualify (i.e., performance metrics, length of time served, the minimum number of MKR delegated) Increases relative voting power to recognized delegates at the expense of shadow delegates and undelegated actors   Creating a treasury voting proxy and delegating a set amount to it. Example 50k MKR.  Maintains relative voting powers between all MKR holders, except in cases where this delegation is deemed necessary. Must make provisions for who controls the treasury votes and under what circumstances they will be deployed. Potentially slower to react as it will not be a regular part of governance    The different parameters within each configuration merit their discussions, but we wanted to provide a framework to start from. gbMKR, a proposal to benefit long-term MKR holders Instead of voting with MKR, as is done today, this proposal suggests gbMKR (governance-boosted MKR) replace MKR in governance voting. MKR would be locked up to 4 years in a contract to mint gbMKR. The current Maker governance system allows any holder of the MKR token to vote on proposals that have meaningful long-term effects on the protocol. gbMKR improves on existing MKR governance by empowering long-term token holders. Instead of voting with the token amount, MKR tokens are lockable in a VotingEscrow for a selectable lock time t1, where t1 < tmax, and tmax = 4 years. After locking, the time left to unlock is t \u2264 t1. The voting weight is equal to: w = a*t/tmax. The voting power of gbMKR decreases linearly as a function of time since lock. For example, when a user sets a four-year lock for some amount of gbMKR - that amount has an initial 100% voting weight. After one year, the weight will be 75%; after two years, the weight will be 50%. gbMKR holders must continually extend their lock time to maintain voting weight. gbMKR is a non-transferable token. However, as pointed out by YFI, this can be \u201cbypassed via wrapped derivatives such as the Yearn yveCRV vault or Convex\u2019s cvxCRV product.\u201d As additional consideration, users could unlock their gbMKR back into MKR before the set lock time. The tradeoff for the early unlock would be an MKR penalty distributed back to the other gbMKR holders. @paraficapital mentions potential engineering considerations by proposing a Mandate for Maker Developers to create the components at their discretion. In addition, they will provide future considerations that give gbMKR token holders a governance boost but no additional economic incentives. The following could be implemented later to introduce further incentives. @paraficapital welcome any feedback and would like for the community to discuss this proposal and incorporate items as needed. They plan to have a signal vote before moving on-chain. In defense of bigger Surplus Buffer In this short write-up, @krzkaczor wants to personally convince our dear Maker holders why increasing Surplus Buffer is the right strategy to ensure the long-term growth of the protocol. Big Surplus Buffer fuels future protocol growth by allowing us to get involved in riskier endeavors without risking flop auctions. There are many riskier activities that DAO can do, which have the independent risk of total failure. Debt ceilings of the size of the whole surplus buffer can be used to cap exposure for each of these. This way, we can prevent these activities from becoming an existential threat to the protocol yet still tap into new markets. @krzkaczor believes that Maker is in the place where we shouldn\u2019t seek short-sighted gains by burning MKR but rather reinvest in growth. Increasing SB is the simplest way to do that. This doesn\u2019t mean a decrease in MKR price. By focusing on future growth, the value of MKR should increase in the eyes of many investors. A perfect example here is Amazon, which never issued any dividends, but it is still one of the most valuable stocks in the world. Burning MKR now is like preferring cents today rather than millions in a few years. If you support this idea, please vote in favor of a high SB in any future governance voting. 250M recently voted in is fine for now, in my opinion, but we shouldn\u2019t be burning MKR again anytime soon.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn Signal Request Ends February 4th With the executive vote that was recently scheduled, we are going to have the Surplus Buffer set to 250 MM so no further burning will happen anytime soon (discussion). This has been done as a counteraction of the events of last friday is meant as a short term fix. @hexonaut from the Protocol Engineering Team already has drafted a more sustainable solution that has the potential to be activated on mainnet soon. This will introduce rate limiting into the Flapper, limiting the number of parallel auctions. However, multiple ideas of replacing the current Flapper have been floating around in the past. In response, @ultraschuppi submits a Signal Request to find out whether the community would like to either (A) do nothing and not burn any more MKR until we have a long term solution in place, or (B) introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper and bring back MKR burning as soon as possible. Offloading TUSD-A Signal Request Ends February 4th A discussion and signal-request submitted over a year ago passed and set the Debt Ceiling of TUSD-A to 0 DAI. Today, there is still about ~26MM DAI of outstanding debt, and the increase of the Stability Fee to 1% has not changed anything. In response, @ultraschuppi offers three options as potential changes to TUSD-A and asks the community whether they want to:  Offload to a new TUSD-PSM with a DC of 0. Activate liquidations on TUSD-A keepers. Keep as is and do nothing.  Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial Signal Request Ends January 31st The initial Signal Request that approved the Delegate Compensation Trial implemented a three-month trial period. We recognized that initial parameter requirements were too harsh and subsequently introduced the Performance Modifier via Signal Request, which has been added to MIP61. As things stand, MIP61 has not been formally submitted, as there are still a few changes being discussed. Consequently, January 2022 is the final month currently covered by the trial, and compensation for Recognized Delegates would cease after this month. In response to these events, @Patrick_J asks whether we should extend the Delegate Compensation Trial by a maximum of 6-months and end it when MIP61 is ratified.

Two-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  Check out the newly-launched Maker Operational Manual!  MakerDAO | 2021 Recap and Looking ahead into 2022    ICYMI - Announcements Announcing Maker Operational Manual - It\u2019s great to see more of @Gala on the forums with GovAlpha, announcing the launch of the Maker Operational Manual! The Manual aims to become the main source of information and documentation to make Governance more accessible and navigatable for the whole community. This will continue to be an ongoing initiative that is open to community feedback and help. StableSims: Optimizing MakerDAO Liquidations 2.0 Incentives via Agent-Based Modeling - @akirillo and @sehyun, both members of Blockchain at Berkeley announce their research project, StableSims, where they created a simulation of the Dai stablecoin system and sought to optimize the Liq 2.0 incentive parameters, chip and tip. Their key results show that it is more cost-effective to increase tip as opposed to chip. They publically provide both their research paper and simulation code, asking only to show some love and make use of their open-source code for further development.

You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 [Discussion] Utilizing USDC in the PSM - @GWintery directs community focus back to the case for USDC-backed Dai and potential fear of USDC blacklisting by initiating discussion on ideas and efforts to reduce our dependency on USDC. @GWintery presents a few ideas, such as reducing USDC in the PSM, auctioning USDC in exchange for ETH, and utilizing USDC yield for protocol expenses.  P.S., check out today\u2019s Governance and Risk call, which will contain an in-depth discussion on potential next steps for USDC-backed Dai.  NUTS & BOLTS: RWA, Trustees & Attestors - @Allan_Pedersen publishes a comprehensive post breaking down the Maker Trusts/Foundations and the trustee role and introduces a potential attestor role in a Maker Trust. He analyzes the differences between the conventional BOT (Board of Trustees) and another kind of trustee called PCTs (Professional Corporate Trustees):  BOTs \u201ccome with serious fiduciary responsibilities and duties. Usually, the appointed parties for these roles are experienced and skilled individuals. BOTs are used as best judgment to provide direction and leadership for the underlying charity/fund/whatnot and accept substantive fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d PCTs offer \u201cservices provided by professional service companies and law firms - and sometimes private banks/wealth managers. They provide the service of acting as a trustee for a trust/foundation/whatnot. They operate under a very clear, almost mechanical, \u201cletter of instruction\u201d from the trust\u2019s beneficiaries to execute certain tasks on their behalf. The PCT will NOT want to make any value judgments nor make any decisions on behalf of the trust.\u201d  The general structure we use in RWA to represent the interests of Maker and act on Maker\u2019s behalf in the RWA world, which requires a PCT instead of a BOT. This results in defined limits in what a Trustee can do for Maker, which constitutes the question of \u2018whom to ask if in doubt or certain requests are made to the trust\u2019 whereas it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for such these decisions to require Maker forum polls or MKR token votes. Therefore,  there is a need for a decision-making entity/role in-between the PCT action-set and the decisions that do indeed require MKR vote to ensure a smooth operation of the Maker Trust.  In response to the summary above, @Allan_Pedersen introduces the Potential Attestor Role in a Maker Trust that will be properly appointed and given responsibilities to help implement on actions and decisions that a PCT cannot. Check out the post for more juicy information on the Attestor Role!    Ongoing Discussions: \u2018Who said discussions should end after a week!?\u2019  Why are you passionate about Maker?
