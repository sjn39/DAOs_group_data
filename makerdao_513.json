ICYMI - Announcements RWA - 6s - 2022 - a time to start walking - @mrabino1 published a comprehensive four-part update on the future and roadmap of 6S and the community. They utilize the \u2018crawl, walk, and run\u2019 approach and announce that it\u2019s time to transition to start walking. In order to help develop appropriate objectives for 2022, the posts begin by looking forward into the far future of what the DAO and DeFi construct may look like; where are we headed as a community from both 6S\u2019 and MakerDAO\u2019s perspective? As we are reeled back into the present, at the beginning of 2022, @mrabino1 further defines the agenda for 6S\u2019 roadmap, which covers their intentions, strategy, objectives for growth and scaling, mission, clarity, and quantifiable portfolio targets. 6S also has strong intentions to implement the Case for Clean Money into their growth plan. Below are links to all four posts and their financial covenants: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Financial Covanents MakerDAO Budget Simulator - 11+1 Revenue & Cash Flow Forecast - @Aes coming in as usual and providing us Maker\u2019s annual revenue and cash-flow forecast, which includes all existing and prospective Core Units along with their budgets and expenses. We forecasted to finish 2021 at nearly 13x 2020 FY revenue, and the rolling 12-month forecast is even more favorable due to an increase in ETH-A and W-BTC SF rates. Check out the post for additional access to a detailed breakdown of actual expenses and the budget simulator. Delegate Compensation Breakdown - December 2021 - GovAlpha publishes December\u2019s Delegate compensations for our 9 Recognized Delegates. The total payout for December is 48,290 Dai compared to November\u2019s payout of 35,834 Dai. This leads to an annualized projection of about 500,000 Dai (which does require more months of data to confirm). Unified Auctions UI Release v0.4.0 - December 24, 2021 - Sidestream Auction Services announced their next SAS release, which includes the implementation of a Twitter bot that informs about auction starts. They are planning to continuously increase the bot\u2019s scope and have it tweet, for example, about auctions that are close to becoming profitable in the future. They also made further improvements on the UX of their collateral auction tool and also made invisible improvements to our CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous delivery) pipeline.

Active Discussions  \u2018What\u2019s going on? You think what?! You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Research-Driven Insights About DAO Governance - @Andrew_Hall, a political economy professor at Stanford who studies governance and solutions, shares his team\u2019s research-driven insights for Maker governance. The discussion presents three central DAO governance challenges, aligning incentives with stakeholders, increasing MKR participation, improving the delivery of information and expertise, and finishing off with potential next steps. @Andrew_Hall is seeking community feedback to help improve and initiate this project. Rocking the DeFi Chasm #2, #3, and #4 - @flipflopflapdelegate continues to help rock the DeFi chasm by publishing three more parts to the topic. He talks about complacency risks and conquering L2\u2019s through mergers and acquisitions. Rocking the DeFi Chasm #3 asks whether DeFi KPI goals are possible and what we can do if the DAO airdropped MakerBreaker for further decentralization. It includes the origin of Breaker and its memenomics, tying in how Maker can utilize this psychology through MKR airdrops from the treasury. As the third post ends off with KPIs goals for DeFi, his fourth post focuses on Maker\u2019s competitive MOAT, Dai network effects, and whether it has achieved desired growth and virility through Dai as our core product.

He also presents a set of requirements for claiming said bounty and asks the community whether MakerDAO should sponsor a 40,000 Dai bounty for a framework to solicit, disseminate, and act on legal advice.
