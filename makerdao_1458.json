Relevant Links: Charting a Path for RWAS - The Case for Continuity  A North Star - DAI as the Destination  Tokenizing Real World Assets With MakerDAO\u2019s Teej Ragsdale - Podcast Preamble: \u201cCharting a Path for RWAs - The Case For Continuity\u201d (Part 1) sought to position RWAs within the history of Maker. Whereas Part 1 was anchored in the past, Part 2 will orient us towards the future. The music is stopping, or at the very least slowing. As US rates rise, dollar inflation persists, and recessionary fears set in, capital markets may slowly contract, leaving trillions in high-quality assets stranded. The Eurozone and Japan are facing the combination of high inflation and high indebtedness. Ukraine/Russia are embroiled in war while China is experiencing bank runs. As the dollar strengthens, the already thin EM credit markets are getting even thinner. As liquidity leaves the system, we realize that what comes next may be a departure from what we\u2019re used to. But with great change comes great opportunity. Being further out on the risk curve, crypto is no exception of course. Crypto assets and the desire to borrow them have been battered. Just as Maker\u2019s crypto lending business dries up due to low demand for leverage, Maker\u2019s real world financing business stands to benefit greatly from these macro developments. Due to its nimble, transparent balance sheet and low cost of capital, Maker can fill the vacuum left by traditional players exiting stage left. Maker\u2019s superpower is in its sovereign, flexible balance sheet\u2014it can effectively arbitrage the delta between crypto and real world rates, remaining antifragile to environmental changes. This flexibility is, of course, a function of how \u201csticky\u201d DAI is as money, which in turn is a function of DAI\u2019s network effects. Networks grow reflexively\u2014our RWA footprint both contributes to and is constrained by our network effects. Demand to hold DAI, a North Star for the protocol, emerges from a wide, dense money network. Amidst the noise, both inside and outside of Maker, it is easy to forget the significance of what we\u2019re doing here. We have a generational opportunity to build a parallel but independent financial system from scratch. One that ledgers and finances the best collateral, crypto or RWAs in an open and efficient way. One based on merit rather than status. Maker will reclaim the promise of DeFi: to transform finance through the fundamental strengths of crypto\u2014incentivizing truth and coordinating agents towards common ends. For us to achieve this grand vision, the House of DAI must expand to make room for not just individuals but also businesses around the world. Executive Summary As we envision what a sturdy House of DAI looks like in 2030, RWAs will be a core pillar. As such, this post will divided into three sections:   Case: Why are RWAs in fact core to the protocol\u2019s success?   Long-Term: What is the long-term vision/strategy for RWAs?   Short-Term: What is the short-term strategy that facilitates the pathway to long-term success?    1600\u00d7432 283 KB  CASE \u201cB2C over-collateralized crypto lending is a red ocean: it is a competitive business that is commoditizing before our eyes. Acquisition is expensive, churn is fairly high, and marginal revenue will trend toward zero. It\u2019s time to look beyond the end of our noses and start positioning for the next source of demand for on-chain credit\u201d - A North Star - DAI as the Destination How to Build Good Money To succeed as money, DAI must generate a network effect. A network effect is a similar concept to economies of scale, but pertains to the demand side (user/customer) rather than the supply side (company). A network effect, jargon emanating from dominant Web2 companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, explains that the value or utility a user derives from a good or service is a function of how many other parties are using it. Not only does each incremental user enhance the utility for those already plugged in, but he or she prompts new participants to join. Due to their self-reinforcing effect and subsequent monopoly positioning, dominant networks are very difficult to compete with or kickstart. The Dutch Guilder and US Dollar rose to dominance via a network effect - a potent combination of strong domestic exports and, for the US Dollar, the adoption of an \u201copen-sourced\u201d ledger based accounting for money \u2013 in effect, the Eurodollar. When export demand is high, a country denominates payment for products in its native currency, increasing desirability, liquidity, and stickiness of that money. In the case of the US Dollar, exports combined with the ability of financial institutions to transact with one another in a dollar-based accounting system. Once past a certain threshold, a network effect and the perks that come along with it have been achieved. The product, in Maker\u2019s case a suite of credit vaults across different chains and the real world, must of course be maintained and upgraded. But as the network grows, it becomes easier and easier to attract the incremental user. As confidence in DAI and the collateral that backs it rises, our flexibility, liquidity, and thus power as an issuer grows. If Maker is to succeed, it will need many trade routes through which to create and export DAI. To constrain our collateral base only to crypto assets would be like exporting only to risky, highly volatile and non-diversified markets, while ignoring those markets and sectors that will generate the highest and most sustained demand for DAI.  1246\u00d7692 752 KB  The value of crypto-assets (crypto collateral) is < $1T, while the value of just real estate, fixed income, and equities is >$600T. If harnessed with any traction, this universe of collateral:    Expands DAI\u2019s total addressable market.     Stabilizes and enhances revenue generation for Maker     Embeds DAI and Maker with increased resilience to crypto-market shocks     Spreads counterparty risk across many RWA operators and away from BitGo/Circle     Accelerates DAI\u2019s network effect    Do MKR token holders want to be a big fish in a small crypto-only bowl? Or do MKR token holders want to super-charge the potential power of DAI across asset classes and jurisdictions and force institutional and market-changes? Do we want DAI to be a stablecoin or do we want it to be money? Now that we understand the quantitative benefits of RWA collateral to DAI\u2019s competitive position as money, let\u2019s move to the fuzzier stuff. Anyone can do the math\u2026visualize the first\u2013order effects. But it\u2019s the abstract, long-term strategy that will continue to set us apart. After spending the better part of a year thinking about RWAs at Maker, I\u2019ve gathered some non-intuitive takeaways that folks on the outside may not have considered. Red Tape: The Elephant in the Room In the wake of Terra\u2019s unwind, Celsius\u2019 bankruptcy, and BlockFi\u2019s last-moment revival, regulation waits in the wings. The question is not if DeFi becomes regulated, but how. As such, DeFi\u2019s mood towards bureaucrats will go from one of indifference to one of existential concern\u2014people just don\u2019t realize it yet. Rather than sitting idly by, hoping helplessly that this torrent of uncertainty passes us by, we should set an example for our peers. We\u2019re well past the days when it was game-theoretically optimal to operate in the shadows. And so the question becomes: how do we structure ourselves such that we\u2019re antifragile to this new player\u2019s entry into the game? A regulator\u2019s charge, very broadly, is to protect consumers, promote competition, and ensure the financial viability of businesses. In light of these motivations, a logical way to conduct our affairs would be to A) maximize Maker\u2019s systemic significance and B) ensure that the scope Maker\u2019s businesses incorporates the needs of normal consumers and businesses. Systemic Signficance: A DeFi application that operates at a significant scale is systemically relevant to the economy. In this case, If a regulator cuts too deeply, hindering its victim\u2019s ability to operate, such heavy-handedness could reverberate into the economy. Scope: A DeFi application that is used by regular consumers and businesses will be, all else equal, more protected from the sword of the regulator. An application deemed to only support an esoteric niche, such as crypto-natives, will be treated more harshly. (HVB is also strategic because it ties Maker with US-based SMBs, the engine of the US economy) I think Maker, as is, is actually well positioned to deal with regulatory pressures. Regulators will be especially sensitive towards vulnerabilities/exploits, unregistered securities, opacity, and circular business models. Fittingly, Maker stands up well against these vectors of scrutiny. With that said, because RWAs directly address both Systemic Signficance and Scope, they\u2019ll materially buttress the protocol against regulatory incursions. Without RWAs, a regulator may make the argument, albeit facile, that Maker doesn\u2019t affect the real world. Brand Brand matters. Especially for money. To date, Maker has piloted its brand well\u2014soundness, security, and transparency. But Maker\u2019s reputation for shrewdness is cloistered to DeFi\u2014the real world is yet to grasp Maker\u2019s potential, let alone that it exists. With the onboarding of SocGen and HVB, however, this is changing quickly. Maker vaults and DAI must be universal\u2014facilitating value creation everywhere. In many sectors of the economy, across many jurisdictions, in both cyberspace and meatspace. Not vulnerable to any one shock, an ecumenical DAI is a strong DAI. It is time to bring trust-minimization and ultimately, efficiency, to real world asset markets. As we build the rails from the House of DAI to the real world, the resulting network effect puts the Old boy network of the past out of business. And in this way, RWAs drive Maker forward: like any money, DAI is an expression of the values of its issuer. Back to Our Roots: Making an Impact on the World To me, a primary long-term advantage of DeFi lies in the relationship between truth and markets. When information is more accessible (availability) or more accurate (fidelity), more market activity occurs. (Market txs increase information as well) This is because, with better information, market participants can more comfortably price risk and thus there is more competition for the same pool of assets. This competition drives cheaper financing which increases access to capital for more users/businesses, democratizing credit markets. We know this dynamic plays out in crypto, so why not apply it to credit assets in the real world? One of the criticism of RWAs is that they will somehow contaminate Maker\u2019s essence. While it is natural to resist change, I think this concern is misguided and will, if left unaddressed, undermine Maker. Just as alloyed steel (iron + carbon) is stronger than iron ore, a Maker with RWAs and crypto-collateral is more powerful. As per the advent of Maker, we should continue driving financial inclusion by innovating and and exploring where our competitors are not. By maintaining ideological purism with regard to investable collateral, we actually cap the impact we might have on the world. To build something that matters, we must grow outside of our comfort zone. Whereas first Maker sought to bring credit to retail, now it must bring credit to businesses. And actually, by focusing on wholesale or B2B lending, Maker can more efficiently serve end users who would\u2019ve otherwise been excluded from financial services (B2B2C). Rather than a departure from our founding principles, the pursuit of RWAs represents a continuation of Maker\u2019s origin story. One small step for DeFi, one giant leap for finance.  1018\u00d7682 1.08 MB  \u201cOn-Chain, transparent RWA finance is a space that Maker - exclusively - can power innovation in and influence the future of. To fulfill this potential, we must come to consensus on a vision on how Maker ingests RWAs. \u201c - Christian Petersen LONG TERM: VISION \u201cSimple MakerDAO - Governance From First Principles\u201d suggests forging a new Constitution that would enshrine Maker\u2019s core principles. In fact, Maker did create a constitution but things change, both inside and outside of Maker\u2014the prescription is dated. The original constitution surely failed to contemplate how Maker would contend with Real World Assets. Given how important RWAs are to Maker\u2019s long-term success, the constitution might be refactored to reflect this changing business model. As such, I Intend for this piece to help generate consensus around how to systematically approach RWAs as a DAO, something we have not yet really achieved. If we\u2019re going to do RWAs correctly, we need to agree on what success looks like in 2030 and work backwards. This contextualizes our short-term moves within a long-term plan, reducing aimless flailing and getting bogged down in arbitrary trivialities that have no bearing on the long-run. It also introduces a guiding framework through which to evaluate collateral in the short-run (We will discuss this at great length in Short Term: Shipping the Maker Standard) A vision for RWAs from someone who\u2019s spent the last year inside the beast\u2026 Humans Don\u2019t Change, Technology Does Technology evolves, altering incentives, which in turn changes behavior (human nature remains constant). The printing press, for example, increased the reach of good ideas and thus weakened the grip of incumbent dogma. By decentralizing the distribution and thus consumption of information, the printing press supported truth and coordination around logic. After the internet, blockchains represent the next technological iteration of this dynamic: through cryptography and financial incentives, blockchains force many computers to come to consensus about what happened. Improving upon the printing press and internet, a blockchain makes the costs of prevarication even higher, increasing cooperation amongst many agents. These technologies progressively triangulated truth, changing the way the world worked. Rune and Maker\u2019s founders recognized a unique opportunity: assets living in a truer (immutable, high-fidelity) ledger were less risky to lend against. Maker used the unprecedented strengths of a blockchain (technology) to advance how humans exchange risk (markets). Rather than an asset class, crypto will be the infrastructure upon which most value is ledgered. Crypto assets, news, scientific studies, companies, real estate, intellectual property, and BTC mining loans will eventually be embedded in blockchains. Just as most information lives on the internet, most value will live on-chain. But this process will take decades. Of course, as a crypto-native stablecoin issuer, Maker will benefit organically from this tokenization of everything. But rather than waiting around, surviving, Maker should through its RWA business actively unlock this process. The Frontier is Inevitable The hype after the HVB announcement was electric, even surprisingly so. But it makes sense. It feels like the early days of Defi summer (2020) or NFTs (2021). Another wave of hope\u2014a wave whipped up by the promise of crypto affecting the real world again\u2014is cutting through what is otherwise a trying time in markets. And for good reason: credit markets will change indelibly as a result of how a blockchain can modify incentives. Cryptographic truth, or on-chain truth, will be a dominant force in our world. By extension, on-chain reputation will dictate how individuals and businesses access financial markets. By cryptographic truth, we don\u2019t mean a pure and objective reality, which is impossible to triangulate. Instead, cryptographic truth provides an immutable record of who said what about which thing. Off-chain creditworthiness will be replaced wholesale with on-chain creditworthiness. Whereas crypto-lending is currently fixated completely on the \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d of the collateral, these markets become more dynamic when colored with the nuance of on-chain reputation. Off-chain legal structures will be replaced with hybrid legal-code-mediated hyperstructures. Paper contracts will be transmuted into smart contracts. On-chain \u201cproof-of-performance\u201d, both of assets and asset operators, will create disproportionately lucrative financing opportunities for good actors. It\u2019s about the ledger, not the assets On-chain RWAs will not, of course, benefit from the same inherent strengths (namely trust minimization) that pure crypto loans do out of the gate. RWA tokenization suffers from the cold-start problem, as any burgeoning network does. The cold-start problem refers to how difficult it is to get a network off the ground and hit escape velocity, represented by a network effect. In this case, because the tokenization, oracle, and financing infrastructure is still nascent, RWA liquidity is minimal. And because the volume of RWAs is minimal, the incentives to build out the infrastructure is minimal. A familiar snafu! This moment in time is similar to the early days of Electric Vehicles, where electrification infrastructure, such as standardized plugs, range batteries, and accessible charging stations, did not yet really exist. Just as we did not abandon the EV, a scientifically superior vessel, we should not abandon RWAs just because the tokenization infrastructure is not yet in place. Building a better system is a slow, iterative process that is worth it in the end.  1500\u00d71072 135 KB  Maker should preferentially deploy its balance sheet such as to incentivize RWA markets to ledger themselves more truthfully. As we know from the flimsy push for renewables, real change only occurs when the \u201cright\u201d thing and \u201ceconomical\u201d thing are the same. By creating the conditions so that economic actors benefit from, rather than are punished by openness, the market will follow suit. Through financial discretion, Maker can shepherd real world asset markets toward the Maker Standard. The Maker Standard flips the script, and with it the market. Maker Standard The Maker Standard is the gold standard for how real world collateral is on-boarded into DeFi. It\u2019s a protocol for RWAs. A protocol is, of course, a set of rules that dictate how a process is executed and how that process can be changed. Maker\u2019s crypto vaults, for example, are underpinned by instructions for how assets are valued and monitored (oracles), how collections occur (debt service), how risk management works (liquidations), and how vault parameters are adjusted (governance). First Maker set the standard for on-chain crypto lending, now it\u2019s time to set the standard for on-chain RWA lending. Unlike the core protocol\u2019s path, the Maker Standard\u2019s path is constrained by the path dependencies of the assets it seeks to ingest. First, credit markets for RWAs are better-supplied, more competitive, and thus more difficult for Maker to have an edge in. (For the sake of argument, let\u2019s take this for granted even though one could feasibly argue that credit markets, especially in assets like trade finance and in emerging markets, remain inefficient) Second, existing RWAs live in an environment exogenous to Ethereum (similar to a crypto asset on, say, Solana)\u2014consensus around these assets is generated elsewhere, typically via corporate and municipal ledgers, commercial contracts, and legal courts. Third, assets are, by comparison to BTC and ETH, illiquid. These differences are all real and to underestimate them would be to be dishonest about the scope of the task at hand. The approach to building the Maker Standard must then be different from the approach Maker took to building the original protocol. The environment isn\u2019t as open. As such, the standard must achieve two ends: re-orient traditional credit markets and unlock new credit markets. How does the Maker Standard come to fruition? The RWA Barbell Approach How do we approach this herculean task? This is my suggestion\u2014an RWA barbell:   Birth: Unlock novel asset types that are uniquely suited to live natively on blockchains from the get-go  Re-Birth: Push traditional asset managers and traditionally ledgered risk assets towards a more transparent, accountable, trust-minimized standard   1106\u00d7946 73.7 KB    Hegelian Dialectic: A thesis and an anti-thesis (discourse) reinforce one another, combing into a more logical synthesis.  Note: We will flesh out the barbell more seriously in the \u201cLogistics\u201d section of course. Birth and rebirth will reinforce one another to create capital markets fit for a digital age. Over time, the distinction between crypto assets and RWAs invariably disappears as \u201cnon-crypto asset\u201d becomes as anachronistic as \u201chorseless carriage\u201d. The RWA barbell puts into motion a Hegelian dialectic, where two \u201copposing\u201d origins synthesize into an improved logic for how RWAs are ingested into crypto\u2014the Maker Standard. SHORT-TERM: SHIPPING THE MAKER STANDARD The Maker Standard is New Age Securitization Maker is the Decentral bank of a burgeoning emerging market\u2014that of crypto. As its credit engine, we\u2019ve not yet truly unlocked capital markets for the \u201cReal World Assets\u201d that already live in cyberspace\u2014our domestic economy. Because the assets haven\u2019t been ledgered yet, they don\u2019t suffer from the same path dependencies as RWAs like Real Estate and trade finance, which live elsewhere. The supporting credit infrastructure and thus credit supply (competition) for such assets is underdeveloped. As such, the design space for embedding these assets in the Maker Standard is wide open. In five years, we will look back on this era as crypto\u2019s \u201csecuritization\u201d moment.  1232\u00d7900 130 KB  Securitization is, in essence, a relatively simple technology that transformed credit markets in the 1990s. Various types of loans are combined into pools which are then sliced up into \u201ctranches\u201d of differening risks and sold to investors as interest-bearing liquid securities. Instead of sourcing proprietary portfolio loans one by one from different sources (banks), investors could now go to a single place (securities market) and allocate capital programmatically. In summary, securitization took disparate, semi-fungible, illiquid assets and packaged them into a more useful form\u2014tokens really. This technology mobilized and institutionalized mortgages, corporate loans, and consumer loans, driving cheaper capital for home buyers, businesses, and consumers. But still today securitization leaves plenty to be desired: A) It only accepts assets of a certain type and maturity B) It is closed off to retail and non-sophisticated investors C) Administrative overhead is significant D) Information/performance data is siloed and non-dynamic. Many assets, most assets, remain paralyzed because they cannot be transparently and efficiently accounted for. Just as securitization was a zero-to-one for traditional credit markets in the late 90\u2019s, the Maker Standard is a zero-to-one for crypto capital markets in the roaring 2020s. Birth: How does Maker unlock Novel Asset Classes? Novel RWAs represent assets that, today, are digitally native and primed for financialization via crypto-graphic truth and the micro-level efficiency of a ledger based blockchain accounting. There is no shortage of assets with this biology: a pathetically non-exhaustive list includes hash-power backed loans, DAO bonds, decentralized insurance contracts, climate assets, the entire trade finance (factoring, merchant cash advance, supply-chain finance etc) industry, revenue-backed finance, emerging market consumer finance, legal settlement finance etc. Many of these asset classes, structurally very appealing, remain locked out of modern finance. When we bring them onto a shared substrate, they can flourish. As a working example, let\u2019s think about an oracle-driven solar receivable. The energy output of solar panels is electronically metered. That digital representation of output, combined with an oracle of the applicable $/kwH, represents a digital account receivable, a novel RWA. As anyone in factoring knows, the single biggest risk is fraud. In the case of our novel RWA, the receivable is difficult to forge as it is automatically produced through the meter + oracle (let\u2019s leave metering fraud out for now). As anyone who has worked in structured credit knows, a short-term receivable is difficult to securitize (not worth the administrative/servicing overhead for a low-duration, low-yield asset). But these short-term receivables could conceivably be packaged into debt tokens and revolved as per smart-contract mediated eligibility criteria. Other assets that can be transformed into a digital representation through metering (i.e., an oracle) include crop/disaster/flight insurance, lliquefied natural gas, renewable natural gas, and hydrogen - all of which are metered at delivery and the energy content of which is measured through a defined scientific process. Like solar energy receivables, these assets can all be minted as novel RWAs (credit risk). Note: Notice the emergent consequence of both the securitization and Maker standards. Not only does the new standard increase the stock of investable assets right off the bat but it actually incentivizes asset originators to originate more assets. Originators know, as long as the assets conform as per the standard, there will be liquidity on the other side. Assets thus become more fungible and easier to service and account for. So, by creating a better standard, we can kickstart a network effect which enhances the entire value pipeline. The synthesis of Birth: Maker should extend credit against high-quality assets that A) already live in cyberspace and B) have not yet really been ledgered or integrated into credit systems. This new cargo will be more amenable to the new track. This new track can start shuttling assets and beckon traditional assets and managers to reformat their risk into a suitable packet for the network. Rebirth: Bring Traditional Credit Markets onto the Maker Standard Rebirth pertains to how Maker will strategically onboard existing RWAs in the short-term (2022-2023). While various frameworks/proposals have been put forth, mainly by the late RWF facilitator Seb, consensus with the community/MKR token holders has not been reached. As such, the community lacks a coherent and thoughtful risk-based approach to onboarding new collateral. Absent this guide, each deal is considered in a vacuum\u2014evaluated, negotiated, and structured independent of the broader context. To use a tired saying, we are missing the forest for the trees. This next section seeks to start the conversation (mainly qualitatively) around developing a comprehensive framework for implementation, which will be forthcoming. That framework will be jointly developed by LTS, RWF, and SF. How does Maker roll-out the second leg of the Maker Standard? Simply put, it should structure its exposures in the most robust possible way and push asset managers to progressively adopt the standard. This will ensure that Maker benefits in the short-run from uncorrelated, yield-bearing assets while over the long-run converging on a better system for on-chain RWAs. Prelude to RWA Onboarding Framework The short-term implementation here is really important, because it is ultimately a temporary measure that will transition into something more self-actualized and less risky. RWA exposures will soon be decentralized across many capable counter-parties aligned with the protocol. We are already seeing a spate of treasury management options that will help flesh out a distributed vision. Pursuit of this strategy will invariably require Maker to lean on traditional legal and commercial knowhow. As the structure of HVB suggests, this does not mean jamming DeFi liquidity into RWA processes and calling it a day. Rather, each new RWA onboarding should be an upgrade on the last. This entails better and better assets with stronger and stronger managers but also progressive innovation towards the Maker Standard (transparency, accountability, redundancy etc.). This is why it does not make sense to simply keep onboarding traditional institutions along solely the dimension of reputation/experience. Ultimately, these groups, albeit capable, will on balance be less willing to build new systems with us. This is also why it does make sense to continue working with tokenization infrastructure partners like Centrifuge. To the extent that we can combine the two (quality and technology), that\u2019s all the better. Maker\u2019s Relationship with Asset Managers As myself and RWF have been proselytizing, prong two should be implemented via wholesale lending with capable and aligned partners. Maker will not staff a bloated credit department to underwrite all asset types across all jurisdictions under the sun. Rather, it\u2019ll export this responsibility to experienced specialists with significant skin in the game. Instead, we will underwrite the underwriter. A structure that fails to fit into a scalable and repeatable form will be dinged relative to one that does, all else equal. \u201cFor RWAs to be profitable and provide value to token holders, MakerDAO should be focusing on wholesale-esc relationships that scale. I.e. build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, underwrite the underwriter, and drip additional funding to them as the vault seasons and the underwriter performs. MakerDAO ought not to be a jack of all trades and master of none. It wants to empower specialist lenders to execute in their niches, not to build out a bloated and ineffective credit underwriting department.\u201d - Teej\u2019s recommendation for the Community to NOT Greenlight OPM ATDC, which was ignored. We can think about this strategy as principally aligned with the D3M but for short-term RWAs with material credit risk and complexity. Because DAI is money and should eventually be in the hands of users, a B2B2C focus is also advisable.    Asset manager is materially aligned with Maker   Significant risk retention First-loss preferably     Progressively innovate on traditional private credit structure     Firm legal protections for Maker     Asset manager has a demonstrable edge in its asset class, jurisdiction, and sector     Structure is repeatable    Assets Suitable for Maker    Secured (What does this mean? Is trade finance secured? Is BNPL secured?)     Shorter term is better (1-3 years)     Amortizing/self-liquidating     Arguably investment grade (<1% loss rate) unless strategically relevant (Which exceptions?)    Maker\u2019s Liquidity Considerations Maker should responsibly onboard assets that match the profile of its DAI liabilities. Rule #1 is to always honor redemption liabilities. If more DAI is redeemed then we can pay out by liquidating assets, the ship will sink. So this is really the most existential concern when onboarding assets. Anything longer than five years is terribly risky, in my view. As the maturity of DAI deposits change, so of course does the asset duration policy. Portfolio Construction After HVB and SocGen are funded, Maker\u2019s RWA footprint will be ~$200MM, or 2% of total collateral and ~2x the surplus buffer. After Monetalis Clydesdale and Backed Finance are funded, RWAs might represent more like ~10% of the total collateral and 10x the surplus buffer. It is thus time to start thinking about the RWA portfolio as a whole rather than considering each deal as per its risks and opportunities. This means understanding the matrix of concentration MKR holders have to categories of risk\u2026asset managers, asset types, geographies, durations etc. To get us thinking on this topic, after HVB is funded, real estate concentration will represent about half of all Maker RWA concentration. So, should a macro shock akin to the scale and variety (unlikely) of the GFC happen again, might Maker be disproportionately punished? Wrapping it Up As Maker wields its sovereignty to bootstrap the Maker Standard, the infrastructure required to reasonably represent all value on-chain flows out of the enormous economic opportunity created. Consider the builders already solving different parts of the DeFi <> RWA value chain:   Tokenization: Centrifuge, Bacon Protocol, Roofstock  Liquidity Pools: TrueFi, Maple  Oracles: Chainlink (TrueFlation/link to RWA article.DONS), Teller, SpectralFi  RWA Ledgering: Provenance  RWA EM Credit: Goldfinch, Credix  Synthetics: Synthetix, ThorChain, Parcl, FTX  Each and every one of these teams is solving a leg of the journey to see RWAs really come to life on-chain. The revolutionaries are already fomenting a revolution in capital markets. As the decentral bank that will finance the battles, I hope Maker can scale RWAs in a way that achieves resilience in the short-run but transformation in the long-run. ",

I generally agree with your post and your vision. I believe real world assets are a frontier that should be cultivated. I would also like to point out that real estate has a lot of different sub-sectors that may not be highly correlated. For example, HVB (based on my understanding) lends mostly against commercial real estate construction in their local areas in PA, whereas New Silver lends to small businesses that mostly do single family renovotation, in 41 different states. Other companies may offer Heloc loans against primary residences, others down payment lending or co-ownership lending, etc. So a large asset class, be it corporate bonds, real estate, etc, will have pockets that outperform each other in different market cycles.

One important rebuttal is that part of the idea of Rune\u2019s Endgame is to spin out the riskier bits of Maker as MetaDAOs - not eliminate them altogether. I don\u2019t think this post is inconsistent with the Endgame plan. A lot of the analysis is just generally relevant to Maker and RWA (and I, at least, found it helpful). Second, so what if someone posts something on the forum contradictory to the Endgame plan\u2026? This is a DAO, not a totalitarian dictatorship with a state-controlled media.

However, to realize such long-term ambitions as @teej outlines here, the community needs to do more than agree on what the North Star should be, or craft a new Constitution. There seems to be a split in how to fundamentally view the world. I find the framing of \u201cTrustware\u201d vs \u201cSocialware\u201d helpful in conceptualizing what a key barrier might be to advancing this vision other than pure consensus on the merits. At the end of the day, who or what is best suited to do which aspects of this work? Are they/is it a part of the community today? If not, how can we attract them/build it? So beyond governance and how to implement a plan, how do we think about the kind of work and operating environment required to sustain and realize the vision? Do we need more or less or better Trustware, or Socialware, both? A lot of impressive teams in Web3 are thinking about organizational constructs that go beyond anything that has existed before. There ought to be non-corporate, non-hierarchical approaches to DAO organization that take the best of all worlds starting with a blend of the kind of trust that code advances composed with the trust advanced when human interactions are optimized. From Scaling Trust in DAOs: Trustware vs Socialware: At Orca, our view is that the assurances provided by blockchain unlocks a new paradigm of trustware technology that is relatively underexplored. One that could potentially reduce the friction and operational overhead that slows down companies and creates unfavorable working environments. Traditional organizations over index on socialware precisely because they have only a smattering of trustware at their disposal whereas in the web3 world, we\u2019re still only scratching the surface of what organizations operating on trustware look like. Is this a community that values humans and wants to integrate functional human relations into its operations? Or, is the prevailing view that we get things done with code. To hell with everything else - especially humans who are centralizing and corruptible forces. If the later is more MakerDAO DNA, then it can\u2019t scale and people are correct who want to simplify, reduce, recede, concede\u2026 ",

                    "content": "    teej:  Maker\u2019s Liquidity Considerations Maker should responsibly onboard assets that match the profile of its DAI liabilities . Rule #1 is to always honor redemption liabilities. If more DAI is redeemed then we can pay out by liquidating assets, the ship will sink. So this is really the most existential concern when onboarding assets. Anything longer than five years is terribly risky, in my view. As the maturity of DAI deposits change, so of course does the asset duration policy.   Fire post, this vision is excellent. Out of curiosity, what does it mean to redeem Dai in this case? Isn\u2019t all Dai created through lending and redemption being the process of paying back the loan? Whenever someone pays back the loan, they will always have access to their collateral [unless it was auctioned]. What is the immediate redemption clause going on here? It certainly makes sense from a traditional banking context, I just don\u2019t understand it as much in the Maker context. ",
