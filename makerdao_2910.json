Declaration to Replace: n/a  Specification Context and Motivation MakerDAO needs a system for communication between the DAO, DeFi community, and the public. Domain teams only have so much time in a day to moderate discussions and keep the project cycle(s) on track. In addition, new users constantly get lost in the deluge of information generated by the community. It\u2019s also clear that as the DAO is moving to formalize operations, and since it will need to communicate with stakeholders and the public, a communications domain team is a possible next step. Around March 13 2020, a team of contributors came together to start experimenting and explore the contours of this problem space. Thanks to the generosity of community development grants, and project planning, the group produces the Maker Relay, governance call snippets, a governance focused twitter, and coordinates with the governance call summary team. Our intent is to formally confirm that this Domain should exist, outline the mandate of said team, and explore speaking on Governance\u2019s behalf. Declaration Detail Maker Governance declares its intention to form a Governance Communications Domain with the following mandate. The Governance communications mandate encompasses the facilitation of products, services, and updates that increase the participation and efficiency of MakerDAO\u2019s Governance. This team should condense activity and surface signal for everyone\u2019s benefit. To facilitate this the Governance Communications Domain will attempt to resolve significant questions/challenges in such a way that provides value to Maker Governance and the other domain teams. The working group has identified three directions of communication, each of which would be the responsibility of the Governance Communications Domain.  Communicating information between members of the DAO.   Clarification: Intra-DAO Updates will be aggregated and simplified for all community members, including those who may not have specialized knowledge of the domain-team workflows (i.e. programming, smart contracts, communication).   Communicating from the DAO to the public.   Clarification: Communications to the public will be accumulations/aggregations of community opinions and discussion, or votes and polls, in order to respond. Messages will be asterisked with a \u201cnot a definitive statement\u201d or \u201cany statements made could be voted on and rejected by the community\u201d or \u201cthe DAO reserves the right to change it\u2019s opinion.\u201d   Communicating from the public to the DAO.   Clarification: This direction will source continual questions, issues, even new ideas and present them to the DAO.    The Governance Communications Domain is a bridge between all of these required communications directions. The Governance Communications Domain would operate under the principles of objectivity, simplicity, integrity and brevity.  Existing Initiatives We believe that these existing initiatives would fall under the Governance Communications Domain\u2019s responsibilities.  Maker Relay  A weekly update of governance-related events, including current votes, prior week  vote results, proposals, forum deep dive,  as well as links to community calls/sync\u2019s, discussions, and useful/relevant information.   Governance Call Snippets  An overview of Governance and Risk call, published the same day, ahead of the high-fidelity summary release. It aims to provide domain team updates, important discussions, and links from the chat for anyone unable to make the call or looking for a brief summary.   Governance Call Summary Team  An in-depth, high-fidelity summary of the governance call for the more in-depth user that also serves an archival function.   MKRGov twitter  A way to update a larger community on governance updates and encourage new users to become active in governance.   Voices of MakerDAO  A proposal for creating a podcast/audio version of governance updates.     Extra Materials Domain questions and challenges  How can a DAO manage Public Relations?  In what circumstances should we make statements on behalf of the DAO? When do we communicate sentiments from the public, from the forums, etc.? How can a DAO respond to journalists in a timely and objective manner? How can we provide thorough coverage of relevant events/procedures/news?   How should teams and individuals go about making statements on behalf of the DAO?  How do we communicate sentiments from the public, from the forums, etc.? How can we be as close to objective and unbiased in our communications?   Can this Domain assist in clarity of working groups and Maker Governance\u2019s actions/intentions? How can the DAO become more welcoming to a global audience?  Next steps  Create a Domain definition according to the MIP23 template Continue producing Maker relay while experimenting with different distribution models and platforms. Explore different team structures to share/rotate responsibilities. Create a formal framework for the specific tasks and responsibilities team(s) would like to handle.  Furthermore, surface new useful tasks and responsibilities for Governance and the Community as a whole.   Validate team utility with data  Analytics will be collected (depending on where they\u2019re being sourced) and aggregated into specific updates. These will be outlined in one of the frameworks, referred to above. Data will assist in quantifying the need for a domain team and responsibilities therein.   Create documentation, and find a canonical place for it to live.  This would be written by the Gov-Comms team, and proposed to the general community for comments/questions/clarification. Documentation would cover expectations around cadence, execution, role types, products, etc. This may be expanded on later. This documentation would be a framework used long-term to ensure the consistency of communications as we continue to grow (as a DAO and Domain).

I think given the DAO could change its mind at any time on almost any subject anyone making statements for the DAO is fraught with hazard and ANY statement from this group for the DAO generally will need to be caveated in some way or formalized with a governance vote.  Even then a subsequent vote could change this unless there is some mechanism to lock DAO statements/decisions against future changes for some time.   A really bad outcome here is a comm group saying something that the DAO later votes against. A prime example of this is with the Black Thursday Compensation.  I warned people repeatedly governance could change its mind on this as the process unfolded and the plan was presented.  That a governance vote to act did not mean governance would act to compensate.  This will also be true with Declarations of Intent generally.   Intent to act does not necessairly mean Intended action will occur.  This happens all the time even in personal lives. This has implications for long term contracts and communications generally.  I would suggest to be able to communicate on anything, the DAO needs to formally have a mechanism to back up Intent with timelines for action for the DAO to formally make longer term agreements/commitments.  There needs to be some way to formalize either within the smart contracts or within a kind of \u201cDAO covenants\u201d document longer term MakerDAO commitments and statements. and     twblack88:  How can a DAO respond to journalists in a timely and objective manner?   Not at all sure how this is possible given that the DAO is ever-changing and by nature  is slow to act.   Even if a single point of contact (POC) could be elected, this POC simply can\u2019t ever assure the DAO would back what is communicated (in a timely fashion) by an affirmative governance vote, or that the DAO would change its mind later.  If the POC waits for governance to vote, the communication, or action, may not be timely   Further, I can\u2019t even imagine how impossible it would be from a governance perspective to vote on DAO statements generally. This really begs a more general question:  How is a DAO able to enter into long term contracts, much less make statements, that will be backed up by actions to the public? I think a communcation group could focus on highlighting and improving consistency in information and communications generally and from this perspective be useful.  I also think having a team that monitors news and media generally (from a report and analytics perspective) to be of use as well. ",

We are proposing this domain first and then if approved will build the domain team around current initiatives we\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s a little confusing but we want to be sure MKR holders want to see communications as a domain before just going all the way in, as a team. This type of feedback is critical in shaping that intent. The problem and issue is the communicating and aggregating available information (including the caveats that HAVE to come with us being a DAO) that tends to get lost somewhere between the team members, and the people who don\u2019t specialize in a given field. This team is already delivering things like Snippets, Summaries, the Relay, and are part of the team helping shape the Community Portal, which can serve Governance and many other constituent communities. We will continue to develop these things into more resources, which are essentially ideas sourced from the community to fill the different needs we have seen and communicated about with, from various parts of the community.
