Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, twitter feed, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard.

Project Impact Market research we conducted in 2021 concluded that crypto users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community. Our dashboard aims to provide a single end-point from which users can consume all the information on a project they could possibly want. In this case, we would like to create a MakerDAO ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:   The latest MakerDAO official announcements and blog post content   A feed of all news mentions of MakerDAO from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet   A calendar containing all MakerDAO events including MakerDAO Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with MakerDAO bounties, AMAs   Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by MakerDAO team members   Youtube stream containing educational MakerDAO content.   MakerDAO Documentation   Integration with MakerDAO Governance Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics   Twitter & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions   FAQ, Whitepaper, MKR tokenomics information   MakerDAO Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed on MakerDAO   MakerDAO metrics including TVL, $DAO Total Trade Volume and other metrics pulled in from Dune Analytics   A widget featuring the MakerDAO roadmap with all the descriptions and links included   Widgets dedicated to MakerDAO Ecosystem    Funding Request and Budget Breakdown 1,200 USD upfront costs for development including integrating the discussion forums, blog post, social feed, jobs listing, TVL and other on-chain metrics. 120 USD per month for 12 months for maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest MakerDAO events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates not automatically captured by the Alphaday aggregator engine is manually added to the board, and other maintenance tasks. For a total of 2,640 USD.  Legal Structure Legal Name: Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd.
