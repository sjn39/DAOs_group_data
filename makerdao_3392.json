In short, yes this has a huge impact on our ability to use them as collateral. That being said it\u2019s not impossible just non-trivial. Ideally Uniswap would create a token wrapper around \u201ccommon\u201d LP distributions which would chunk large amounts of liquidity into fungible pieces. These V3 LP tokens could then be used as collateral within Maker. A Uniswap created solution is likely to become a standard which increases composability and liquidity. Absent of an official \u201cblessed\u201d token wrapper, either Maker, Aave, or a yield-aggregator like Yearn could step in to create these wrappers with the risk that others create competing standards and integrations/liquidity becomes fragmented.
