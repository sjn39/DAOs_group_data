                    "content": "Hi @rune - I\u2019ve been following along with the various calls and parts of the Endgame Plan as a small MKR holder and will be honest that I\u2019m a bit confused about how some parts of the plan fit together, specifically around the focus objectives you laid out in the call yesterday and MetaDAOs. To take your point above, as I understand it, the idea of the Endgame Plan is to facilitate the complexity of the protocol by distributing responsibilities/roles out from the core to an array of MetaDAOs. I agree the L2 analogy is quite helpful as that\u2019s essentially how Ethereum has evolved to some extent: core developers focus on building out value-neutral, flexible infrastructure for the whole Ethereum project (proof of stake, sharding etc) in the most secure way possible. L2s and projects built on the L1 are then free to innovate in a bunch of different directions. This is good! But if the point of the Endgame Plan is to distribute out the complex/risky stuff to MetaDAOs, why does it feel like a priority along the way is to effectively freeze certain growth vectors for the protocol like RWA, and cut costs by looking for headcount reduction? I would have thought the whole point of the MetaDAO structure is that CUs can reconfigure as MetaDAOs and each figure out how they can each best support the protocol, with the Maker core distributing funds based on how each MetaDAO performs. The focus objectives covered in yesterday\u2019s call seemed antithetical to the enticing vision of \u2018dividing and conquering\u2019 where MetaDAOs are unleashed to develop Maker in a range of different directions (like Etheruem L2s). It\u2019s kind of like the Endgame Plan is trying to push through a protocol-wide austerity philosophy as part of the decentralisation process, which seems to compromise some of the real value that could come from MetaDAOs experimenting and innovating. In summary, I think that the Endgame Plan is hugely ambitious (in a good way) and has the potential to really set Maker up for the future. MetaDAOs are really exciting. But I\u2019m worried that the process for reaching the \u2018endgame\u2019 might involve terminating a lot of the best work done by the CUs, rather than capitalise on our existing progress. ",
