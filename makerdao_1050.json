The team behind Fei will be hosting a community AMA to explore the possible use cases for this token within the MakerDAO ecosystem, ranging from a standard vault, D3M, or even a PSM.  Rari Pools? Our guests will also take the time to discuss different possibilities and potential integrations. Do you have any cool ideas? Do you want to pitch Joey on the next great pool?  Join us Join us 2022-05-11T15:00:00Z as we host Joey Santoro @joey & Brianna Montgomery @bpm6867 from Fei Protocol to lead a discussion into Fei v2, the mutual benefits from onboarding, and answer any of the community\u2019s questions.  Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by Fei Protocol\u2019s Joey Santoro & Brianna Montgomery Community Q&A   [MIP6] FEI Collateral Onboarding Application   While filled as a MIP6, this proposal can be seen (and converted) to a D3M (or even a PSM). It is suggested to have a good overcollateralization, meaning that the only use case for this vault will be Tribe Protocol to put FEI as collateral to mint DAI. The Tribe DAO will use this loan to finance its balance sheet and provide a better peg for its users. Moreover, with the stablecoin war starting and CeFi stablecoins winning the DeFi space, it makes sense to partner with other stablecoin issuers to push DeFi stablecoins ahead. FEI is already pegged to DAI with 10bps fees. This vault will allow Fei to decrease conversion fees. Tribe DAO is also managing Fuse so this will be complementary to the Fuse D3M discussion \u2026 The use cases for MakerDAO are: Generate a yield and decrease USDC exposure. The FEI vault will be akin to a super-senior DAI loan to Fei Protocol (D3M-like). Being overcollateralized in FEI, MakerDAO would enjoy more protection than FEI holders. Taking the role of a decentral bank by providing temporary liquidity to stablecoin issuers when needed. This was already discussed on MakerDAO forum in the Intra DeFi stablecoin issuers money-market. Long term such arrangement will make DeFi stablecoins safer.   When Time in your local-timezone format: 2022-05-11T15:00:00Z Mark it on your Google Calendar!

Today we are joined by Tribe DAO. Joey and Brianna want to share more detail about their MIP6 application for onboarding Fei, a collateral type to the MakerDAO protocol, and a stablecoin. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

Any \u201ccapital controls\u201d? 17:31 - Marko Stemberger: Is there a dashboard that shows stats for the PSMs? 21:36 - Retro: Can you talk about the V2 upgrade in terms of how it should support the onboarding? 24:47 - LongForWisdom: At what point do you bail on the volatile PCV in a black-swan event? Like Maker maintains the over-collateralization by liquidating users below that ratio. How does Fei maintain the over-collateralization in that situation, or would it allow Fei to become undercollateralized? 26:56 - Primoz Kordez: What is the intended use case for the 100M facility again, DAI yield generation or FEI market-making activities? 31:11 - ElPro: Can you provide more color on how FEI adopts ERC4626 and what benefits it can provide to a possible partnership with MakerDAO? The last audit was July 21st, are you slated to have a new audit in 2022? 39:20 - Marko Stemberger: Do you have any comment on why the price is still less than one dollar, even though you can achieve 15% APR? 42:13 - LongForWisdom: What makes the vault better than just selling volatile PCV for DAI? 43:57 - Retro: What is the best way to get a hold of you? 44:41 - Retro: Do you have anything else that you would like to add?
