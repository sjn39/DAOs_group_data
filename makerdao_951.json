Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here.  Show some love to our Medium account      Current Events Ethereum DeFi Staple MakerDAO Adds StarkNet Bridge in First Step Toward Multi-Chain Addressing the need for a cheaper, faster option for users, MakerDAO is bridging to StarkWare\u2019s zero-knowledge side chain StarkNet. The bridge will be developed in four incremental phases:   Simple bridge: The first phase in the four-stage process involves building a simple bridge between the main Ethereum blockchain and StarkNet\u2019s Layer 2 network. The simple bridge will be released on April 28th.  Fast withdrawals: In the second phase, fast withdrawals leveraging Maker\u2019s \u201cWormhole\u201d design will enable more users to withdraw from L2 to L1. Project engineer Louis Baudoin says transactions will execute \u201cin a couple of minutes.\u201d  Teleportation: The third phase involves bridging between different Layer 2 networks, such as StarkNet and Arbitrum. The fourth phase involves rebuilding multi-collateral dai on StarkNet.  On the security and risk management benefits of a phased rollout, Baudoin offers, \u201cObviously, there\u2019s been a lot of testing done. It\u2019s sensible to increase the bridge limit slowly so that the amount of money at risk is manageable, and also to have some emergency mechanisms in place internally to mitigate if there was a hack.\u201d Cointelegraph also released their article on the StarkNet Bridge. These articles were created thanks to the initiative of the Maker Brand Team with the help of @pyramidmaker from the StarkNet Core Unit.    This Week in Governance  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Weekly MIPs Update #84 by @blimpa The monthly-cycle Ratification Polls for April have closed. All passed with two exceptions:   MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure.  MIP40c3-SP63: COM-001 expanded budget. (MIP40c3-SP62 passed instead).  All the proposals currently in RFC are eligible to enter the May Governance Cycle. There are no weekly-cycle proposals at the moment. The May Formal Submission Window opens on Monday 2 and closes on Wednesday 4. The Frozen Period (for monthly-cycle proposals with a seven-day Frozen Period) starts on Wednesday, 27.  Executive Vote(s) Oracle Whitelist Additions, Replacing the Curve stETH/ETH Oracle This executive proposal passed on April 25th, and the following changes were made to the Maker Protocol:  Oasis.app Whitelists As per the outcome of this governance poll, Oasis.app was whitelisted on the following OSM Oracles: -   ETH/USD -   WSTETH/USD -   WBTC/USD -   RENBTC/USD -   YFI/USD -   UNI/USD -   LINK/USD -   MANA/USD  Replacing the Curve stETH/ETH Oracle Due to technical issues, the Curve stETH/ETH oracle was replaced and reactivated by:  Removing permissions on the previous oracle implementation. Adding permissions on the new oracle implementation. Replicating the whitelist for this oracle on the new implementation.  This action restored full functionality to the Curve stETH/ETH oracle and CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vaults.

Active Signal Requests Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful, but it only allows to kick off a new auction if the new auction does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it\u2019s at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What\u2019s good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting thereby producing a more steady burn. However, in sacrifice, we will limit the maximum MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai. Vote will run until May 13, 2022.

Phase I of the Collateral Onboarding (COB) process addresses several issues that have come to light over the past few months. Priority changes were made regarding the transparency and communication aspects of the COB process, which remains under constant iteration and improvement. CES will be posting a CSI update every Thursday before the Governance and Risk call. Each update will be divided into three sections:   Collateral Application Status: Lists all collateral application statuses before prioritization  Prioritized Collateral - Lists the \u201cUp Next\u201d status of collateral being onboarded  The Work In Progress Collateral - All collateral in the Assessment through Executive Vote execution   The CSI spreadsheet is where you can find information about all the collateral moving through the COB process. Spreadsheet data includes: Collateral Application Status before Prioritization  Prioritized Collateral  1036\u00d750 7.14 KB  Collateral Work In Progress (WIP)  1066\u00d7273 77.8 KB  CES has also created several different filters to make it easier to find the data you want to explore:  Questions or discussion about specific collateral should be posted directly to the forum as a collateral application forum post; general questions relating to each week\u2019s CSI update can be posted as comments on the relevant forum post.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here. Show some love to our Medium account     Current Events  Recommended Guidelines for Collateral Onboarding  Continuing the ongoing discussion regarding the most effective process for onboarding new assets into Maker, this collaboration between the CES, Risk, Growth, PE, and Oracle Core Units offers a set of guidelines for assessing candidate collateral. Because every asset has its unique collection of attributes and market conditions are always in flux, no assessment framework can provide hard-and-fast \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answers every time; the goal is to provide a toolbox to help MakerDAO make more well-informed and educated decisions. For additional context, check out the latest Governance and Risk Call discussing collateral onboarding and management. Recommendations: 30M Dai minimum target debt ceiling: The Core Units involved in the collateral onboarding process have agreed that candidate collateral should be expected to generate at least 30M Dai. Reasons include collateral onboarding and maintenance costs, the upfront work required, ongoing operational/maintenance work, bandwidth costs, and opportunity costs. Clear business case: The technical ability to support a 30M+ debt ceiling doesn\u2019t mean much without an audience of users willing and able to generate more Dai. For this reason, it is crucial to investigate how much actual usage a new type of collateral may stimulate. Min. $250M market cap of circulating supply: Requiring this minimum will help ensure that Maker does not become overexposed to any newly onboarded assets. If we assume a max 30% of circulating supply as a guideline for crypto token collateral and average debt weighted CR in the vault type at 250%, the asset needs a minimum circulating market cap of $250M for a minimum DC of $30m (Min DC*CR/MaxRatioOfSupply = 30M*2.5/0.30 = 250M).  Min. $40M of onchain liquidity (132% of debt ceiling): Like the minimum circulating supply, this minimum is derived from the debt ceiling figure. By considering the CR distribution of positions in the ETH-A vault and an expected drawdown or jump risk of 40%, it is expected that approximately 26.5% of total Dai debt will be liquidated. After this 40% drop, vaults CR will go below LR.  Based on the previous minimum debt ceiling, an estimation can be made for how much Dai debt would be liquidated in such a scenario.  If the liquidation penalty is 13%, the system can slip up to approximately 27% price slippage before depleting the buffer created by the penalty and potentially creating bad debt. Therefore, the maximum allowed price slippage after a 40% drop is 27%. By utilizing this number (27%) in the AMM x*y=k formula, we can derive that such slippage occurs when around 35-40% of assets are sold compared to the pool size of the asset. This means that assets should have five times more on-chain liquidity compared to liquidated debt (in the case of an equally weighted two-asset AMM).  945\u00d7386 59.1 KB  Traded on at least five exchanges with: 1. Daily exchange volume of the collateral asset >$2M., and 2Order book depth of over $200k in the +2% and -2% tiers: The presence of these metrics will help ensure that the price sources needed to build and maintain an oracle for the new asset are difficult to manipulate. Technical metrics to gauge complexity and upfront implementation cost: The more of these metrics a candidate collateral type checks off, the easier the onboarding should be in terms of technical difficulty:  Implements ERC20 token standard Can utilize existing ExchangeCallee contracts for flash liquidations; the currently supported exchanges are Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, and Curve; must have sufficient liquidity on these exchanges to support liquidations Audit(s) from a reputable firm(s), e.g., Trail of Bits, ChainSecurity, ABDK No admin functions/upgradability No rebasing/changing supply of individual token balances No blacklists/whitelists Transfer semantics should be simple; e.g., no fees on transfers  For more discussion on collateral onboarding, this time focusing on real-world assets, scroll down to the Forum Insight below.

The case focuses on continuity, such as pushing the \u201cAggressive Growth Strategy\u201d and raising our Surplus Buffer. Additionally, we also need a code of principles to help us stay on the most promising path forward. RWAs have the potential to strengthen both the protocol and public belief in the peg\u2013we should take advantage of that. @Traster_Tray has already responded with another thread, A Letter to the CUs on Community Impatience and Trust. The author presents their perspective on some of the current issues around RWAs, specifically among the community. This post discusses shifting directions, the unsustainable rise in operational expenses, a growing perception of greed and waste, centralized voting power, and Core Unit influence and power.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here.  Show some love to our Medium account      Current Events  Compound Passes Proposal to Lower MKR Borrow Limit  @monet-supply submitted a sentiment gauge on Compound\u2019s Forum about reducing the cMKR borrow limit. The sentiment poll passed to reduce the MKR borrow cap to 5,000 MKR and was pushed on-chain to Compound governance. The on-chain proposal poll passed and officially set the borrowing limit from the current value of 25,000 MKR to 5,000 MKR.  1772\u00d71007 150 KB  This will help increase our governance security and reduce Compound\u2019s MKR and DAI market volatility risk. Compound states that \u201cMKR is not frequently borrowed, and based on historical demand across Aave and Compound, this 5,000 token limit is unlikely to limit typical usage.\u201d The risk of the malicious triggering of an emergency shutdown has become the primary attack vector for Maker governance. The emergency shutdown threshold sits at 100k, which is currently 11% of MKR circulating supply; further increasing the ES threshold is not a solution. monet-supply identified that reducing the availability of borrowable MKR can, in conjunction, reduce the cost of the attack because the cost of repurchasing burned MKR to close a loan would cost less after an attack were to happen. By reducing the availability of borrowable MKR, Compound reduces the risk of a malicious shutdown, making MKR and DAI a safer collateral assets overall. Even though this action reduces the reserve growth of cMKR and the utility of Compound\u2019s money markets, the Compound community-supported to pushing this ahead.     This Week in Governance  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Weekly MIPs Update #83 by @blimpa   1278\u00d7723 26.2 KB    We are in the second week of April Ratification Polls, and 12 polls will run until Monday, April 25. RFC and FS Dates for reference and existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. Check out the Practical Guide to Voting if you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO. Proposals eligible to enter the May Governance Cycle cannot be modified after Wednesday, April 27. Formal Submission Window for May will be open May 2nd - 4th.   Executive Vote(s) The week of April 12 - 18 contained two executive votes: Copy Stub For Out-Of-Schedule Executive - April 14, 2022  An oracle was frozen in an emergency executive to mitigate a potential vulnerability. View this post for additional information.  Offload TUSD and DAI Transfers - April 15, 2022 These executive proposals passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:  TUSD Collateral Offloading As per this successful governance poll, TUSD collateral in the Maker Protocol was liquidated under the parameters tabled below. The communication and lead-time requirements for offboarding collateral defined in MIP62 have been met. TUSD Parameters under Liquidation:     Parameter Amount     Liquidations Enabled   Auction Price Function Linear Decrease (tau: 250 days (estimated 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0))   Liquidation Penalty 0%   Liquidation Ratio 150%   Auction Price Multiplier 1.00   Local Liquidation Limit 5MM DAI   Max Auction Duration 5 days (implies minimum price of 0.98)   Proportional Kick Incentive 0 DAI   Flat Kick Incentive 0 DAI*     *The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has reduced the Flat Kick Incentive to zero as detailed here. For further information, please see the proposal forum thread here.   Growth Core Unit Budget As per the ratified GRO-001 DAI Budget, 474,683 DAI was transferred to the Growth Core Unit multi-sig wallet. This is the second of two lump-sum transfers specified in the budget proposal.  Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot As per this successful governance poll, 25,000 DAI was transferred to the Ambassadors Program multi-sig wallet. For further information, please see the signal request thread here.  Replace Gelato Keeper Top-Up Contract DAI Stream As per this forum post, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit have included a replacement for the Gelato Keeper stream in this executive proposal to resolve a bug related to token approvals.  The existing stream is revoked - previously streamed funds will be used to fund keeper actions as planned.  1,000 DAI per day was streamed to the new contract for 6 months.

With the help and education by @maxglass, GEG submitted a post introducing a new Content Production Core Unit called \u201cLet\u2019sMakerDAO,\u201d or LMKR for short. Nancy Glass is the facilitator proposed and the founder of GEG. GEG speaks shortly on their mandate to increase Maker and Dai mass consumption, expand our reachable audience, grow the community, and help promote the MakerDAO name. They will also work with other Core Units to support needs and objectives containing professional audio and video. There are two stages of commercial content production; The development stage delivers a production plan based on a given production budget. The production plan will include a creative description and concept overview, an episodic breakdown, a description of the tone, and a style guide (the \u201clook\u201d of the content. E.g., Fonts & colors). Additionally, an audio-visual proof of concept, typically 90 seconds to 2 minutes, may be applied before voting for production. The production stage is broken down into pre-production, production, and post-production, which can take up to 12 months. For GEG to enter a production stage, the community would have to vote on GEG\u2019s production budget and plan after they complete the developmental stage. These two stages may likely have their signal requests. Instead of shelling out a large chunk of Dai, GEG applies for 3 months of development funding at 124.000 Dai.  This will include a content marketing strategy and development team:  1750\u00d7917 108 KB   If a proposed Signal Request is successful, GEG will create a formal proposal to acquire the necessary budget and onboard as the LMKR Core Unit. GEG will provide show treatments/budgets/sizzles into a content-marketing strategy package using YouTube, podcast platforms, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and MakerDAO\u2019s website. The Strategy Proposal will focus on getting LMKR content picked up by the DeFi news outlets and mainstream media: network, cable, and print such as CBS, CNN, CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, etc. GEG acknowledges their inexperience in crypto-related, global economics, and monetary policy production and not being crypto-native. What comes after this informal poll? If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes favor a 3-month development test, GEG will post a detailed MIP officially requesting funding for their development budget. If less than 50% show support, no further action will be taken by GEG.
