                    "content": " 2582\u00d7582 235 KB  Hi everyone, thanks for checking out the Weekly Relay! Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version    What in the DAO is Going On?!    Halted Withdrawals on Lending Platforms Myriad lending protocols halted customer withdrawals last week, citing various reasons for the delays. Babel, Celsius, CoinFLEX, Hodlnaut, and Vauld are among the names closing up shop as the liquidity crunch, or \u201cUST Contagion\u201d, continues its spread. Click for more info on Celsius' wBTC-A position  With Celsius standing as one of Maker\u2019s primary vault holders, their liquidity situation is the headline for our purposes. Collateral hadn\u2019t been added to their wBTC-A position since June 16th, and its collateralization ratio dropped to a low of 154.1%. That changed on July 1st when the Celsius wallet began paying back DAI en masse.  Celsius deposits1462\u00d7482 127 KB  A frenzy of deposits totaling 196.7M upped vault collateralization to over 577.8%, decreasing its debt from ~202M DAI on July 1st to just over 82M DAI by the 4th.  Celsius de-risked1355\u00d7622 60.8 KB  Sidenote: In a room of the bad company, CoinFLEX still managed to stand out for its truly horrendous \u201crisk management\u201d practices.    Harmony Bridge Exploit Leads to the Theft of 6M DAI Damages: The Harmony Bridge held around $100M in wrapped assets, the entirety of which was drained, meaning every 1-wrapped token is currently un-backed. Click for more info on the hack and resulting DAI loss.  Harmony\u2019s 2 of 5 multisig fell to a spearhead phishing campaign speculated to have been readied and performed by the Lazarus Group, the name was given to North Korea\u2019s state-sponsored hacking force. The team reached out numerous times over the week via on-chain correspondence but received no response as the last of the funds made their way through Tornado Cash.  Not Lazarus\u2019 first Rodeo  An FBI investigation identified that the methods used in the Ronin hack were eerily similar to attacks known to be carried out by the group, in which social engineering was utilized to gain access to company servers that contained the private keys used to sign legitimate network transactions. The Lazarus Group features two units with two distinct objectives:   BlueNorOff (APT-38, BeagleBoyz) is financially motivated sector hosting around 1,700 members. The sub-group primarily targets the SWIFT system and centralized and decentralized blockchain projects.  AndAriel (Andarial) focus lies on South Korean disruption. Not much is known about the sub-sector, but its targets have included everything from high-ranking Korean businessmen, to multi-national corporations, to government officials.   Potential Vectors for the Attack  Per a Twitter thread via Mudit Gupta, the heist falls in a string of similar \u201ctraditional hacks,\u201d where the breaching of centralized servers, rather than an on-chain attack, led to the tremendous losses. Though full details have yet to be released, Gupta speculates that this central server was breached, warning developers that the next generation of mega-hacks won\u2019t target chain-security but will come through more traditional vectors. He concludes that traditional security needs to be approached with the same vigor as chain-security.  What this means for Harmony  Harmony is functionally insolvent. Around $100M of its total $200M in locked value was housed on the Harmony Bridge. Without intervention, the chain is unlikely to recover. This figure may have dropped the hat a couple of months back, but with the VC landscape decimated, non-FTX/Alameda funding is tough to come by.  What this means for DAI  As multi-chain DeFi surged, many warned of centralized bridges\u2019 risks. Risks which, unfortunately, made themselves abundantly clear this year. DAI played a minimal role in the Harmony ecosystem, but a number of wrapped derivatives were siphoned and laundered all the same. Around 6 million DAI were initially locked in the bridge contract. Today, less than ~9.5k remains. Sidenote: Massive props to the PE team for staying the course. The Optimism wormhole (and similar implementations) enables DAI to flourish without the systematic risks inherent to centralized bridging contracts. Last year, many feared DAI was falling behind the competition as various \u201cstablecoins\u201d quickly made their market presence known via shiny, new layer-1s. But rather than playing to the noise, PE stayed the course, positioning the DAO and DAI to benefit from the next wave of layer-2 innovation fully.   This Twitter thread talks about how a Crypto Stealer attack works and how to protect against it, and basic malware analysis.   Current Events   Delegate Office Hours  We are excited to introduce a new Delegate Office Hours call on Thursday, July 7th at 16:00 UTC! What started as a discussion by Tim Schuppener, Raphael Spannocchi, and others to help improve communication and coordination between delegates and core units has now become a public call named Delegate Office Hours. Thomas Flitter of Governance Communications will host the call. The format for this first call is simple; a kickoff discussion panel where each delegate has five minutes to speak on any topic of their choice, followed by an open mic section. Everyone is welcome to attend. Coming to a Calendar near you! Join Link - Zoom   DUX Updates - Fresh Off the Press!   Governance Portal Release v0.6.0  The DUX Core Unit team spent June delivering two primary new features: Gasless Poll Voting and Delegate Migration. The team also worked on improving the resiliency and efficiency of their tech infrastructure, especially needed after a recent increase in traffic and Delegate contracts. The research and architecture design phase for the Gasless Poll Voting feature has been finalized, and the finished product is set to launch in Q3 of this year. The system will be:  Fully compatible with Maker\u2019s current voting system Free for the user Available to all MKR holders and delegates  The Delegate Migration feature, scheduled for launch in about two weeks, aims to streamline the migration process for expiring Delegate contracts, both for Recognized Delegates and for delegators.  Part 3 of the End-Game Summary by LongForWisdom  To aid his understanding and increase the accessibility of the ideas for everyone, @LongForWisdom posted a summary of Part 3 of @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan. The structured, bullet-pointed summary:  Stresses the simplicity of the process Points out budget challenges as the primary area of concern Highlights the need for best practices to achieve a general separation of powers  MetaDAOs may be the best way to compartmentalize this risk   Introduces ideas around DAO2DAO operations  Follow @LongForWisdom\u2019s Endgame Index List for a listing of Endgame-related posts and @LongForWisdom\u2019s summaries.  A Unified DAO Toolkit to Help Make Transparency Easy  In this post, @rune argues that we should have \u201cmaximum reasonable transparency\u201d regarding the work Core Units are engaging in. All significant work interactions between independent Core Units must be carried out publicly and thoroughly documented according to standardized procedures. @rune proposes a \u201cunified DAO toolkit\u201d to achieve this level of transparency. This kit would comprise a software tool used for workflow tracking, similar to Jira or Trello, and a wiki-like governance information dashboard. These two components combine governance and operations under a single system and allow for built-in transparency for \u201cfree.\u201d  Risk Updates - Fresh Off the Press!  The Risk Core Unit was busy in June. Particular areas of interest are their work developing a multi-chain DAI liquidity strategy, an update to the Makerburn website, and continuing work on Maker Risk Dashboard v3. The team put out an in-depth post regarding why we need better DAI liquidity across blockchains and how we can achieve it. Ways to boost cross-chain DAI liquidity include:  Liquidity Incentives: A limited scope of incentives to bootstrap DAI liquidity on external domains to the point where DAI markets become self-sustainable. Partnerships: Hand in hand with self-funded incentives, Maker can partner with external protocols to support DAI liquidity and integration in their projects. Community Visibility: Independent community members and/or MKR whales don\u2019t face the same governance and custody risks that MakerDAO itself would when deploying assets cross-chain. Hence, they could play an essential part in improving DAI liquidity across external domains.  The Makerburn website has new system surplus and estimate of annual profits pages.  The team recently made a post announcing v3 of the Maker Risk Dashboard.  For this third iteration, the team has:  Redesigned the website to provide a better and more accessible user experience Abstracted data, concepts, and models to reduce complexity and simplify the dashboard Added new features to provide access to data not previously available in v2     This Week in Governance   Weekly MIPs Update #94  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.  Executive Vote(s) Two executive votes passed this week, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:   MKR Vesting Transfers - June 22, 2022 \u2013 Passed on July 02, 2022, 13:03 UTC. Executed on July 04, 2022, 14:00 UTC.   Core Unit MKR Transfer and Advancing Collateral Offboardings - June 29, 2022 \u2013 Passed on June 29, 2022, 15:06 UTC. Executed on July 01, 2022, 16:40 UTC.    Core Unit MKR Vesting Transfers     Core Unit Amount Budget Proposal     Deco Fixed Rate (DECO-001) 500 MKR Budget Proposal   Real-World Finance (RWF-001) 152 MKR Budget Proposal   Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) 175 MKR Budget Proposal     Collateral Offboarding As per these successful polls for offboarding UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A, the following changes to liquidation parameters took place:     Parameter Vault Type + / - From / To     Liquidation Ratio UNI-A + 165% / 1300%   Liquidation Ratio UNIV2DAIETH-A + 120% / 2000%   Liquidation Ratio UNIV2WBTCETH-A + 145% / 2400%   Liquidation Ratio UNIV2WBTCDAI-A + 120% / 800%    The changes mentioned above will occur within 30 days. At the same time, the Flat Kick Incentive (tip), Liquidation Penalty (chop), and Debt Ceiling were set to 0 for all of these Collaterals. This executive vote follows a previously successful executive proposal, and it is the next step of performing collateral offboarding, as defined by MIP62. No changes to UNIV2UNIETH-A took place in this executive, as the vault-type already has 0 outstanding DAI. However, as this proposal passed, it will continue to be offboarded.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version    What in the DAO is Going On?!    Aave proposes its own overcollateralized stablecoin, GHO While still in its polling stage, the announcement came from Aave Companies, the centralized entity that supports the protocol. Maker and Aave are lending protocols, but they\u2019ve traditionally functioned under very different business models.  Through the Maker Protocol, users deposit assets to generate a set amount of DAI relative to the value of their deposit. Aave opted for the more traditional approach, where users deposit assets to earn interest. These deposits are then lent to borrowers at a premium.  Enter GHO, an overcollateralized stablecoin backed by myriad digital assets, which can only be minted against deposited collateral. If GHO is above peg, it\u2019s profitable to mint it using another stablecoin and \u201cshort it\u201d via stableswap pools. And if it dips below the peg? Paying back accrued debt is the most profitable path, allowing GHO\u2019s total supply to contract as repaid debt is burned. All this, of course, sounds vaguely familiar\u2026 Put simply, GHO aims to position itself as a direct DAI competitor with near-identical tokenomics. Click for more info on the GHO proposal   What makes GHO any different? Yield. GHO minters would receive token rewards on both deposits and borrows, enabling a \u201cdouble-sided\u201d yield. These incentives are furthered through offering a discount on GHO to all users with stkAAVE locked into Aave\u2019s Safety Module.  Aave Facilitators  Aave facilitators1600\u00d7800 95.9 KB  The proposal also introduced network \u201cFacilitators,\u201d i.e., protocols, entities, or institutions with the ability to \u2018trustlessly\u2019 generate GHO. Each Facilitator would be assigned a \u201cbucket,\u201d or an upward limit on the GHO they\u2019re able to mint, and any party gunning for the designation must first be voted in through community governance. The Aave Protocol will activate as the genesis facilitator if the proposal passes.  Portals for cross-chain transfer Another interesting feature briefly described in the post is \u2018Portals.\u2019 These portals enable users to mint GHO on Ethereum to distribute across networks any number of networks. Portals would utilize \u2018message passing\u2019, in which a message (ex. sendTokenAndExecute()) moves along the source chain through \u2018Gateways\u2019 that confirm the call, subtract the minimum fee, and prepare the outgoing transaction on the destination chain. It\u2019s then marked as approved and routed to the users\u2019 desired chain. Also, the proposal leaves room for adding real-world assets (RWA) as the platform moves into direct financing. The service will also initially run on Aave v2, though an upgrade to v3 is expected in the coming weeks. To follow the discussion on the launch, head to this thread.    The Week\u2019s Hottest Topic: Budget Reductions The majority of this week\u2019s most trafficked threads can be boiled down to the singular point of budgetary concerns. With liquidity tightening, protocols have shifted to \u2018survival mode,\u2019 with many now re-considering the total sums of their expense sheets. As the recent discussion shows, Maker is no exception. Several concerns have been expressed, with some of the more pressing including:  Despite rapidly falling revenue, protocol expenses are still climbing as budget increases continue to pass. Fear of MKR dilution as vested tokens are divvied to contributors, the treasury surplus is drained. The need for a defined, streamlined budgeting process with several intended improvements, including:    Making it easier to compare different budgets and proposals The ability to alter budgets without excessive micromanagement Further convergence between assigned and utilized budgets     As discourse progressed, several proposals calling to alter or off-board particular CU budgets made their way to the forum. The most recent of these can be found here, with an attached post by @Ippy outlining a series of theoretical reforms meant to streamline the budgeting and compensation process. The entirety of the discussion and its ramifications can be followed via the \u2018Current Events\u2019 section below or through this megathread provided by @LongforWisdom.   Current Events  Anyone following the Maker forums knows how hotly debated the topic of budgeting has been in recent months, and the past week was no exception. Today, we propose revamping Delegate compensation, instituting fire drills to test Delegates\u2019 emergency preparedness, and more.  Restructuring Incentives for Recognized Delegate Compensation  @aburban90 of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit believes that while it makes sense to compensate Recognized Delegates for the difficult task of voting effectively on every proposal, the current incentive structure is not well designed. In this post, he offers several new mechanisms he believes will improve the way. Delegate compensation works at MakerDAO. Weighting for Community Presence Weight Factor: Up to 30% Because a longer track record with Maker may indicate a deeper understanding of Maker\u2019s foundational values and core principles, this mechanism would compensate Delegates more the longer they\u2019ve been community members. A simple way to measure this factor is to check when a Delegate\u2019s first activity on the forums took place. Whale Backer Registry If a single source backs a large percentage of a Delegate\u2019s MKR, this information should be clearly transparent and publicly available. Skin In The Game Weight Factor: Depends on the Amount of Staked MKR This mechanism would require all Delegates to stake some of their own MKR as collateral before being eligible for any Delegate compensation. Some of this staked MKR could be slashed or burned when a Delegate is not effectively carrying out their duties. Compensation in MKR Delegates are compensated using DAI from the Surplus Buffer. @aburban90 would like to see Delegates compensated using a combination of DAI and MKR, redirecting some of the DAI taken from the Surplus Buffer to purchase MKR, which can then be added to the Delegate\u2019s voting power and vested. If a Delegate resigns, purchased but not distributed, MKR can be burned. According to the informal poll results, forum readers support compensating Delegates in MKR in addition to DAI and requiring Delegates to disclose whale-supported MKR backing.  Fire drill, Request for Discussion + Informal Polls  Part of the Immunefi Security Core Unit\u2019s mandate is the performance of \u201cfire drills\u201d\u2014practice events aimed at answering the question \u201cHow long would it take to pass an unexpected, unannounced emergency executive spell?\u201d The first fire drill was set to take place in February but was delayed due to the lack of a clear idea of what a fire drill should include. In this post, @psychonaut proposes the following process:  A fire drill will be declared every month at a random day and time. Delegates will be asked via emergency communication channels to sign a message. Reaction time will be measured and recorded.  Potential benefits include:  Regular testing of Delegates\u2019 emergency preparedness Reaction times displayed on Delegates\u2019 information pages, adding another metric for MKR holders to consider when delegating their voting power Reaction times could be incorporated into the Delegate compensation structure   CU Budget Reduction Initiatives - A Wiki Summary  This post by @LongForWisdom aims to gather budget-related initiatives, both Maker-wide and at the individual Core Unit level, in one place as a reference point for the community. This wiki post is freely editable by forum users with trust level 3 or higher @LongForWisdom has asked forum-goers well acquainted with the ongoing budgeting debates to contribute to the document.  pLaP59r636\u00d7888 86 KB   Endgame DVC Meeting - July 20 | Budget reductions and growth/marketing CU consolidations  @rune has announced his intention for the Endgame Decentralized Voter Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 20th at 7 pm UTC to focus on budget reduction plans. His approach involves streamlining Core Unit budgets by identifying the \u201clow hanging fruit where budgets can be reduced\u201d and then consolidating similar Core Units with unified budgets. @rune hopes that after gaining some clarity on budget questions, preliminary MKR voter support for an overall direction for future budget reductions and consolidations can be achieved, enabling Core Units \u201cto focus on their day-to-day more and not worry about sudden top-down budget changes.\u201d     Help Wanted! Andrew Burban of Strategic Happiness Core Unit asks for community help distributing Maker swag to EthCC in Paris. If anyone attending EthCC lives near New York or Washington D.C. and has some available baggage space, please, contact @aburban90 by July 14.

A suspicious poll appeared on the Voting Portal on July 08, 2022. It was later revealed on the Forum by @Prose11 that this was a fire drill to gauge celerity in response, with almost no previous notice to the community, to a malicious attack.  A fraction of the voting power shown in this breakdown reflects the voter\u2019s opinions on the drill\u2019s usefulness, although this test was not conceived as a means to evaluate that in the beginning. Suppose you wish to voice your opinion on this matter. In that case, there is currently a poll in the original thread aiming to effectively assess the community\u2019s sentiment in that regard: Is monthly a good frequency? How fast is fast enough for a Delegate to react? Should we incorporate some measure of reaction time into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier?

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version    CURRENT EVENTS    Ongoing Offboarding Proposals Three proposals have now been posted to offboard and remove various Core Units. As such, this made for a natural topic of discussion during this week\u2019s Delegate Office Hours. The discussion began with IS-001, represented by its facilitator, @psychonaut. Several options for compromise were presented and will be covered below. But first, it\u2019s worth noting that IS-001 first proposed these reductions in its June update before the proposal to offboard surfaced. As such, several delegates applauded IS-001 for its proactivity and feel the proposed changes offer a template for other facilitators to fix perceived issues before drastic measures are taken. IS-001\u2019s Proposed Reduction   A reduction of the current minimum monthly spend from 22k to 8k Payments to Immunefi drop from 10k monthly to 0 A reconsidering of active partnerships with Chaos Labs and DeFi Safety.   Note: An Immunefi budget cut would immediately cease report triaging, educational content, reports on non-critical vulnerabilities, as well as access to their war room/emergency response service. Further, IS-001 views Chaos Labs as an integral part of the future of the bug bounty program. Currently, whitehats don\u2019t have the incentive to spin up the proper environments to test and push the protocol. Chaos Labs enables this environment to be quickly installed, meaning additional eyes on the code and additional conditions being tested that might not have been considered. The conversation then broadened, and a few underlying problems were identified. First, we have three offboarding proposals running concurrently, but the MIP to revise this process has yet to go through. @twblack88 feels we need to start viewing these proposals through the lens of this new framework, which emphasizes working alongside CUs directly to encourage proactivity. The second was best put by @rspa.  \u201cWe want to see budgetary discipline, but we haven\u2019t established what that really means.\u201d  To him, this means allocating budgets to the \u201cright things,\u201d but we first need to establish a basis for deciding what the \u201cright things\u201d are. Before we continue down this path, a central strategy needs to be agreed upon, granting CUs a more detailed path to success and ensuring that various CU initiatives align under that message. The third served as more of a subtle reminder. @schuppi warns that while forum activity in no way dictates a majority opinion amongst MKR holders, from the outside looking in, it very much appears that way. An idea expounded on by @Thomas-flitter1. The Events CU was added very recently, delivered on the items laid out in their roadmap, and is still under fire due to market conditions. Put simply; they haven\u2019t been given enough time, particularly when they were indeed operating via the strategy that saw them ratified. To conclude, there\u2019s more work that needs to be done, but frameworks offering solutions to some of these issues are already in the works. All that said, based on the week\u2019s discussion, talks surrounding a DAO-wide strategy are sure to follow. Click here to watch the discussion in full. Active Offboarding Proposals   IS-001 Facilitator Offboarding | Budget Modification   EVENTS-001 | Budget Modification   SH-001 Facilitator Offboarding | Budget Modification     Hasu Proposes a One-Time Delegate Metric Reset In a Signal Request posted on the forum, Recognized Delegate Hasu requested a \u2018reset\u2019 of personal delegation metrics. The reasoning for the request stems from earlier confusion surrounding the expected roles, responsibilities, and commitments of a Recognized Delegate. To summarize the proposal:  Hasu originally joined with no intention of working as a salaried delegate but rather as a platform activist; however, this work became more time-consuming than initially expected. Hasu argues that under the current participation system, it would take years to reach the metrics required from a salaried delegate and requests a one-time \u2018reset\u2019 of personal participation metrics.  The signal currently sits at a 42% \u2018No\u2019 vote, with \u2018Abstain\u2019 trailing at 31%. The poll, shown here, will run through July 23rd.

The Schuppi and ElPro Delegate Happy Hour \u2013 Episode 1    Delegate Office Hours - Includes poll for discussion topic   Delegates @ultraschuppi and @flipflopflapdelegate joined forces for Episode 1 of the Schuppi and ElPro Delegate Happy Hour! In this series, the two Delegates hope to provide a \u201cvisual platform\u201d for Delegates to communicate the core values of their platform and their views on current events in the DAO. They also plan to invite non-Delegate Core Unit Team Members and Core Unit Facilitators in the future. And, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be happy hour without a live taste test of world beers!      Standard Delegate Office Hours session also took place last week. The primary topic of discussion, voted for by the community, was \u201cActive Core Unit Offboarding Proposals,\u201d just edging out \u201cMakerDAO Constitution.\u201d        BlockTower Credit - Introduction & Arranger Proposal  Well-known crypto investment fund BlockTower Capital, formed by Goldman Sachs alumnus Matthew Goetz and former University of Chicago endowments risk manager Ari Paul, made a post last week proposing becoming an arranger for MakerDAO and announcing their intention to request a $100MM DAI Vault at a 4% stability fee to fund senior secured, real-world credit assets. BlockTower currently manages \u201cwell over half a billion dollars\u201d in assets. BlockTower Credit manages a traditional asset-backed private credit strategy and securitizes its assets via DeFi channels. The team argues that because low-cost bank and insurance capital is difficult to secure in the crypto market, attractive yields for entities able to make these kinds of deals are up for grabs. Furthermore, the underlying credit assets tend to be of shorter duration (less than 2-3 years), which the team argues is an \u201cideal investment profile\u201d given the current state of Maker\u2019s penetration into the Real-World Asset (RWA) market. As an arranger for MakerDAO, BlockTower Credit would seek to leverage their experience, skills, and network to, in @rune\u2019s words, \u201csource, arrange, and propose RWA deals\u201d to scale up Maker\u2019s exposure to this asset class.   Endgame Plan Part 5: Endgame Product Roadmap - Pregame and Early Game  Part 5 of @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan focuses on the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap, a complete list of all the core Maker products and features that will be in place if the immutable Endgame state is achieved. An essential element of the Endgame Plan is that these features should be carefully defined at as early a stage as possible to avoid too much change once the Endgame Plan is actually launched.  1035\u00d7622 50.8 KB  This post focuses on Pregame products and features: low-cost, high-impact products that can be developed quickly and must be in place before the Endgame Plan launch. Some of @rune\u2019s proposed Pregame products include:  ETHD I: EtherDai  The central user-facing product of the entire Endgame Plan, since all other mechanisms and incentives aim to drive users toward EtherDai Vaults The goal is to have a staked ETH token under the control of Maker governance that can ultimately be upgraded to become a fully-fledged synthetic asset   Elixir I  The universal long-term liquidity solution for DAI, ETHD, and MKR in the Endgame Plan Used to automatically provide sustainable, captive liquidity on all key decentralized marketplaces   MetaDAO Tokens  Simple ERC20 tokens that the Maker Governance Security Module administratively owns   Simple off-chain voting  A system like snapshot.org for off-chain, gasless polling    Join @rune and other interested parties this Wednesday and Thursday at 7 PM UTC for the following Decentralized Voter Committees, this time focused on budget reductions and consolidating growth- and marketing-related Core Units. Last week\u2019s call was recorded and featured Nik from the Oracles Core Unit, who talked about the OCU roadmap and current initiatives and shared his thoughts about the Endgame Plan.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS    Budgeting for Bear Markets Bear markets are always bleak, but \u2018bleak\u2019 is an ever-shifting point of reference. For many, the current macro-economic landscape represents that fresh perspective. As such, much of the week\u2019s discussion focused on long-term profitability, with a wide range of posts and discussion calls centered around budgetary management. Some of these proposed solutions could see short-term ramifications, but they aim to position the DAO for the long term better. The most recent MakerDAO DVC Meeting discussed these concerns in detail. A written version of the signal, posted by @pipko of the Risk CU, and its ensuing discussion can be found in this thread. \u2026   Summary of the Risk CU\u2019s Budget Re-allocation Signal  \u201c[The protocol is] well capitalized with a return to profitability in sight, but cost structure must be reassessed.\u201d  Current Financial Position  The DAO incurred no \u2018bad debt\u2019 linked to key CeFi lenders despite significant initial exposure. Over a 1-month window that began on May 1, non-stable collateral fell from USD 3.3B to USD 1.2B, resulting in USD 11.3M in liquidation income. As of July 22, only 1.02B in non-stable collateral remains locked in the protocol, meaning the DAO can no longer rely on consistent liquidation income as a significant source of profit.  Forecasted Revenue & Cash Flow  The Protocol operates at a monthly loss of USD 2M until balance sheet assets are deployed into short-term treasury bonds. Without further deterioration in the crypto lending markets, Maker will break even by Q1 2023.  Paths Forward Of the two proposed options, the Risk CU prefers \u2018Option 2\u2019 but will support any solution chosen by the DAO and MKR holders. That said, given their preference, the \u201cTactical Re-Allocation\u201d option is more fleshed out in theory and form. As such, Option 2 will focus on this summary.  Risk&#39;s proposed paths forward934\u00d7495 286 KB  Per Risk\u2019s assessment, this approach enables token holders to allocate capital based on merit and granted holistically under a DAO-wide view. The framework aims to address myriad issues seen in the status quo, particularly surrounding:   Transparency into CU activities and initiatives; difficulties surrounding performance evaluation, and; non-simultaneous budgeting periods.   \u2026  Proposed Budgeting Process Note that each stage of this proposed process would be executed concurrently across all existing and proposed core units.  1458\u00d7797 102 KB  1. Core unit Budget & KPI Proposals  Delegates and MKR holders would determine the \u2018Targeted Spend\u2019 level for the budgeting period through an on-chain vote. CUs propose budgets, layout key operating activities, strategic goals, and KPIs, and highlight capital tradeoffs in a \u201clow/high\u201d budget allocation scenario. As part of this process, CUs promise to deliver operating results (in the form of KPIs) in return for a capital allocation from the DAO. As such, core units should identify and release operational KPIs that accurately reflect the impact and return their services offer the protocol. Delegates and MKR holders would then assist core units with developing, negotiating, and measuring KPIs to confirm that the targets set are reasonable for both the unit and the protocol.  2. Budget Proposal Evaluation With the help of delegates and MKR holders, several competing budget iterations would be drafted and polled. The general flow would track as follows:  Delegates and MKR holders vote in an on-chain ranked choice poll on the competing budget plans presented, excluding proposals that do not meet the agreed upon \u2018Target Spend.\u2019 After a ranked choice poll is selected, the winning budget plan is proposed to an on-chain binary vote.  3. Capital Allocation & KPI Re-Targeting After on-chain confirmation, CU Facilitators would be expected to communicate the perceived impact that both \u201clower and higher\u201d capital allocations would impact their KPIs, and new operational promises would be established. 4. Evaluation of KPI attainment Once the KPI period is complete, the delegates and MKR holders will review each core unit\u2019s KPI scorecard to understand how they performed against their strategic goals. Once KPI attainment can be condensed into a qualitative metric, Delegates and MKR holders would have the information necessary to make informed decisions moving forward. The post ends with a Signal Request meant to gauge community sentiment on the proposed options. Option 2: Tactical Reallocation has currently captured 48% of the total votes.  image1700\u00d7922 160 KB  Note that due to the urgency triggered by market conditions, this signal will run for one week and is set to end on July 30th.   Announcement: Delegate Migration  In this post, DUX Core Unit Facilitator @0xdeniz outlines a new feature added to the Governance Portal. Delegate contracts, through which delegators delegate their MKR voting power to delegates, expire after one year. Because of this, delegates and their delegators need to migrate to a new contract once the old one expires to ensure that delegated MKR intended to be activated in governance operations does not go \u201cstale.\u201d To facilitate this process, the Governance Portal UI now displays a banner letting both delegates and their delegators know when their existing delegate contract is expiring and offering guidance through the migration process.  979\u00d7727 204 KB    Request for feedback - legal work for MakerDAO  @Balloonist, a member of SES\u2019s currently incubating Legal Research Team, has put together a document intended to serve as a go-to resource for answering legal and other questions: \u201ca Stack Overflow-like database for DAO and DeFi problems and solutions.\u201d Balloonist envisions the document potentially becoming broader in scope and encompassing contributions from members of other DAOs to help define and refine problems and offer broadly applicable solutions.  1343\u00d7536 75.7 KB    Codeknight Delegate Platform   My goal is to turn Maker into a trillion-dollar entity that is easy to understand and decentralized. I am committed to helping grow Maker into a sustainable, profitable system.  @CodeKnight published their Delegate platform on Monday. Their core values include:  Simplifying the core protocol by eliminating unnecessary complexity, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the protocol and its governance, as well as making decentralization easier to achieve Developing sustainable, decentralized systems Making sure MKR holders\u2019 interests are represented  In terms of voting expectations, CodeKnight states that they will support proposals that anticipate \u201cstrong risk-adjusted returns\u201d and object to too expensive proposals.   End-Game Summary - Part 5  @LongForWisdom published a new edition of their work summarizing @rune\u2019s ongoing series of posts on his Endgame Plan. Part 5 of the Endgame Plan is the first to discuss the Endgame Plan Product Roadmap, a complete list of all the core Maker products and features that will need to be in place to establish the immutable Endgame state described in rune\u2019s posts. This summary provides basic info about each product delineated in the original post, along with notes on timelines and objectives.  756\u00d7327 55 KB   Dune  The Strategic Finance Core Unit has made its dashboards and queries publicly available. A wide range of data is accessible on topics from stablecoins to oracle gas fees.  1906\u00d7863 197 KB    Governance Security Module (GSM) Adjustment [Informal Poll]   2025\u00d7345 104 KB  The Governance Security Model (GSM) Pause Delay is used to help ensure MKR holders have time to review all upcoming protocol changes for malicious intent before they are enacted. This poll, which aims to gather sentiment from the community on whether to adjust the GSM Pause Delay, is coming to a close. The \u201cno change\u201d option is currently in the lead, which would preserve the current GSM Pause Delay of 48 hours.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version    CURRENT EVENTS   MIP-6 Declaration of Intent \u2013 Invest in short-term bonds \u2013 Proposal for implementation  @backed-finance presents a Collateral Onboarding application for tokenized, short-term Treasury bonds held under Swiss law. The proposal points to MIP13c3-SP12, which ratified a \u2018Declaration of Intent\u2019 for the DAO to invest in such bonds. Under the proposed terms, Backed Finance would create \u201con-chain, permissionless securities backed 1:1 with an underlying, short-term bond ETF\u201d to be held by a secure, third-party custodian in Switzerland. Market participants would then sell these tokenized bonds to the DAO. The preliminary concept (subject to RFC) would utilize a \u201cmodified PSM implementation,\u201d incentivizing market participants to sell tokenized ETFs in exchange for newly minted DAI. Per the MIP, all trading would be liquid, permissionless, and require no active management or KYC on the part of the protocol.  Summary of the proposed asset \u2b9b  Token: Backed iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCTIS ETF (Accumulating) Contract Address: 0x9ABB4E7f4ee96cA58F156338640aEd031188E5E1   Its subsidiary, Backed Assets, would tokenize IBTA (USD denominated Treasury bonds) securities on the Ethereum chain, granting the protocol access to passive revenue in a \u201cfully permissionless way.\u201d The asset is \"fully backed by the linked underlying. The token is an ERC-20, entitling its holders to the right to redeem it for fiat through the issuer at any time (during standard business hours). The token is a new issuance and would begin with a circulating supply of zero on-chain. As the asset is an ERC-20, transactions would also be settled on-chain.  Note: As the underlying is conventional security, it\u2019s inherently based on a trusted system, which operates as follows: The underlying capital is purchased through a Broker and placed in a custody account. This custody account is then supervised by an unrelated third party (referred to as the \u201cSecurity Agent\u201d), who has the authority to \u201cblock the account and liquidate assets to repay holders the value of their investment.\u201d  Current Custodian: ISP Securities AG, Zurich, Switzerland Current Security Agent: Security Agent Services AG, Baarerstrasse 75, 6300 Zug, Switzerland   Summary of Proposed Use Cases \u2b9b  The DAI generated through this vault would be distributed to its depositors at a slight spread. Following oracle price updates, \u201cthe price change should mint new DAI directly into the surplus buffer.\u201d The vault\u2019s Debt Ceiling would be calculated as a percentage of the DAO\u2019s stablecoin holdings to allow the volume to shift toward the proposed ETF token. Backed Finance proposes an initial Debt Ceiling of $50M.   Given the potential of the proposal, its generated quite a bit of discussion. If you\u2019re looking to weigh in or follow the debate, the post can be found here.   Delegate Participation & Compensation  Four delegation-centric proposals made their way to the Forums last week. GovAlpha Facilitator, @Patrick_J, posted three frameworks to define and streamline the process for delegate participation and compensation. The fourth, via @GFXlabs, proposes an amendment period for Recognized Delegate participation metrics. MIP-77: Delegates in the Maker Protocol aims to establish a baseline definition of the Recognized Delegate role and provide a framework, or \u201cfoundational MIP,\u201d upon which future iterations can be implemented.  Summary of Roles & Responsibilities \u2b9b Per the proposal, the role of a Recognized Delegate can be broken down into two parts:   To express an opinion on on-chain Governance processes by casting regular votes. To communicate their voting decisions and the rationale behind them.   Beyond this, Recognized Delegates may take on additional roles and responsibilities as they see fit.  Summary of Participation & Communication Metrics \u2b9b Recognized Delegates are expected to vote on Executive Proposals or voice their explicit opposition within 72 hours of their posting. Failing to vote for an Executive would not count against a Recognized Delegate\u2019s participation metrics if sound reasoning for the absence is provided (as assessed by Governance Facilitators). Further, Recognized Delegates would be expected to communicate their vote within seven days of a Governance Poll\u2019s conclusion.  Summary of Regonized Delegate Metric Reset \u2b9b Under the proposed framework, a Recognized Delegate could request a reset of their tracked metrics if approved by a majority of Governance Facilitators. If approved, a Recognized Delegate may choose any date within the last three months as the new \u201cstart date\u201d for tracking personal metrics. These requests could only be made once per year. MIP-78: Recognized Delegate DAI Compensation seeks to define the DAO\u2019s process for awarding DAI compensation to Recognized Delegates. The Maker Protocol compensates Recognized Delegates to incentivize their participation in the system of governance. In return, the Protocol receives a diverse group of individuals capable and incentivized to study proposals, cast votes, and communicate their reasoning to a public forum.  Summary of MIP-78\u2019s Proposed Goals \u2b9b  DAI compensation should positively correlate to voting weight. One Recognized Delegate\u2019s compensation should be independent of another\u2019s compensation. This compensation would be positively skewed toward Recognized Delegates with smaller voting weight to encourage the recruitment of new Recognized Delegates. A cap on the maximum DAI compensation a single delegate can receive should be imposed. Recognized Delegates with high voting weights should receive enough compensation from having the option to hire an assistant(s). The system should allow for and appropriately compensate Recognized Delegates acting as part of a team or group.   Initial Parameters if Ratified \u2b9b  MIP-79: Recognized Delegate MKR Compensation shares a similar goal as the above but is geared toward the growth and retention of talented Recognized Delegates. The proposed system aims to encourage a \u201clonger-term\u201d mindset that would more fully align Recognized Delegates with the MKR holders that delegate to them. If the MIP passes as proposed, MKR will be distributed to Recognized Delegates using DssVest to an address of their choice. Streams must have a twelve-month duration and a cliff date of twelve months. Governance Facilitators will post the amount of MKR to be streamed, stream dates, and cliff dates to the Maker Governance Forum in advance of the relevant Executive Vote.  How would vesting be calculated? \u2b9b  \"Once a Recognized Delegate has been active for six months, in effect, six months since they completed the steps to become a Recognized Delegate defined in MIP77c2 and received their first delegated MKR tokens, the Governance Facilitators will calculate the total DAI compensation the Recognized Delegate has received in that time. This value will be divided by the 12-month rolling average price of the MKR token in DAI. This will calculate the amount of MKR vesting to which the Recognized Delegate is entitled.\"  MIP4c2-SP24: Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics proposes to amend the feedback loop for delegate participation, which is a key variable in the calculation of their compensation. If passed, the proposal would amend the language ratified in MIP61c2. The proposed alterations can be found here.   Clarifications about my take on LOVE vs. MetaDAO and a diagram of approval voting   With a set of broadly supported core system delegates, we can start untangling this mess without every single vote being split down the middle based on essentially political lines.  MakerDAO co-founder @nikolai clarified his views on the LOVE and MetaDAO proposals. In short: \u201cI am not in favor of the MetaDAO proposal any more than I am in favor of the LOVE proposal.\u201d Nikolai believes that Maker governance is largely split down the middle, resulting in contentious vote after contentious vote and a roster of Delegates lacking broad support due to the current simple majority voting system. He argues that before making any severe changes to the governance system, Maker needs to address this \u201cdysfunctional\u201d governance situation by reducing complexity and clarifying how the current voting system works.   Meet Your Delegate #17  The Meet Your Delegate public call #17 will take place this Wednesday at 1 pm UTC. For this session, Delegate Candidate @CodeKnight will present their platform and field questions from the audience. Continuing from the previous episode, @pvl will also be hosting a Q&A (check out his platform and slides from the last call). Zoom Meeting ID: 823 9827 1372 Passcode: MYD17  MakerDAO Actual Expenses vs Budget - June 2022  The Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF) has released the Actual Expenses vs. Budget report for June. Highlights include:  Reported DAI expenses incurred were 2.9M in May, 0.6M lower than forecast. Forecasted expenses are expected to stabilize to around 3.2M/month by July, a 40M annual run-rate (slightly lower than forecasted in April). SF has started proactive work around reducing burn rates to mitigate the impact of the bear market on the protocol (follow the bear-prep tag on the forums to find these initiatives).    What happens when you send 1 DAI  This blog post doesn\u2019t come from the forums, but it\u2019s too valuable not to share. Learn how DAI transactions work at the nuts-and-bolts level, down to how the transaction is executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  This piece is quite technical, but concepts are well explained, and plenty of background material is provided to fill any knowledge gaps.   This Week in Governance  Weekly MIPs Update #98  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.   Executive Vote(s) Back to voting with this week\u2019s Executive, which is currently up on the Portal and awaiting your participation: Onboarding Real World Asset Vaults \u2013 Posted on July 29, 2022.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version    CURRENT EVENTS       Breaking Down the RWA-001 Rift  A number of related, high-trafficked posts took root over the course of the week; each related to RWA. A summary of the events links to all relevant discussions and further details can be found below. Summary of RWA-centric Events \u2b9f  williamr is currently the sole, listed member of RWF-001, as the peripheral team was let go. Former members of RWF-001, christiancdpetersen, teej, and eumenes, proposed the inception of a new RWF Core Unit, dubbed RWF-0x. The initial proposal was met with confusion; as to that point, the greater community was unaware of any conflict within RWF-001. The proposed RWF-0x team questioned williamr\u2019s positioning of the CU and its underlying strategy. williamr followed with a post defending his position, which included screenshots of private correspondence between team members - a topic which became highly contentious as the week progressed. Another thread, posted by SebVentures, requests the funds necessary to \u201cunblock\u201d the currently stalled initiative to generate revenue via short-term bonds.  Detailed Timeline & Breakdown of RWA-centric Events \u2b9f The two MIPs were posted in conjunction. The remaining links direct to the myriad discussions that spawned from those initial posts.  MIP39c2-SP34: Creating RWF0x from a Split of RWF-001  August 3, 2022 - christiancdpetersen posts the above MIP, which proposes a split from RWF-001. Under the terms of the current proposal, RWF would be split into two Core Units, and 75% of RWF-001\u2019s budget would be re-allocated to RWF-0x.  MIP40c3-SP78: RWF-0x Budget Proposal through 2022  August 3, 2022 - christiancdpetersen outlines the budget for the proposed RWF-0x Core Unit. The proposal requests funding through the end of the year with the following expenditure breakdown:   Delegate Office Hours: RWF Split into RWF-0x & RWF-001  August 5, 2022 - Naturally, last week\u2019s Delegate Office Hours centered around this RWF rift. A Brief Summary of the Call \u2b9f  monkey.irish speaks on the deals currently left in limbo by the split. He is currently working with both willamr and the proposed RWF-0x team to facilitate negotiations in the interim. Business continuity is currently his highest priority. It was confirmed that the entire peripheral team was fired. PaperImperium notes that a replacement team has been put into place by williamr. Per Mark Phillips, the delay is currently costing the DAO 50k USD per day in legal fees. A general consensus was met that more information was needed from the parties involved to form a proper action plan.   williamr\u2019s \u2018Response to unnacceptable behavior\u2019  August 5, 2022 - willamr provides his side of the story, including screenshots of private correspondence between team members. The original post was soon edited to exclude this information, but Recognized Delegate ChrisBlec chose to save and re-post the conversations for \u201cfull transparency.\u201d Several community members have shared their thoughts on the topic, and the current sentiment is split.  Unblocking the stalled short-term bonds revenues generating initiatives  August 7th, 2022 - SebVentures requests funding to continue with the delayed projects established by MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution and MIP-6: Invest in short-term bonds. Per the post:  \u201cEvery day of delay has a 40-80k DAI opportunity cost. It is key to return to profitability (see ALM forecast).\u201d  SF-001 requests 500k DAI from the RWF-001 legal budget, currently controlled by willamr, to be deposited into the SF-001 wallet for any legal fees incurred in pursuing the above deals.  [Informal Poll] Should we allow leaked private conversations on the forum?  The final topic of discussion came from TRUEMAKER in a follow-up poll that questions whether or not the sharing of private conversations should be allowed, and if not - should the responsible parties be penalized in any form. \u2018Abstain\u2019 and \u2018Not Allowed\u2019 currently lead the vote at 41% and 38%, respectively.     Do you support the End Game Plan?  In an effort to get a better sense of the level of support among the community for rune\u2019s Endgame Plan, Ippy submitted an informal poll asking simply: \u201cDo you support the End Game Plan?\u201d At the time of writing, opinions appear to be split roughly evenly.  1662\u00d7757 115 KB   Poll closes: 2022-08-11T04:00:00Z   DAI-Backed Collateral Initiative to Gather Information  GovAlpha\u2019s LongForWisdom has announced the launch of an initiative to create simple documentation\u2014sentence and paragraph summaries\u2014explaining each of DAI\u2019s backing assets, including RWA. Several community members have already stepped in to provide asset descriptions and share feedback about the project.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Breakdown - July 2022  The Recognized Delegate Compensation Breakdown for July has been released. 121,808 DAI in compensation was distributed to Delegates in July, compared to 78,062 in May and 73,612 in June.  1036\u00d7583 128 KB    SocGen Forge OFH: Granting final permission after the onboarding  This week, the final steps in onboarding the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SocGen FORGE OFH token (RWA008-A) will take place when SocGen\u2019s wallet address is officially added to the Vault contract.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS   Tornado Cash Sanctions  We finally reached that subtle paradigm shift, where the line between human and machine begins to blur. Smart contracts can now be sanctioned as if they were sentient. In a press release distributed on August 8th by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the popular mixing service, Tornado Cash and its contracts heard the gavel fall. In an unprecedented move, OFAC designated the smart contracts as  Specially Designated Nationals - a classification typically reserved for nation-states and terrorist organizations. Tornado Cash and its IP were designated under EO. 13694, an Executive Order enabling the blocking of property and assets of individuals engaged in malicious online activity. Per the report: \u2b9f  Tornado Cash has been used to launder over $7 billion since its 2019 inception. Of that total, at least $455 million was stolen by the Lazarus Group - North Korea\u2019s state-sponsored hacking arm. We\u2019ve already seen 96 million USD stolen and laundered from the Harmony ONE bridge heist and at least 7.8 million USD via the Nomad exploit in 2022.  Results of the imposed sanctions: \u2b9f  All properties and IP associated with Tornado Cash in the United States are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. Any entities owned directly or indirectly by \u201cone or more blocked persons\u201d will also be blocked. All transactions by U.S.-centered blockees involving the sanctioned assets are prohibited without a specific license issued by OFAC.  Surprisingly, the news wasn\u2019t well received, and several high-profile crypto-natives have now levied their two cents on the implications of the imposed sanctions. Among these was @Rune, who shared his views in a recent interview with Coindesk. He feels the sanctions are counter-productive, even bordering on pointless. Due to the nature of open-source software, it\u2019s a simple procedure to redeploy an identical protocol.  \u201cTarget the criminals you actually want to target.\u201d  If the goal is to utilize a \u201cblacklisting\u201d procedure on state-sponsored hacking groups, shutting down the infrastructure won\u2019t accomplish it. Instead, known North-Korean Ethereum wallets should be actively monitored, allowing for stolen assets to be frozen the moment they enter these wallets. Rune ends with a warning that blanket bans like these only serve to stifle innovation that can truly benefit the average consumer. But as it goes, the effects of the sanctions didn\u2019t stop with Tornado Cash. The report only mentioned mixing services directly, but some view Tornado as the first of many dominos to fall. Aave responded by blocking all addresses that had interfaced with Tornado Cash from its front-end. Furthermore, per a tweet via banteg - they certainly aren\u2019t alone in their efforts.   twitter.com    banteg @bantg  when defi apps started snitching on you, with links  2021-10-25 uniswap github.com/Uniswap/interf\u2026 2022-05-10 ren github.com/renproject/bri\u2026 2022-06-29 balancer github.com/balancer-labs/\u2026 2022-08-11 oasis github.com/OasisDEX/oasis\u2026 2022-08-12 aave github.com/aave/interface\u2026 (never) yearn, curve https://t.co/1FkgVPnUqb   11:52 PM - 12 Aug 2022           1.1K                270            Links are provided to the Github pages of Uniswap, Ren, Balancer, Oasis, and Aave, highlighting the moments \u201cwhen DeFi apps started snitching on you.\u201d An ongoing discussion centered around the sanctions, as well as the suspected arrest of a Tornado Cash developer, can be found here.  A \u2018Project-Based Budgeting\u2019 Proposal  @juan of SES-001 outlined his ideas for a new method of budget distribution. The proposal views the current structure as imbalanced, with the \u201cWorkforce\u201d maintaining full control over the work being done, as well as its prioritization. A summary of the proposed changes: \u2b9f Currently MKR holders:  Must accept or reject the whole deal, are unable to provide direction; and find themselves discussing people rather than work.  If polled as proposed, a CU would propose any number of projects with all expenses attached. A general budget would then be assigned, and these projects would be voted on and ranked via on-chain Governance.  High-level Roadmap of Proposal1974\u00d71110 184 KB  Any projects that fall within the assigned budget limit receive funding. Those that remain would be discarded. This implementation provides two primary advantages: \u2b9f  It grants MKR holders the means to choose the projects they want to see built. Currently, budgetary proposals trend toward a Core Unit vs. MKR holder mentality. The proposed model encourages productive discussion surrounding the merits of individual projects, thus decreasing the friction inherent to an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach.  A link to the proposal and its ensuing discussion can be found here.  Monthly Financial Reporting | July 2022  @adcv of SF-001 provides an updated look into the DAO\u2019s current and forecasted financials. The full slide deck can be found here. A summary of the report: \u2b9f  710\u00d7278 14.1 KB   The post highlights these topics as priorities for community consideration:  [SIGNAL REQUEST] N6M Target Spend Level Lower ETH/WBTC stability fees to reduce USDC reliance and attract more borrowers URGENT: Signal Request Set Aave D3M bar to 0% [GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Form Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022  SF-001 concludes with a Dune query that includes all relevant wallet addresses and their current standing.

Governance Voting and Delegation Compensation   MIPX: Maker Compensation Guidelines   [Temperature Check] Guidelines for MKR compensation  Last week, Recognized Delegate @CodeKnight submitted a poll pointing out the disorganized nature of Core Unit MKR compensation, noting that current guidelines and methods vary significantly and are decoupled from the overall health of the DAO. Poll participants supported linking MKR compensation to the financial state of the DAO, rejected tying it to MKR\u2019s price performance, and rejected standardizing it to implement equal compensation among Core Units. A few days later, CodeKnight submitted the proposal idea MIPX, which defines an annual amount of MKR each Core Unit will receive in compensation to bolster personnel recruitment and retention efforts. The proposed distribution method is to transfer MKR compensation to each Core Unit Facilitator, who will have the flexibility to work out the best way of distributing the funds for their unique Core Unit situation. The proposed compensation amount is 75% of Core Unit salaries with a four-year vesting schedule and a one-year cliff.  Governance Voting Incentive Campaign  Events Core Unit Facilitator @PonJerry posted a plan for incentivizing small MKR holders to participate in MakerDAO governance via a voting incentive campaign. The idea is to leverage the high demand for DAIvinity tickets by offering them as a reward for participating in governance voting. Potential benefits include:  An increase of <50 MKR holder participation Promotion for people to procure MKR and start participating in governance voting Increased social media chatter about MKR voting Drawing more social media attention to Maker generally Better representation of MKR holders at DAIvinity events    Special Purpose Fund Proposals  Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program  This RFC from @kat outlines Subproposal MIP55c3-SP7, which asks for an allocation of 81,000 DAI to the Ambassador Program, an initiative that aims to create further MakerDAO resources and educational content in languages other than English. So far, the program has focused primarily on Spanish, resulting in a significant increase in Latin American users and topics on the forums\u2014the top post of 2022 by SourceCred credits is in Spanish.   Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund  This RFC from the Strategic Finance Core Unit\u2019s @adcv requests a 50k DAI advance to cover legal expenses involved in the greenlit bIBTA application. The funding will investigate any potential legal consequences of onboarding a bIBTA Vault, a prerequisite to continuing technical work on the project.   The Chopping Block - Live Debate  The Chopping Block Live! - with Hasu & Rune - YouTube  @Hasu and @rune participated in a live debate with Compound\u2019s Robert Leshner and others on the future of MakerDAO. Topics covered include:  MakerDAO\u2019s business model, potential implications of the TornadoCash sanctions on MakerDAO\u2019s collateral strategy, and Hasu and rune\u2019s different approaches to DAO governance.     This Week in Governance   Weekly MIPs Update #100!  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.   Executive Vote(s) After an unexpected quota of back-and-forth with some of the parties involved, a hefty Executive was proposed and passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol: MOMC Parameter Changes, SocGen Vault Drawdown Authorization, Recognized Delegate Compensation, HVBank Legal Agreement Amendment - August 12, 2022, \u2013 Passed on August 12, 2022, 21:20 UTC.

However, due to the key holders being unavailable during the spell creation and validation, the ownership of the operator wallet could not be verified. The ownership has now been verified. The final permission to SocGen\u2019s wallet which will allow them to drawdown DAI was granted. Please see this post from the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES-001) that explains this in more detail.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS  DAOs are often judged for their shortcomings, but as for their triumphs? Well, maybe success just doesn\u2019t sell. Instead, the peanut gallery congregates en masse, armed with smug grins and cheap rhetoric. The past two weeks have been messy. There\u2019s no denying that, but we\u2019ve also seen a tremendous response from the greater community towards establishing a viable plan of action in the interim. And therein lies a DAO\u2019s strength - built-in redundancy that enables swift responses to hindering problems.  MIP41c5-SP10: Facilitator Offboarding (RWF-001)  Authored by Recognized Delegates @ultraschuppi and @JustinCase, this MIP proposes the offboarding of RWF-001\u2019s incumbent Facilitator. To summarize its motivations: \u2b9f  Per the proposal, @williamr is \u201cactively divesting\u201d RWF-001 from its duties. Further, current RWF-001 projects have been left \u201cabandoned\u201d, and its mandates to various CUs remain \u201cunfulfilled\u201d.  This MIP is meant to provide MKR holders an option for action if, by the time the proposal moves on-chain, RWF-001 continues to shirk the responsibilities outlined in its mandate. That said, a tangible plan of action, articulated and executed by williamr, is preferred. The MIPS and proposals below represent the work mandated to RWF-001, currently being advanced by separate Core Units and interested parties.  MIP55c3-SP8: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund  This MIP, penned by @adcv, @aes, and @SebVentures, requests an SPF totaling 30k DAI to reimburse @christiancdpetersen for the legal work required to advance the deal ratified in MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale | Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution. Funding Breakdown \u2b9f  Posted within MIP65, williamr shares his updated thoughts on the state and continuance of the project.  I am recommending an amendment to MIP65 based on changes related to responsibility in the performance of the legal work for this structure. The MIP65 was originally drafted with a scope in mind which is currently changing as per funding requests by other core units: CES and SF. With that in mind, it is only natural that the accountability for verifying the performance of legal duties is also amended to reflect the changes in responsibility for undertaking the work. Or at a minimum, supervising that the legal review is done in accordance with best practices. Given that RWF is not engaging the legal contractor to perform the review on MIP65, it is natural it should not have the responsibility for supervising its proper execution. I am therefore requesting that governance aligns the accountability for verification of legal & governance structure with the responsibility of the performance of the task of legal review. Therefore placing the accountability with the responsible core unit, whichever team contracts the legal services for this MIP. Thanks, William   Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR)  In response to the above, Monkey.irish requests a Project-based Funding Request (PFR) to use the existing CES-001 core unit budget for professional services related to the management and on-boarding of collateral assets. Funding Breakdown \u2b9f The PFR requests approval for the use of:  44,000 DAI, or 45% of CES-001\u2019s current Professional Services budget line item. 56,000 DAI, or 40% of CES-001\u2019s current Contingency Buffer line item.  The proposal notes that this total, or 100k DAI, only represents an allocation due to the significant variance in the costs of professional services specific to real-world assets (RWAs). Under the terms of this proposal, CES-001 would fulfill the onboarding and management requirements of RWAs, a role currently mandated to the RWF-001. Note: this proposal is meant as an alternative to the various SPFs stemming from deals stalled by the current RWF-001 situation.    Huntingdon Valley Bank RWA Deal - Official Announcement!      Credit: @Growth-Core-Unit  Today is a defining moment to truly envision the potential of connecting decentralized finance and real-world finance. Huntingdon Valley Bank and Maker pioneer the first commercial loan participation between a U.S. Regulated Financial Institution and a decentralized digital currency. Maker is connecting to the legacy economy through the largest real-world asset vault to date and its first relationship with a US-based bank. This integration involves a 100 million DAI participation facility to support the growth of Huntingdon Valley Bank\u2019s existing and new businesses.    Delegate Priority Surfacing Tool - Round 1 Results  Recognized Delegate @rspa shared the survey results he issued to delegates last month. The survey was intended to serve as a \u201cconsensus enabling tool\u201d by revealing delegates\u2019 biggest priorities for the next three months. Participants were asked first to enter priority topics in a spreadsheet, then to distribute 1,000 points between the priority topics already collected to help determine a \u201ccollective prioritization score.\u201d  1035\u00d7358 39.4 KB  The top three priorities were:  Increasing vault usage (2399.84 points) Increasing DAI supply (1844 points) Ramping up MIP65 and other PSM yield strategies (1824 points)  The community received this initiative well, which strongly favors undertaking another round.   Llama\u2019s delegation program as Delegation Captain  @luca_pro announced on Discord that he would join Recognized Delegate @Llama\u2019s delegation program as Delegation Captain, heading up Llama\u2019s public communications. Llama works with many well-known DAOs and DeFi protocols, including Aave, Uniswap, Gitcoin, and more. Check out their Delegate Platform here.   Frontier Research Delegate Platform  @Matt_NZ published his Delegate Platform as Frontier Research LLC. Matt, who has been actively following MakerDAO since 2019, is a New Zealand lawyer and legal scholar specializing in the intersection of law and technology. He specializes in decentralized finance, decentralized governance, and the regulatory environment around emerging technologies.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS  We live in an era defined by change. We witnessed the rise of technology and the emergence of the information age. We watched Web2\u2019s slow decay from unadulterated creativity to a corporate sandbox. Furthermore, we saw the rise of financial cryptography, which, if you are here today, has likely struck a chord with you. All this to say, the world around us and our interpretation of it is moving at a rate never before experienced. Unfortunately, speed doesn\u2019t always correlate with efficiency. Hard times come steeped with hard choices, even more so in business. Hierarchical models have centuries of data and frameworks to refer to; however, the rulebook for Web3 has not yet been written. All the same, community members took it upon themselves to get the ball rolling. Their first order of business: develop a standardized framework for CU offboarding.  MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments  Recognized Delegate @twblack88, in conjunction with @gfxlabs, @blimpa, and @Gala, authored and released an amended framework for Core Unit Offboarding, dubbed MIP4c2-SP15. The framework was polled and ratified on-chain on August 8th, with nearly 87% of voters in support. As we wade through numerous offboarding proposals, it would be beneficial to view them through the lens of this new framework. Summary of its motivations \u2b9f  The MIP\u2019s original motivation was to clarify and simplify the CU offboarding process, with the overall goal of reducing dysfunction in the event of a business disruption. In addition to the alterations stemming from the proposed MIP, necessary changes to MIPs 38, 39, and 41 were also recommended to streamline the process further and limit the DAO\u2019s exposure to painful, time-consuming tangents.  Summary of its goals \u2b9f  Solidify the Core Unit offboarding process.  Simplify and templatize the process for offboarding. Clarify offboarding terms within the governance cycle. Establish a standard for proposers.   Introduce and format expectations on project timelines, workflow, and budgetary processes. Have the offboarding process reference the new Core Unit Budget process (pending approval). Add templates where appropriate, or finalize WIP from the original MIP4. Propose an unwinding plan for core units with legacy budgets as the revised MIP40 came along.  Changes to MIPs 38, 39, and 41 - made in conjunction with the proposed MIP\u2b9f   MIP38 - The new framework for CU offboarding was added, as well as the means to propose an offboarding through one MIP subcomponent.  MIP39 - References were added to the requisite MIPS, and the framework\u2019s definition was finalized.  MIP41 - The offboarding process was mentioned, but not clearly defined. Further, no framework was in place to handle the loss of a CU Facilitator. Language was added to remedy both issues.  A detailed breakdown of the above changes can be found in the links provided above. With this framework in mind, let\u2019s review the progression of the most recent offboarding proposals.  MIP39c3-SP2: Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding  The original proposal was withdrawn in favor of a new MIP penned under the guidance and specifications of the above framework. Under the proposed terms, a severance of 45K DAI - or around 33% of its ratified annual salary -  will be awarded to the unit\u2019s Facilitator per a passing vote. The MIP is set to enter its one-week Frozen Period on September 1st and will be included in the September governance cycle. This proposal can be discussed here or through the link above.  MIP41c5-SP10: Facilitator Offboarding (IS-001)  In the MIPs sub-proposal, blimpa of GovAlpha provides an updated timeline of events and links to relevant resources. A transcription can be found below.  This is a valid offboarding proposal under the currently approved governance process.  MIP40c3-SP77 (Budget Modification) along with MIP41c5-SP10 (Facilitator Offboarding) aims to offboard the Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001). If the offboarding proposal is ratified, the existing DAI and MKR vesting streams will be canceled. This proposal asks the Community or IS-001 to propose an adequate severance plan for the contributors. No execution plan is provided. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here. This author of the proposal has stated that they are willing to keep the proposal in RFC after a compromise has been reached.  This proposal is set to enter its Frozen Period on September 1st and will be included in the September Governance Cycle.  MIP41c5-SP11: Facilitator Offboarding (SF-001)  Proposed on August 9th, this MIP requests the removal of @aes, SF-001\u2019s incumbent Facilitator. Its motivations are sparse, but a summary can be found below. Summary of its motivations \u2b9f  SF became increasingly more expensive without showing much value. A blurry mandate became experiments that can be a waste of time and risky projects. \"We\u2019re Building Something, Here, Detective, We\u2019re Building It From Scratch. All The Pieces Matter.\u201d Det. Lester Freamon   The unit advocates for a \u201cbear market strategy,\u201d but its budget has seen significant increases over the year. The unit advocates for a \u201cbear market strategy,\u201d but its budget has seen significant increases over the year. However, this followed the new MIP40 guidelines, which passed to grant SF-001 their \u2018business as usual\u2019 budget, approved by MKR token holders. The proposal argues a lack of results given its budget, as well as a general \u201clack of professionalism\u201d in its handling.  In line with the above, this MIP is set to enter its Freeze Period on September 1st and will be included in the September Governance Cycle.

Hi everyone, thanks for checking out the Weekly Relay! Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS  Sometimes, the proper introduction has already been written. @g_dip provides a detailed account of Maker\u2019s recent movement, activity, and drama in the Twitter thread below.   twitter.com    Greg Di Prisco | gdip.eth @g_dip  A thread summarizing the latest Maker Drama\u2122   How we went from onboarding a US Commercial Bank to discussing how to depeg from the US dollar in less than two months.

Summarized goals of the initial release: \u2b9f  Provide a clear overview of all the MakerDAO Core Units, their mandate, related MIPs, and practical info such as their social media profiles. Enable all Core Unit Administrators to easily submit their monthly budget reports in a standardized format, including Core Unit expenses and a rolling three-month forecast. Allow Core Units and their auditors to easily access and review monthly budget reports in a single location.  Per SES, the dashboard is built atop three core components: \u2b9f  1. The Dashboard UI   1920\u00d71080 150 KB  As the primary focus of the initial release, the UI allows interested parties to review and verify all submitted budget reports in one central location.  2. The CU Budget Reporting Tool  This tool allows CUs to securely and conveniently upload their data through the provided API. Initially launched in June of this year, the focus will shift towards onboarding any remaining CUs.  3. The Ecosystem Performance API  This underlying component heavily bolsters data availability, enabling a means to permissionless access data relevant to the community, the greater Maker Ecosystem, and third-party builders. Next Steps: \u2b9f In the immediate future, the focus will be centered on:  Onboarding the rest of the Core Units; Ensuring that the data is complete, correct, and up to date; Incremental UX and other improvements based on user feedback.   \u201cFurther down the road, we will target a broader user base, add more features, and advance the Dashboard as the primary collaboration tool for DAO stakeholders.\u201d   The MIP-set currently known as MIPXX  A flurry of new MIPs was posted Wednesday, September 7th, each tagged as MIPXX.

If passed as proposed, the following changes would be enacted:  The Protocol Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) would be activated This approach aims to emulate the \u201coutcome of operating a Protocol Owned Vault.\u201d The initial collateral would include: any Lido-staked ETH, EtherDAI, DAI, or any LDO held in the Pause Proxy. The POVE would be bootstrapped with 40MM DAI to be used to acquire the initial Lido-staked ETH collateral  Proposed Parameters \u2b9f   MIPXXc5: An initial collateralization ration of 225%, resulting in 1.8x leverage on said collateral  MIPXXc6: This component enables a monthly Subproposal Process to modify the Collateralization Ratio:  MIPXXc7: Under this MIP any DAI (up to 500k DAI per day) available in Pause Proxy would be used to purchase Lido-staked ETH, and later EthDAI.  MIPXXc9: All additional income generated by the Maker Protocol would also be used to fund the Protocol Owned Vault unless DAI has reached 75% collateralization through \u201cdecentralized assets.\u201d  MIPXXc10: \u201cIf the price of the collateral assets is above the POVEC virtual price ceilings, they are only counted as being equal to the virtual price ceilings when calculating the POVEDC.\u201d  MIPXX: Monetalis/Coinbase Appaloosa Summarized Posted by @Allan_Pedersen, this MIP seeks to onboard a DAI 500MM real-world asset vault to be used to acquire and loan USDC through the PSM. These loans would be granted to Coinbase and split into six, nine, and 12-month terms. ETH or BTC would be provided as collateral. Summary of proposed structure \u2b9f The payment flow would be handled as follows:  Interest paid monthly in USDC to Coinbase Account Immediately converted via PSM to DAI DAI Immediately paid into Surplus Buffer  The vault must provide:  Debt Ceiling of 500 million DAI. Stability Fee of 0% (surplus is paid manually through the legal structure, as specified in MIPXXc1) All other parameters must be set to ensure they have no functional impact.  MIPXX Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards Summarized Posted by @CB_Institutional, this MIP aims to onboard an \u201caccount representing MakerDAO\u201d to Coinbase Prime and transfer 33% - or 1.6B - of the PSM\u2019s USDC into custody to earn \u201crewards with Coinbase.\u201d Summary of motivations \u2b9f  The proposal was made in response to MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-term Bonds. Maker\u2019s balance sheet is exposed mainly to USDC \u2014 in exchange for zero holding reward. Maker believes it is beneficial to safely be rewarded for holding collateral in USDC. This MIP outlines a clear path to providing up to 1.5% APY on USDC in the form of USDC Rewards and optimizing liquidity at zero cost to and industry-leading security for Maker.  MIPXX: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters This MIP is also a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP set aiming to configure the \u201cClusters\u201d for the launch of MetaDAOs.  \u201cThe Endgame Plan has been discussed in the Maker Community for more than six months and is now going up for a vote with the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. The Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters MIP is a required part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set. It sets up the MetaDAO Clusters to begin work immediately on preparing for the Endgame Plan Launch.\u201d  Summary of terms and proposal \u2b9f  A MetaDAO Cluster is a formally recognized MetaDAO led by a Facilitator that\u2019s mandated to prepare an onboarding proposal.

Forum Post | Github repo    Some thoughts about the resilience of decentralized stablecoins  In a recent blog post, JP Koning provides a well-versed and sometimes dissenting opinion on the importance of \u201cseizable assets\u201d with the uncertain cloud of regulation looming. The post came as a retort to a recent forum thread, Endgame Plan timeline to free-floating Dai, specifically addressing the proposed \u201cPhoneix Stance.\u201d  1124\u00d7619 338 KB  Per the post:  \u201cWhile in phoenix stance, Maker would no longer rely on RWA. By RWA, [Rune] refers to centralized stablecoins such as USD Coin and loans to banks and other financial institutions with a physical address and a regulator. These are the sorts of assets that can be used by authorities as a lever to hurt the Maker protocol. With nothing for authorities to confiscate, presumably, Maker would be resilient to attempts by authorities to shut it down.\u201d  Koning disagrees with this stance, as the seizing of assets is just one of many levers that authorities could use to halt a protocol. Take, for instance, Tornado Cash. Rather than asset seizure, sanctions were instead levied against the software. Koning argues that sanctions levied against Maker would garner similar results:  A decrease in licit DAI usage, removal of collateral from the protocol, delisting of DAI on significant exchanges and fiat off-ramps, and finally; a drying up of liquidity.  Koning believes focusing on seizure resistance (i.e., Phoenix Stance) will not render \u201cMaker meaningfully more resilient\u201d - however, the removal of real-world assets will. This concept is presented as a double-edged sword of sorts. The removal of RWAs makes the system less usable, as, without centralized reserves, the peg is more likely to see a strong variance. Conversely, introducing RWAs makes the DAO more practical and attracts many additional users. Koning argues that makes the DAO more likely to fall under regulatory scrutiny. The post ends with an attempt at framing a solution:  \"Stakeholders should ask themselves how relevant Maker has become. Has Maker become so important (and its public perception so negative) that it is about to attract the baleful eyes of regulators? If so, one defensive option is to engage in a rational form of self-sabotage: make the tool less useful. This will shrink the pool of Maker users, thus the tool\u2019s visibility to regulators and, therefore, the likelihood of it being shut down. Real-world assets enter into the picture because their removal is one way to impinge on the system\u2019s usefulness. Of course, if a protocol starts engaging in self-sabotage, then the people making this decision better be sure that their original assumption \u2013 that regulators are furious \u2013 is correct.\"  A link to the full post can be found here or through the above link.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS   The Merge   On September 15 at 06:42:42 UTC at block 15537393, the Ethereum mainnet merged with Ethereum\u2019s Beacon Chain at the Terminal Total Difficulty of 58750000000000000000000. Ethereum\u2019s complete transition from a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm into a Proof-of-Stake consensus has been successfully completed.     beaconcha.in    Open Source Ethereum Blockchain Explorer - Index - beaconcha.in - 2022 beaconcha.in makes the Ethereum 2.0. beacon chain accessible to non-technical end users      The expectation of the merge was an odd thing. Given enough time, misconceptions and inaccuracies obfuscate the tangible reality of an event, and mythos is born. The Merge has finally happened, but as we approached the \u201cDifficulty Bomb,\u201d many still do not quite understand the nuances of this transition. Fortunately, we can attempt to sift through the noise and separate fact from myth. To that end, several CUs have been hard at work priming a detailed plan of action come Merge-day.  Risk-001 Summary: Merge Risks and Market Impacts  Presented by @monet-supply, this thread details the many intricacies of the merge with a primary focus on its market impacts. Recently, we have seen an increased focus on the potential PoW Ethereum forks. Chain forks are not new (see Ethereum Classic or Bitcoin Cash), but the prevalence of centralized stablecoins, DeFi, and cross-chain bridges have made forking a much greater challenge than it once was. Potential market risks include:    Futures backwardation and negative funding Impact:  Nominal cost of leverage through futures contracts (excluding potential fork value) declines, creating competitive pressure vs. Maker vaults Users who consider market implied fork value to be too high are incentivized to leverage on futures, while those considering implied value too low may prefer leveraging with Maker vaults (where the vault owner will still receive any potential fork tokens)  Responses:  Maintain competitive rates to avoid losing too much volume to futures contracts    stETH Discount Impact:  Possible increase in stETH liquidity risk and downside volatility stETH discount could incentivize leveraged staking behavior, which would increase the risk of negative price gaps while raising ETH supply rates on lending protocols  Responses:  Monitor stETH liquidity and respond with parameter changes (increasing stability fee or liquidation ratio) if necessary Monitor competitive rates using ETH collateral across DeFi lending protocols    External Asset Fork Choice Impact:  Minimal impact for Maker if all externally backed asset issuers support merge upgrade If one or more issuer supports POW fork, this could cause a significant impact on DEX liquidity pools and other protocols accepting the asset as collateral  Responses:  Confirm merge support from key external asset providers that interact with Maker protocol, including Circle, Paxos, Binance, Bitgo, Gemini, Centrifuge issuers, other RWA issuers, and services bridging DAI out to other chains. (eg. Wormhole, Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Multichain) Minimal impact if all externally backed asset issuers support merge upgrade If one or more issuer supports POW fork, this could cause a significant impact on DEX liquidity pools and other protocols accepting the asset as collateral    Liquidity Pool Protocols Impact:  Possible migration of some users from external lending protocols to Maker vaults Possible withdrawals of ETH from lending protocols putting pressure on stETH Near the merge, the potential for a decline in decentralized exchange liquidity for ETH pairings  Responses:  Monitor user behavior and maintain competitive rates to facilitate any potential migrations or user acquisition Monitor stETH leverage positions and ETH lending utilization on Aave, Euler Monitor exchange liquidity and consider parameter changes if needed    Oracle Networks and Indices Impact:  Increased possibility of bad / outlier data delivered to oracle feeds Possibility of market disruption due to bad price data incorporated in third-party oracles or perp indices  Responses:  Confirm centralized exchange plans concerning POW fork listing, tickers, and API changes Encourage industry players to adopt alternative ticker for any POW fork, avoid collisions, and ensure continuity of mainnet Ethereum data    Replay Attacks Impact:  Increased possibility of unintended transactions on mainnet, replayed from POW fork chain (e.g., closing vault positions, selling fork-DAI or fork-MKR tokens, etc.) Possibility of mainnet transactions, including Maker oracle and keeper operations, being replayed to POW fork chain  Responses:  Share info about replay attack risk within the Maker community Advocate for POW fork to use alternative chain-id (instead of chain-id 1, which will continue to be used by mainnet Ethereum) to avoid replaying transactions    PECU Announcement: Maker Protocol, the Merge and Future Forks of Ethereum  Replay attacks are not specific to DAI or MKR tokens - raw ether, ERC20 tokens, ERC721 NFTs, and all other digital assets can be transferred through replay attacks. Any transaction broadcast to the PoW network can be replayed on the PoS network if they share the same chainId. Some examples of interactions that may be replayable:  Interacting with any Maker contracts on PoW directly (from the same address you used before the fork) Selling PoW DAI or MKR tokens to someone in a peer-to-peer transaction Interacting with PoW DAI or MKR tokens via a dApp (such as selling them on UniSwap)  In summary: anything you do on PoW ETH may be able to be replayed on PoS ETH, and you should assume that it can be replayed on PoS.

Oracles Update: post-merge   2291\u00d7312 31.4 KB     In Other News\u2026  MakerDAO\u2019s Window of Opportunity  The recent article posted by rekt.news posits that, from the outside looking in, Maker\u2019s path forward is becoming increasingly unclear. Before the window of opportunity closes entirely, the DAO must first face an \u201cinternal struggle\u201d:  Preserve the ideals of cryptography, and reject the legacy system entirely, Or embrace growth regardless of the route taken.  Since the collapse of UST, stablecoin issuers have had a singular focus: long-term stability. In the wake of the collapse, fiat-backed stables offered a \u201csafe haven\u201d from the extreme volatility. And then came the Tornado Cash sanctions and the freezing of all associated USDC, adding fuel to an already raging fire.  \u201cThe OFAC sanctions have been a harsh wake-up call for DeFi, bringing into focus the vulnerabilities associated with forfeiting autonomy in place of growth.\u201d  Per the article, a diverse range of options and motivations were presented: For instance, Why Maker has no choice but to prepare to free float Dai, comes in stark contrast to MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards. These proposals are the \u201cdividing line\u201d between the two conflicting ethea. To free float, DAI would fully embrace crypto\u2019s root ideals and move forward with the Coinbase proposal emphasizing growth over the route taken. All this to say, this \u201cstruggle\u201d is inevitable. Not just for MakerDAO, but all DeFi protocols wading through this undefined era. Despite the accusatory tone the publication has come to be known for, the piece ends with an air of respect.  \"Although controversial, Rune\u2019s proposed gameplan may also usher in a new paradigm of non-reliance on the dollar, potentially putting DeFi out of the reach of those who want to see it stamped out. In proposing such bold steps, Rune is risking the death of DAI, this time by his hand. Nevertheless, faced with increasing volatility in the \u201creal\u201d world, with fiat currencies rapidly devaluing and no near-term end, the window of opportunity is closing fast. \u2026Crypto\u2019s original cypherpunk ethos may be a lifeline as we spiral into an ever more volatile future.\"  Extended drawbacks have a way of making us doubt the things we once held as givens. So, as we traverse our path unknown, ask ourselves who we are and who we can be. Because once again, MakerDAO\u2019s writing the script for present and future protocols to follow.    This Week in Governance   Weekly MIPs Update #104  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.   Executive Vote(s)  Hot off the press!   Core Unit Budget Streams, SPF Funding, HVBank Legal Update, MKR Stream Accounting Cleanup \u2013 Posted on September 13th, 2022. Expires at October 14th, 2022, 16:20 UTC.  If this Executive Proposal passes, the following changes will occur within the Maker Protocol:  A total of 3,004,859 DAI will be streamed to two Core Units:  As per this governance poll, ratifying the bear market option from the latest budget proposal, three DAI streams will be created, and a total of 667,055 DAI will be streamed to the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001). As per this governance poll, ratifying the latest budget proposal, one DAI stream will be created, and a total of 2,337,804 DAI will be streamed to the Oracles Core Unit (ORA-001).   As per these governance polls: 1 & 2, a total of 80,000 DAI will be transferred to two Special Purpose Fund multisig wallets. MKR Stream Cleanup:  As per this forum post, the MKR stream that was previously streaming MKR to the Growth Core Unit before it was redirected to the Maker Pause Proxy will have the remaining MKR balance vested if this executive proposal passes. This action is for accounting purposes only and will not affect the balance of MKR in the Pause Proxy. See the forum post for more details.   As per this governance poll, the IPFS hash for the HVBank Legal Agreement will be updated.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS   Endgame RFC DVC Calls  Recognized Delegate @twblack88 has hosted an open call to discuss and workshop the Endgame MIP-set. Summary of the discussion\u2019s goals and format As they stand, DVC (Decentralized Voter Committee) calls need more structure. These calls aim to surface particular topics and coordinate themes to focus the discussion on certain areas of the vast array of proposals. Endgame RFC Calls are held without the author of the discussed MIP to better shape feedback and to identify unbiased questions and concerns. This feedback gets honed into actionable items that focus DVC discussion on particular areas of interest or concern. Last week, the initial results of these meetings were shared in the appropriate thread, summarized below. RFC-DFV Feedback to Endgame Plan v3 Complete Overview High-level direct endgame challenges:  Why not a phased rollout? What exactly is the point of bundling MIPs together? Many moving parts need a detailed execution plan to get right. There is so much research and work/iterations in this design, but what\u2019s missing is the implementation plan. What\u2019s with the extended mandates around RWA? Shouldn\u2019t there be incentives for collaboration and cooperation? MetaDAOs must be dynamic with exemplary leadership, a credible plan, and understandable tokenomics. Lacking those fundamentals is setting them up for failure. How do we ensure everyone interprets the information and context of the plan as intended? How can we iterate to make this better? How can we ensure that launching metaDAOs is not reinventing the governance wheel repeatedly?  RFC-DFV Feedback to MIP83: Launch MetaDAO Clusters  Is the clustering organic, or do we want to put some structure into creating the metaDAOs? Do current teams pick a color? The definition of these mDAO types is missing from the MIP. It probably needs another component explaining the protector, creator, and governor DAOs. Things like what roles are initially present, expected responsibilities, interaction (or not) with other metaDAOs, constraints on business, the definition of intangible value, etc. Highly recommend a legal audit. What levels of governance will be owned by the MetaDAOs versus Maker core? If we are still using the executive vote mechanism to pass MIPs\u2026 how do the governance systems interact? How do the budget and incentives work when metaDAOs form? How do budgets change as the metaDAOs bootstrap? What does this look like when they are fully operational? What is the relationship between scopes and clusters?  RFC-DFV Feedback to MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation  Surplus buffer changes wildly if we have excess liabilities. dss-kiln was never tested or audited. Is there a way to slowly scale this up test by test? (1 mil at a clip was suggested) Where is the leverage coming from? Seems like this is out of sequence? Wouldn\u2019t the POVE be after ETHD?  RFC-DFV Feedback to MIP39c3-SP4: Offboarding the Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)  Does the EVENTS-001 Failed Offboarding carry any weight? Governance just said \u2018no\u2019 to offboarding events; what\u2019s the point if it\u2019s up for a vote again? Should offboarding, in general, be bundled?  RFC-DFV Feedback to MIP39c3-SP3: Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001)  Are the offboarding(s) necessary to Endgame? How does Marketing play into Endgame?  These calls represent an ideal starting point if you want to understand the Endgame Plan or participate in its development. Endgame DVC RFC calls are held on Friday at 14:30 UTC. Meeting details can be found via this link, or through the original post.  Endgame: Informal Sentiment Poll  Posted by @psychonaut, the poll aims to gauge community sentiment surrounding the Endgame Plan, with all votes remaining anonymous.  691\u00d7314 14 KB  \u2018No\u2019 currently leads with around 38% of the total votes.  Endgame Breakdown with LongForWisdom on the \u2018The Raphael, Schuppi, & ElPro MakerDAO Happy Hour\u2019  @LongForWisdom shared detailed, unbiased insight into the current Endgame design and followed with a post outlining his interpretations of the model\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. All of these will be covered in summary below.  Summary of the discussion:  MetaDAOs fuse the creation of a new DAO with an individual Core Unit or Units. Under this format, contributors form a new DAO aligned with Maker and its principles. This alignment must be placed before goals separate from the DAO. The structure allows for more governance direction but \u201ca way that benefits both Maker and the metaDAO itself.\u201d  \"The idea is, as you participate in Maker Core as a contributor or customer, you accrue these [meta]Tokens and become involved with the [growth and activities] of the metaDAO. \u201cMaker benefits by creating a redundant, decentralized workforce.\u201d  MetaDAOs are incentivized to perform to the full extent of their mandate and are held fully responsible for their actions relative to the Maker Protocol. This scenario benefits the theoretical metaDAO while shielding Maker from major disruptions affecting the central product. They do not, however, come without risk.  \u201cThe first risk I want to highlight is the risk that MetaDAOs cannot create/attract/retain meaningful communities.\u201d  1. Not everyone wants to create and manage an entire community.  \u201cI hypothesize that, in general, the ability and desire to attract, create, organize and operate a community is rarer than most assume. Further, individuals with both the desire and ability are likely to self-select themselves into roles where they can express that ability and desire naturally.\u201d  2. Self-determination seems to have been a key rallying point in existing DAO Communities, and MetaDAOs cannot meaningfully self-determine.  \u201cWithout the commitment to decentralization from the Maker Foundation, I doubt as many individuals would have been attracted to the project. Anecdotally, I would not have been.\u201d  3. The given examples of successful Meta-Engineering don\u2019t have very successful or high-quality communities. Examples of these endeavors came through Uniswap, Unit Bias Memecoin, and the early BTC community. Further, he questions the utility and inherent value of these proposes mDAO tokens.  \u201cThis might be more tidily summed up by the question: \u201cWould you be willing to get paid for your work only in vested MDAO tokens?\u201d I\u2019d argue that a large share of individuals wouldn\u2019t work solely for vested MKR tokens, let alone MDAO tokens.\u201d  Lastly, the issue of politics, and its interlaced drama, was addressed - a source of distraction that Long believes metaDAOs may amplify rather than contain. In a flat organization like a DAO, the humanity of business is a very noticeable factor. Altering the structure of this relationship won\u2019t mitigate the inevitability of human nature. But, separating the workforce won\u2019t make it any less human. The same political issues will persist and could even be amplified by the inherent \u201cownership\u201d attached to the establishment of a metaDAO.  The Protocol-owned vault (POVE)  As a very high-level overview, the POVE functions to acquire ETH and mint DAI. Traditionally, user-operated vaults are subjected to safety measures like stability fees, collateralization ratios, and liquidations to bolster Protocol security. Instead, The POVE is afforded certain luxuries to ensure it traverses a less adversarial path. As it\u2019s owned and operated by Maker and not an end-user, it wouldn\u2019t face the same set-in-stone stability fees and liquidation ratios. In a \u201ctrustless\u201d space, these hard-coded \u201claws\u201d are designed to shield the protocol from the intentions of unknown parties, but the POVE is owned and operated exclusively by the Maker Protocol.  \u201cBecause Maker owns this vault and is the only one using it, we don\u2019t need as many explicit mechanisms to ensure its safety\u2026 We can, essentially, allow a lot more than we would for [user-owned] vaults.\u201d  LFW sees many benefits to the proposed model, but peg security stands out as the most impactful for a few reasons.  This extra DAI can then be used to manage the peg through volatile stretches. Provided the POVE is fitted with ample ETH, Maker could mint and market sell DAI when its price is high and repurchase it if it drops below one dollar. In other words, arbitrage at scale. Something quite evident on the surface, but much collateral is needed to mint enough DAI to affect its market price in either direction. For example, to mint $3B DAI, the DAO would need to own $4B in ETH. The POVE then serves to slowly build ETH reserves, which could then be deployed to protect the peg if required.  RWAs Cash-like RWAs - These include options similar to the PSM or the procurement of US Treasury bonds. These assets aren\u2019t fully decentralized but offer the DAO a means to earn consistent yield or expand DAI\u2019s market reach. USDC is the most accurate example of this asset type currently being used. The primary benefit of this asset class is it affords DAI liquidity. This would allow the protocol to offer direct swaps through the PSM, meaning if the demand for DAI rapidly changes, this mechanism could absorb the market pressure. Clean Money RWAs - Long sees these assets as a net positive. If RWAs are to be a long-term part of the system, it would be ideal for the majority to be carbon negative or neutral. This initiative also serves to assuage potential regulation. If the protocol had a positive global impact, it would be far less politically feasible to \u201cshut it down.\u201d The call ended with a direct question. \u201cWhere do you see the most pressing risks in the current plan?\u201d Long\u2019s response was simple yet elegant.  \u201cThe major risk is that [Endgame\u2019s] based on the assumption that may not turn out to be true.\u201d    MakerDAO\u2019s Past, Present, and Future with Rune Christensen Since we\u2019re on the topic, we recommend to listen to this podcast episode of I Pledge Allegiance, which presents Rune Christensen who discusses MakerDAO\u2019s origins, his exit from MakerDAO, and his recent return. Rune also elaborates on his Endgame plan for MakerDAO, which he hopes will lead the DAO forward a long time to come. Check out the episode here!   MKR and DAI comp discussions  Compensation discussion from Delegate office hours: This discussion is often approached, circled, and inevitably bookmarked, only to be picked up again, so the process repeats. This is due to the problem\u2019s complexity and the variety of different approaches offered to date. It\u2019s not just a matter of doing or not, but also where, how, and why. These conflicting factors make it difficult to standardize across the entire DAO. A flat rate across all units neglects achievements, prowess, and general importance to business continuity. And then on the other hand, the weighting of \u201cimportance\u201d is subjective, differing from person to person. In other words, the problem itself is rooted in instability, so calculating the \u201ccorrect\u201d parameters is quite difficult. As @Aes put it:  \u201cWith something like this, the devil\u2019s in the details.\u201d  The call concludes by identifying areas with the least clarity, as those should take priority as we move toward a finely tuned framework. Compensation Discussion from Governance & Risk (timestamped) The proposal, authored by Recognized Delegate @CodeKnight, seeks to establish a standardized framework for contributor compensation. He spoke about the proposed changes during the last G&R call (linked above). First, this proposal was written as a means to grant the conversation legs. Assistance from anyone with more experience in vesting structures would be appreciated, as little feedback has been offered. Without a framework, we leave room for personal agendas to conflict with business. These lengthy vesting discussions not only cut into a CUs time but also often lead to conflict. CodeKnight hopes that, through a structured framework, contributors would have more insight into whether or not vesting is worth pursuing in a given period. This would ideally mean fewer proposals for delegates to dissect and less uncertainty for DAO contributors. @monkey.irish also spoke on the importance of talent retention. We\u2019ve seen a recent trend of \u201ctightening the belt buckle,\u201d but he believes a certain misrepresentation exists. Many DAO contributors are not being overpaid relative to comparable positions in the traditional space, but quite the opposite. He worries that the DAO\u2019s long-term strategic positioning could take a large hit if this trend continues.   Coinbase proposal discussion  GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator Patrick_J presented some governance-related concerns regarding MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards during last week\u2019s Governance & Risk call. Among other issues, GovAlpha believes that MIP81:  Does not follow the standard MIP Template Is lacking in completeness and clarity, two of the five core principles outlined in MIP0  Is too focused on low-level information and lacking in high-level information Appears to instruct GovAlpha to oversee the transfer of funds to Coinbase without oversight from the wider MakerDAO organization  Proposed solutions include ensuring that the MIP adheres to the MIP template, appointing an Arranger, and adding provisions for assessment by a legal team and other Core Units. Check out the slides on this topic for a quick at-a-glance summary of GovAlpha\u2019s viewpoint, or watch the video segment (about half an hour) if you\u2019re interested in catching the full discussion.  Coinbase Live Call with CFO!   The discussion prompted GovAlpha to arrange a one-on-one public call with Coinbase\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas. Prose11, a neutral third party, is moderating a thread where anyone may submit their questions in preparation for the call.  All community members can attend and listen in. There will be a dedicated channel in the MakerDAO Discord for real-time discussions during the interview.  Submissions must be received by 17:00 UTC on Thursday, September 22nd!  The call will take place on 2022-09-26T16:30:00Z    Merge POAP  During the same call, Patrick_J also presented the Maker Merge POAP, commemorating the blockchain historical event of the successful Ethereum 2.0 merge. Anyone who attended the live merge watch party should have received their POAP already, but any MakerDAO contributor or community member is eligible. Get in touch with @prose11 or @Patrick_J on the forums to claim yours!  960\u00d7540 117 KB     This Week in Governance  Weekly MIPs Update #105  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.   Executive Vote(s) Why, hello there!  Coming for your hebdomadal voting fix? As it was announced on our latest G&R Call, this week bares no new Executive Proposals to ponder:  \u201c@Protocol-Engineering has expressed a desire to limit executives to whenever possible every week to help manage dev bandwidth and keep costs associated with executive spells down. While we may not always be able to accommodate this wish (and will seek to amend our MIPs if this becomes formal practice), when appropriate, we will opt for taking a week off of executives\u201d.  Nevertheless, you can still further explore the effects of the last one to be passed:  Core Unit Budget Streams, SPF Funding, HVBank Legal Update, MKR Stream Accounting Cleanup \u2013 Passed on September 16th, 14:49, 2022. Executed on September 18th, 2022, 14:50 UTC.   A total of 3,004,859 DAI was streamed to two Core Units:   667,055 DAI were streamed to the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001).  2,337,804 DAI were streamed to the Oracles Core Unit (ORA-001).   A total of 80,000 DAI was transferred to two Special Purpose Fund multisig wallets. Check MIP55c3-SP6 & MIP55c3-SP8 to learn more! MKR Stream Cleanup:  As per this forum post, the MKR stream that was previously streaming MKR to the Growth Core Unit before it was redirected to the Maker Pause Proxy has had the remaining MKR balance vested. This action is for accounting purposes only and will not affect the balance of MKR in the Pause Proxy. See the forum post for more details.   As per this governance poll, the IPFS hash for the HVBank Legal Agreement was amended to QmQx3bMtjncka2jUsGwKu7ButuPJFn9yDEEvpg9xZ71ECh.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon  Online PDF Version     CURRENT EVENTS   Coinbase MIP81 Q&A and follow-up discussion  Under the terms of MIP81, 33% \u2013 or around 1.6 billion \u2013 USDC would be transferred from the PSM into Coinbase custody. The DAO would then be eligible to earn USDC rewards via the exchange. These rewards are estimated to provide up to 1.5% APY, netting the protocol a theoretical 24 million in annual revenue. Due to the nature of the proposed partnership, community sentiment appears to be split. In response, Coinbase CFO, Alesia Haas, joined GovAlpha for a live Q&A regarding the polarizing proposal. The call was allotted a 30-minute time slot, and only pre-screened questions were answered. It\u2019s worth noting that while this may not be the meeting we\u2019ve come to expect in Web3, the format is common practice in traditional business. Myriad community members posed several excellent questions, but due to time constraints, only a handful was addressed in detail. A full transcription of the call, provided by @Artem_Gordon, can be found here.  @TRUEMAKER breaks it down into digestible bytes.  A summary will be provided below, but the post can be read in its entirety via this link.  701\u00d7476 44.9 KB   Endgame Plan: Diagram of the Scopes and ecosystem  In this edition of the Endgame breakdown, @rune provides additional information about the scope and scale of the re-envisioned Maker ecosystem. The Endgame Plan identifies three broad categories of actors:   The Scopes remain closest to the \u201cMaker Core.\u201d  MetaDAOs function as semi-independent DAOs  Ecosystem Actors are entirely independent companies, individuals, or DAOs that provide service to Maker Core or its MetaDAOs.  What\u2019s a Scope, and what does it do? Scopes detail and standardize how the various actors communicate and collaborate. They primarily function to maintain the \u201cimmutability\u201d that is critical to the success of the Endgame plan and \u201cMaker\u2019s long-term survival.\u201d  \"The 11 Scopes are split into Primary Scopes and Supporting Scopes. The Primary Scopes are the activities that help grow and sustain Maker. They include Protocol Engineering, Decentralized Collateral, RWA Collateral, and Growth.\"  These scopes are covered in depth by three groups:  Decentralized Voter Committee Governor Councils Tribunals  Primary Scopes are large entities with a litany of available resources. As a marked \u201cseparation of powers,\u201d these actors remain separate from the \u201cCouncils\u201d that define the Scope Framework. These Councils are composed of representatives from all Governer MetaDAOs. Summarized Workflow Step 1: DVCs, Delegates, and Council agree on a Scope Framework. As an example, this could specify the process used to determine when it is worth it to deploy a new Synthetic Asset, such as EuroDai, and the steps that need to be followed when deploying a Synthetic Asset in accordance with best practice. Step 2: With the Scope Framework in place, the Core Units now have clear guidance on when and how to initiate the deployment of a new Synthetic Asset and how to determine which contributor (MetaDAO or Ecosystem Actor) that should be paid to carry out the work. Step 3: The last step is to construct the Executive vote that activates the new Synthetic Asset and wait for the MKR holders and Delegates to vote it through  \"Fully specified processes like this example onboarding of a Synthetic Asset must be developed for each process in all 11 Scopes. Having the processes specified in the greatest detail possible prevents the risk of a grey area uncertainty becoming a beachhead for complexity expansion and scope creep.\"  Overview of the Scope system  1920\u00d71552 346 KB  The full post can be read in its entirety here.    This Week in Governance  Weekly MIPs Update #106  Ratification polls, proposals, and pre-MIP discussions.   Executive Vote(s)  Hot off the press!   Update the PROXY_ACTIONS_END_CROPPER Address, Starknet Bridge Deposit Limit Increase, Core Unit MKR Vesting \u2013 Posted on September 28th, 2022. Expires at October 28th, 2022, 10:36 UTC.  If this Executive Proposal passes, the following changes will occur within the Maker Protocol:     PROXY_ACTIONS_END_CROPPER Address Update  As per this post from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit Facilitator @Derek, the address for PROXY_ACTIONS_END_CROPPER will be updated to 0x38f7C166B5B22906f04D8471E241151BA45d97Af.   As per this governance poll, the deposit limit for the Starknet bridge will be raised from 50 DAI to 1,000 DAI. Please see the forum thread for further details.  Core Unit MKR Vesting  A total of 1161.49 MKR will be transferred to three Core Units:   20 MKR will be transferred to the Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001), as per their approved MKR compensation proposal. The amount being transferred is lower than the initially requested amount due to a reduction in the number of FTEs working for RWF-001.  966.49 MKR will be transferred to the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES-001), as per their approved MKR compensation proposal.  175 MKR will be transferred to the Risk Core Unit as per their approved MKR compensation proposal.        Passed Last Week:   Core Unit Budget Streams, SPF Funding, HVBank Legal Update, MKR Stream Accounting Cleanup \u2013 Passed on September 16th, 2022, 14:49 UTC. Executed on September 18th, 2022, 14:50 UTC.  This Executive Proposal passed, and the following changes occurred within the Maker Protocol:   A total of 3,004,859 DAI will be streamed to two Core Units:   667,055 DAI to the DAI Foundation Core Unit (DAIF-001).  2,337,804 DAI to the Oracles Core Unit (ORA-001).   As per these governance polls: 1 & 2, a total of 80,000 DAI will be transferred to two Special Purpose Fund multisig wallets. MKR Stream Cleanup:  The MKR stream that was previously streaming MKR to the Growth Core Unit before it was redirected to the Maker Pause Proxy has had the remaining MKR balance vested.   The IPFS hash for the HVBank Legal Agreement was updated.     Active Poll(s) We are hitting the final stretch for these!

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon   Online PDF version - coming soon      CURRENT EVENTS  Navigating the forums right now feels like driving down the middle of a flooded highway. With so much to discuss, and so much being discussed, it\u2019s exceptionally easy to get swept away. So, let\u2019s take a moment to wade through the myriad of impactful proposals, dissect what they offer, and explore the current community sentiment.   Gemini: GUSD Proposal  Following in the wake of Coinbase\u2019s proposed MIP81, two similar proposals hit the Forum last week. The first came via @tylerwinklevoss of Gemini, a top CEX and the issuer of the GUSD stablecoin. Per the announcement, Gemini has been a long-standing supporter of the Maker Protocol. For reference:  Custody: MKR has been supported on Gemini since August 2020 and Dai since April 2020. Trading: MKR trading was supported in September 2020 and Dai in May 2020. Earn: MKR is supported in the Gemini Earn product with 1.26% APY, and Dai with one of the highest rates at 5.31% APY to our users. Nifty Gateway: Nifty Gateway users can use their Gemini exchange account balances to purchase on NG. This means a Gemini exchange user who has Dai in their wallet can use it to pay on Nifty Gateway, where a conversion from ETH or USD takes place. Credit Card: Customers can select Dai and MKR as their rewards to earn instant crypto rewards on the Gemini Credit Card.  Summary of the proposal Per Gemini, a three-month program began on October 1, 2022, wherein Gemini contributes a fixed rate of 1.25% to the DAO on any GUSD present in the PSM. These rewards are to be paid out monthly provided a minimum average balance of 100M GUSD is maintained. Further, a legal entity would need to be set up and processed through KYC to claim these accrued rewards. As this was announced as a marketing incentive, GUSD held in the PSM will not be moved from the PSM or into Gemini custody.  \u201cWe recognize the importance of the PSM in securing Dai redemptions, and we believe keeping it on-chain is the best way to fulfill that task.\u201d  The Gemini team also provided the following Dune query to aid in tracking the DAO\u2019s GUSD holdings.   A link to the full announcement can be found here, or via the above link.   MIP87: OUSD Decentralized Rewards  The second was posted by @pete, representing the Origin Protocol, the issuer of the OUSD stablecoin. OUSD is a \u201cyield-generating stablecoin that rebases positively and daily to distribute yield directly to user wallets.\u201d Per the proposal, OUSD is backed 1:1 by DAI, USDC, and USDT. It generates its yield via lending to protocols such as Aave, Compound, Curve, and Convex. All accrued interest is then converted into OUSD and proportionally distributed. Summary of MIP87  The MIP suggests a 1% allocation that can be increased at any time as confidence grows. Maker would convert up to 33% of its USDC holdings to OUSD.   \u201cMaker will store the OUSD in a rebase-capable wallet, such as MetaMask, Ledger, Coinbase Wallet, MEW, etc. If using a multi-sig wallet, Maker will \u201copt-in\u201d to participate in the rebasing by calling OUSD\u2019s rebaseOptIn() function. This can easily be enabled via the OUSD application in Gnosis Safe.\u201d  \u201cThe Elephant in the Room\u201d  \u201cIn November 2020, OUSD was exploited for $7M in funds. The DApp at the time included a clear disclaimer warning that the product was in BETA and that the contracts had not been audited. Nonetheless, the Origin treasury opted to cover the losses for these early OUSD holders\u2026 OUSD has not suffered another security failure since relaunching in January 2021.\u201d  OUSD\u2019s view on the Coinbase, Coinshares, and Gemini proposals  \u201cOrigin is aware of the proposals from Coinbase (MIP81), CoinShares (MIP86), and Gemini (Proposal: GUSD PSM). While these proposals are legitimate, we believe that it is in the best interest of Maker DAO and the Maker DAO community to remain as decentralized as possible with business partners moving forward and with the MIP13c3-SP12 investment, as neither Coinbase, CoinShares, nor Gemini align with Maker\u2019s decentralized principles.\u201d  The full proposal is linked above or can be viewed here.   Crimson Creator Cluster  @hexonaut proposes Maker\u2019s inaugural Cluster, Crimson Creator. The team aims to onboard a large user base through an easy-to-use DeFi frontend, offering Maker products and yield farming alongside other unique innovations. Summary of the proposal The perceived problem:  \"Maker\u2019s superpower has always been the cheap cost of capital due to the success of DAI as the most popular decentralized stablecoin. However, Maker has struggled to gain traction on the supply side. Our primary lending use case during the last bull run was as a wholesale lender to CEXes who would pocket the interest spread. This demonstrates the strong demand for frictionless, fast, low-fee user experiences. The only ones providing this at the moment are centralized exchanges. Maker can provide credit to these protocols / CEXes, but their missions may not align with the DAO. Maker is dependant on external counter-parties.\"  The proposed solution: The team aims to bring new life to Maker products by offering best-in-market rates due to low-cost capital infusions via D3M injections. Their initial product would be a fork of an existing best-in-class lending platform, retrofitted to integrate directly with Maker through the D3M.  \u201cWe will focus on large-scale market segments. We are not interested in supporting long tail assets - only ETH, BTC, and staked ETH derivatives.\u201d  The platform would utilize two external oracles, Maker and Chainlink, to address the issues in security witnessed throughout DeFi. The proposal notes that the team is investigating the addition of a third oracle provider for future implementation. Further, as more scaling solutions become available (such as zkEVMs), the team feels adequately situated to capture this new market.

Q3 2022 MKR Decentralization, Delegation, and Distribution Update  @lyt of the Strategic Finance CU provides a high-level summary of selected metrics on the decentralization, delegation, and distribution of MKR governance. An Overview  Full Breakdown Summarized Most of these metrics saw a quarterly decrease outside of an increase in total holders. Further, some expired delegate contracts still hold an MKR balance. This can be viewed as a measure of the total amount of MKR represented by \u201cpassive delegators,\u201d shown below.   Another notable trend correlates positively with delegation\u2019s growth and distribution. While direct participation has been steadily declining, participation via delegation has thrived. Not just for top delegates but across the board.   The number of MKR holders with at least one token has been steadily increasing since May 2022. With that rise, we have seen a steady uptrend in the number of top wallets and entities required to compromise 50% of the available MKR holdings. This represents an increase in the MKR token\u2019s overall decentralization. Per the report, this form of attack would take 23 of the top MKR wallets, suitable for a 17% YoY increase in protocol security. The post concluded with a look into MKR\u2019s Gini coefficient, commonly used to measure income distribution. Its scale ranges from complete equality at 0 to complete inequality at 100. Maker previously used this metric to measure the concentration risk of accepted assets. High risk occurs when most of the debt comes from a few large vaults. This view, instead, utilizes the metric to assess MKR ownership.   MKR currently stands at a 96.69 Gini coefficient, representing a high degree of ownership inequality. That said, this figure stood at 96.74 on July 14th, showing slight signs of regression. Summarized Conclusions  There is a long-term governance trend of direct participation shifting to participation via delegation. There is a fair amount of MKR in expired delegated contracts for the first time. The number of participants of 1MKR+ represented in governance contract has been steadily increasing but trended slightly downward QoQ. We have seen slight increases in MKR decentralization since last quarter.  The full post can be found here or via the above link. To view the attached Dune Analytics Dash, click here.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon   Online PDF version - coming soon      CURRENT EVENTS     [Signal Request] MIP65 Asset Reallocation  MIP65 initially allocated 250M of a total 500M DAI towards a mixed basket of medium-term corporate and government bonds. This Signal, posted by @Allan_Pedersen, proposes the reallocation of this DAI toward ISIN IE00BGSF1X88: 0-1y US Treasury ishares/Blackrock ETF product, a short-term US Treasury Bond. If ratified as proposed, the entirety of the 500M DAI would be allocated as follows:  Summary of Motivations: The proposal came as a \u201creaction to two core principals\u201d:  Corporate bond performance in a recession   \u201cWe feel uncomfortable making a bet on this market. We might have been comfortable moving towards highest quality Corporate Bonds (AAA), but our concern about general market volatility (below) leads us to, unfortunately, propose leaving this asset class for the time being.\u201d   General Market Volatility   \" Whilst we might be comfortable about the long-term return and value of highly rated (AAA) corporate Bonds and long-term Government Bonds, we are concerned about short-term shocks in market values that could lead to sentiment-driven negative extreme shock actions on Maker and DAI. Thus we, for the time being, propose fundamentally only deploying capital towards short-term government bonds in a highly liquid ETF product.\"  \u2018Reallocate to ISIN IE00BGSF1X88: 0-1y US Treasury ishares/Blackrock ETF\u2019 is currently leading at 64% of the total votes.  The full thread can be found via this link, or to vote on the Signal, click here.    Viridian Cluster Introduction  The second Cluster application has arrived, and with it comes a naming convention. @Allan_Pedersen introduces the Viridian Cluster | Protector MetaDAO and breaks down the responsibilities of a Protector. To Summarize:  The Protector MetaDAO must deliver an RWA portfolio to Maker that can support a 1:1 USD peg. Maker benchmarks the Protector MetaDAO against US Treasury for 3-months, meaning the Protector must deliver alpha/spread against this benchmark. The Protector MetaDAO, as its core revenue from Maker, receives 10% of yield income up to the benchmark - and 25% of all yield above the benchmark. This revenue, and other income sources (such as frontend revenue share fees that are available to all MetaDAOs), go directly to the Protector MetaDAO Surplus Buffer (\u201cPMSB\u201d). The Protector MetaDAO can accrue value to Protector MetaDAO token holders by using funds in the PMSB to acquire Elixir (DAI/ETH/MKR liquidity provider tokens). The accumulated Elixir tokens are used to slowly buy and burn Protector MetaDAO tokens.  Guiding Principals The team intends to focus its attention on two key areas:  Arresting Climate Change Connecting Defi, CeFi, and TradFi in a net positive way  The team intends to address these issues using, what it calls, the Max Yield Equation, the flow of which can be seen in the below visual.  Viridian\u2019s plans to tackle climate change:  Set a clear, simple, and strong standard for Climate Change investing that makes sense for the Protector MetaDAO community - and engage with relevant institutions/NGOs, etc, on evolving the standard. Focus investing in credit portfolio build-ups and seeding/encouraging asset strategies that meet this Community-based Climate Change standard - and resell as they meet an institutional threshold. Open up the above investment strategies of credit portfolio build-up and seeding investment strategies for like-minded third parties to participate in growing the base of investors participating in accelerating these important assets.   \"The world\u2019s asset holders remain starved for true, impactful, Climate Change assets. Using the (limited) heft of a Protector MetaDAO\u2019s initial mandate of Maker to establish a machine to manufacture these assets will deliver substantial franchise value from premium on assets to the application of this machinery broadly to global investors.\"  Viridian\u2019s plans to integrate DeFi/CeFi/TradFi:  Engagement with the regulators on finding a true north that is based upon gainful and safe integration between DeFi/CeFi/TradFi. More on this in our Regulatory/Legal section. Developing legal structures that can be governed by smart contracts, working appropriately with self-custody environments, and developing smart-contract integration with regulated asset custodians and regulated digital asset markets. Create Cash flow growth in \u201cgood\u201d patterns of integration by \u201censuring the capital controlled by the Protector MetaDAO flows through these models - and allow third parties to use our \u201chigh-speed high-way\u201d for moving between TradFi/CeFi/DeFi (maybe with a little toll-booth on it\u2026)\u201d   \"Paving a performing high-way that integrates digitally from DeFi to TradFI will have substantive value - the toll-booths the Protector MetaDAO can install on the high-way have the potential to generate massive cash flow as these markets integrate. There will not be many of these high-ways and first-movers working collaboratively across will, likely, have sticky advantages in terms of trust and size that is not easily supplanted.\"  A link to the full Proposal can be found here.   An EIP 4337 Rundown  Note: While the EIP is not Maker-centric, with the emergence of MetaDAOs, some of its proposed features could be beneficial in bolstering user adoption. EIP 4337 was originally introduced in September of last year but only recently gained traction. To summarize the issue addressed: Currently, EOA (Ledger, Trezor, etc.) and smart contract wallets (Metmask, MEW, etc.) operate under very different rulesets. Only EOA wallets can initialize transactions, and as this logic is hardcoded into the Ethereum protocol, these functionalities can\u2019t be further customized.   twitter.com    Nishil @_nishil_  7/ This is a problem because EOA functionalities are hardcoded into Ethereum protocol and there is no room for customization.  For example: Gmail provides you the option to enable 2FA on your account. Similar customizability can't be done on Ethereum today.   7:12 PM - 10 Oct 2022           11            This limits both users and protocols in a couple of ways:  Unlike smart contract wallets, users can\u2019t use a custom signing schema. Transaction fees must be paid in native ETH.  EIP 4337 aims to incorporate \u201cAccount Abstraction\u201d (AA) into the Ethereum protocol without any consensus-layer alterations. AA enables users to utilize smart contract wallets that contain the same verification logic used by EOAs, which (in theory) displaces the need for an EOA wallet entirely. The flow contains three moving parts: User operations, Bundler, and Paymaster.  A technical breakdown is provided in the above link, but at a high level, user operations denotes the logic allowing users to initiate a transaction via a smart contract wallet. Bundlers route these transactions to a global Entry Point, where each user operation is verified by its validation function. The paymaster enables sponsored transactions wherein users could have their transaction fees paid for by a paymaster (likely a protocol).  Why does this matter? For many, it may not \u2013 but if the alterations occur without any changes to the consensus layer, users and developers can expect several UX improvements:  Android or iOS schemes could be used to turn a phone into a hardware wallet. It allows for two or more users to approve a single transaction. And per Vitalik, it provides for a \u201cdecentralized fee market\u201d for user operations conducted in a smart contract wallet.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @nothsa, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon    CURRENT EVENTS   Endgame, Clean Money and Nuclear Energy   This thread sees @rune expand on the Endgame Plan\u2019s goals, motivations, and integrations. Summary of definitions and motivations To begin, the Endgame Plan grew out of the original case for Clean Money, \u201cwhich focused on the critical importance of \u201cSpark\u201d in DAO governance.\u201d Here, Spark is defined as an individual or team\u2019s drive, interest, and commitment to the DAO and its central purpose.  \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that drives individuals to act according to shared community interests rather than their personal [agendas].\u201d  Further, this spark must come from a shared purpose beyond personal enrichment. The DAO\u2019s purpose must extend beyond simple profiteering and the enrichment of its token holders. Similarly, the DAO must also adhere to a purpose that deemphasizes its direct, local, and short-term interests in favor of the shared interests of a much broader group. The challeneges of Clean Money 1.0 summarized The original concept called for Maker to utilize its immense potential for allocating RWA collateral, thus ensuring that climate-aligned investments could make a tangible impact. However, two significant developments altered these initial assumptions:  Political complexity  Initially, the sheer implementation complexity was not yet understood, and attention shifted towards less \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201ccredit-like\u201d solutions. However, this was still just an attempt to copy and paste existing TradFi processes, and it soon became clear that the design and implementation of entirely new models would be extraordinarily difficult.  Regulatory deterioration   \"Secondly, the window of opportunity that would allow Maker to significantly impact the trajectory of crypto regulation closed with the disappointing lack of tangible progress in the last crypto bubble (including Maker\u2019s inability to deliver on Clean Money). Instead of recognition as a promising technology that could help solve humanity\u2019s problems, crypto became further branded as good for nothing other than scams and bubbles, exemplified by the collapse of Terra, Celsius, and 3AC.\"  Purpose 2.0 The new iteration introduces a more flexible and adaptive model that can \u201cprovide purpose and public goods for many different social impact causes, while also boosting the MetaDAOs brands, meta and governance readiness.\u201d  \"The first requirement of Clean Money 2.0 is that it must be simple and not get in the way of RWA processes by introducing brand-new concepts or complexity. The second requirement is to prioritize the internal benefits to the meta of the Maker community rather than prioritize influencing regulatory developments. It should, of course, still be seen as an essential factor in proving Maker\u2019s value to society, but this should not be the primary goal.  Proposed solution  A simplified version of Clean Collateral. An example of this comes in the form of ETH and stETH, which \u2013 post-merge \u2013 are now near carbon neutral.  That said, on its own, carbon neutrality isn\u2019t enough to move the needle. Under the new scope, Maker itself \u201cmust use its global scale and powerful economic potential to make its mark in the short-term.\u201d To that end, current geopolitical circumstances grant a unique opportunity to make a meaningful impact without overextending Maker Governance.  \u201cSupporting the advocacy of nuclear power as the completely neglected but most important short-term measure of the sustainable energy transition.\u201d  This, the post posits, is the ideal starting point for \u201cPurpose 2.0\u201d, as it grants MKR holders a narrow scope with minimal complexity to deliver on Clean Money. The full post can be found here or via the above link.*  a16z\u2019s Thoughts on Endgame  Posted by @Porter_Smith, this thread offers a16z\u2019s thoughts on the current state of the Endgame Plan. Summarized commentary The Endgame Plan addresses the need, partly based on political uncertainties, for an optimal organizational design, a long-term growth strategy, and a framework to incentivize internal innovation. A16z feels these debates funnel into one fundamental question: How can we increase MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization while best optimizing long-term growth?  \u201cGiven that DAI\u2019s most valuable characteristic is its decentralization, we believe that putting MakerDAO on a long-term path to legal, technical, and economic decentralization through the workforce (legal), the customer (technical), and the product (economic) will provide a strategic direction that can help frame other operational decisions by the community.\u201d  Decentralization summary Porter_Smith believes the Core Unit structure is already (arguably) legally decentralized, as many are wrapped in their LLC, and the managerial efforts of others direct none. Along that vein, the post offers another guiding question.  \u201c\u2026Do we need to externally restructure how Core Units work, per the Endgame Plan, or implement community-driven internal changes to improve accountability, efficiency, and output?\u201d  @Juan\u2019s recent post on project-based budgeting was presented as an example of increasing CU performance without introducing organizational risk. Techincal: Minting DAI summary This section points to @psychonaut\u2019s recent post, Toward decentralized frontend hosting as a means to increase DAI circulation organically.  \u201cFor MakerDAO, more technical decentralization practically means \u201cwho can enable users access to DAI after depositing collateral?\u201d Or, \u201chow can we incentivize as many access points to DAI generation as possible?\u201d Currently, such frontends exist; however, incentivizing more could lead to more resilient technical decentralization.\u201d  Such incentivization could be achieved through a commission-based model, similar to the strategy deployed by Liquity. Ideally, these schemes would be sufficient in enticing devs to build frontends that offer utility for the multi-chain deployment of DAI, similar to Yearn\u2019s approach. Economic: What backs DAI summarized  \u201cCollateral sits on a spectrum of decentralization, and centralized collateral has inherent risks because it can be frozen or blacklisted by another party. If MakerDAO issues 1B DAI against collateral that is subsequently blacklisted, the system is now insolvent, which is an existential risk to the long-term continuity of the project.\u201d  The post offers three solutions that address this lingering issue:  Only accept \u201csufficiently decentralized\u201d collateral types, such as Ethereum and certain derivative products. Continue to accept a certain amount of collateral types with centralization risks (USDC, wBTC, etc.) and decrease their usage over time. Embrace that MakerDAO will have to accept some centralized collateral and put caps on it. Over time, any collateral that meets these criteria would have to be backed by the same amount of DAI in the Surplus Buffer.  To conclude, a16z stressed their continued involvement in developing the Endgame Plan.  \"The Endgame Plan incorporates different innovations designed to drive MakerDAO forward; we will deliberately evaluate each piece separately through the lenses proposed above. We will support MIPs that we believe will contribute to the decentralization of the protocol. We will vote against MIPs that do not meet this threshold in their current form. We also support experimentation through smaller, self-contained proposals to get a baseline for how proposed changes might work (or not) in practice.  To read the whole post, click here.  Two New MetaDAO Clusters!   Earlier this month, we\u2019ve already witnessed the push toward MetaDAOs with both the Crimson and Viridian clusters proposed for governance approval. Nevertheless, this looks to be the beginning of a potential snowball effect as two more clusters were introduced this week. These are dubious yet exciting times for Maker!   TaiDai Cluster:  Firstly, TaiDai clarifies that its proposal will become formal once Endgame tokens have been distributed and Maker\u2019s governance process is capable of independent decisions. Introduced to you through inspiration and by the creators of Daivinity, TaiDai aims to improve the Maker brand by leveraging events, parties, and the existing relationships built and to-be-built. However, brand awareness also offers opportunities for additional revenue (as we\u2019ve seen from past Daivinity events) that TaiDai is willing to help capitalize on. No longer will we be called the \u201cBoomer Protocol.\u201d It\u2019s time to set the narrative straight and put Maker on top of the hot list. It may not be easy, especially with the complete decentralization of independent clusters; collaboration may be a difficult feat, but TaiDai proposes to utilize the power of strategic alliance by engaging with other MetaDAOs, Maker itself, and web3 partners from around the world. The Daivinity team has already proven itself\u2026 but this is just the beginning of a new era   Spring Cluster:  Our fourth Cluster proposal, posted by @Centrifuge and @Blocktower, hit the Forum this week. Dubbed the Spring Cluster, the team aims to \u201cenable the future Protector to build the long-term capability that enables Dai to meet real-world business needs openly and transparently.\u201d The team believes that bringing DAI to the real world is the critical step in its economic success, political acceptance, and its impact on the lives of everyday people and businesses.  \"BlockTower, working with Centrifuge, will be the initial arranger within the Protector. Together, we will create repeatable, scalable, and reliable frameworks for on-chain RWA investments. This cluster envisions expanding to include like-minded, technology-driven, impact-focused partners aligned to deliver real-world value promptly and safely. Following the lead taken by Maker Growth in Latin America, this cluster will dedicate time and resources to building out the adoption of Dai in emerging markets, such as Dai investments in Africa, Southeast Asia, and other emerging market countries.  Summary of the proposed mandate  Source, underwrite, structure, and manage deals that protect Maker\u2019s interests, enable Dai\u2019s growth in the real world, and foster the adoption of technologies that make transactions more efficient and open than before. Fully leverage the power of blockchain technology to break through the limitations of existing financial infrastructure.  This can be done by pushing more data on-chain, enabling additional automation via smart contracts, and increasing authenticity through a shared, digital ledger. The Cluster\u2019s general flow would track as follows:  The full proposal can be found here.   Huge thanks to @alec for writing these summaries!

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  The Weekly Relay is now published Monday mornings! Authors: @alec, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS  Endgame Maker\u2019s past few months felt like a microcosm of the global environment. We saw several internal crises, both real and imagined. The governance process underwent radical growth, and its politicization came naturally. This political introduction precipitated a rise in populism. Lines were drawn, and sides were chosen. However, this also led to increased participation in the governance process. With ideals set, proposals were further scrutinized, and the RFC process finally saw the required attention. These efforts were then boiled down into the Endgame MIP Set, and with its passing, the DAO again has a unified purpose. Not everyone will agree with the entirety of this purpose, but viewed piece by piece, the Endgame Plan offers several diverse routes for future growth. To that end, let us explore the many changes enacted by the Endgame Plan - our freshly ratified \u201ccollective purpose.\u201d  Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set Passed    Endgame poll totals953\u00d7529 25.3 KB  Amassing over 80% of the total votes, the Endgame MIP Set passed with ease. As a result, the following protocol alterations will be enacted:  MIP83: Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters   \u201cMIP83 is a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set configuring the Clusters of the Launch MetaDAOs. This enables groups within the Core Units to begin preparations to restructure as MetaDAOs, a de-risked form of scaling the Decentralized Workforce available in the Endgame.\u201d   MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation   \u201cThis MIP activates the preliminary implementation of the Protocol-Owned Vault, using the Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) approach, which uses a non-standard configuration of the existing Maker Protocol to achieve the effects of a Protocol-Owned Vault.\u201d  With its passing, a Dss-Kiln will be configured and deployed to purchase stETH. An executive will then be crafted to transfer 20M Dai to this new vault.  MIP1c4-SP1: Subproposal for Changing the Problem Space   \u201cMIP1 was largely forgotten and never managed to serve its purpose, but with the Endgame Plan, the same core concept is revived as there needs to be clarity around when Maker Governance starts to slow down and not invite so many proposals.\u201d  Under the above terms, five items would be added to the \u201cProblem Space\u201d - or perceived inefficiencies in the Maker Governance model.   Constitution: The constitution is a MIP that contains the core tenets of the social contract and voter pre-agreements that stabilize the meta of the Endgame State.   Endgame Product MIPs: A set of MIPs that define each Endgame Product in as much detail as possible. Only products already detailed and defined in the Endgame Products MIPs can be added to the Maker Protocol.   Scope MIPs: The Scope MIPs are individual MIPs that each cover the 11 Scopes that define all Maker Governance processes and the expectations and KPIs of the Decentralized Workforce. Metanomics: The Metanomics MIP provides an immutable and unambiguous definition of what the long-run, unchangeable tokenomics of the Endgame State will be. This includes MKR emissions, Maker surplus funneling, MetaDAO emissions, and MetaDAO surplus funneling.   Metanomics: The Metanomics MIP provides an immutable and unambiguous definition of what the long-run, unchangeable tokenomics of the Endgame State will be. This includes MKR emissions, Maker surplus funneling, MetaDAO emissions, and MetaDAO surplus funneling.   Launch MetaDAO Activation: To trigger the Endgame Plan Launch, a Launch MetaDAO Activation MIP is required, as this authorizes the deployment and activation of the MetaDAO tokens and the MetaDAO token farms.    MIP4c4-SP1: MIP Removal Subproposals   \u201cContinuation of the actual useful forms of collateral onboarding is already enabled entirely through the existing governance mandates and their ability to trigger relevant Executive Votes, as specified in MIP16, MIP39, and MIP41, but the Endgame Plan MIP Set also proposes additional amendments to emphasize this existing capability further and ensure that collateral onboarding can continue happening smoothly with no risk of unexpected blockers.\u201d   MIP4c2-SP27: MIP16 Amendment Subproposal   \u201cThis MIP is being amended to become compatible with the Endgame Plan and prevent Signal Requests (non-standard weekly polls) from dominating the governance dynamic and acting as a vector for unpredictable complexity growth and governance overhead.\u201d \u201cThis MIP Amendment only affects Signal Requests leading to non-standard weekly polls and does not change the standard and primary focus of MIP16.\u201d   MIP39c2-SP35: Modifying Risk Core Unit Mandate - RISK-001   \u201cThe updated mandate is written with a new approach where the critical element of the mandate explicitly and directly impacts Facilitator Governance Powers are provided upfront. This information is also described as short and succinct as possible to clarify what Governance Privileges the Core Unit Facilitator will have regarding proposing non-standard weekly polls as defined in MIP16.\u201d   MIP39c2-SP36: Modifying Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate (SF-001)   \u201cThe Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate is modified as a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set to eliminate any possible risk of the collateral onboarding process becoming disrupted or blocked by the removal of the old MIP6 process.\u201d   MIP39c2-SP37: Modifying Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit Mandate (CES-001)  Like the SES modification, this MIP aims to eliminate the risk of disrupting or blocking the collateral onboarding process. Details on the proposals can be found here.  Core Units Offboarded - Next Steps  A thread by @Patrick_J documents the following steps to be undertaken in the offboarding of three Core Units: SH-001, EVENTS-001, and RWF-001.  SH-001   Both the DAI and MKR vesting stream will be halted. 43,332 DAI and 26.04 MKR will be sent to the SH-001 multisig.   EVENTS-001   The DAI vesting stream will be halted (there is no MKR vesting stream). 167,666 DAI will be transferred to the EVENTS-001 multisig.   RWF-001   Like EVENTS-001, DAI vesting will be halted, and no MKR vesting stream exists.  However, unlike the previously mentioned offboardings, RWF-001\u2019s budget flow includes an auditor wallet. The offboarding MIP specifies that all payments should be routed through this wallet. After discussions with the auditors from the @SES-Core-Unit, the following will occur:  Zero DAI will be sent from the surplus buffer to the auditor wallet - the auditor wallet has sufficient DAI balance to fund the remaining offboarding costs. Any DAI balance above 176,000 DAI in the auditor wallet will be returned to MakerDAO via DssBlow. 143.46 MKR will be sent to the auditor wallet - this is the approved 201.46 MKR minus the 58 MKR already in the auditor wallet. The auditors will arrange separate MKR payments to team members per the amounts listed in the offboarding proposal.  The full post can be found here.  User Retention Revenue Share, Fixed-Rates, and Decentralized Collateral Scopes  @rune further details the fixed-rate mechanisms and strategy utilized in the increased decentralization of DAI\u2019s collateral backing. These mechanisms only apply to Maker Core Vaults that do not directly support MetaDAO token yield farming.   User retention revenue share bonus   This bonus is based on the observation that long-standing vaults are less likely to be liquidated and would come in addition to the standard 25% stability fee revenue share available to both MetaDAO and \u201cecosystem actor\u201d frontends. The initial parameters enable a 10% bonus accrued over one year. To help illustrate this accrual:  This means that if a user opens a vault through a MetaDAO frontend and it pays 1000 Dai in stability fees over a period of one year, the MetaDAO gets a total 10% bonus on top of the standard 25% for the entire period, so a total of 35% in revenue share over that one year, for a total of 350 Dai. If a user opens a vault that pays 500 Dai in stability fees over six months before closing, then the MetaDAO gets half of the bonus, so 5%, for a total of 30% for the six months or 150 Dai.    Fixed Rates Module    \u201cThe Fixed Rates Module is a conceptual system that allows Maker to target a fixed rates strategy for decentralized assets and its own vaults by using protocols like Deco and other similar products built by fixed rates projects such as Element or Sense.\u201d  Under this model, Decentralized Collateral CUs create a target portfolio based on the information it collects through the Stability and Liquidity Scopes. For example, \u201ca CU might target the accrual of 10% of its total Dai supply locked into term vaults (that the user must pay to wind down early) \u2013 and 5% of the total Dai supply into premium fixed rates vault, which can freely wind down early.\u201d The full outline can be found here.   In other news A poll to end DAI funding for SourceCred had passed on October 13th. The last payment for the SourceCred program will be this Friday. However, the instance will continue to calculate cred for users just in case SourceCred is to be used again in the future, but it will not calculate grain, resulting in no DAI tied to the cred.    Shout-outs! Intra-protocol Vault Exposer Migrations Research analysis The Risk team examined vault exposure migrations in a broader context, focusing only on intra-protocol exposure movement. They looked at major collaterals such as ETH, stETH, and WBTC. According to the analysis, intra-protocol migrations are not common since most vault owners tend to keep to vaults that offer better borrowing conditions (e.g., lower liquidation risk). Though the exact reasons are unknown, the team believes the rationale is that users are more cautious during bear market conditions. The Risk team hopes to investigate cross-protocol migration in the future. See the report for a complete breakdown! Multiparty Democracy in Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Evidence from MakerDAO Research paper A group of researchers consisting of Ph.D. student Xiaotong Sun, associate professor Xi Chen, professor Charalampos Stasinakis, and professor Georgios Sermpinis attempt to answer the controversial question: can blockchain technology help to achieve decentralized governance? Using actual governance data from MakerDAO, they examine whether DAO governance is a multiparty democracy and how voting parties affect DeFi protocols.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS  Last week\u2019s G&R Call saw two proposed Clusters further detail their overarching schemas: Crimson and Viridian. A summarized breakdown of each Q&A segment will follow.  Crimson Cluster  Cluster presentation here.  2285\u00d71284 176 KB  \u201cWhat is Crimson\u2019s cash-flow generation, and how does it incorporate into the metaDAO token?\u201d Per @hexonaut, Crimson\u2019s inaugural release will be a high-efficiency lending front-end. Initially, cash flow generates from this lending engine in the form of interest rates.  Much like Maker Vaults, users can deposit digital assets to borrow DAI (with an attached Stability Fee). Further premiums are collected from users \u201cborrowing\u201d this lent collateral.  These collected fees would then be dispersed between LPs and the metaDAO. \u201cDo you plan on using the D3M for RWA platforms?\u201d Crimson is not currently focused on RWAs, but rather on DeFi-native assets. \u201cWill Crimson have on-chain governance?\u201d Yes, the metaToken will function as the platform\u2019s governance token. \u201cWhat are some potential competitors, and how is this Cluster better?\u201d Listed Competitors: Aave, Compound, Oiler Finance. hexonaut believes Crimson possesses two niche advantages:  The platform focuses on significant assets (i.e., BTC, ETH, and staked ETH derivatives) and will not be competing for tail-end assets. All other lending markets utilize Chainlink oracles. Initially, Crimson will instead use Maker Oracles, but the ultimate vision remains a multi-oracle system, utilizing both Chainlink and Maker Oracles.  \u201cAre you planning on having algorithmic rates?\u201d Stables can be borrowed at fixed rates in quantities not exceeding the current debt ceiling. @hexonaut sees these fixed rates as an integral part of the platform\u2019s draw. \u201cUsers don\u2019t like taking leveraged positions on platforms with volatile lending rates that can spike at any time, so [Crimson] prefers the Maker model for stablecoin borrowing.\u201d The full interview can be found here, or through the above link.  Viridian Cluster  Cluster presentation here.  2354\u00d71267 230 KB  \u201cHow is your cluster thinking about the possibility of \u201crisk-on\u201d partnerships with arrangers that go after riskier opportunities?\u201d Per @Allan_Pedersen, the idea is to generate maximum yield, but many of the strat-gems depend on the \u201chard frameworks\u201d Maker develops to expand RWAs. \u201cDo you see any opportunities in the short-to-medium term with Corporates?\u201d Viridian currently operates \u201crisk on,\u201d and the current governance process moves too slowly to undertake these risks in the current climate. The team does see an opportunity here, but they might not be ideal for Maker as situated. \u201cHow do you plan on hedging Risk for RMBS when exposed to it through arrangers?\u201d Because these bonds are bought below \u201cpar,\u201d Viridian should capture additional yield. This would typically create additional risks as this inflow is reinvested, but the team doesn\u2019t expect to sustain losses on this yield as Viridian\u2019s cash flow is sufficiently compressed. \u201cIn the current environment, why not just go all in on treasuries and earn over 4% with minimal risk?\u201d Per @SebVentures, the team has considered re-investing its short-term bonds, but to do so through DeFi instruments presents a problem. \u201cAt some point, we have to give some of this cash flow to DAI holders by increasing the DSR.\u201d To receive a 4% yield \u201crisk-free,\u201d the allocated stables would need to be arbitraged. Using DeFi products for this process, much of this yield would be lost to slippage and arbitrageurs. Placed alongside any DSR increases, the overall spread would be very narrow. \u201cIs the Viridian Cluster responsible for the risk and legal assessments of its RWA deals?\u201d Per Allan_Pedersen, the team hopes to provide stand-alone risk and legal assessments regarding \u201cdirect counterparties\u201d (i.e., Monetalis and any future arranges ratified through governance). The full discussion can be found here, or via the link in the title.    Shout-outs!  Drinks with Delegates ft. Kurt Barry of PECU!       @ultraschuppi and @flipflopflapdelegate meet again, but this time they invite @Kurt_Barry to discuss decentralized stablecoins and the challenges associated with long-term scaling. Moreover, the trio shared their opinions and possible implications for reactivating the DSR as federal interest rates continue to rise. This idea originated in the governance channel. However, the drinks were not finished that soon; Further discussions focused on the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism and the DeFi Collateral Problem.  SES Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard - New Release   Visit their dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/  The GraphQL API can be accessed using the API explorer  Download the latest budget tool here   SES is excited to announce the following additions to their Expenses Dashboard:    DAO-Level Activity Feed  A global activity feed with everything happening on the platform, with the possibility to filter by the Core Units of interest.    Privacy Control Improvement    Allow the user to choose if cookies can be used for remembering the dark mode toggle, last visit indicators, and basic feature usage tracking.    Commenting Improvement for Expense Reports    A general comments tool for the monthly expense report enables Core Unit Administrators to provide more context for their expenses.    Offboarded Core Units Improvement    With the recently voted-in changes to offboard several MakerDAO Core Units, SES has further specified these changes in the dashboard by introducing \u201cobsolete\u201d status for such Core Units.   new User Authentication    SES is currently working on the ability for users to authenticate on the dashboard, which is a critical requirement for future collaboration features.

Given that his team worked at the intersection between theory and practice, they frequently faced unexpected results. As they continued to break new ground, they found that all the tried-and-tested models to ensure precision could have been more effective. Instead, they relied on initiative and intuition. From this team came Murphy\u2019s Law, which states that whatever can go wrong will. Crypto operates in a similar space. No models define correctness, and no compass offers guidance, so when things go wrong - they often go wrong in unexpected ways. The need for continued, focused engagement and innovation has never been clearer in this unforgiving environment. Fortunately, this week saw numerous efforts to define Maker\u2019s path and position better.  Discussion on Enabling the DSR  @SebVentures, in tandem with the MakerDAO Open Market Committee (MOMC), proposes an increase to the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). Summary of motivations  \u201cGiven that MIP65, the GUSD partnership, and soon MIP81 will give us access to TradFi safe yield or rewards, we have all the tools to generate sustainable revenues at scale.\u201d  This proposal comes as a double-edged sword of sorts. A DSR increase improves DAI\u2019s utility but comes at a high up-front cost to the DAO.  Per Seb, in TradFi, the \u201crisk-free\u201d benchmark currently stands at 3.8%. The Coinbase deal offers 1.5%, but its custodial nature has caused significant friction As it currently stands, DAI offers a meager 0.01%.  Summary of the opportunity Both Compound and Aave have an in-built DSR integration currently left inactive. Assuming a 2% DSR, the lending rate on Compound would move from 1.2% to 2.25% - over double USDC\u2019s current rate. The team feels this incentivizes USDC holders to migrate to DAI, improving its positioning on leading lending engines. Further, the DAO could bolster its DEX liquidity through CHAI (an ERC-20 token built atop the DSR), which could be paired with stable-ETH LPs.  Urgent Collateral Parameter Changes!  In light of the recent market drawbacks, @Primoz posted an Urgent Signal seeking community sentiment on several parameter changes. If passed, the following alterations would be enacted:   Decrease MATIC-A Debt Ceiling from current 20M to 10M  Decrease LINK-A Debt Ceiling from current 25M to 5M  Decrease YFI-A Debt Ceiling from current 10M to 3M  Decrease renBTC-A Debt Ceiling from current 10M to 0  Of these assets, renBTC has the highest \u201ctail risk asset\u201d due to uncertainties surrounding its post-FTX market positioning. The Signal also aims to proceed with the proposed MANA parameter changes despite action from the borrower. If passed, MANA\u2019s parameters would be adjusted as follows:  Decrease Debt Ceiling to 3M from the current 10M (pending current executive vote execution) Significantly increase SF to 50% from the current 7.5% (pending current executive vote execution) Increase liquidation penalty to 30% from the current 13%  The Signal concluded with a 75% \u2018Yes\u2019 vote, and thus, will be included in an out-of-schedule Executive.

Defender Contract Against Governance Attacks MIP91: Defender Contract Against Governance Attacks, proposed by the GovAlpha Core Unit, is aimed to become an additional smart contract tool in our governance system that will help MKR holders defend against potential malicious attacks.

Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Limit MIP84c10-SP1: Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Limit, proposed by psychonaut, Core Unit Facilitator of Immunefi Security, in effort to move forward on Protocol Owned Vault Emulation (POVE) of the Endgame Plan. The MIP proposes to set the new Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit parameter to 1B, which will be way above the size of the surplus buffer.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @Sol_Invictus, and @Artem_Gordon Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS   Endgame Plan next steps: 2023 milestones for MetaDAO Launch  With the approval of the Endgame MIP Set, the \u201cPregame\u201d phase is officially underway. This post saw @rune expand on what to expect in 2023. Summary of 2023 MetaDAO Milestones:  1) Pregame Product smart contracts  These are the contracts necessary to launch the on-chain components of future MetaDAOs.   EtherDai token wrapper deployment Elixir Balancer pool deployment MetaDAO ERC20 token deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Meta Elixir Uniswap v2 pool deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Anti-Reflexivity Mechanic deployments (one for each MetaDAO)  Linear token sales mechanism to prevent price spikes   Dai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) EtherDai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) MKR Farms (one for each MetaDAO)  Metanomics I deployment  70,000 MKR emitted per year, with 60000 funneled directly to the Meta Elixir of each of the MetaDAOs   Various dss-kiln and proxy contract deployments to manage accounts and token flows for MetaDAOs    \u201cOf these features, I believe that the ETHD Farms and the MKR farms are the only ones that are somewhat technically challenging in terms of new code required, while the rest is almost all extremely simple code and implementation.\u201d   2) MVP of the MetaDAO frontends  Per the post, a MetaDAO \u2013 like any DeFi protocol \u2013 is defined by its front end, so it\u2019s imperative to have quality UIs in place for these initial Launch MetaDAOs. These frontends will require the following:   Access to all Dai Farms Access to opening Maker Vaults (including EtherDai Vaults) Access to all EtherDai Vault Farms Access to all MKR Farms MVP of the Easy Voter Frontend that is required for users who wish to farm with MKR, as they need to first delegate through this frontend to be able to farm with MKR Support for MetaDAOs adding their products or external services.    3) The MetaDAO Cluster journey  Steps that must be met before the launch of a MetaDAO:   Cluster announcements Vote to include announced Clusters as Recognized Launch MetaDAO Clusters Creation of MetaDAO forums Early meta development of the new MetaDAO forums Approval of the starting MIP-like infrastructure of new MetaDAOs by Maker Governance Preparation of MIP39-equivalent onboarding proposals by the Clusters to a specific MetaDAO each Launch of the MetaDAO frontends and the Pregame Smart contracts, which begins the distribution of MetaDAO tokens to Dai, ETHD, and MKR holders Onboarding of the Clusters as Administration Teams to each of the MetaDAOs Normal operation of the MetaDAOs with Administration Teams in charge of running their governance processes and facilitating budgets and community decisions.    4) The Endgame Constitution and the Endgame Scope Frameworks   \"The Constitution and Scope Frameworks will be the primary way that the processes of Maker Governance itself will be locked down to prevent corruption or instability of direction over time. The constitution will govern eligibility for compensation from Maker Core as a Mandated Actor, Recognized Delegate, or Recognized Decentralized Voter Committee.\"  The utilized Endgame Scope Frameworks will be defined in the constitution, making them difficult to change, add, or remove. These carefully designed frameworks are then used for \u201call lower-level decisions surrounding the implementation or actions of the Decentralized Workforce, MetaDAOs and Ecosystem Actors, and any compensation-based risk parameter adjustments.\u201d The post concludes by stating that each of the above items must be completed by the end of 2023 to ensure that the Endgame Plan remains on track. Click here to read the post in its entirety.   Gasless Voting is Here!      You can now submit your vote preferences at zero cost through the voting portal frontend! Summary of the process:   Gasless voting is the default option unless a user specifies a preference for a legacy (L1) transaction. This is accomplished through a relay service that securely submits vote metadata to a polling contract hosted on Arbitrum. The Governance database listens to the event and appends it to the table. When requested by the front end, votes from both networks are merged and calculated. The frontend UI displays the merged polling results.    2880\u00d71664 231 KB  The system also features numerous Spam Protection Checks   Address has at least 0.1 MKR of poll voting weight. Address has not used the Gasless Poll Voting system in the last 10 minutes. Address has only voted once in any of the polls included in the ballot. Address is not a multisig wallet. (note: Safe multisigs do not yet support off-chain message signing)   For a video walk-through of the gasless voting process, Click here, or for a detailed technical overview - head to the Maker Operational Manual.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @Alec, @Sol_Invictus and @Artem_Gordon Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS   Collateral Engineering Services  Interim Facilitator Selection Summary The week began with unfortunate news. The Core Unit facilitator of Collateral Engineering Services, @monkey.irish, resigned his post and submitted facilitator offboarding and Core Unit offboarding proposals. An interim Facilitator decision process followed shortly after, with @Retro being chosen earlier today. Below are some more details about what happened.  1. Mabel Tong & David Krett are nominated as co-interim facilitators Within his facilitator offboarding proposal, Robert declared support for the nomination of @zmtong and @dbckan as co-interim facilitators to assist in the offboarding of the CES Core Unit. GovAlpha responded to the nomination by posting an overview of the Interim Facilitator Ratification process that included a gated poll to measure support from the other facilitators.  1534\u00d7947 62.9 KB   2. The nomination of @lollike as interim facilitator @juan, facilitator of the SES Core Unit, proposed @lollike as interim facilitator for the CES Core Unit with some good reasoning. Lollike informed Mandated Actors of his withdrawal and urged them to support both Zmtong and Dbkcan as co-interim facilitators. Meanwhile, the Facilitators voted on the poll. Unfortunately, none of the candidates received the needed 10 votes to be ratified as an interim facilitator; therefore, GovAlpha was required to initiate a Fallback Nomination process as described in MIP41c6. Juan responded to the Fallback Nomination Process by nominating @Retro. Retro accepted the nomination and recognized it as an opportunity to lead CES through this challenging time.  3. Selection of a fallback interim facilitator Accordingly, GovAlpha submitted a separate post to select an interim fallback facilitator for CES. A procedure of this nature has never been implemented in MakerDAO before. The process:  Facilitators had 24 hours to confirm their intention to opt-in or opt-out as potential nominees. Anyone could nominate themselves. The nominee is asked to confirm the nomination if they have been nominated by someone else. Volunteers could propose themselves as co-interim facilitators. Following the nomination process, active facilitators vote for nominees using the ranked-choice method (IRV) for one week or until 10 votes for a single nominee are collected.   4. Retro Leads CES GovAlpha collected votes here. And just an hour ago, Retro gathered the needed support, becoming the active interim facilitator for the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @Sol_Invictus and @Artem_Gordon Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS   Dai Savings Rate Increased to 1%   The community and our recognized delegates voted to increase Dai\u2019s annual reward to 1.00%. Due to current market conditions, yields in DeFi continue to fall and decrease demand for loans, especially since traditional market yields have skyrocketed. This has pushed more users out of decentralized stablecoins like Dai and into USD. A higher DSR (Dai Savings Rate) encourages users to hold more Dai, which leads to higher demand and liquidity. Even though a DSR of 1% is far below the traditional market yield, this represents a significant improvement to MakerDAO\u2019s protocol revenue. However, sustaining a higher DSR involves more maintenance and costs; we must ensure sufficient liquidity in order to maintain Dai stability, and the total cost of maintaining Dai stability increased to 12,000 Dai. This cost would significantly increase if the Dai supply deposited into the PSM also increases, however at a benefit:  \u2018Higher DSR rates would significantly increase Maker\u2019s cost base but may be more than compensated for by improved revenue generating capacity.\u2019 - MOMC  The passing of this poll opens opportunities for more partnership integrations and increased user retention. Dai is now a more competitive stablecoin . Please refer to this documentation and discussion post for more information about the Dai Savings Rate.  A Work-in-Progress Scope Framework Endgame: Scope 3 (Real World Asset Collaterals) Last week\u2019s DVC call with Rune brought us the very first draft MIP for an Endgame Scope. This draft aims to present an initial Scope Framework, which the broader community can use to collaborate on its improvement. Each of the 11 Scope Frameworks will be implemented as a stand-alone MIP. MIPs for the Scope Framework is split into three components:  Content (replaces MIPs on processes and procedures in the DAO). Budget (replaces the Core Unit MIP structure). Future Implementation (replaces Declaration of Intent MIP).  Community members are invited to provide feedback, including those with relevant specialized skills, regarding the document\u2019s language, structure, and format. Rune hopes to have the Scope Framework on-chain by the end of Q1 of 2023.    Shout-outs!

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @Artem_Gordon, @Davidutro, and @Sol_Invictus Online PDF version    CURRENT EVENTS   New Delegate Expands Diversity  2222\u00d71255 289 KB  Despite delegation being in place for almost 18 months, we have yet to see an educational institution from Asia participate in governance. Until now\u2026 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) enters the arena as Maker\u2019s newest Recognized Delegate with the following Core Values to drive their platform. HKUST EPI aims to present value to the protocol by:  Establishing a beneficial and friendly environment between Universities and Protocols. Developing innovative solutions through critical thinking. Educating the next generation about the benefits of blockchain technology in TradeFi. Supporting the protocol on Treasury, Budgeting, Process Streamlining, and Collateral Risk Management. And sharing their insights, industry knowledge, and experiences.   Summary of Delegate Statement  HKUST openly embraces the visions and innovation stemming from bleeding-edge technologies, and its students are actively encouraged to explore these new frontiers.  \"As blockchain technology is still maturing and adoption rapidly increases, continuous education and development should be established. Strategic planning, proper decision-making, and marketing are required for mainstream adoption to be achieved. Therefore, establishing a research lab (EPI) to synergize the growth of MakerDAO, by governance participation, with exposure to blockchain technology and decentralized finance, would provide a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship between MakerDAO and the University.\"  The delegator will be led by a University researcher, with volunteer students filling out the Research Lab. This Lab expects to be fully vested in Maker Governance, with frequent and timely communication on all governance decisions. The Lab will receive assistance from other Faculty members on topics such as Research, Education, Business Development, and Web3-centric developments. Focus will be placed on several initiatives, including:  Actively participating in forum discussions. Initiating new improvement proposals. Monitoring protocol news and updates. Seeking consultations with respective faculty members or with collaborating external parties. Communicating with internal team members. And offering public Q&A with their delegators.  Curious to learn more? Join the next Meet Your Delegate call happening this Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. UTC, where EPI Lab will present their platform and answer all of your questions.   Uncertain Paths as Core Unit Budgets are Rejected Several Core Units had their budgets rejected, with delegates advising transitions to Endgame-compliant positions as Ecosystem Actors. Governance Communications, Immunifi Security, SideStream Auction Services, and TechOps all had their budgets rejected during the November governance cycle. The rejections did not come with any offboarding proposals but rather left the Core Units in a questionable position, asking them to figure out their next move. Each group scrambled to understand what to do next. Over the last week, we saw proposals published, hinting at these teams\u2019 future. Some Core Units are anxious to see how delegates will vote during the next round of budget proposals coming in March. Hopes for a smooth transition into Endgame are dwindling.  Governance Communications  COM-001 Unwinding GovComms was the first to act, proposing their own offboarding with no certain future in mind. Following the budget rejection, GovComms worked with GovAlpha Core Unit to transition the critical and most valuable parts of their work. They are on track to close everything out by the end of January. The proposal generated a range of responses. Many expressed gratitude and well wishes, while others felt confusion and uncertainty. However, the bulk of the discussion focused on the golden parachute and retroactive MKR compensation.  Debate on Golden Parachute and Retroactive Compensation The offboarding proposal that polled for the level of retroactive MKR compensation sparked some lively discussion on the fairness of the proposal with regards to the golden parachute and retroactive MKR compensation. While many agree on the general concept of the golden parachute, the disagreements stemmed from the questions of \u201cHow much should the DAO compensate offboarded units?\u201d and \u201cis the level of retroactive MKR compensation fair?\u201d One side argued that the packages might be too generous, while others argued that compared to other Core Units, GovComms was being penalized for poor timing and that they should be compensated on a comparable level.  Immunifi Security  Mandate and Budget Rejected Besides their budget, Immunefi Security also had its mandate rejected as delegates generally agreed about the value of the bug bounty program, but stated that the Core Unit should transition to an Ecosystem Actor and that they wouldn\u2019t support the revised mandate.  IS as an Ecosystem Actor The Deputy Facilitator, Psychonaut, committed to moving forward as an Ecosystem actor, but requested more time to transition. A proposal for bridge funding was posted. In parallel, recognized delegate Flipside Crypto posted a formal offboarding proposal for the Core Unit.  Sidestream Auction Services  Budget Rejected SAS had its budget rejected as delegates expressed their opinions that the services provided by Sidestream may be better offered as an Ecosystem Actor.  SAS as an Ecosystem Actor Sidestream requested bridge funding to finance operations until March 2023. The team has acknowledged the feedback provided by Delegates and will wind down auction-related work to a bare minimum by only maintaining current auction services. During the next few months, they will work on a process to support Endgame products as a software service provider. Recognized Delegate Flipside Crypto posted a formal offboarding proposal for the Core Unit.  TechOps  Budget Rejected TechOps had its budget rejected as delegates believe that the Core Unit should reduce its budget and transition as an Ecosystem Actor or Tribunal.  New Budget as an Ecosystem Actor/Infrastructure Tribunal TechOps requested bridge funding through February 2023 as they propose a new budget they hope will win favor with delegates, which offers even lower Base and Bear options. Along with this, TechOps will transition as either an Ecosystem Actor or Infrastructure Tribunal and update its roadmap to include these as new objectives. If passed, this new budget proposal will begin on April 1st, 2023.   Compound v2 D3M Integrated The long awaited executive vote to integrate D3M with Compound has officially passed!  The community showed overwhelming support to onboard a second D3M, as it\u2019s been over a year since the first one with Aave. D3Ms help position DAI as a more liquid and convenient stablecoin to borrow. Compound users can now benefit from a fixed DAI borrowing rate, which is an attractive option within the volatile structure of DeFi. Compound V2 D3M Vault Parameters:  Maximum Debt Ceiling: 5 million DAI. Target Available Debt: 5 million DAI. Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl): 12 hours. Target Borrow Rate (bar): 2%.   D3M Links & Resources  Should Maker Prioritize Onboarding A Compound D3M? @GFXlabs posted a signal gauging the community\u2019s interest in prioritizing the onboarding of a Compound D3M. Polling concluded with a 48% \u2018Yes\u2019 vote, topping second-place 'Abstain by a narrow 2% margin. Compound D3M Risk Assessment @Sean of the Risk CU offers a deep dive into the newly activated D3M. The post details the entire history of the D3M proposal before moving into a complete analytical breakdown of the mechanism. Compound v2 D3M Technical Assessment @Derek of the Protocol Engineering CU provides a technical breakdown and assessment of the D3M module. Note that per the post, this implementation is viewed as \u201chigh-risk.\u201d Compound Protocol & cDAI ERC20 Token CES Domain Team Assessment @dbkcan of CES-001 offers another D3M assessment; this time focused on the risk of onboarding cDAI (Compound\u2019s interest-bearing DAI derivative).

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates. Authors: @alec, @Artem_Gordon, and @Sol_Invictus Online PDF version   Happy Holidays and Farewell   First and foremost, we wish everyone a very merry and happy holiday season. Hopefully, you all had a fantastic year filled with knowledge, excitement, and experience. The most important thing we hope for next year is that MakerDAO and its community will be able to realize the Endgame Phase and that Santa Claus will bring a bull market sooner rather than later.  Now for the sad news: Since GovComms has been offboarded, these publications have come to an unfortunate end. It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to provide our readers with weekly recaps, event summaries, and news updates. However, do not fret just yet! Wipe those tears away because we do not wish this opportunity to be wasted. In accordance with the Endgame transition, I (Artem Gordon) am in the process of reorganizing a new and improved publication service. While I do not want to reveal any surprises, expect the Relay and Forum Recaps to come back bigger and better than ever (along with a few new twists and unique improvements). Watch for the official announcement and discussion posts soon after the ball drops.  image1200\u00d7627 210 KB     CURRENT EVENTS   Open Decentralized Voter Committee \u2013 \u201cThe Endgame Constitution\u201d  Rune breaks down the latest iteration of the Endgame Roadmap, listed below. It\u2019s emphasized that the majority of these lack tangible content. This Open DVC, instead, served to introduce these terms as well as outline their relation to the Endgame Constitution.   1644\u00d7782 86.5 KB   Summary of intentions: Rune feels we need to \u201crethink\u201d what we\u2019ve, to date, been calling the Endgame Plan. Strip away the interlacing complexity of each moving piece, and \u201cwhat\u2019s left is the Endgame Constitution.\u201d This Constitution serves to elevate the Endgame\u2019s many pieces from abstract concepts to concrete plans of action. In other words, it encapsulates the entirety of the Endgame Plan, including the interactions between each element.  \u201cThe whole Plan, then, naturally grows from the Consitution. Like a single MIP that implements everything, it\u2019s fundamentally responsible for implementing these mechanisms that self-reinforce and resist change.\u201d  Summary of discussed terms: The goal is a document akin to the U.S. Constitution, complete with an artistic flourish of the era, lending an air of professionalism that\u2019s missed in modern implementations.  The Principles of the Endgame Constitution are ideals, set in stone, \u201cthat each voter must understand to [better utilize] the mechanisms of the Constitution.\u201d   \u201cIf you have no voters that understand, follow, and act based on these guiding principles \u2013 the Endgame fails. However, the system only needs a few to maintain its effectiveness. \u2026These voters assure the system remains stable in the face of any of the [many] risks that we now know exist.\u201d   Preserving the purpose and meta of Maker and DAO  This step requires MKR holders that act based on something greater than simple personal gain. This is a natural extension of the above \u201cprinciples\u201d dictating the DAO\u2019s overarching direction. These initial items dictate the \u201crules of operation\u201d for proceeding terms. For example, the DAOs principles and purpose drive the function of its metaDAOs. Per Rune, the most critical of these comes in an easy-to-use voting front-end. This front end comes equipped with a Delegate ranking system based on \u201cpopularity\u201d (i.e., vote weight). This UI requires consistent engagement to retain this top slot and the visibility that comes with it. In that sense, this UI \u201cself-polices\u201d participation and fits on the delegate end while streamlining the selection process on the user side. The role of SubDAOs summarized: While these units may engage in independent projects, Governance SubDAOs assume the de-facto title of Mandated Actor. As in the current system, these protocol actors can be \u201cpenalized for any failings to follow the ratified Constitution.\u201d  \u201c[The system] assumes everyone to be corrupt, as very few MKR holders are actual semi-altruists.\u201d  As such, this penalization system must be clearly defined at each step, leaving no doubt about the consequences of a particular transgression. The goal is to comprehensively codify the process, allowing the protocol to wage these penalties automatically. This better aligns with the decentralized ethos and allows the workforce to fully anonymize over time. Timeline summarized:  The current task list is filled with unknowns. By the end of Q1, these unknowns will be fully explored, dissected, and quantified. Q2, we\u2019ll see these processes formally ratified, with all DVC Subcommittee calls operating as defined in this Constitution. After further, now informed, updates to the Constitution, a Q3 launch of SubDAOs is expected. In Q4, everything learned and implemented will be ossified or fixed, and the DAO can begin to fully operate under the rules of engagement formalized in the Constitution.  Community Discussion: While community conversation is confined and brief, some dissent was expressed. @LongForWisdom questioned the scope and complexity of an all-encompassing Constitution and offered an alternative structure.  \u201cThe aim of a constitution in my mind is to be a short, easily understandable document that explains what Maker is trying to achieve, why, and how it plans to do so at a high level.\u201d  This proposed structure:  Includes articles 1-3 in your division above. Defines enshrined legislation (and the requirements for changing it) Includes a list of enshrined legislation. Defines mutable legislation (and the requirements for changing it) Includes a list of mutable legislation. A clear statement that the constitution itself is enshrined, meaning no one can add additional mutable legislation without clearing the enshrined modification requirement. A set of enshrined legislation as defined in the constitution but not part of it. These are MIP-like documents covering what you currently define as articles 4-10. I\u2019d recommend that they be MIPs and that you re-purpose the MIPs framework to host these and nothing else. But MIP-like is fine. A set of mutable legislation (i.e., the scope contents).   \u201cThis keeps complex information separated into digestible chunks and allows us to go into the required level of detail without polluting the constitution with the sort of legal crap you need to constrain the actions of profit-seeking entities effectively.\u201d  A link to the complete video discussion can be found here, or to read the accompanying post in its entirety \u2013 click here.  An Introduction to Now Polling MIPs Top Level  MIP92: Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to Earn Yield  @corn from Yearn Protocol proposes a USD 100M onboarding of PSM USDC to an entirely new, bespoke, non-custodial Yearn vault to be explicitly built for Maker. MIP92 proposes an on-chain, DeFi-native route to earn a yield on USDC currently held in the PSM. Yearn v2 vaults are battle-tested, handling ATHs of USD 6.4B. Since then, they\u2019ve successfully unwound USD 6B with no loss in funds by promoting safety, security, and risk management. At the time of posting, Yearn provided a risk-adjusted 2.16% APY average on its USDC vault implementation. Yearn has also built and contributed to the creation and development of products in services such as yAcademy, Coordinape, ApeWorx, ERC4626, and more. Yearn wants to utilize the current bear market to build a long-term relationship with Maker through a Strategy plan that covers everything from due diligence to production:  1859\u00d7921 122 KB  The Yearn risk structure measures eight key frameworks, which are live and can be viewed at yearn.watch/risk.  1729\u00d7929 90.8 KB  Yearn takes a 20% performance fee to cover the costs for monitoring, alerting, troubleshooting, and other processes. However, there are no management or withdrawal fees at all.  1768\u00d7803 111 KB  The proposed bespoke Maker vault will be under the sole control of Maker governance. If the proposal passes, Yearn will follow this vault cycle:  1864\u00d7778 108 KB  Additionally, the team is excited to work on a D3M implementation and will follow the same vault cycle strategy whenever to push forward the initiative.

MIP13c3-SP13: Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults  Proposed by Recognized Delegates @rspa and @twblack88, our newest MIP calls for developing an on-chain monitoring system for RWA Vaults. Summary of context and motivations:  \u201cCurrent RWA monitoring is lagging behind as much as 13 months in the case of New Silver\u201d  After ratifying several RWA-centric MIPs via the Endgame MIP Set, it\u2019s clear that the DAO aims to scale these RWA Vaults to capture \u201csafe\u201d and diversified yield. As such, each step of this process must offer full transparency. Currently, no CU is \u201cexplicitly and directly\u201d responsible for monitoring RWAs, though SF-001 plans to offer a set of viable solutions. The proposal notes that these efforts were conducted as an extension of the team\u2019s current mandate and came attached with considerable extra costs. Summary of Community response: Per @Aes, SF-001 is currently in the process of onboarding to develop and report on existing RWA collateral types.  \u201cGiven MakerDAO\u2019s significant expansion in RWAs and the fact that a majority of protocol income is derived from RWAs, we believe it is critical that these assets are monitored, reported on, and transparency around these assets given the off-chain nature and complexity is provided to the community in a digestible format.\u201d  Rspa believes the desired solution has three tiers: 1. Data Intake Under this system, the DAO requires trusted, capable third-party accountants to monitor cash flow and funnel that data into the middleware infrastructure. 2. Middleware - Infrastructure This middleware would ideally be an oracle. Chainlink\u2019s Proof-of-Reserve is currently being strongly considered barring further community input. 3. Representation  \u201cRepresentation is more than [its] UX.\u201d  Ideally, this data would be curated to enable vault health to be quickly checked while providing granular breakdowns for those wishing to dive further. Last week\u2019s G&R call contained a live discussion on RWA management approaches toward due diligence, maintenance, and monitoring. SF-001 first relays why such a solution is required:  \u201cIf you\u2019re an MKR holder or a metaDAO, you could direct funds to yourself. There\u2019s no law against it; particularly as an MKR holder, there\u2019s no one to stop you. So, this needs to be designed into the system itself to ensure that it\u2019s either very obvious or just not possible when this occurs.\u201d - G&R Ep. 21 (39:38)  Another pressing topic was Oracle\u2019s choice, namely, would Maker Oracles be utilized? Per @nikKunkel, RWA deals currently have no standardized template. Each implementation requires custom tailoring and unique parameters that make the operation too difficult to scale. In response, @rspa offers an interesting solution:  \u201cIn the future, perhaps RWA collateral should be chosen by the ability to monitor it easily. With crypto collateral, we\u2019re pretty choosy. We should apply the same discretion in the real world.\u201d   MIP90: Liquid AAA Strictured Credit & Money Market Fund  Under this MIP, a 600M DAI vault would be opened to acquire USDC via the PSM to purchase diversified AAA \u2013 or equivalent \u2013 investment vehicles.  At the end of each quarter, collected interest would be remitted to the DAO and used to bolster the Surplus Buffer.  Principal proceeds, or the sum of all the funds made available to the issuer, excluding accrued interest, would be reinvested until \u201cliquidation is triggered through governance.\u201d     Calls, Meetings, and Events   Visit: Calls Calendar  Last Week\u2019s Calls   Meet Your Delegate #22 | HKUST EPI Blockchain \u2013 Wednesday, December 14th, 2022   Video / Forum / Platform     Know Your MIP #16 | MIP92: Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn yield \u2013 Wednesday, December 14th, 2022   Video / Forum  Check G&R #218 for an overview of MIP92 by @corn, its author.
