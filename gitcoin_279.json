                    "content": "The DAO has been continuing to work on increasing transparency and context-sharing with our Stewards and wider audience, and it\u2019s been encouraging to see some of the recent high-quality engagement this has been driving! Below is a proposal for a redesign of one of our most important/impactful operation procedures - our budgeting process. This proposal has been discussed extensively internally as well as with some of our most engaged Stewards, but is still very much a work in progress and additional feedback is greatly appreciated. Currently, the DAO uses a quarterly budgeting process as the main way to report to and engage Stewards, plan work for the upcoming Season, and allocate resources for completing this work. Although the existing process has served its function of ensuring workstreams have the resources they need to do their work, it hasn\u2019t been the most effective or transparent way to maximize our accountability to Stewards and ultimately our larger community. In addition to being time-consuming and emotionally-taxing for workstreams, the traditional budgeting process that Gitcoin has been using can have several other pitfalls that lead to deeper, systemic issues:   Inflexibility + short-term thinking: the process encourages workstreams to fixate on delivering on rigid OKRs for the season in order to prove their value during the next budgeting cycle, reducing our ability to sense and respond to changes and opportunities in our environment, or think more long-term/take in the bigger picture.  Weak links to strategy: as each workstream is looking out primarily for their own interests, OKRs consist of targets centered around the functions that this workstream has resources to deliver in the next three months - even if these targets aren\u2019t necessarily the ones most aligned with long-term strategy.  Gaming behaviour: lowballing and sandbagging due to OKR-setting being tied to workstream performance evaluation  Performance-related issues: workstream and contributor performance is tied to suboptimal metrics - the same metrics that are rigid/not tied to strategy/can be gamed etc.  Opaqueness to Stewards outside the organization: With very little context on workstream projects (and little incentive for workstreams to increase context-sharing), Stewards are often left in the dark on the how/why of work completed at the DAO - leaving them to make resource allocation decisions without a complete picture.   Proposal  Modularize the budgeting process and make it more effective by separating resource allocation from forecasting, objective setting, and performance evaluation.  Details  In our current budgeting model, the three processes of resource allocation, strategy and objective setting, and performance evaluation are inextricably intertwined. This makes it very difficult or impossible to optimize for each, due to conflicting goals for these components. By modularizing the budgeting process, we make it much easier to work with and refine each piece. This proposal includes all three components.  Forecasting + Objective Setting  Currently, the DAO doesn\u2019t do any meaningful forecasting - there is often no clear \u201cwhy\u201d for objectives being set. Well-thought-out objectives should be aligned with a unified strategy and have a strong \u201cwhy\u201d that is easy to understand, and in response to market signals. In this redesigned process, we propose (strategic) forecasting and (tactical) objective-setting to be the first part of a three-part process. The process:   Every 3 months, the DAO presents a rolling forecast of the next two seasons (the upcoming season + one more following). This should include forecasted milestones, threats/challenges, changes in market and/or \u201ccompetitors\u201d, and any other major considerations for each of our four essential intents. Note that this is not just an internal roadmap, but also looks outward to define the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the work we\u2019re taking on.  PGF (being the home of our flagship Grants Program) and GPC (being the builders of our Protocols) would be the first to share their forecasts internally, followed by other workstreams, informed by PGF and GPC\u2019s forecasts. These forecasts are then merged into a single forum post (not every workstream) to be made on the governance forum - inviting the community and stewards to provide input on any blind spots or perspectives we may have missed. The purpose of this is to serve as the \u201cwhy\u201d for the work that workstreams will propose in the next step of the process.   Once this post has been on the forum for a minimum of 5 days, after another 5-day working period, workstreams present how they will sense and respond to the presented forecast (with integrations from any steward feedback) + how they sensed and responded to the previous season\u2019s signals ****(a short summary of work that was completed in the past season, with no judgment attached).  The format of the sense and respond proposals is up to the workstreams - workstreams can continue to use OKRs if they prefer (keeping in mind they will not be evaluated on how close to 100% they get to achieving these OKRs), or just a list of objectives/projects based on the forecast + how the workstreams plans to assign resources (contributors) for accomplishing them. Once proposals have been on Discourse for a minimum of five days (and any changes have been integrated + other requirements for proposals such as minimum Steward input are met), these can go to a Snapshot vote for a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d on the workstream\u2019s direction/planning for the season. Additional discussion may continue to happen as the Snapshot proposals are live, however a \u201cno\u201d vote at this stage signals that Stewards disagree with how the workstream has chosen to respond to the forecast and/or how it is assigning resources.    Only after the above activities are completed + discussed with Stewards do we move on to the next step in the process, resource allocation. This ensures that Stewards understand and are aligned on general direction first, before providing additional input on resource allocation.  Resource Allocation  This process is only done every other season (6 months) - the idea is to approve forecasted expenses (mainly contributor compensation) for 6 months at a time rather than every season. In a Resource Allocation season, once the proposals from the Forecasting + Objective Setting step are passed, the DAO presents a single proposal that lists total compensation costs (this is ~ 90% of expenses) + any other forecasted costs such as benefits, tooling and a reserve for GTC price fluctuations for the next six months. In total, this should cover at least 95% of the DAO\u2019s projected costs over the next six months. Workstreams will have discussed how these resources are assigned in the previous step (direction-setting that Stewards will have agreed on), so there should be minimal debate at this step. We propose sending all of this six months\u2019 funding to the CSDO Multisig and having a simplified payment system through Utopia Labs for the entire DAO (most core contributors are already being paid this way). This could help us be more cost-conscious, as well as simplify treasury management practices. Note: For a simplified, shared compensation proposal to make sense, the DAO would need to demonstrate to Stewards that our contributors are being compensated fairly and consistently across all workstreams. The comp-auditing/reporting work that is underway will allow us to back our claims on compensation with market data. For the remaining 5% of costs, such as new hires in the middle of the season (that weren\u2019t forecasted), unexpected infrastructure costs, retreats, etc, we would follow the advice process first internally (at the CSDO and Steward-Council level at a minimum, preferably engaging the wider DAO), and then at the governance forum before requesting a funds proposal on Snapshot. Tying spending to GTC price: As one step in tying our spending to GTC price and protecting our treasury, I propose the 6-month resource allocation to be denominated in GTC, using the spot-price at the time of the proposal + a portion in stables to cover token price fluctuations and protect the GTC treasury. For example if the sum of compensation + other expenses is $5M USD for the 6 months, and GTC is at $2/GTC, the budget amount is 2.5M $GTC + 20% or $1M in stables. This is the maximum in GTC + stables we will pull from the treasury for six months of expenses - if the price of GTC drops further than expected, we would need to pull from our stablecoin reserves instead of spending more GTC for the remainder of the season\u2019s expenses. A Snapshot proposal would be required to send stablecoins from the treasury to the CSDO Multisig, and a \u201cno\u201d vote at this stage would signal that workstreams will need to find ways to further reduce costs and minimize operations to get us through to the next resource allocation. Good treasury management practices for the CSDO Multisig can help us prevent the need to do this, and allow us to better handle market fluctuations - an ideal scenario would be converting a large portion of the 6-month funding to yield-generating stables, so that there is less uncertainty around being able to cover expenses in the short term.  Performance Evaluation  OKRs have not been an effective performance measurement tool for the DAO, and there is a large amount of documentation to show they don\u2019t work as performance evaluation tools in other organizations either. In the existing model, workstreams essentially evaluate their own performance on OKRs that are designed to be unambitious to meet and/or prone to being framed in a way that makes them seem like they were met. This is demonstrated by the fact that 95% of S15 OKRs were marked as completed or on-track to be completed in S16 budgets - for most workstreams, the number is 100%. In the new model, we propose moving accountability to where it should truly live in a DAO:  internally with core contributors across the DAO, and externally, with Stewards.  We\u2019ve received very positive feedback on our \u201cSteward Health Cards\u201d model for evaluating the performance of Stewards, and the idea of \u201cWorkstream Health Cards\u201d has been floated on a number of occasions for accountability in the other direction. This component of the redesigned budgets presents an opportunity to implement Workstream Health Cards. We propose agreeing on a set of 4-5 metrics that are closely tied to core values/principles we aspire to as an organization. Measurement of our alignment with these values will encourage us to continually push towards excellence in achieving them (\u201dwhat gets measured, gets managed\u201d). For the purposes of this proposal, let\u2019s start with the values of Communication/Transparency, Impact, Financial Responsibility, and Alignment/Collaboration, and Leadership. For the Workstream Health Card, each workstream is evaluated internally and externally using a 1-5 Likert rating scale questionnaire for each of the five metrics, at a monthly cadence. A questionnaire that can be used to measure the above metrics: Communication + Transparency  I understand what this workstream has accomplished this month, as well as what\u2019s on the horizon. It\u2019s easy for me to find information on projects this workstream is working on, and/or get in touch with someone for updates.  Impact  All of the work this workstream has completed/worked on this past month has been valuable to the DAO. This past month, this workstream has played an important role in moving the DAO further towards achieving its goals.  Financial Responsibility  I believe that this workstream has used its resources effectively this past month. I believe the value this workstream has delivered this past month justifies the costs to pay its contributors.  Alignment + Collaboration  I can easily see how this workstream\u2019s work in the past month fits within our Purpose and Essential Intents. I can see how this workstream\u2019s work this past month fits in with what other workstreams are focusing on.  Leadership  I trust the leadership of this workstream to steer it in the direction that brings the most value to the DAO. I believe this workstream holds its contributors to high levels of accountability.  Internally, this questionnaire is completed by all core contributors on a monthly basis for other workstreams (for obvious reasons, contributors don\u2019t fill out the questionnaire for their own workstream), during a 1-week evaluation period. Externally, this questionnaire is completed by all Stewards on a monthly basis, during the same 1-week evaluation period. The scores = the average rating received (between 1-5) for each of the components, with a separate Contributor and Steward scores. These are updated on the Workstreams tab on https://www.daostewards.xyz/, or other easy-to-find location. Here is an artistic rendition of what a Workstream Health Card might look like (thankfully we have better designers in the DAO than the author of this proposal):  Screen Shot 2022-12-13 at 11.16.35 PM1868\u00d71210 96.1 KB  Front and Back of Workstream Health Card Advantages of this approach:  This provides a more holistic look at how workstreams are performing, as evaluated by peers and Stewards rather than themselves Much less emotionally-taxing/burdensome for workstreams Doing this at a monthly cadence instead of every 3 months gives workstreams more opportunities to detect shortcomings and course-correct Provides a direct and regular touchpoint between Stewards and workstreams, and incentivizes workstreams to improve context-sharing with Stewards Encourages collaboration, creativity, and long-term thinking as performance-measurement is no longer tied to fixed independent goals, but to the overall value added to the DAO  Note: This proposal only focuses on the workstreams\u2019 performance - for contributor performance we will continue to work with our existing peer review system within workstreams, and an adapted version of this for CSDO member performance.  Assumptions   Stewards are interested in engaging with strategy and goal-setting, and will find it easier to understand costs once they are aligned on direction The additional opportunities for input from stewards will allow us to make better decisions and increase accountability, rather than becoming a distraction or time-sink Strategy/objective-setting, resource allocation, and performance evaluation are a good way to modularize the existing budgeting process to make it more effective We can stay aligned and build towards our goals without a rigid, but thorough, OKR-setting process every season Evaluating workstreams on more generalized \u201cvalues\u201d rather than outputs (existing traffic-light system) will lead to better performance and increased accountability   If successful   Stewards will find it easier to understand the context surrounding the DAO\u2019s work (through the forecast), and be able to make more informed decisions We\u2019ll see higher energy around governance outside of resource allocation debates While it may not reduce the time required to do budgets, it\u2019ll reduce the emotional burden as planning is more fluid, and performance isn\u2019t tied to delivering on fixed outcomes Workstreams will be able to better adapt and respond to market signals rather than fixating on pre-set OKRs We\u2019ll see an increase in collaboration, alignment, and truly cross-stream projects, as workstreams are evaluated on the value they\u2019ve added to the DAO and not just on their own independent projects It\u2019ll become simpler to track workstreams\u2019 performance and improvement over time Accountability will increase, with more regular (monthly) scorecard evaluations We\u2019ll set more ambitious targets instead of ones we\u2019re afraid of missing For future adjustments, it\u2019ll be easier to incrementally fine-tune just specific modules of this process without affecting the entire system   Solarpunk1920\u00d71281 332 KB  The world if this budgeting redesign is successful  Risks   Forecasting is hard to do due to the dynamic nature of the space, and the DAO isn\u2019t practiced in this. If there isn\u2019t clarity/leadership on how to do this well, we might slip back to old habits and keep relying on internal signals for planning instead of responding to external challenges and opportunities. If the assumption that we don\u2019t need rigid workstream-specific OKRs in order to build things proves to be wrong, this could lead to workstreams struggling to find direction without them. This process is longer and proposals will spend more time on the governance forum from start to finish (2-3 weeks in seasons without Resource Allocation, 4-5 weeks in seasons with a new Resource Allocation proposal) - workstreams/Stewards could lose energy to continue participating in these discussions. If the price of GTC falls much more than 20% since the previous Resource Allocation proposal, we\u2019d have to tap into stables through a Snapshot vote that could fail at the governance level, possibly necessitating layoffs and/or other difficult decisions. As with any large change in organizational process, there are risks associated with how this is implemented and communicated, and the adjustment-time needed for contributors to become comfortable with a new way of working   Open Questions and Call to Action As DAO Ops continues to evaluate and make tweaks to all our operational procedures, budgeting being one of the most important, we hope we\u2019ll continue to increase their effectiveness as well as value to our Steward community. The above proposal has been discussed at CSDO internally as well as with some of our most engaged Stewards, but still remains very much an open proposal. We also have a few open questions that would be great to have additional input on:  There has been a request for some Stewards to have fixed DAO/workstream budget caps. If we went down that path, how would these budget caps be decided? Would the cap be a percentage of available treasury? Is it tied to performance? How do we reconcile transparency with the need for efficiency? This budget process is designed to be more transparent and provide better context for Stewards to engage, but is also longer. There have been several calls for greater transparency from the DAO, and the creation of the Steward Council and this budget redesign are some of the ways we are working to resolve these tensions. Is there appetite and capacity from the Steward community to engage in more planning/strategy and performance-evaluation discussions? The DAO is also interested in an alternative (likely post-protocol launch) exploration into shorter budget cycles and thinner workstreams. Is there a way to reconcile this and the composable approach to budgeting described above?  Given this redesign process and our efforts to incorporate the Steward feedback we receive to create a proposal that best enables the DAO to fluorish in an uncertain market, we will likely need to request a \u201cbridge budget\u201d for the DAO to continue operations until a new solution is reached. Your feedback will help us expedite the creation of a new process so we can minimize the period we would need these bridge funds for. We\u2019ll have a much clearer idea of timeline once a final decision has been reached. The budgeting process is a lot more than how we spend our resources - it\u2019s also how we strategize and plan our work, share context with and stay accountable to Stewards and the wider community, and ensure alignment on shared goals - your input on helping us build a process that enables us do all of this more effectively is very appreciated.

The comp-auditing/reporting work that is underway will allow us to back our claims on compensation with market data.   This should be the case anyway - regardless of the budgetary cycle. I would pull this out of the proposal and build it into the ongoing seasonal deliverables for DAOops.  Random side note, I don\u2019t quite get the secrecy around individual DAO compensation.  Actually, I do as I have fought this battle in non-profits as well, but in the US, government organizations publish individual salaries as do many non-profits. Example: https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Efficient-Service-Delivery/City-of-Cincinnati-Employees-w-Salaries/wmj4-ygbf/data Also - given payments are on chain - there is only an illusion of privacy, individual payments are figure-out-able. Net: Just publish the data and let stewards chew on it.  Way faster.  (/end rant)     safder:  Tying spending to GTC price: As one step in tying our spending to GTC price and protecting our treasury, I propose the 6-month resource allocation to be denominated in GTC, using the spot-price at the time of the proposal + a portion in stables to cover token price fluctuations and protect the GTC treasury. For example if the sum of compensation + other expenses is $5M USD for the 6 months, and GTC is at $2/GTC, the budget amount is 2.5M $GTC + 20% or $1M in stables.   I agree professional treasury and financial management is a gap at Gitcoin.  But I do not think this is the place to attempt to professionalize treasury management or building contingency plans for market drops.  It has to be done, but not here. ",

Going deep on one specific part here, I worry about the rhetoric regarding tying spending to GTC price. I know I\u2019m somewhat a heretic with my belief that token price has nothing to do with performance, but I\u2019m becoming increasingly convinced that token price is a terrible indicator for success, especially when the token is a governance token. This tweet from Messari about Yearn\u2019s ATH TVL and ATL token price is something I think about often. In the absence of super strong tokenomics (which we are currently moving quickly towards) there is no reason we should assume token price is currently any indication of success, which I view as an implicit assumption behind this idea you purpose. The most recent pump of $GTC in early November, from my perception, had nothing to do with anything the DAO achieved. I worry that this idea of \u201ctying spend to token price\u201d in the absence of strong tokenomics is a poor idea. I\u2019d propose we consider alternatives. For example, tying spend to revenue generation, or simply holding off on this until we have strong enough tokenomics to assume any price action is the result of something we are or aren\u2019t doing. There is currently a ton of work underway to address the revenue generation and tokenomics pieces, so I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll solidify those pieces in place in the coming months. I might be completely wrong here, and perhaps tying spending to token price at this moment is a good idea. However, I\u2019m personally highly convinced that token price is an enormous distraction, and we should focus on achieving a state where the DAO\u2019s spend is not at all concerned with token price fluctuations, meaning that we either have enough stables to support operations, or better yet we have enough revenue to cover our costs via either strong tokenomics or a successful business model (hopefully soon!).

To fill in the question mark, if there\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d vote to a workstream\u2019s proposal, this signals that Stewards disagree with how the workstream has chosen to respond to the forecast (Stewards don\u2019t think the proposed work would be valuable to the DAO) - this would require redoing the proposal integrating any feedback received. In contrast, what we currently have is a monolith that includes all three of these components as one inseperable block.     shawn16400:  I know this proposal works in concert across the three areas, but I would see value in breaking this into two components: 1) budgeting and 2) performance evaluation. I think \u201cforecasting\u201d is confusing strategic planning / goal / road map development and that is a separate process - which also needs work, but separately.   Super appreciate this feedback - the current version that\u2019s been shared has been through several rounds of editing to get it to be as digestible as possible, but I agree it\u2019s stil quite a mouthful. At this point, now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, would it still be helpful to split this out further into two posts?     shawn16400:  Do these proposed questions integrate with the DAO Health Survey set to launch next week?   It does not - the thinking behind this was that the questions in the monthly review are centered around accountability, whereas the health survey is more around contributor experience. While there is some overlap between these, I think it makes sense to have separate metrics for each. Note that contributors are reviewing other workstreams (not their own), so again the focus is on accountability in both the contributor as well as the steward portion of the reviews.     shawn16400:  Monthly seems a bit heavy for the stewards - I would go with a quarterly assessment, but if you really want monthly data, we can do a continuous batch poll, for example. We could do 1/3 of our 200 stewards each month.   I tend to agree here - I originally had this set to just the Steward Council (as they have a mandate to keep a closer pulse on DAO activities), but received feedback that it could be wiser to leave this more open. The Steward Council would mainly be the ones expected to complete this monthly, while it remains optional for other stewards. It was also designed to be a very light lift, with Stewards only expected to answer 10 questions on a 1-5 scale.     shawn16400:  Part of me likes 6 months, but the overachieving-ambitious part of me (its a small part) wants to move to a jobshop project portfolio design where funding is allocated by project, not by arbitrary timefences. But, might be for later. I like 6.   Yes, there are conversations to move in this direction post-protocol launch (as a heavier restructuring before then might be too large of a disruption). The good thing about this proposal is that in that case, we could easily adjust the resource allocation portion of this process while the other components remain largely the same (or receive minor changes).     shawn16400:  This should be the case anyway - regardless of the budgetary cycle. I would pull this out of the proposal and build it into the ongoing seasonal deliverables for DAOops. Random side note, I don\u2019t quite get the secrecy around individual DAO compensation. Actually, I do as I have fought this battle in non-profits as well, but in the US, government organizations publish individual salaries as do many non-profits.   Again, couldn\u2019t agree more here - I am definitely of the opinion that every DAO that truly aims to be accountable to its community should have fully transparent compensation practices (and many of the best do), but this is a hotly debated topic and the prevailing opinion is to keep these private. As a Steward, I would advocate for demanding greater salary transparency from the DAO, but as a contributor, this feels out of my control (I have voiced this opinion in the spaces I do have access to internally).     shawn16400:  I agree professional treasury and financial management is a gap at Gitcoin. But I do not think this is the place to attempt to professionalize treasury management or building contingency plans for market drops. It has to be done, but not here.   This came out of conversation with some Stewards - the biggest thing Stewards want to see from the DAO in the current market environment is contingency plans in case of another severe market downturn, and incorporating this into our budget feels like the most natural home for this (as this would affect all other aspects).     shawn16400:  Additionally - I think you need to bring this to the Steward Council as a topic and get input from from that council of web3 wizards. It may not be a converging exercise, but if you scope this right, you will get some great input. Next free agenda period is Jan 23 - but we can call a ad-hoc meeting of those with relevant experience to review the topic sooner.   Yes I think an ad-hoc meeting with interested Stewards would be very helpful - especially since I\u2019m planning to be away the week of January 23. I\u2019ve spoken to a couple of Stewards on the council and incorporated their feedback into this proposal already, but would love to get more feedback.     Maxwell:  Going deep on one specific part here, I worry about the rhetoric regarding tying spending to GTC price. I know I\u2019m somewhat a heretic with my belief that token price has nothing to do with performance, but I\u2019m becoming increasingly convinced that token price is a terrible indicator for success, especially when the token is a governance token. This tweet from Messari about Yearn\u2019s ATH TVL and ATL token price is something I think about often.   I 100% agree that token price is very loosely, if at all, tied to performance. I think the reason there is such a strong push to tie our spending to token price however (again, this section was included after a strong push from some highly engaged Stewards) is not because it\u2019s being used as a measure of our performance as a team, but because ultimately what the DAO has to spend is GTC. With ~80% of our treasury consisting of our native GTC token, a sharp drop in token price (for reasons completely unrelated to performance) ultimately means we have significant less funding to work with. This component of the budget process serves as a \u201cbreak in case of emergency\u201d forcing function for us to pause what we\u2019re doing, and consider adjusting priorities in the case that we suddenly have 50% less funding to work with.

If we are polling contributors, the proposal makes sense on a monthly cycle.  If we are polling contributor-stewards, it makes sense.  But it seems a stretch to ask non-contributor-stewards to be able to monthly weigh in on such questions as:  I believe the value this workstream has delivered this past month justifies the costs to pay its contributors. All of the work this workstream has completed/worked on this past month has been valuable to the DAO. I understand what this workstream has accomplished this month, as well as what\u2019s on the horizon.  Please consider the Stewards primary touchpoint is a 1 hour meeting 1x a month and quarterly budget proposals.  Without some other mechanism to provide greater WS visibility to stewards so they can answer the questions in a meaningful way, I think monthly polling will become an annoyance. But, if someone really wants to give it a go, lets try it and see the results after 3 months.

(It\u2019s also overwhelming to try and evaluate it all as a steward.) What I\u2019ve seen work well in Gitcoin/CSDO governance to date is more iterative, smaller moves to test ways of working and then charge forward with them, or scrap them, depending on how each one goes. What I worry is that this whole thing gets passed as a proposal \u2013 and then parts of it ultimately work, but parts of it ultimately don\u2019t, and then it becomes unclear if the process redesign was a success or not. I am wondering if there might be a way to make this proposal more modular/iterative? To me, the forecasting/objective setting \u2192 resource allocation \u2192 performance evaluation metastructure is a no-brainer at the highest level, but I\u2019m not necessarily convinced on some of the specific details within each (mainly because this is all new territory and we just don\u2019t know what\u2019ll work!) so I\u2019m wondering if you guys might start with a bit of a broader proposal on structure and then describe what you\u2019ll test within that structure each cycle, rather than implementing a granularly thought-out process once and for all.

IMO, the design challenge is to have two feedback loops: one for the DAO\u2019s essential intents and strategic objectives; the other for the DAO\u2019s resource allocation across people and projects. These should be assessed independently even though they will often yield highly correlated health metrics / decisions. Keeping them parallel also helps prevent the system from reducing a la Goodhart\u2019s law to: monthly scorecards \u2192 votes of confidence \u2192 resource allocation decisions.

Thank you for acknowledging this point!     shawn16400:  where funding is allocated by project   This is a great idea. It\u2019s so hard to follow the budgeting processes because workstreams are so bloated and they don\u2019t map to the DAOs goals.  This makes it hard to see where the $1 million per month is going, and which outcomes they achieves.  Since oversight is so complicated, this means there is not a lot of accountability to outcomes. @a33titude brings up an important point.    A BULL/BEAR case for Gitcoin/GTC in 2023   There is no competition or market for DAO leadership.  Want an alternative approach to software development? Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with GPC and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to fraud defense? Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with FDD and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to marketing? Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with MMM and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to partnerships? Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with PGF and it\u2019s leadership. Want an alternative approach to DAO Operations? Too bad, you\u2019re stuck with DAO-OPS and it\u2019s leadership.    Gitcoin has modular protocols. But it\u2019s budgeting is not really modular at all!  If funding was more modular and it were tied to outcomes, that\u2019d make it much easier to track what is worth funding and what is not. TLDR I think a sign of a more mature GitcoinDAO would be if there was competition for modular teams creating outcomes. ",

That said, I echo A LOT of the sentiment from other stewards and the community that this proposal \u201cincorporating many different little pieces all into one big proposal to change this super meaty process once & for all\u201d (@annika) is too intense. As demonstrated in the process up until now, incremental changes and improvements tend to work better. A tree does not shoot up all at once. I advise breaking this down into phases that are not only easier to observe and measure but also easier to digest for everyone and rather than correcting a whole organism if it fails, you address the small part that can be improved.

I know this takes a ton of time, and none of us are gifted with enough, and so I recognize that.

The good news & the bad news is that nobody gets forecasting \u2192 budgeting \u2192 accountability quite right afaik. The better an organization is at forecasting - the more deterministic their results are - the closer they are to becoming a slow or no-growth organization.  Variance is the enemy of forecasting.  And yet rapid growth takes an organization that will \u201csense and respond\u201d quickly. That said - driving blind without forecasts is sort of ill-advised for any size org. My other priors include:  I am a steward council member, a part-time contributor to the FDD, and I have helped to found the OpenData Community which FDD Gitcoin founded & continues to support along w/ other orgs  TL;DR -  I support 2/3 of the main modules:  Do add some sort of 1. Forecasting & 2. shift to 6-month budgeting w/ a loose tie to GTC value - I do not currently support 3.  Performance Evaluation shifting to rely upon voting as a means of quantifying feedback for workstreams  Why?  a bunch of reasons - regarding OKRs, while they are imperfect and I definitely fear we are gaming them which is human nature (more on that below) \u2192 I know they are used actively to attempt to nurture self-accountability & team-work & focus by FDD at least. how could we make the OKRs better?  I think the Forecast process or some version of it will help here by providing an external context that is more objective even when setting the OKRs so we don\u2019t see them set too low for eg someone above - I\u2019ll link to it in a minute - made an excellent contribution of suggesting that each workstream have a view into their competitive set & taking an approach of evaluating other approaches to achieve their goals than simply hiring more, working harder, etc; perhaps this could be facilitated by including this competitive / substitute good perspective into the Forecast.  For example each workstream would be responsible as a part of forecasting for maintaining a Porter\u2019s Five Forces or similar view of their competitive set and an explanation of how their approach to achieving the essential intents is superior to alternatives and whether they are going to take a portfolio approach (which is what I believe FDD is doing fwiw by supporting ODC - more than one org structure and \u201cbusiness model\u201d addressing similar goals of fighting Sybils)    One more point on external view - while it isn\u2019t in our essential intents - I do wonder if having as a goal or aspect of our mission helping to grow web3 itself could be useful.  A few folks discussed this briefly on the broad stewards call recently.  How this intersects budgeting is that it could be that we need to reinject some broader vision into our thinking as we appear to approach the goal of turning into a protocol our software and hence wonder whether we are not soon to become a hyperstructure, running on forever with or without all of us  ",

I enjoyed reading it @safder, it was very detailed and thought-through. I think the overall goal of providing a six month cadence for funding makes sense so as to give workstreams a bit more runway in their planning. I also like the idea of using Workstream Health Cards to inform forecasting, which then informs resource allocation. Smaller-scope more frequent check-ins that lead into less frequent, larger scope decision making seem like a smart/standard way of operating. I think a monthly check in might be a bit much for stewards however which is why I love @shawn16400\u2019s idea of maybe checking in with 1/3 of stewards every month on a rotating basis. Overall, I think this proposal is moving in a really great direction but would second the idea of breaking it up further and making it more modular, per @annika and @Pop\u2019s comments. Really exciting to see the thinking around this process evolving in real time! ",

The general theme that I\u2019m hearing is that while folks are aligned on direction, to implement this all at once and fully replace the exisiting budgeting system feels that it\u2019d be risky + hard to change-manage and evaluate. This is very fair - internally we\u2019ve been looking at this for a few months so have had a bit more time to digest the various components, but even so, a more iterative process would also be easier on the team as we continue to remain focused on the upcoming protocol launch. We discussed this during the CSDO strategy meeting earlier today, and the general direction we\u2019re leaning towards is starting to experiment and iterate with the Workstream Health Cards (module 3 of this proposal). This component aims to resolve a number of tensions:  Workstreams essentially evaluating their own performance in the current system Stewards lacking context required to provide meaningful feedback on performance Lack of opportunities for Stewards to actively share feedback other than quarterly budgets (which tend to focus on costs rather than performance) No way to easily track performance changes over time OKRs being designed to be \u201csafe\u201d since they are used to measure performance  We discussed making a few amendments to this module (cadence/subset of Stewards participating etc) over the coming week, before sharing with Stewards during the Feb 1 Steward Council meeting. More will be shared here on the gov forum as this develops! To respond to your concerns on this component @epowell101: this won\u2019t replace OKRs being used to create targets at workstream and individual levels, however performance will not be evaluated against these OKRs (this is a known problem when using OKRs for performance evaluation).     shawn16400:  Have you been able to look to existing approaches to see if there might be solutions that we could fork?   Yes! I shared the research that I conducted during the internal design process - happy to share here too if there\u2019s interest (or DM you with this). I was unable to find anything innovative happening in the web3 DAO budgeting space - all DAOs are using some form of the traditional budgeting process, with changes being in cadence/using tools other than OKRs for planning. I think a lot of DAOs look to Gitcoin for operational best practices. However, there is plenty of innovation in budgets in \u201cweb2\u201d Teal organizations; the framework I took inspiration from for this process is Beyond Budgeting - you can find a lot of high-quality academic research on this framework if you\u2019re interested in deep-diving.

Otherwise, such OKRs can naturally lead to sandbagging and zero-sum behavior. What I\u2019ve done in the past that I think worked is to have a section of OKRs & 360s that was tied to teamwork & taking initiative & other activities that are more about values & collaboration - the very sort of things that sandbagging & zero-sum behavior would cause low scores on.  It isn\u2019t perfect however it highlights the need to acknowledge the risk of errors of omission vs. commission dynamics. TL;DR - I think that we are all looking to reduce the incentive to game the system.  One approach is to have a section of the OKR that is explicitly about not gaming the system. ALSO (added this a little later than the original response fwiw) - this may be conventional wisdom as opposed to a blinding insight - one approach is to tie any bonuses to the achievement of the overall organization as opposed to a particular department or workstream.  For example, what I\u2019ve done in the past is that there is a pool set aside for organizational achievement and then use an algorithm such that everyone\u2019s bonus is graded based on overall organizational achievement AND then VPs have their bonuses based mostly on organizational achievement as opposed to the achievement just of their org.  Those that are in the org / department / workstream are somewhat more closely tied to their org success. There are always tensions as you know @safder - a classic one is MQLs - SQLs - deals - NPS. Speaking of which NPS is sometimes useful as a means to encourage a focus on building superfans and references.  We would build that in as well. ",
