                    "content": "Project Compass: DAO Vision Setting Working Group What? Since February, an initiative has been taking place in the Autonomous DAO working group concerned with establishing and formalizing a process for vision setting, called Project Compass. The priority for this group is NOT to create a vision, but rather to propose a framework for future consensus-seeking on a direction the DAO should be taking. Why? Firstly, with the introduction of Core Units and the increasing decentralization of decision-making in the DAO, a clear need for alignment between various teams and the wider DAO arises. Secondly, limitations in resources will necessarily lead to some objectives being prioritized over others. Lastly, the goal of decentralization, as lofty as it is, should never break the protocol itself. All of those reasons create the need for the DAO to consolidate its thinking into a single vision. In our considerations, we\u2019ve identified three governance groups that should be a part of the vision setting process:  Mandated Actors (and their respective Core Units) On-chain Governance Off-chain Governance  What\u2019s needed for a coherent vision to materialize is then a process of discovery utilizing on-chain and off-chain voting tools to measure the sentiment in all three groups. A resulting mandated vision would serve as the essential foundation for Core Units to base their activities upon, and for Governance to utilize in any subsequent review of these activities. Who? The working group consists of:  @ultraschuppi @amyjung @Anna @Elihu  Updates We\u2019re currently in the process of collecting initial feedback from all three aforementioned governance groups. As the early iterations of the vision setting framework solidify, we\u2019ll make sure to keep the DAO updated. ",

Delivering the best value and experience to customers (vault owners) Ensuring long-term sustainability of the protocol Prioritizing long-term investments and value creation over short-term profitability considerations Build a culture focused on innovation and collaboration, attract, hire, and retain the most versatile and talented DAO members then incentivize them with a MKR allocation. Success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated workforce, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner. Make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case. Measure the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to increase our investment in those that work best.

If this is a good metric we are possibly going in the wrong direction, although the Instant Access Modules have been a huge help. Another metric, and perhaps a better one, is measuring how long time it will take for the system to fall out of use if human involvement stopped altogether. Presently I feel we are somewhere around a year or two on this one, mostly due to rate changes. Is this too much vision? Or too limited? It is at least a nearly universal endorsement of any attempt at automating the Maker system, perhaps even to the extent of accepting limitations. ",

Happy to join in the brainstorm if you guys are interested in discussing where the balance lies.   I second that. Governance minimization. Efficient governance is hard nut to crack, DAOstack kinda failed at it and Aragon is still trying after years of experimentation and dozens of millions of dollars poured into this effort. DAOs tend to have a lot of noise as there are a lot of participants \u2014 that\u2019s the downside of being totally open \u2014 and so far the tools available are not tailored to such use case (to DAO communities). Tools being used are very imperfect: i.e. 1/ this forum that can be hijacked by literally anyone, even anonymous people who may have malicious intentions (whether intentional or not), 2/ the votation system can be hijacked by whales, censoring the less wealthy although maybe more committed contributors (who donate or work full time on the project). I have been going through this DAO forum for only 24h to catch up on everything you guys have been doing so far and I believe you guys have exactly the same challenges we had in previous I have been part of. It\u2019s a good and bad news: it means it is a pattern, nothing unique to your community; but it also means that you may face the same downward spiral that many DAOs have suffered \u2014 talents leaving because of high levels of frustration. MakerDAO community definitely needs to put some work into how to avoid a similar destiny. ",
