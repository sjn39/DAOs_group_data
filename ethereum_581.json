Not sure how useful I can be on the coding side of things, but I\u2019ve spent my life learning how & why people think the way that they do, and how to leverage applied psychology to influence behavior. Looking forward to lurking around here and contributing if/when it\u2019s useful.  ",

I can see an interesting application of your skills in the community: researching how certain transactions are understood to users, particularly if they are accomplished with interacting with physical objects or haptics on mobile devices. This kind of user interaction is not unlike how an audience of a magic act perceives information on cards, objects, or even concepts that are put into motion by the mentalist. Magicians and mentalists are experts in the UX realm! One recent example is using QR codes to transfer value such as in Austin Griffith\u2019s \u201cBurner Wallet\u201d proof of concept.

My educational background is in fine art & design, and I\u2019ve always seen a huge parallel in how magicians go about designing their effects and how designers create websites, apps, posters, or anything else that requires interaction with the user. It\u2019s a connection that very few recognize or appreciate, so it\u2019s awesome to see you recognize it. The only place a magical effect exists is in the minds of the audience. It\u2019s not real, you can\u2019t point to it, but I still get paid good money to make it happen. It\u2019s a meta-product of sorts, and it\u2019s designed from the beginning to the end. Every gesture, word, and interaction is carefully choreographed. I see Ethereum as a the magical substrate that makes a lot of meta-experiences possible, and I\u2019m super stoked about it. ",
