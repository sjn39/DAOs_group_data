                    "content": "1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application ? Nobody and everyone, as 0xBTC is entirely decentralized trustless and neutral, structured exactly like \u2018bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin\u2019 but as an ERC20 smart contract. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. The ideal collateral to back DAI is neutral with no central point of failure and trustless with no IOU, no custodian, no central bank, and non-owned smart contracts with no oracles.  With this in mind, 0xBitcoin is the ideal collateral to back DAI. The 0xBTC smart contract was deployed in Feb 2018 with an initial supply of 0 tokens.   This non-owned contract gave no tokens to the deployer.  Instead, tokens are minted from the contract with a mint() method that rewards new tokens from Proof of Work.  This reward halves every ~4 years to a max supply of 21 million 0xBTC tokens.  The difficulty auto adjusts to target 15 minute reward periods.   There are no oracles used to accomplish either of these tasks and no human has any capability to affect the smart contract in any way.   There is no contract admin and the code can never be changed. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Upon deployment on Feb 6th 2018, information about how to CPU mine for 0xBTC from the smart contract was published to Bitcointalk Forums.   More advanced CPU miners were developed by the community, followed by GPU miners and then mining pools.  Today, three large mining pools and many solo miners are mining for 0xBTC.   Liquidity for the token largely exists on UniswapV3 and on Sushiswap on the Polygon sidechain.   Mercatox exchange has additional liquidity. Since 0xBTC is trustless and neutral with no dependencies, since it works exactly like a new \u2018version\u2019 of Bitcoin but redeployed from genesis as a smart contract, and since its price is non-correlated to ETH, it is the absolute perfect token to use as collateral for DAI.   Since it is relatively new at only 3 years young, the liquidity is relatively small with a total market cap of $6m.   This would have been seen as large when Maker DAO first launched, and this is merely a chicken-before-the-egg type of phenomena. Liquidity can be grown over time, and it will with additional integrations.   Trustlessness and neutrality of an asset can never be grown or changed, so the fact that 0xBTC has better trustlessness and neutrality versus any other asset on the Ethereum Mainnet (Especially compared to USDC and WBTC) makes it extremely desireable as collateral to the Maker DAO basket.  My suggestion is that it be onboarded with a small capacity today, even if only used for a fraction of 1% of the basket of collateral, because it will be paramount and a key asset to the ecosystem fundamentally as liquidity grows.  By Maker DAO adding support, this will help grow liquidity of 0xBTC which will in turn make it a stronger asset which will in turn make Maker DAO stronger and more trustless like symbiotic partners. I strongly strongly encourage reading the smart contract as it explains the entire scope of 0xBTC.  There is no company, team, service, app, or anything else running 0xBTC except the contract. https://0xbitcoin.org/#/ https://etherscan.io/address/0xb6ed7644c69416d67b522e20bc294a9a9b405b31#code   messari.io    Crypto Research, Data, and Tools Gain an edge over the crypto market with professional grade data, tools, and research.      https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xaff587846a44aa086a6555ff69055d3380fd379a  Medium \u2013 14 Jun 21    Fundamentally: The perfect asset to back DAI DAI is intended to be a trustless and neutral form of currency on the Ethereum Mainnet whose price is tied to $1 US.

Why in your opinion is Proof of Work \u2018unethical\u2019?   In my view, energy is consumed in order to create a trustless neutral unstoppable asset.  Since this is impossible to acquire in any other way, there is no waste.   Waste implies there is another way to accomplish the same thing.  For example, we NEED to drive cars so using energy/electricity to do so is not a waste it is consumption.  We NEED proof of work for trustless neutral tokens so we are using energy to do so.  [Would you rather use some instant-central-minted made up token called \u2018JoshuaToken\u2019 for which you started with the entire supply?  Maybe you should use that as collateral for DAI lol that wont need energy .   ] IMO it is your duty to look out for the best fundamental interests of Maker DAO, not to play The Lorax and try to save the environment.  By the way, 0xBTC uses 0.00000000000000000000000001% of the earths energy.   You are being brainwashed by the media, congratulations why dont you look at some data.   I will make a deal with you\u2026 if 0xBTC starts consuming more than 1/1000000 th of humanities energy you can ban it from Maker DAO.  There. No problems. !

It accomplishes this by being the largest token that total mathematically neutral, such that there is no owner, no control, no dependency, and no vulnerabilities.  This is only possible due to the specific way that it is designed and it is impossible to achieve mathematical neutrality in any other way.  Keep researching about Blockchain technology. You have a lot to learn.   And you are CLEARLY not concerned at all about energy use since over 20% of your collateralization is based on IOU of a proof of work coin.

I am unable to tell if this is a joke. As long as BTC exists in the wild, this will never be a reality and custodians will have to exist until the end of time in order to maintain the 1:1 wrap/unwrap functionality that is critical for wrapped BTC to exist as an asset. Speaking of aspects critical to the existence of wBTC, the premise that relinquishing your BTC to a centralized org/custodian (for a fee) makes the wBTC immune to any energy-wasting finger-pointing is a heavily flawed argument If that/the custodian(s) at the center of this did not value the \u2018waste\u2019 and scarcity that comes as a byproduct of said \u2018waste\u2019, wrapping would be impossible, no? Denying consideration of this asset simply on the basis of energy consumption makes no sense\u2026If the value is maintained from BTC<->wBTC, then the energy spent obtaining that value travels with it. The energy overhead added by simply having to maintain a network of custodians ready to wrap/unwrap 24/7 seems like the true waste here. This overhead spent on upkeep is not only wasteful because it is a hack, it is pointlessly siphoning BTC from those wrapping and putting it right into the hands of centralized entities. If your vision did miraculously pan out, how much of a \u2018meme token\u2019 scenario are we looking at if 0.25% of all BTC was now in the hands of the custodians? Paying an entity such as \u2018coinlist\u2019 a whopping 0.25% fee just to be able to use BTC on the ETH Mainnet is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, it is fundamentally a CEX on train tracks. Not only do users have to depend on custodians to give wBTC wrap/unwrap functionality indefinitely, they have to pay them a significant cost. If the fundamental concept of BTC is so attractive that you are willing to take on additional energy/monetary overhead as well as security risks, maybe it should be asked why. Why is there such a concerted effort to preserve the token itself, instead of adopting a future proof native version of BTC that has absolutely no centralized authority keeping it alive? Why the heck would anyone want a custodian holding a disproportionate amount of the total supply of BTC, opening up all sorts of potential for problems? On the flipside, 0xBTC is a native ERC20 - it needs no custodian and there is no central authority that must be depended on - is a form of trustlessly provable value that is immediately redeemable on the ethereum mainnet not what we\u2019re after here? Why are we wasting time and money propping up custodians who get to sit back, wasting energy on hosting and various contract executions, ALL WHILE collecting fees from those who want to get away from centralized authorities in the first place? The only alternative these people have is selling off their BTC\u2026 Wrapped solutions are not robust, certainly not immune to all of the problems that Bitcoin has in the first place, waste more energy because they require overhead to centralize on top of just PoW, and funnel money into the hands of the few. I (respectfully) think you should take some time to research 0xBTC, and reconsider the points you attempted to make in your post. It\u2019s natural that a lack of understanding causes friction, but I believe we will be in a better place once we stop attempting to apply short term solutions to problems that will outlive you and I.
