We are basically moving from a position where a stablecoin is risky collateral to saying that USDC is the same as DAI. This might be okay, but I\u2019m not sure we are working hard on that front. If we move things forward, we might have a consortium (or, not ideally, a regulation) stating what the rules are to be considered money in DeFi. This would encourage some kind of fungibility of Tier 1 stablecoins (which, obviously, exclude USDT). Being in those Tier 1 stablecoins will be a competitive advantage and a moat. I guess this step might happen when a big algorithmic stablecoin will fail (or USDT). The next step would be the introduction of a clearing mechanism between banks (or coin issuers). Each bank, having coins from another bank, will bring those coins to get dollars in exchange. This would require us to open a bank account (most likely a eurodollars bank account) and would impose liquidity constraints on us. But on others as well. Indeed, how fun would that be to bring our half a billion USDC to Circle for cash and see them fail to do the transaction. If we succeed to do that (the DeFi ecosystem as a whole), I don\u2019t think there would be any difference between having DAI/USDC/TUSD, having a $ account in London or NY. This was the prediction of the day. If this is the future, we will have to decide if DAI fits inside this system or outside. ",

My suggestion from a few months ago: Should we print 100M DAI to buy ETH? is just one example. Calling DAI backed by ETH \u201cunbacked\u201d DAI while calling DAI backed by USDC (that cannot be sold for more than $0.99) fully backed is misleading. ",

They are as transparent as an imperial stout. They are both of the same category stablecoin, but different flavours. Just like a dollar and an eurodollar are not the same but no one see much difference. Or a dollar note and a dollar in your bank account. My view is that a stablecoin is no more no less than a privately issued bank note. This doesn\u2019t exist currently in the real world but it did exist during Free Banking eras. And I believe that stablecoin issuers will become real banks. It is a hypothesis that such a consortium will take place, but I think it makes sense.

I agree with the ideas behind this, I\u2019m always a little worried about stablecoin exposure (like most on the forum seem to be) but the PSM makes a big difference and if we have to lean on another stablecoin for a bit while we build our \u201cmoat\u201d USDC is the clear choice. At the end of the day we do want it to be clear that DAI is a better stablecoin, but the team behind USDC and Coinbase\u2019s general clout in the US make it a good initial partner. Ultimately though, I think it makes a lot of sense to have broad base of stablecoin support for the PSM, the biggest challenge will be figuring out how to protect ourselves from a heavily used stablecoin experiencing major theft/fraud and IMO the clear answer is to not be over exposed to any particular stablecoin.

Quite sure that, together, we will find something. To come back on the stablecoin exposure, I think @g_dip (but not sure) proposed that we open a bank account (through a Trust for instance)  Therefore no more stablecoin risk.

This is a key component of Dai\u2019s value proposition and I would never compromise on this front. The collateral that backs Dai is a different story - when considering collateral I firmly believe there is no such thing as actual decentralization, just diversification of risk profiles. Even ETH and BTC, while they may be technically decentralized, rely on liquid secondary markets for the purposes of being Dai collateral. These venues are beholden to regulators and sometimes even to the liquidity of centralized stablecoins, and they could be compromised at any time. Rather than being too focused on how decentralized the collateral portfolio is, I like to focus on its diversification - this is the only real metric that matters at the end of the day. In a dream world, a pro-rata slice of the Dai collateral pool would give the holder a perfect diversification of volatility and counterparty risk. ",

I had been thinking about how USDC in the protocol could be a significant fall back if for some crazy reason DAI price started to fall.   I was thinking about systemic risk events - the big ones that could just screw everything up pretty bad.  Most people tend to ignore these now.  I mean who wants to mess with crypto especially when the big banks and players want to sell it to the masses.  Right?! One thing that has been bugging me lately is a long ago concept of antifragility of these in crypto and the whole cyberpunk approach to societal change.   I honestly don\u2019t think antifragility it is possible since money has to land to transact for necessary goods and that is where the old system steps in with KYC/AML, taxes, transaction tracking etc\u2026  I remember the old days of Bitcoin where value and price growth was measured by how many merchants would take the BTC for \u2018stuff\u2019.   Now I look at this space and wonder the same thing.   Money is only as good as what you can use it for.   I mean even if I get a zillion percent interest on something, and traders think it is worth something If I can\u2019t spend the thing anywhere, for more than 5% of what I need, then what is the point.?   Money is only as good as what I can trade it for, where. I really think the biggest things missing in this space is the crypto bizaar where you literally can buy anything and what 10 years later I feel like I can buy less today with crypto than I could even 5 or 6 years ago.  But hey there are crypto credit cards.  lol Everytime I hear about taxes, and KYC/AML I keep thinking of a UNODC 2011 report that pretty much highlighted how much of a FAIL AML has been indicating a disctintive need for a change.    RegTech Consulting, LLC \u2013 7 Sep 18    UNODC Report 2011 \u2013 The Estimate for Global Money Laundering - RegTech... Many recent reports refer to the total amount of money laundering in the world, with wild and often unsupported estimates. For example, a September 2018 CD Howe research paper titled \u201cHidden Beneficial Ownership and Control: Canada as a Pawn in the... Est. reading time: 5 minutes       I fully expect legislators in the west to grab a hold of these systems with both hands declaring \u2018time for a change\u2019 and it will be full control.    I also have this vague feeling after seeing loan rates continue to decline and a descent into negative rates, for every bank, and every financial instrument, to basically implement negative rates.   Imagine tomorrow you can only redeem your USDC for USD at .999, then .998 etc. etc.  and the USD that lives in any account to be drained.   At some point holding cash will be illegal and rebasing applied to digital versions of cash pretty much the new norm. The trap we are falling into is to make money we are giving up on an idea.  To so radically transform how we conceive of money, how we do business, in such a way as to transform society itself.  It looks less and less likely that this can be done without significant battles in the new system with the old. We keep coming back to the same theme over and over again.  Highlighted to some extent in the classic Matrix Trilogy. Two shorts \u201cWhat is Control?\u201d.            ",

I fully agree with the power of the DAI smart contract. But if most of our collateral value is in G7 jurisdictions and regulation can remove us from most distribution channels, what is the point? I\u2019m all in to defend our values of transparency and freedom inside the next financial system. Not on the fringe of it. And the best way to avoid bad regulation is to preempt it or become too big to change. Another path is to depeg from the dollar (let\u2019s say worldwide CPI as defined in the whitepaper) and launch a new monetary standard. Then regulation is probably less an issue (but there are others). I don\u2019t care much about the path, but we should all be aligned on where we are going. ",

I think the peg to 1 USD will become an impediment to growth over time, and I think a peg to an index that provides for stable purchasing power (i.e inflation-adjusted) would be a good point of differentiation compared to other stablecoins like USDC- although this would make borrowing costs somewhat higher.

Not sure we can succeed to make it mainstream but that would be a Plan B in case of stupid regulation. Better to start early. To go back to the initial subject, I really feel defining \u201cTier 1 $-stablecoin\u201d is important. The whole space would improve a lot if we can define rules to be Tier 1 and not Tier 1 (obviously only if DAI is Tier 1). Quite sure that if we are not at the table \u2026 we will not be Tier 1. Seriously, at the dawn of 2021 USDT is the main stablecoin, this is a joke. We need to check what is the regulation on Eurodollars, I think it\u2019s light (don\u2019t see how the US can regulate Eurodollars in China or Russia). USDC and PAX can have all the US Federal insurance (and regulation) they want and we can still be the big player. But this can\u2019t be the far west (sorry sUSD, ESD and co). ",
