I am from Origin Protocol and we have a product called Dshop. It\u2019s a decentralized platform for storefronts with crypto and fiat payments. It\u2019s integrated with Printful so all order fulfillment, inventory management, and shipping is completely automated. Everything is free and easy to set up. Brave, Kyber, Coinlist, and a bunch of other projects are already using it. I\u2019m @coleman415 on Telegram or coleman@originprotocol.com if you want to reach out directly! ",
