Currently, I am looking for the SHA3-256 (SHA3 FIPS 202, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) hash function on the solidity to develop a new smart contract using this hash function. But, I haven\u2019t found any related information regarding SHA3-256 on the solidity. 1.) SHA3-256 hash function exists on the solidity? 2.) If not, is there any plan to implement the SHA3-256 hash function on the solidity as a method? 3.) If not, anything I can do to use the SHA3-256 has function on the solidity? It would be really helpful if you know the answer to the above questions. Thank you for reading this question. ",

Do you know the Ethereum update schedule? As for next steps, do you have a recommended next step we can take to get this function added? Any advice you may have would be super helpful, as our bridge technology (as it\u2019s currently designed) depends on having this function. ",
