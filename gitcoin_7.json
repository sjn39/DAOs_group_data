Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Sybil Defense   The Anti-Sybil Operational Process is ready to hand off from Blockscience to GitcoinDAO. After 3 workshops to transfer knowledge, the DAO devops group is ready to run the main system which activates sanctions against sybil accounts.   The trust bonus evaluation shows how few of the accounts currently use any of the trust bonus methods. We still feel we can make recommendations for how the weighting of each integration should be updated to more accurately reflect their intended purpose.      Grants Investigation Agency   We received legal approval from the Gitcoin Holdings org for our integration for the Ethelo tool built out to scale our ability to review grants as a community. While we still may use it for the last week of open approvals, we plan to use it again for the flags & disputes later in GR13.   In working with the Ethelo platform, we learned that its design is generalizable to many other uses including our human evaluators in the ML pipeline. It could even be used to review user participation, task creation, task completion, community sentiment among other use cases. We hope to advance discussions on building a lasting partnership with the Ethelo team.   Last day for new grant approvals is Wednesday, March 15th! Get your grants in today!

Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  The FDD Workstream is running a polis discussion to collectively generate thoughts & ideas about budget proposals in GitcoinDAO and would appreciate your feedback. Attend Memepalooza VII this Friday to hang out and create memes with 100+ meme lords!    Meta-Governance:   In Grants 2.0 is how we scale our impact , Owocki shares his thoughts on the future of grants: \u201cTLDR: Grants 1.0 is centralized & therefore has an upper limit to its growth. [\u2026] We can reduce fragility & scale our impact with Grants 2.0 I explore what that world looks like & attempt to build common understanding & consensus about that direction.\u201d   In How do we scale our sensemaking?, Owocki shares the idea that \u201cSensemaking is the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences\u201d and asks \u201cWhat novel sensemaking tools/processes, or sensemaking tools/processes for DAOs, should GitcoinDAO be aware of?\u201d   A world where QF Enhances Every Income by Owocki describes an ambition of GitcoinDAO to have \"QF enhance every income\u201d and how \u201cGrants 2.0 could allow us to exponentially scale Grants because we\u2019re not the ones administering the QF rounds anymore.\u201d   Gitcoin Product Collective - how to map software teams to workstreams by LThrift outlines a strategy for how the \u201cGitcoin Product Collective becomes a meta-workstream that supports holding continuity across highly dependent teams while allowing for smaller, self-organizing groups oriented around deep protocol domains\u201d   The Blue Ocean by Owocki is about how we explore The Internet of Jobs (an uncontested market space or blue ocean) and continue building products that can make Web3 go mainstream.   In Abundance & Scarcity  by Owocki, Kyle replies to share his thoughts on how GitcoinDAO scales through having aspects of being an ImpactDAO (funding public goods), ProtocolDAO (Coordination Party Kit, Grants 2.0), and InvestmentDAO (grant funding leads to early project discovery). Kyle also describes how Gitcoin continues to diversify it\u2019s treasury and that workstream leads \u201care doing double duty, running the DAO and their Workstreams\u201d   In Wartime DAO / Peacetime DAO, Owocki shares insights from the Ben Horowitz essay on the differences between Peacetime CEO & Wartime CEO. He emphasizes the importance of knowing that Peacetime and Wartime have different values and makes a \u201cchallenge [to] the DAO stewards & leaders to be aware of whether they are in wartime or peacetime.\u201d   Why I am Holon Maximalist  by Owocki introduces the idea of Holons as \u201cthe collectivist circles we individuals live in\u201d and goes on to describe how \u201cEach Holon can have a QF round. Maximizing the Holons that have QF is how we win.\u201d   In Can Gitcoin be doing more to support Ethereum Protocol Devs?, Owocki started a discussion where Trent introduces Protocol Guild: a coalition of protocol developers who aim \u201cto provide autonomous tools for recruitment, retention, and reward to the protocol and its maintainers.\u201d   DAO Design Best Practices by Owocki highlights Best Practices advocated by Tracheopteryx and Chase Chapman which include being able to trust that your actions will replicate in the way you expect them (process fidelity), being able to navigate inevitable tensions, and being able to see what\u2019s happening in a DAO (network topography) and step up to help.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview:     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Partnership & Mutual Grant with Wonder     Proof Of Impact      Grants Policy Update: Projects with Tokens     Data Science @ Gitcoin DAO     Treasury Diversification Part II - Welcoming Strategic Partners        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Grants round 13 is in the books! We raised $4.6M for public goods, with $3.2M from matching funds and $1.4M from the community!    Round 13 grantees can expect payouts to be ready to claim on April 15th!     Moonshot Collective    Green Pill Podcast Episode 6 hosted by Owocki is live! Kevin is joined by serial entrepreneur Jordan Hall to talk about how to achieve harmony and sovereignty on a civilizational scale. This is a heavy episode, so strap in!   Every month Moonshot Collective Devs demo their projects for the community. The next demo will be Monday, April 4 at 1 pm MT. Join here, or checkout the video later on MC Youtube.   GTChase and Willsputra have written about how the \u201cMoonshot Collective + Internet of Jobs = \u201d. They highlight how \u201c[w]e are seeing a huge shift of talent coming into Web3 + more of that talent being part time then full time. So the question becomes how do we onboard the continued influx of new talent & part time contributors to full time and meaningful work. \u201c   Paulwalnuts writes about a new Product Idea and makes the case for why the moonshot collective should \u201cCreate a permissionless and possibly decentralized rapid testing platform for DAOs to more easily test their prototypes and designs.\u201d     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    We completed a review of the Trust Bonus system used to increase funder\u2019s matching percentage and found that the majority of users do not verify at all   We closed all GR13 grants disputes and are super grateful to our contributors (special shoutout to Zer8)   We are running a polis discussion to collectively generate thoughts & ideas about budget proposals in Gitcoin DAO and need your feedback!   Thank you to FDD\u2019s very own Octopus for making this great video where he shares his thoughts on the purpose of FDD and how it works     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Memepalooza 7 will be hosted in Discord on the OG meme day of the year: April 1st. This month we are inviting our frens from 1Hive as well, come join us! During the last Memepalooza we started a new initiative to highlight artists in our ecosystem and this month we are excited to feature Gitcoin\u2019s very own Colton Orr!   We are testing Matomo as our web analytics tool instead of Google Analytics after engaging with our community about data privacy.   The RadicalxChange Voice event regarding how we will structure and evolve the MMM Workstream going into Season 14 has been concluded! The participation from our contributors was great, check out the result deck to learn more. Shout out to @erich and @anoanoano for helping facilitate the experiment!   Seanmac created a post which discusses the lack of Product Marketing at Gitcoin and advises that \u201cAs we enter Season 14 budget planning, we should think strongly about investing in product marketing.\u201d     DAO Operations    We are initiating a project to improve our governance forum and request your feedback in this 4-minute survey.   Our accounting team is diversifying FDD and DAO Ops treasuries and seizing opportunities to swap into stablecoins. We have also sent reimbursements to FDD members for EthDenver and are sending DAO Ops members reimbursements by the end of the month.   We are engaging with our Steward Council by defining a structure for calls, discussing foundation bylaws, and voting fee reimbursements.     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET on Discord!

The proposal detailed in the thread has been ratified by the CSDO group, with representatives from each workstream, and establishes a shared infrastructure and processes to follow going forward.   Gitcoin Aqueduct posted by Dave and co-authored by Owocki is a paper which introduces the \u201ca tool that incentivizes ecosystem development for your project with a single line of Solidity.\u201d The tool is aimed to reduce the \u201cfriction involved with starting a protocol while providing opportunities for developers to make a living contributing to open source\u201d.

Moonshot Collective   It\u2019s all coordination \u2014 always had been. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building the Coordination.Party Toolkit. Each decentralized Toolkit app helps DAOs recruit, recognize, reward, or retain contributors. For example Recuriter.Party is a decentralized LinkedIn where job seekers get paid when recruiters access their profile. And Pay.Party allows teams to allocate a budget in a democratic way. We\u2019re building coordination tools for GitcoinDAO and beyond. Keep track of our weekly progress here.    Decentralize Gitcoin    Payouts for dGrants Gitcoin Building Gitcoin Grant Round have been issued.   Research for dGrants protocol V1 proposal is in progress, the research include:  Smart contract upgradability Grant creation flow considerations Curation approaches Grant Metadata management    DevOps has been working with teams to identify some additional needs, to ensure calendars are regularly synced and help with the build process of GitBook together with MMM.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    We are updating the FDD Operating System, including:  Making sure contributors understand the How, What, When, and Why of getting paid Ensuring FDD delivery of mandate via proper success metrics for sybil, grants, and research Proper access control for all documentation and project management Contributors know which meetings to attend, where information and conversation are being held and proper review cadence A clear system for making decisions and adding contributors    Q1 Outcomes for Sybil Defense are:  GitcoinDAO runs the ASOP end-to-end. Blockscience scope reduced and redirected. Alignment on a single high-quality codebase and single source of truth for documentation Clearly define the data needing access control vs what can be opened up A basic app for human evaluations is built, used, and analyzed after the round Gain commitments and requirements for participation in a Sybil Detection data storage      Merch, Memes & Marketing    We hosted the 5th iteration of Memepalooza last Friday in Discord with over 40 attendees and lots of great memes. We scored a 9.2/10 on overall satisfaction with the event and 66% of respondents said 10/10 they would come back. We also discovered some new bugs of Memes.party which are being worked on.   Three design bounties have been listed in the Schelling Point Hackathon, which begins on Jan 20. Are you interested in creating some awesome Reaction stickers, GR13 POAPs or DAO Governance POAPs? There\u2019s 1000DAI up for grabs for each of these, check them out!   Memes.party and Steward Report Cards have both received optimizations and improvements during the week as a step closer to their respective v2.0 launch later this quarter.   We\u2019re always interested in assisting with other groups and initiatives within GitcoinDAO. Please utilize our Request form and let us know if you\u2019re looking for support or collaboration!

We create value before we capture value. We build ecosystems.\u201d   The Donut Economy x 8 Forms of Capital by Owocki talks about the \u201cworld I want to see created by regen web3, using two frameworks which I discovered during research into GREENPILLED - how crypto can regenerative the world.\u201d \u201cIf Gitcoin is a generator function of innovation, this post is a taxonomy of what I think the DAO could point its innovation machine at.\u201d   Our Flagship Product is GitcoinDAO by Owocki argues that our flagship product is actually GitcoinDAO, as opposed to Gitcoin Grants as \u201cGitcoinDAO is the totality of what we do and how we show up. Gitcoin Grants is just one part.\u201d   Data Science @ GitcoinDAO by Owocki raises the question \u201cWhat should the data science practice at Gitcoin look like?\u201d The thread describes four areas of interest; Product Analytics & Data Science, Marketing Analytics & Data Science, Complex Systems Insights and Fraud insights.   Dan provided an update on the Treasury Diversification Working Group.

Our partners think so too. We\u2019re partnering with:   Crypto, Culture, and Society (a learning DAO studying the impact of crypto on culture and society) are kicking off Season Two! Gitcoin will be playing a key role in helping build a liberal arts education for crypto   DeveloperDAO is bringing tons of amazing coders into the space to help us build new types of public goods   DreamDAO is continuing to help push forward the solarpunk + regen narrative to show the optimistic futures we can create together   Verses (a collective of writers, researchers, technologists) who have some of the best writing in the ecosystem about what it means to be a pluriverse.       Moonshot Collective    The Moonshot Collective Season 13 budget request has passed on chain as is queued for execution.

Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!    Key actions for this week:  Vote on the Gitcoin DAO - Workstream Accountability Flow Ratification  Make sure to claim your GitcoinDAO Contributor 2021 POAP!    Meta-Governance    Elliot from Llama posted an update to the Gitcoin Financial Reporting for December 2021. The statements are split into transactions denoted in GTC and in stablecoins.   GD Steward Roles & Responsibilities by Simona starts a conversation on the roles and responsibilities of our Stewards in GitcoinDAO. \u201cStewards are in charge of listening to their constituents, evaluating and voting on proposals. (\u2026) They are the protectors of the legitimacy of the DAO, they are responsible for keeping the DAO on track to accomplish its mission, and they are final enforcers of responsibility for everyone working on the GitcoinDAO\u2019s mission\".   We\u2019ve seen a lot of great feedback for the foreword of his upcoming Regen CryptoEconomics book by Owocki. Check out some of the suggestions from Diego, Kyle, and Scott on how GitcoinDAO should be represented!   IRLart is asking for feedback on the beneficiary of the Gitcoin / Solar Punk Auction that will be hosted at ETHDenver. \u201cIt could go directly to the Gitcoin DAO multisig, but I thought it would be a great gesture of regenerative crypto economics to streamline it to the metaverse coordinators working group to continue elevating their efforts.\u201d     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Gitcoin Treasury Diversification Gitcoin DAO - Workstream Accountability Flow Ratification Gitcoin DAO - Workstream Accountability Flow   Introducing the Steward Forum  Developer DAO Partnership   2/17 ETH DENVER event  Public Goods Funding workstream budget      Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Annika and the Public Goods workstream are seeking community input on how we can improve the structure for the upcoming GR13 taking place from March 9-14 this year. \u201cAs we continue on the path of decentralizing Grants Ops from Holdings into the DAO, we want to build the habit of bringing the community in much earlier in the process to provide their input on what they want to see with respect to the matching pool, rather than having a Holdings-proposed structure that stewards simply vote on.\u201d    Moonshot Collective    Heading out to ETHDenver in February? Our Moonshot Collective devs will be speaking at various points throughout the conference, and we\u2019ll be hosting Schelling Point on Feb 17 where we\u2019ll debut \u201cGreenpilled\u201d, Owocki\u2019s Regen CryptoEconomics book. Stay tuned for more details.   Every week Moonshot Collective devs try out the apps they\u2019ve been working on. We call it dogfooding, and our dogfood tastes good! Check out the project videos on our YouTube here.     Decentralize Gitcoin    We\u2019ve published the data used to execute payouts on the governance forum as a final step in completing the payouts for the Gitcoin Building Gitcoin round that was run in GR12. Community members can now run through the verification process themselves! Currently, this process is lightly documented and requires strong technical expertise, but we are working on making this more user-friendly in the future.   Research on the various areas that will feed into the final design of the dGrants V1 Protocol is moving forward. The areas mentioned in our last update currently consist of Smart Contract Upgradability, Grant Creation Flow, Curation Approaches, and Grant Metadata Management. We are taking the learnings from the last two rounds as well as customer/user use cases to improve and designing a robust protocol accordingly.   It is clear that a multi-chain implementation of dGrants is a must, so we are working hard to ensure that we can take the V1 solution and deploy it across any EVM compatible network. This will allow us to build a single cohesive ecosystem on top of each of these Grant Registry deployments.   The DevOps team has created a request portal for the GitcoinDAO, making submitting requests significantly easier and more trackable.   Next week, we will be proposing rolling out DAO wide standards around required 2FA and the use of password managers.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)   FDD will host a meeting with their multisig oversight group on Friday to review Q4 deliverables and Q1 budget proposal.    Merch, Memes & Marketing    We\u2019ve listed 4 bounties (1, 2, 3, 4) in the Gitcoin Schelling Point hackathon leading up to ETHDenver! The bounties are worth over 3000 DAI in total, so make sure to check them out!   We\u2019ve sent across the Regen vs Degen card game to the production company. Over a hundred decks have been ordered in the first batch that will be given out to attendees of Schelling Point in February. Make sure to keep an eye out for hidden easter eggs!   Check out the MMM Workstream objectives and key results for Q1 that was recently posted on the forum by Sean. Our budget request is being worked on and more details on this will be shared soon.   Make sure to claim your very own GitcoinDAO Contributor 2021 POAP if you contributed to any of the Workstreams last year!     Upcoming community events    Ever seen conflicts in DAOs & wondered how to handle them in a non-hierarchical way? Stay tuned for an event on Conflict Resolution, where you can hear from several trained facilitators. The event will be February 8th at 3pm ET, joining details will be sent out next week!   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET in Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement and we would love for you to join us.

Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    This week began a series of workshops to teach 3 DAO contributors to run the Anti-Sybil Operational Process so the DAO can take over work previously done by Blockscience.   An app was built for human evaluations of Sybil accounts allowing us to better protect the process from vulnerabilities and allow us to improve on inter-reviewer reliability.   The Grant Review Team is going to the backup plan of scaling grants reviews as the Gitcoin Holdings team needs more time to assess legal implications of integrating data to our GIA software built for this purpose.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Memepalooza 6 is happening this Friday. For the first time, we will be partnering with another DAO to host the event, this time welcoming our friends at DeveloperDAO to meme about all things web3 and public goods. We are also continuing our artist spotlight series, featuring MMM Contributor Nanopunk\u2019s artwork and giving away some NFTs during the event.   Check out our blog post on the collaboration with Tally, utilizing Gitcoin Aqueduct to automate the funding of public goods and the building of Tally\u2019s community-owned ecosystem.   Gitcoin GR13 is just around the corner, a new Grants Verification Score has been implemented to help eliminate bad actors and ensure that funding is more proportionately matched to trusted contributors.

The response by Glen Weyl to Owocki\u2019s \u201cA Vision for A Pluralistic Civilizational Scale Infrastructure for funding Public Goods\u201d thread sparked a rousing discussion on quadratic funding, with interesting points made by nollied and Ben.   Scaling Funding for Blockchain-era Public Goods by Owocki provides some context behind barriers to high throughput public goods funding. \u201cFunding distribution mechanisms & funding sources are two sides of the same coin. They need to grow together, and not grow too far out of balance with one another.\u201d     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     dCompass Season 13 budget request DAO Operations Workstream Budget - Q1 2022    Gitcoin Treasury Diversification     Introducing the Steward Council     2/17 ETH DENVER event        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding   No updates for the week!

You can think of these as \u201cWhat would be true if FDD is successful over the next 90 days\u201d.   Treasury management netted us $75k in gains. The stream will end up with $30k extra after using a portion of the gains to kickstart the FDD OS, increasing the number of human evaluations, and beginning work on a red team simulation software similar to cadCAD.

Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  Vote on the proposal to Ratify Grants Round 13 results! The FDD Workstream is running a polis discussion about budget proposals in GitcoinDAO and would appreciate your participation.  Submit your unconference session proposal for Schelling Point @ EthAmsterdam by 4/10!  Owocki started an AMA that will run for the month of April! Jump in to ask any questions you have.    Meta-Governance:   [Proposal] Ratify the Results of Grants Round 13 and Formally Request the Community Multisig Holders to Payout Matching Allocations by Annika is a request for Stewards to ratify the results and payouts for Grants Round 13. \u201cOver $4.6M will be distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.2M came from the combined matching pools and $1.4M was contributed by the community.\u201d Expected payouts are going to be sent on April 15th.   Huxwell provides an update on dCompass which shows how adventurers can complete quizzes to receive rewards and quest creators can configure how the rewards are delivered. A staging app on testnet to test the first quests is set to go live this week.   Owocki shares Lessons about Impact Networks from the book \u201cImpact Networks\u201d by D Ehrlihman. Impact Networks are \u201clike DAOs but without tokens\u201d and \u201c[relationships] between network participants is the core basis of trust that allows for antifragility of the network.\u201d   Get a special sneak preview of the Future History of the Open Internet Book, and The ImpactDAO Poster/Book from Owocki! You can also see the physical copies (and maybe grab one) at Schelling Point Amsterdam.   In Hype Cycles - a tool for sensemaking, Owocki drills down into five phases of emerging technology lifecycles: Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations, Trough of Disillusionment, Slope of Enlightenment, & Plateau of Productivity.   In The Plateau of Productivity , Owocki continues the discussion about Garner Hype Cycles by contextualizing them using the history of Gitcoin Grants. In 2022, with a DAO standing up and Grants 2.0 on its way, \u201cwe are further along in the trough of disillusionment, but the plateau of productivity is perhaps in sight.\u201d   Simona Pop shares a timeline for workstreams to share their Season 14 Budgets. Workstream leads are expected to share their budget request on the forum by April 28th.   The treasury diversification working group let us know that they had calls with potential lead partners and welcomes you to send your recommendations for strategic partners.   In An Evolutionary Lens on Web3/Open Source Software , Owocki discusses the key properties that allowed Linux to evolve and how Web3 can learn from this. This thread highlights how Web3 technology has already had a spectacular evolution, partly because it adds global coordination and incentivisation layers to what makes OSS work.

Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Joe delivers the GR13 Governance Brief which outlines the FDD workstreams efforts to improve Sybil Defense, Grants Review, and Data Access. Sybil Defense makes use of Humans-In-The-Loop (HITL) machine-learning and in round 13 delivered a 100% increase in the number of human evaluations with a 300% decrease in cost. Grants Reviews were conducted by the new Grants Intelligence Agency (GIA) which had to use a \u201cplan B\u201d system in lieu of the data access they needed to use a newly developed tool. The GIA also conducted a review of Grants Eligibility Policy following the BrightID case.   We are working on an analysis of \u201cairdrop farming\u201d a type of collusion behavior we found certain grants and users to be propagating during round 13.
