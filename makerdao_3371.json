                    "content": " Overview The Oracle and Smart Contracts Domain Teams have reviewed the preliminary ABDK audit results for the Uniswap V2 LP Oracle contract. No critical or high priority issues were found that would have adverse effects on any of the LP tokens that the Maker Protocol currently supports. The Smart Contract / Oracle Domain Teams are making the appropriate fixes in the Oracle contract and will resubmit the result to ABDK to compile a final version of the audit report that will be published. Subsequently, the current instances of the Uniswap V2 LP Oracles will be replaced with the updated version. In the meantime, now that we\u2019ve confirmed the Oracle contracts are safe, the community can consider raising the debt ceilings for one or more of the LP tokens. It should be noted that Aave launched support for LP tokens today and will likely eat away at our marketshare without us raising the debt ceilings of LP tokens. The primary counterpoint to raising debt ceilings is that there is liquidation risk for LP tokens. There is no significant primary liquidity for LP tokens. While we do see some participation in liquidation auctions for LP tokens, there is no guarantee that all keepers have updated their setups to support LP tokens. After discussions with the Mandated Actors including the Risk Domain Team we feel that the liquidation risk is worth the upside of competing for LP token marketshare and are recommending the following changes.  Changes: Increase UNIV2USDCETH-A debt ceiling to 20% of pool liquidity => 50M Increase UNIV2DAIETH-A debt ceiling to 20% of pool liquidity => 30M Increase UNIV2DAIUSDC-A debt ceiling to $50M Add DC-IAM to UNIV2USDCETH-A (final params pending, 10% of DC w/ 12 hour gap) Add DC-IAM to UNIV2DAIETH-A (final params pending, 10% of DC w/ 12 hour gap) Add DC-IAM to UNIV2DAIUSDC-A (final params pending, 10% of DC w/ 12 hour gap) It should be noted that the DAI-USDC pair has none of the aforementioned liquidation risk due to the DAI and USDC Oracles being fixed to $1.  Reasoning USDC-ETH and DAI-ETH were selected because of their high liquidity, significant LP fees, as well as proven demand within the Maker Protocol evidence by their debt ceilings being fully utilized. This bodes well for their potential to generate significant amounts of Dai. DAI-USDC is more of an experiment. It has low LP fees (5.3%) which will likely decrease as liquidity is added to the pool. However, there is potential that once a critical threshold of liquidity is reached that new trades begin to route through the DAI-USDC pair, increasing volume, and ultimately LP yield. It is relatively safe to jack up the debt ceiling to 50M relative to the current $24M in the liquidity pool due to liquidations being turned off. Please vote on ALL options you would support in an onchain-poll.

However I am wondering to what extent that will be constrained by total pool liquidity. If there is a fixed % will that change if Liq2.0 proves effective?
