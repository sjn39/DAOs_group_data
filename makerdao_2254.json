                    "content": "Summary MakerDAO\u2019s co-founder has published his End Game plan for Maker\u2019s future that includes annual dilution of MKR, builds another complex governance bureaucracy in the form of CVCs, and large spending on environmental activism and subsidies for private companies not owned by the DAO. GFX, as one of the largest delegates at Maker, is seeking support for a different vision - one where Maker invests in finding new markets and uses for its core product, DAI. A slimmer, more focused Maker would already boast impressive profits. Bringing DAI to new chains and new lending markets creates a powerful potential for growth. But to get to that bright future, GFX needs your help as a MKR holder. Refocus on Products, Growth, and Core Competencies One of the key shortcomings of End Game is its inward focus and dramatic increase in bureaucratic complexity. Maker today is not perfect, but the focus of the DAO should be on growing market share, pioneering new markets, and a return to the core mission of creating an unbiased, permissionless currency. We propose this plan as the first step in refocusing MakerDAO on its core principles, and re-engaging with the greater DeFi ecosystem. DAI Stability MakerDAO\u2019s first priority should always be ensuring the price stability and security of the DAI stablecoin. Its second priority should be to encourage responsible growth in the supply of DAI and its adoption. DAI\u2019s fixed exchange rate is paramount to its proposition as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Similar to a foreign central bank that enforces an exchange rate to the dollar through the open market, Maker provides permissionless arbitrage facilities that backstop secondary market liquidity. This means the USDC Peg Stability Module needs to always hold \u2013 or within minutes be able to access \u2013 USDC to maintain DAI\u2019s stable value in real time. Under the End Game plan being put forward by Maker\u2019s co-founder, the value of DAI would be eligible for devaluation below a $1 target, either as a planned measure under the End Game\u2019s \u201cEagle Stance\u201d and \u201cPhoenix Stance\u201d or as an unplanned mitigation to prevent total loss by MKR holders, whose responsibility is to manage the protocol. This devaluation is seen as a way to punish DAI holders to force the supply to shrink to a level that can be supported solely by decentralized collateral. We feel Maker has neglected \u2013 and needs to return to \u2013 its core mission of creating \u201ca stable, decentralized currency\u201d where users are protected from censorship not only from irresponsible governments, but also from irresponsible governance. Driving Growth in DAI Along with reaffirming DAI\u2019s price stability as one of its key value propositions, MakerDAO needs to return to seeking use cases and integrations for DAI. Practically speaking, this means partnering with protocols and marketplaces where DAI can be used. One example familiar to this community would be Aave, where users can borrow or lend DAI in short-term, on-chain debt markets. Another would be Centrifuge, where users invest in private credit using DAI. Because currencies benefit from scale and network effects, Maker needs to re-prioritize its strategy to grow DAI usage and reach. Where End Game does not seriously focus on how to grow DAI, we feel there are still avenues for DAI growth in the DeFi ecosystem. DAI lives on chain, so DAI growth must occur on chain. On Ethereum, Maker already has a mature market share of the largest collaterals. Growth must come from expanding the use of DAI Direct Deposit Modules (D3Ms) to a larger number of qualified intermediaries, whose receipt tokens (such as aDAI) are considered to be reliably redeemable for DAI. These should both be numerous and start small, with regular increases over the course of a year or more. In this way, other protocols can handle \u201clast-mile delivery\u201d of DAI into the broader economy, which Maker is not well equipped for. Maker already relies on third-party front ends, has relatively weak branding as a borrowing market for small users, and cannot easily offer cross-collateralized lending against multiple assets. Maker\u2019s high fixed economic costs for supporting an asset as collateral also makes it a poor destination for borrowers not using the most ubiquitous collaterals like ETH and staked ETH. An expanding family of smaller, conservatively capped D3Ms to protocols such as Yearn, Element, Notional, Euler, Yield, and many others would provide material increases in Maker\u2019s revenues while increasing DAI\u2019s footprint in lending markets where Maker does not hold a competitive advantage. Diversification, prudent experimentation, and conservative risk management are key. Just as the Federal Reserve does not lend directly to US borrowers, Maker does not need to directly pursue riskier long-tail collaterals and more litigious retail participants. The Maker Foundation wisely spun out front-ends such as Oasis and other retail touchpoints after experiencing litigation in the previous market cycle. This has proven again to be wise, with Oasis being subjected to court orders to intervene to seize collateral. Maker should clearly be seen as a software, and not responsible for users\u2019 behavior in the way that a front end, like the proposed Spark Protocol, might be. Outside of Ethereum, Maker\u2019s Protocol Engineering Core Unit has been working diligently on Maker Teleport, which will soon allow for native bridging at scale to Optimism, Arbitrum, and StarkNet. This opens the possibility of Maker vaults and D3Ms on those chains. Teleport represents a large commitment of development resources and a supplemental strategy of partnering with a variety of existing bridge infrastructure providers would allow Maker to \u201ctest the waters\u201d on any and all new chains. This should be done through a public, competitive process guided by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. Where DAI finds market fit and establishes share, then Teleport can be expanded to allow for large scale DAI flows. The use of a more aggressive multi-chain strategy and D3Ms allows DAI to reach further into the on-chain total addressable market. Real World Assets (RWAs) It is no secret that Maker\u2019s RWA program has had a rough road to travel to get to its current state. Many mistakes have been made and lessons learned. It is time to apply those lessons. Maker is ill-suited to bespoke, exotic transactions. Given the lack of a registered entity to encompass MakerDAO, the exercise of creditor rights is untested. A lack of staff internal to the DAO to adequately diligence, structure, and monitor deals on both a legal and credit basis has led to the passage of proposals that were incomplete, not fully understood, or simply difficult to monitor on an ongoing basis. Fortunately, the vast majority of legacy RWAs are not of a size that could endanger the protocol even in the event of a total loss. Because of this, Maker should continue to maintain these early, pioneer RWAs for the foreseeable future. Moving forward, however, MakerDAO should limit its RWA exposure only to assets that are easily monitored by the general public, and scalable through direct purchase. They should serve the purpose as diversification away from USDC, and not for the purpose of asset management in its own right. The publicly traded debt markets \u2013 particularly US government securities, directly held \u2013 are an area where Maker can deploy nearly unlimited capital without affecting returns or having to innovate exotic, bespoke legal structures for every deal. A simple holding company can be established, lent to through the protocol, and siloed in a favorable jurisdiction for tax and compliance purposes. There is no need to lend to external third parties to gain exposure. A steady stream of term debt instruments also ensures a flow of dollars-to-DAI demand that can be forecast into the future, which should also be beneficial to the long-term stability the DAI peg. Ultimately, any foray into RWA yield-bearing securities should be viewed as a complement and not a substitute for Maker\u2019s primary expertise - on-chain DAI generation and risk management. Maker as Software, Not Asset Manager The overarching theme of this strategy is for Maker to return to its core competencies - creating permissionless software that allows users to generate and use DAI. MakerDAO has no competitive advantage in underwriting private credit or any other esoteric or complex financial instrument. Perhaps someday in the future it will, but for now, that is simply outside the DAO\u2019s circle of competence, and better suited to platforms (such as Compound, Notional, or Gnosis) building on top of the Maker protocol\u2019s stablecoin. Maker does excel, however, at evaluating and managing on-chain risk and on-chain assets. This includes both directly offering vaults on an asset and devolving credit management of long-tail assets to external protocols like Aave or Compound, where exposure to those long-tail assets are effectively cross collateralized. Within the Maker protocol itself, this kind of \u201cportfolio\u201d backing is not available, and MakerDAO also has high costs to monitor and manage parameters related to smaller market cap assets. Returning to Maker\u2019s original promise of value creation provides a way for Maker to scale the protocol on chain. Maker should exit the business of picking winners and losers of complex financial and legal arrangements. To the extent that Maker continues to be over-reserved in stablecoins, those stablecoins should remit yield to Maker, or else exposure managed by drawing down those reserves for liquid, high-quality public bonds that return all net interest income back to the Surplus Buffer in DAI. Existing Partnerships & Workforce Existing partnerships with RWA providers and stablecoins should continue to be evaluated on a regular basis, but we do not see benefit in automatically offboarding any of them as a result of strategically pivoting back to Maker\u2019s core competencies. By returning to a reduced scope, there may be less need for a large, salaried workforce. Every effort will be made to find productive uses for existing contributors and core units, but to the extent that the workforce is too large, those contributors should be given a winding down period, financial relief packages, and letters of recommendation. MKR as a Deflationary Asset Core to the value proposition of the Maker protocol\u2019s governance has been the deflationary nature of the MKR token. Using excess DAI to buy back and then burn MKR tokens has become so synonymous with MakerDAO that the most popular dashboard for Maker is makerburn.com. The End Game approach is to inflate the amount of MKR in an attempt to punish existing MKR holders that do not actively participate in governance. While we share Rune\u2019s frustration at the lack of participation by some MKR holders, Maker has managed to become one of the few cash flow positive protocols in DeFi, and it has done so without net emissions. MKR is ultimately a governance token, and for large holders, its value is derived from its influence over the protocol. But for smaller holders in the short term, and for all holders in the long term, the protocol acting as the end buyer for MKR tokens is a simple, powerful, narrative. It has the benefit of being easy to understand, difficult to game, and trivial to track the progress of MKR burning. The role of traditional MKR tokenomics should be reaffirmed \u2013 where MKR dilution occurs in the event of insolvency, and MKR deflation occurs in the event of excess protocol DAI accumulation. Vote No on the MIP101: Maker Constitution. MIP101 and the MIPs bundled with it, irrevocably lock MakerDAO into the End Game plan. It is imperative that those MIPs not be approved by governance. GFX Labs will take the lead in authoring any required proposals to refocus Maker after rejecting the End Game plan. We invite members of the workforce and holders of MKR to collaborate to draft the required proposals so that there can be a broad base of support. We also invite stakeholders with other priorities that are complementary to the strategic plan above to contact us to find ways to include them. We would like to thank those contributors and MKR holders who provided feedback on early drafts of this plan. ",

Couple of points from us:  DAI stability should absolutely be first priority but it is important to navigate tradeoff of taking on too much centralised collateral (e.g. 70% USDC backing was a major point of failure during recent SVB crash, with almost 1:1 USDC correlation) We should also acknowledge that RWAs bring in substantial revenue beside their role in collateral diversification. These will likely continue to exceed on-chain revenue opportunities. Refocusing on liquid, low-risk instruments like US treasuries seems to strike the right balance in terms limiting off-chain risk while providing diversification + continued yield generation opps. There can then be a smaller allocation for riskier, more exotic deals. One other important point against Endgame in our view is the cognitive load that comes with managing complex organisational structures. MetaDAOs / clusters + related tokenomics risk being overengineere, which detracts from useful coordination. We fully support a \u201cback to basics\u201d approach to DAO management which focuses on process and people rather than token incentives.  ",

It can be considered that US government securities, including treasury notes, bills, bonds, HAVE proven to be mostly reliable RWA, but this does not, in turn, mean that they WILL prove to be reliable long term assets. The point of financial investment in MakerDAO should be financial resilience before financial gain itself. This is because the mobility and security (including price security, since there is no difference between suffering total price destruction and physically losing your private keys) of capital is of paramount importance. Non-exposure to RWA given adequate smart contract safety assures the best possible mobility and security of capital for DAO members in regards to what the DAO can provide, everything else falls on DAI / MKR holders. Exposure to RWA on the other hand implies accepting degrees of systemic risk in exchange for a yield increase. That is not to say that such a tradeoff is not acceptable, but only given a proper diversification based on considering ALL systemic and otherwise environmental risks involved. @GFXlabs sees risk in the financial and organizational structure of the DAO and also in the potential financial and organizational structure of the DAO given the Endgame plan. But, @GFXLabs should also see the risk in not considering long term, extrapolated risks, which can cause contagion not only in this industry, but in most of today\u2019s industries. Thus, a balanced plan, between the long term considerations of Endgame and all possible necessary criticisms based on the current inefficiencies of the DAO seems appropriate. As a last point, @GFXLabs implies that a floating peg will work exclusively at the expense of holders which would essentially suffer the burden of this transition. This is only the case if the transition is not executed properly, and only if this is rushed. Thus, the DAO should make a MAJOR analysis and consideration of a floating peg, such that the uncertainty through a lack of knowledge, but also the dissatisfaction of completely denying an idea, are both eliminated.
