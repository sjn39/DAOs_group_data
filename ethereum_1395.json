If not, have anyone attempted to do so, and why it did not continue to exist? Should each issue have its own smart contract address (like individual item on EIP-721) or should it support multiple items in EIP-1155, or should it support multi-class voting in EIP-1178, EIP-1203 (e.g. certain issue can override another issue) Should the voting support proxy(e.g EIP-897, EIP-1167) and migration? What are potential security concerns Should it be proposed in a single phase standard or multiple separate into multiple phase, with earlier phase supporting easiest and simplest interface, and later phase supporting more advanced interfaces? (I intuitively believe it will be the latter, but not sure if it might be possible to do it all-at once.)  ",
