This MIP set is the evolution of Work-based Budgeting, and aims to give the DAO better tools to enable a decentralized workforce. MIP97 - DAO-level Objective Framework is a consensus tool for Governance to define work, while MIP98 - Work Proposal Framework is a coordination tool for enabling funding in exchange for value. The MIP set will enter the Frozen Period on February 1st, and is actively incorporating feedback prior to this deadline. The MIPs are slated to enter the February Governance Cycle. It is expected that improvements and amendments to the MIPs will be ongoing as this tool is refined during its use.  We will host\u2026   @Retro & @Juan from the Ecosystem Cluster.

I noted a few issues as I went through, the chief of which is that there are still WIP sections which will have no time for feedback to be taken into account before a vote. I think I\u2019d like to contribute to them, if you\u2019re open to it, and assuming they are pushed back. I\u2019ll be at the meeting shortly. ",
