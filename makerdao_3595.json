We are aware of the problem and are testing a fix right now. In the meantime you can indeed use the old oasis interface, as that\u2019s left unchanged. Find it on: Oasis Borrow The other workaround is to clear your local browser storage and refreshing. To do this try:  Press F12 - That will open the Dev tools Look for a tab labeled Console  Type localStorage.clear()  Press F5 - that will refresh your page  ",

The new site is really quite nice, visually. For efficiency, however, I do prefer the the old site. It seems to organize the information in a more readable fashion.
