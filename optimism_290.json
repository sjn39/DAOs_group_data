I very much hope see them working soon. As for project proposals, I suggest you check this:    Grant Proposal Template \ud83c\udfdb Governance   Phase 1 Proposal Template v2 This is an update to the \u201cHow to Create a Proposal\u201d post. Please reference the Gov Docs and operating manual for additional details on submitting proposals.   Key information about Governance Fund grants 5.4% of the total initial token supply (231,928,234 OP) will be distributed to Optimism projects and communities via the Governance Fund.  During Season 2, projects can continue to submit forum proposals to request any amount of OP tokens from the Governance Fund. A\u2026       github.com   ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism Collective. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/Operating-manual) on the Optimism Foundation Github.  ### **Operating Manual v0.2.1:  The Token House and OP Holders**  Governance in the Optimism Collective begins with the launch of the Token House and its members, the OP holders.  As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals.  In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote their OP directly (by delegating their OP voting power to their own address), or delegate their OP voting power to an eligible third party. Addresses with delegated OP voting power are called \u201cdelegates.\u201d Delegates are expected to exercise their authority responsibly and in accordance with community standards.  The Token House is just the first part of the Optimism Collective [governance structure](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/). Launch of the Citizens\u2019 House will soon follow and this Operating Manual will be updated accordingly.  ### **Governance Toolkit**  The primary tools for Optimism Collective governance are:  - [**Snapshot**](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth): Where all Token House governance proposals are submitted for vote. - [**The Optimism Forum**](http://gov.optimism.io): A platform for discussion and deliberation about governance proposals. - [**Discord**](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/): For informal governance discussion and feedback.
