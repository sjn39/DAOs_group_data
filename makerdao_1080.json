As described in this post, the name chosen for this product was Maker Wormhole. Nevertheless, Jump Trading has been building a bridge product with a similar name for quite some time. They also acquired the domain wormhole.com as part of its branding strategy. This is why between the Brand Team and Protocol Engineering Core Unit we decided to rename the Maker Wormhole as Maker Teleport. This new name will allow us to continue promoting this amazing product with the same original narrative, avoiding any type of confusion and taking into account the following advantages in terms of branding:  The name is aligned with the impact we want to have on the user experience. This will help users to remember this product according to its actual functionality. The name is easy to remember and has never been used by any bridge that has similar products. We will be the first to position this name. The name will allow us to continue to build the same narrative around the product and then move forward with the communication strategy without any major changes that might delay this process.   220506_MakerDAO_Screens-081920\u00d7657 47.5 KB  Teleport your Dai. Use Maker Teleport. Coming soon!  6eplC4HlXm8x5Hs8o8scKuKHVuKOCUhEzOEkwIklhRbcOauJ6qSRl84yGdHIYkqvNJsoPVqo3or4f3tL-jezsREiw8U1ewIspWPt48Fgbr0ZlxICgT58Xye_sev8bMb_iLQXZ5N5960\u00d7960 253 KB  ",

The Bridge name was chosen and widely used by the community to name products that want to transfer assets from one chain to another. Nevertheless, the current functionality of these \u201cBridges\u201d only operates the lock-mint scheme, which doesn\u2019t provide the best user experience. On top of that, the name Bridge has been a target to refer to one of the biggest risks of the multi-chain world. The Maker Teleport is different and we want to highlight the difference. As described in the introduction, what happens when you transfer Dai from one L2 to another is much like an actual teleporting \u2014 Dai is destroyed in the origin and minted in the destination. When it comes to user experience, specifically on security, speed, and costs, the Maker Teleport makes a huge improvement over traditional bridges. This is how we want to promote it. Teleporting is superior to bridging. Cheaper, faster, and without losing the Dai essence and the Maker security  ",
