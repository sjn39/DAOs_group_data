As shown in Towards taking asset risk, ETH sounds like a sound investment for MakerDAO. This was also explored in A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy. Before devoting more time on research on all the possibles strategies to onboard ETH on our balance sheet, we think it is time to poll the community/MKR holder on this possibility.  Pros  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and, therefore, linked to the success of ETH ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO as it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset   Cons  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods of time The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long term impact on price.  This Signal Request is to signal core units that community wants to have them work on the topic. ETH derivatives (stETH, ETH-related LPs) are also included if it make sense for core units. No priority is attributed. An actual implementation will have to go through the governance processes.    Do you want to allocate some of the balance sheet of MakerDAO to ETH?  Yes, invest in ETH or ETH derivatives No, do nothing Abstain     0 voters     The signal will run until 2022-05-18T22:00:00Z, before being put on-chain if the yes option is wining. ",

Maker will be footing the gas bill for oracles indefinitely, including (hopefully) in years or decades\u2019 time where ETH may well be orders of magnitude more pricey than it is now. Gas costs may also go up as a consequence of rollups gaining more and more adoption, crowding out other transactions on the L1. Putting aside the possible upside that Maker could capture by investing part of its balance sheet now, I\u2019m concerned by the risk factor if we don\u2019t have a strategic reserve of ETH. We have no choice but to meet future oracle costs, and so investing in ETH can also be understood as a hedge against a future where gas becomes prohibitively expensive. Kind of like how nation-states stockpile oil. ((Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States) - Wikipedia ) ",

In the last Expense report, @adcv estimated oracles costs to be 3.6 mil annually.  That means a target investment of 36 mil if you are getting 10% staking returns or 72 mil if it\u2019s 5%.  But investment target should be even clearer because we can think in eth.  Knowing our oracles eth costs, we know exactly how much eth we need to completely cover our oracles costs. Think about it, irregardless to the price of eth, we guarantee a reduction in one of our biggest expenses.  It also takes away one element of accounting volatility as this expense has been completely unpredictable due to its correlation to eth price.  Eth fees may still jump around but you don\u2019t get the crazy spike in both price and fees that we have seen in the past.  Anyway, my argument is that having Eth produce Eth actually reduces exposure to Eth because you\u2019re no longer forced to buy when prices are high (you can always buy if you think prices are low).  If you have enough of it, you don\u2019t even need to ever buy Eth again. And if Eth crashes hard?  Well, this protocol is already super exposed to such a scenario because so much of its revenue is generated from eth/eth based loans.  Growing the RWA ventures would be the ultimate solution to really reducing exposure to Eth and that\u2019s in the works already. To @SebVentures note that discussion on this topic has already taken place, I think the market at that time was in an obviously inflated place and now is a much better time to enter.  We can give credit to the community for having cooler heads and seeing that it was not the best time to invest in Eth. ",

It\u2019s just sad that you didn\u2019t wait for prices to drop to get more eth for the same price.  On the flip side, if prices and fees skyrocket and you don\u2019t buy, you\u2019re stuck with huge costs at high prices.  This has already happened to the protocol. Anyway, nobody knows what will happen to price.  What we do know better is how much we can afford and how much we need in eth each month.  Further in the future, I\u2019m sure eth developers want to drive eth fees lower at some point and at that point, you can then keep any eth leftover as profit.  So for now, you\u2019re just taking the eth price out of the fee expense equation with an eye on future returns if and when eth fees are reduced (something I think everyone in the ethereum ecosystem is looking for). Also, for all those concerned about the surplus buffer being reduced, I wouldn\u2019t see this as a true reduction.  What this really is, is a slight reduction in liquidity and increase in capital at risk.  Eth holdings are still part of the balance sheet and if the buffer gets hit for whatever reason, eth can quickly be liquidated to replenish what\u2019s deemed necessary. ",

If the price of ETH increases more, the demand for opening up Maker vaults will increase as well as ability for the protocol to raise stability fee. However, in case if there\u2019s a sharp decrease, it will likely cause the opposite as we have witnessed in March 2020 Crash. During this crash, surplus buffer as well as auction was taken place to fill the gap. Now in the case where this would happen with ETH holding, the protocol would needed to auction even more MKR to fill the gap. Imagine if we used 35 million as some have voted, then sharp 50% fall which happened few times in its history would mean the Maker protocol needs to secure additional $17.5 million worth. In addition, I want to clarify with the following because holding ETH as treasury was the reason behind so many bankruptcies and ruined projects back in 2017 and 2018.     SebVentures:  Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage   This was a study conducted in mid 2018 looking at projects\u2019 ETH holdings. And ETH price fell around 40% more in later months which is not reflected here. The reason why we don\u2019t hear about many of these projects is of course because their heavy reliance on ETH as treasury, despite their large ICO fundraising, has put them in significant financial stress and end up collapsing.  image1920\u00d71148 60.1 KB  ",

If we wanted to be completely safe, we would leave everything in DAI and bank on growth in RWA or crypto lending operations.  But according to this model by @SebVentures, we have room to invest some funds even before a capital raise and the question here is only to explore whether Eth investment strategies might make sense.  If you look at the numbers in the model, everything is very conservative and crypto backed loans (the Maker vaults) are very much taken into consideration.  Eth is given a capital at risk of 94%!  Once the capital raise occurs, we\u2019ll have a lot of capital that won\u2019t be effectively used and even when RWA gets ramped up, you\u2019ll be much more diversified, reducing risk of losing your entire buffer at once and thus reducing liquidity demands.  Before capital is raised, I agree that we should be more cautious about volatile investments. So I apologize for posting so much here.  I just want everyone to see the full picture and understand that nothing reckless is going on here.  I have very much been critical about ramping up spending that might be wasteful but on the investment side of things, I feel the protocol has sometimes erred too much on the side of caution (maybe due to those Black Thursday scars or maybe just the barrier of not having ever seen the surplus buffer as anything other than a buffer).  This is debatable but I believe the protocol is in a much better place than it was March 2020 and it can withstand much worse events than it\u2019s given credit for. ",

                    "content": "Following is my personal opinion. I am also heavily biased towards ETH, in my mind it\u2019s one of the rare crypto assets with long-term potential. The surplus buffer exists to cover potential bad debt and allow us to be more aggressive with several products and strategies. Higher surplus leads to more business, higher DCs and higher risk tolerance towards various risks we are exposed to, higher trust in the protocol and dai as a crypto hedge asset. It doesn\u2019t matter in my opinion, if we achieve some yield or not on the assets in the balance sheet, since we are far from our business potential and therefore we should focus on that. The interest accrued is such a small cash flow compared to business potential. If MKR token holders wish to have exposure towards ETH, they can just buy it. MKR token holders probably hold the token for other reasons than ETH exposure. Realistically, there are probably zero MKR holders that don\u2019t already have exposure towards ETH. Hedging gas costs of DAO\u2019s operations is a weak argument in my opinion, as it can go in our favor or against it. On the other hand, we need assets which are not correlated with ETH and the general crypto market to fulfill the primary function of the surplus buffer. Projects that hold large amounts of crypto assets are in reality just hedge funds in disguise and a lot of them were just very lucky, that crypto pumped and not dumped. They had some obscure ideas, a token with fake utility/governance to justify ICO/airdrop/making money for founders and people who financed them, who then pivoted into being a hedge fund (because the original idea was weak to start with or didn\u2019t need a token at all). A lot of these projects would likely not exist today, if ETH didn\u2019t pump as it did. Remember, not that long ago, ETH was worth $100. Maker in my opinion is one of the rare projects, where the token is really used for governance (because we are actually decentralized and not just pretending, because we call it a \u201cDAO\u201d) and we have a working, successful business model and therefore do not need to pivot into being a hedge fund. These projects in reality do not need the capital (otherwise they would spend it for developing whatever they promised already). I think that we, as a community, made some sudden decisions in the past without strategy, which felt right at the time, but later turned out to be just plainly bad decisions. This is because we were focusing on the current thing, instead of having a long-term vision and a strategy. For example we added a bunch of stablecoin vaults, which we now need to deal with and cost us money, and at the time, only helped for a very short period of time. PSM was a much better and sustainable (perhaps) solution to the problem at that time, which had a long-term vision. Later, we were obsessed with increasing the supply of dai without strategy, which resulted in adding many different collateral types which are now problematic, unprofitable and only produced a marginal amount of dai and are clearly a net negative, especially considering the lost time. Many projects exploited this obsession (read some of the old posts for new collaterals, where the argument constantly mentions boosting the dai supply, where realistically it had very marginal potential for dai generation). The new current thing seems to be treasuries and buying crypto assets (UST, new project from Justin Sun). I could be totally wrong here, but I have a feeling we are doing the same thing once again; short sighted decisions with potential large negative impact later in time, without long-term vision and strategy. Finally, I don\u2019t think current poll options are ok. They offer 0%, 15%, 50%, 100% and 100%+ which is biased towards investing more. The 15% is maybe realistic, but 50% and 100% is simply too much in my opinion, considering the risk-averse nature of Maker protocol. This does not mean I am against holding strong assets (ETH, BTC) in the future, I just think that what we need now is a vision and developed strategy before making such decisions. ",

I know that the SB is supposed to be there for security, so I see a small initial investment in ETH as possible, it is not supposed to be a trade and ETH has a long term strategy roadmap. Especially as the suggestion comes from a CU member who is responsible for strategic finance. The argument that many projects failed because they had ETH can just as easily be turned the other way around many projects were successful because they had ETH, even the EF has most of it in ETH. What is being ignored is that many projects failed because of themselves or because they were corrupt with the large assets and ran away with the funds and a lack of fundamental professinalism through all areas. And the projects that have been successful have not been successful because of eth holdings, but because they are committed to their projects. Even if we \u201conly\u201d invest 1 Mil in ETH, sometimes it is better to take small steps to realise which way we are going, what worries me a lot is the strong decline in DAI. The discussion leads to a higher level of what defines us as DAO and what we actually want. I wouldn\u2019t think in absolutisms, if we can put something into ETH with a healthy risk ratio then ok, that doesn\u2019t make us a hedge fund directly, it\u2019s about efficient use of capital, if we can push something else sensibly instead, then great.

If Ethereum succeed, it doesn\u2019t mean much for MakerDAO. If MakerDAO succeed, it means that Ethereum is successful. Obviously it\u2019s not as simple, but overall I think that we endure bad Ethereum news, while not getting much of Ethereum good news. We are long Ethereum downsides. There are also quite some reason to use MKR holder capital to invest in ETH in the protocol vs MKR holders doing that:  It increases the surplus buffer and provide more safety for the protocol. If a token holder own ETH on the side of his MKR position, this doesn\u2019t add safety to Maker. That is assuming a diversification benefit. ETH is also the pristine collateral in DeFi, therefore can be used to source liquidity if needed (see shiftability in the ALM framework) Holding ETH on MakerDAO balance sheet allows cheap leverage thanks to DAI (albeit very limited with the current ETH CaR) that no MKR holder can enjoy on himself.

Please note that if more than 50% of non-abstain voters support multiple options, we will run an instant-runoff poll on-chain. All on-chain votes will include \u201cNo\u201d as an option. I would also like to highlight that the second poll asking how much to invest in ETH also includes \u201cNothing\u201d as an option, and this is currently the option that has attracted the most votes despite the first poll being in favour of the proposal. Voters in favour of deploying the balance sheet in ETH may wish to consider voting for multiple options in the second poll to ensure their views are represented in the on-chain vote. ",

We have no choice but to meet future oracle costs, and so investing in ETH can also be understood as a hedge against a future where gas becomes prohibitively expensive.   Gas costs will always be part of our fixed costs and if they go very high due to ETH increasing in value, then we will also have correspondingly higher revenues because people will be able to borrow more DAI using their crypto collateral and hence pay higher fees. This will more than cover fixed gas costs. Allocating the SB to such a volatile asset is something I personally find unnecessary in terms of the risk it introduces. We need the SB to cover losses from that once in x years event and trying to generate additional profits from it should always be a secondary priority. ",

So I don\u2019t see a future of high gas costs; rather, there will be a multi-chain, low-cost, and high throughput blockchain ecosystem. If the balance sheet is to invest in ETH, it should be for the sole purpose of maximizing risk-adjusted total returns. To a lesser extent, it is also for reducing concentration risk via diversification. As far as diversification of collateral, I have suggested in the past and still maintain that it is worth exploring onboarding cash value life insurance. The virtues of life insurance are that it hedges mortality risk, goes up when the stock market goes up, it does not go down when the market goes down, rising interest rates increase future returns from higher-yielding Treasuries, it is Tier-1 capital on bank balance sheets, and it is highly efficient to liquidate.
