                    "content": "Hello everyone, Given the inclusion ever-growing for smart contracts to be inter-connected, I wanted to come up with an idea to aid developers in building \u201csmarter\u201d multi-contract systems by being able to apply introspection to the entrypoint of a blockchain transaction. I have already filled out the necessary EIP data under my fork, however, before submitting a formal PR I would like to get validation on whether this is something that the community feels would be useful. I have briefly voiced the idea in Ethereum security channels with positive feedback, hence the conception of the EIP. Put briefly, I have introduced four EVM instructions that permit introspection to be applied to the original transaction data by being able to access the original data payload as well as the original recipient of the transaction, the to address. This would primarily allow more complex types of \u201cbasic\u201d contracts to be created, such as ERC-20 tokens that are aware of exactly what type of action (i.e. \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d) is performed on a DEX like Uniswap. As a side-effect, it would counter-act the breaking change of EIP-3074 with regards to the ORIGIN opcode by allowing a more granular level of introspection to be performed on the original transaction context, i.e. in pseudo-code the ORIGIN() == CALLER() can be replaced by ADDRESS() == ENTRYPOINT(). Let me know your thoughts. EDIT: This EIP has been split into two separate ones given that the optimizational benefit of the ORIGINDATA* opcodes was properly argued. The main point of the EIP is to provide an optimized way of transmission for large data payloads rather than introspection; that purpose is suited for the new EIP 3520. ",

The ENTRYPOINT instruction is necessary because without it, the input signature and arguments can easily be spoofed by a malicious contract. Implementation wise, I do not believe it is possible to restrict what the community wants to do. They can already prohibit such wallets by evaluating the extcodehash of an address (note: this will not prevent malicious contracts, only wallets that have already been deployed). Ultimately, I think the benefit of such introspection outweighs the potential of one or two projects producing an ill-advised implementation which they can already apply using the aforementioned check, unless the intention is to strip that ability entirely. I would like to stress this again, caller discrimination is not the main point of the EIP and is a side-effect of ENTRYPOINT, however, I do not believe there is any non-spoof-able way to associate the to address of a transaction with the original data argument. Ofcourse, this is completely up to debate. ",
