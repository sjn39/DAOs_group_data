When talking with a protocol on another network about integrating Dai, they sometimes ask for help to inject Dai liquidity into the protocol to bootstrap the market. Depending on the depth needed and the size of the protocol, Dai needed for liquidity could be about 3MM. Usually, these pools generate fees from trades that will provide revenue. Still, there\u2019s always the risk associated with the impermanent loss if the pool is not against another stablecoin (and the risk of the protocol itself). There are different solutions for this:  companies that provide Market Maker services (for a fee) Other DAOs have a treasury A loan from any of the lending protocols (for a fee)  We will be posting an extended analysis of this to find the right solution for this challenge.  MakerDAO is part of the EEA. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is an organization whose objective is to drive the use of Ethereum.

We are reaching out to the issuers of the tokens we plan to offboard and conversing with them to get feedback and understand why they or their token holders are not using Maker Vaults. We have spoken with Brave, Loopring, Decentraland, Kyber and waiting to talk with 0x. The feedback we are getting is similar from all the teams:  They want to maintain their position as collateral They (as a project) are not using Maker Vaults for different reasons (their treasury is for helping them to grow, so they use it in their partners and marketing, they are defining how to manage their treasury, their treasury team is not aware of the current risk parameters) They are interested in having special terms for their vault  These conversations are taking longer than expected because the decision to open a Vault to take the remaining DC requires time. We explain to them that we will be waiting until September 1st to see if the utilization of the vault changed and that that will be taken into account when the community decides what the next steps are.  Institutional Vaults. We are talking with a large custody platform and \u200b\u200ba major digital asset trading platform about Maker Vaults. We have their interest, and if we can have them opening vaults, that will increase Dai supply and reduce our USDC exposure. What do we want to do to achieve this:  We need the institutional vault product asap. Growth, PE, Risk CUs, and Nexo are working together on the proposal of this product. We need to solve the KYC part. We are working with our legal counsel to understand these companies\u2019 requirements and determine what kind of structure we need to incorporate or with whom we need to partner to solve it. Institutions have off-chain requirements: like the one-to-one relationship to set agreements and a larger liquidation window.   PSM delay Update.

Question about future products Proposal Ideas       At Maker growth we are always trying to find ways to grow the protocol, both through partnerships and through the creation of new products (example institutional vaults), and following this line, I have been thinking lately several examples of products of which I would like to know the opinion of the community about it.

This interest comes from the analysis of knowing that integrating Dai will help them attract more users and improve the usability of their product.  Once Dai is integrated into the product, it requires a market capable of fulfilling users\u2019 requests.

A GUI for PSM on IPFS and/or PSM bridge: So we could link our PSM\u2019s and do any type of swap we are capable of doing. A user that has Pax, for example, could swap to USDC or vice versa by just paying the tin to get Dai, and then in the same transaction, it would put Dai into the other PSM and getting the token. The tout is zero going out anyways.   A furocombo-like web for arbitrage with PSM and Flash Mint.   An optimistic roll up test environment to facilitate the testing of L2 code.

Instead of them being just a PSM collateral, we are developing a partnership where both sides are committed to working together in a long-term relationship. At the same time, we are reaching out to all aggregators to push the PSM-USDP integration.  ETHOnline We are sponsoring the ETHOnline hackathon, which starts next week with a technical workshop with @liberuum  from SES and officially kicks off on Friday - September 17th. For this hackathon, we will be giving prizes to the best integrations with the Maker Protocol. We are thinking about specific Prize names, but please leave a comment with your suggestions if you have an idea.  Welcome Feli to the fam!! @zxMori  is our Integrations Lead. He will be helping our partners to interact with the Maker Protocol. Felipe has been working as a Software Engineer for about five years, he started with crypto development right before the 2017 ATH. He has worked in several parts of the crypto ecosystem, getting to know a few prominent protocols inside out, like AAVE, Compound, The Graph, and Chainlink. We are very excited to have him on our team!! If you want to say hi to him, you can find him on RocketChat: @mori or Twitter: @fmorisan   Star-s of the week     MKR is now available on the Blockchain.com Exchange.
