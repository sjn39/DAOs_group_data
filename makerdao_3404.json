                    "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about this a while, and thought I\u2019d just put out the idea now for feedback. It concerns the idea that Maker tends to buy and burn MKR (flap) when it\u2019s expensive, but mint and sell MKR (flop) when it\u2019s relatively cheap.   If effect, the protocol buys high and sells low. While that is not guaranteed to be true, it makes intuitive sense and will be presumed true in the following discussion. The idea is to dampen that tendency and therefore, on a net basis, buy low and sell high. The proposed mechanism is gives governance 3 levers: Funding Rate Max Flop Rate Max Flop Support Rate Funding Rate defines an amount of protocol income flowing to this mechanism instead of the surplus buffer. Max Flop Rate (e.g. 1 per day) defines how many flops are allowed before this mechanism activates. Max Flop Support Rate (e.g. 2 per day) defines how many flops this mechanism can avert once it activates. It works like this: First, it slows the rate of flaps (buying MKR at a high price) by slowing the rate of surplus buffer accumulation when things are going well. Next, when things are not going well and the surplus buffer is wiped out and the protocol starts flopping (selling MKR at a low price), the mechanism averts some of the flops (prevents selling MKR at a low price). That means less buying MKR high and less selling MKR low, which has the same net effect as buying low and selling high, which probably we can all agree is good for the protocol. In the simplest form, this mechanism stores the Dai allocated to it until needed for flop abatement. However, a further iteration could employ a second storage strategy: Holding it\u2019s assets in a custom DAI/MKR Automated Market Maker (see MIP31).  Given the large scale, it could potentially earn significant fees.  It also fits well with the \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d idea because it would hold less MKR when it is expensive, and have more MKR when it is relatively inexpensive. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for starting this discussion. Maybe I have misunderstood some things but the flop mechanism to mint MKR is if and only if we have bad debt beyond what the surplus buffer can cover. Unfortunately, this will probably happen when the market crashes and MKR price will be low - so you are right that we\u2019ll have to mint MKR at cheap prices. But given that this should be a rare event and that the surplus buffer is now being made larger, is this really a worry? As for the flaps, again, it seems like the surplus buffer growth/contraction helps here. As prices go up, so does the buffer (assuming the buffer is going to be a certain percentage of outstanding DAI) and hence we burn less MKR than we would if the SB was not growing. Similarly, when prices crash, we don\u2019t need such a large buffer anymore (because total DAI minted will drop). That reduction in the SB would burn a lot of MKR at low prices - which is great! I think we could even play with this further by having the SB be larger than the minimum requirement in a bull market and use that excess to burn more MKR in a bear market. I guess I\u2019m not sure if your premise that the protocol buys high and sells low is actually true. ",

Unlike user vaults, which we might really want to keep uninvested at 0% because potentially they can be claimed back at any moment by users, with the USDC of the PSM we are free to do what we want.

Currently the protocol doesn\u2019t flop (raise funds) until all resources (surplus butter) are exhausted. On the surface this seems like a fairly terrible strategy. It\u2019s boom and bust. That doesn\u2019t mean it was a bad design decision: It traded simplicity for optimization. Creating this new buffer creates a minimum amount of system resources to have available, after which resources begin to get replenished (flops).  It may still get drawn down, but the draw down will start sooner and will be shared with system income (flops). This mechanism should also make the flop markets healthier.  By flopping sooner and over longer periods of time, a more consistent market will emerge.  A market that operates only rarely, during catastrophe, may have fewer committed participants. I described the proposal mainly as \u201cavoid buying high and selling low\u201d in MKR flap/flop auctions, but I think this mechanism would be better even if it didn\u2019t have that benefit. Is there any good argument (other than simplicity) to fully deplete all forms of system surplus before beginning to gradually re-capitalize? ",
