Specification  Motivation Experiments are great in every organisation. This becomes truer for web3 and truest for MakerDAO. That being said, when an experiment is not killed in time, it becomes a money pit or a missed opportunity. Several strong reasons indicate that this is a good time to release this team from their duties:  Lack of Quality This point might be hard to qualify or quantify when a shop is up and running. Ultimately it comes down to the metrics. The meme Wizard has done much better things and there are groups interested in making swag great again.  Lack of Service It has been reported by several community members that the site has been down for weeks, which is unacceptable at any point in time after 1997.  Lack of Accountability This team promised 50% of the revenue of the shop, and they have vested approximately 0 Dai to the Protocol. We probably don\u2019t care that much, but not delivering on a promise should have some consequences. Reputation?  Conclusion After wasting everyone\u2019s time and delivering zero results --both in terms of branding or monetary-- we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several miles higher.  Core Unit ID MDS-001 ",

The unfortunate reality is that, for a number of reasons, the shop has not functioned the way we (or the community) had hoped. We accept responsibility for that and would like to share a recommendation on how to move forward. But first, some context. Coulter and I made the proposal to run the shop because we are enthusiastic supporters of Maker and wanted to continue to contribute to the project even after our roles in the Foundation were decentralized. While conceptually simple, the store was much more complicated to pull together in practice than either of us expected, especially from a legal perspective. Luckily, none of the issues were insurmountable, but they did result in time delays and, eventually, disruption in service. Let\u2019s talk about money. The store made $2115.82 and .1806ETH (from crypto payments) in profit in the time it was functional and, per the agreement 50% of that belongs to Maker. We have not shared that money yet as we do not have a place to send it. Once we have the best accounts for the project we will initiate the transfer ASAP. Now, our recommendation. Swag makes people happy. @aburban90  is the embodiment of happiness in the Maker Community. We\u2019ve worked with him multiple times to get him the swag he needs for his CU. We suggest folding the store into the Strategic Happiness core unit, if Andrew is up for it. Andrew is passionate about the project and has poured his heart and soul into creating and sharing fantastic swag that drives engagement and happiness. We think it\u2019s a perfect fit. This is, as always, a call for the community to make, but we think this is the best option as it wouldn\u2019t require new proposals/votes etc\u2026 we can just transfer everything to him if the community wishes.

It may be best to continue to keep the shop off. SHCU is not a professional CU nor does not suggest itself to be (nor does it desire to be, but burban can correct here if he wants to be held accountable to the DAO for swag drops and online shop tech performance). This initiative was sold to the DAO as independently-managed initiative with no out of pocket cost delivering money to the DAO without effort or headache. It seems appropriate the Shop Core unit simply keep the ether and cash profits and just unwind. It can be taken over when a proper marketing core unit comes online. Right now the rep of our shop has taken a hit for no gain. Rolling it up into a new chimera sounds like another uncertain and risky venture for little gain trading on the Maker brand. ",

(If they\u2019re up for it.) It seems like the shop was/is a passion project, and they had ongoing issues with IP arrangements with the Dai Foundation that set them back early on. The solutions the DAO should focus around should probably include giving them the resources they need to succeed instead of stabbing them in the back with a disposable identity. Coulter and Mike have been around longer than I have, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to do them like this. They have community goodwill and reputational stake here and have given a lot of themselves to the DAO over the last few years. If anyone can pull off the shop, it\u2019s them, but it\u2019s easier to destroy than to help grow, I guess. No alternative shop provider has been proffered here, so the idea that others are waiting in the wings to create a shop but are only hindered by the fact that there\u2019s already a shop core unit seems pretty speculative. I\u2019d argue, on the other hand, that this sort of MIP proposal does more to harm morale in every other core unit than good that can possibly be done by sniping longtime Maker community members from unpaid roles.

Even if there is a hand-off between core units, the community needs to know what they are getting into now. We are all smarter based on the challenges you faced if we can document them. Regardless of whether it is a transfer or an unwinding, a new MIP set with an appropriate budget with transparent management is probably needed to make sure we can deliver and avoid further issue to MakerDAO (to McMichael\u2019s point). The original MIP was early on and a reasonable shot in the dark and blind faith. The DAO is much further along in its due diligence WRT proposals. The best way to proceed would be to demonstrate actual oversight or analysis of what it would take to deliver on a shop to MakerDAO standards. Also, it is implied in your post you and Mike are stepping down from the core unit regardless? @MakerMikeP  If so, do you think you could just make that clear, it would make this facilitator offboarding thread and the accompanying core unit thread irrelevant. It would also move this forward to a different (more productive) stage. ",

(If they\u2019re up for it.)   Just want to be clear that angry anon\u2019s don\u2019t dictate the direction of the DAO - even if it might sometimes feel like it - the outcome of votes do. Sometimes having proposals that we don\u2019t agree with is an unavoidable outcome of having the proposal process open to anyone. It doesn\u2019t mean that these proposals are what the DAO actually wants as a whole. Proposals are one of the mechanisms through which we collectively find out what the DAO wants as a whole.     brianmcmichael:  Just pointing out that this justification seems pointlessly hostile, I worry that this is exacerbated by anons on a warpath against core units. You get what you pay for, and the DAO didn\u2019t pay anything for the shop. It\u2019s possible to acknowledge that this isn\u2019t working out without casting these sorts of aspersions.   Totally agree with this, though, and I would encourage @Deimos to keep this in mind in the future.     Puzzler:  Perhaps needs a new discussion, but why does maker never ask for bidding?   Anyone is able to do this through MIP13. I\u2019m not 100% sure why it isn\u2019t utilized more. But I suspect part of it is lack of familiarity with the MIP, and because it\u2019s a moderate amount of effort to make a proposal. ",
