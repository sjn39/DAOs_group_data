Next week we will run a poll on whether we can use the remaining funds from the SAS Auditor and Operational wallet to fund the CU till end of February. Note: On 10th November 2022 we returned funds to the DAO, so the remaining funds is the usual  runway. If the poll result is negative, we will proceed with this MIP14 to request a DAI Transfer to cover 4 months of operational expenses. If the poll result is positive, this MIP will become obsolete. Brief note on scope of our work: SAS spent the last days and weeks talking to Rune and other Endgame stakeholders about how the people of SAS can best contribute to the Endgame. Together, we\u2019ve defined next steps, which we will explain here shortly. From now on, only a tiny part of our work will be on auctions and the majority will be around doing other engineering, Smart Contract and Decentralised Frontend, work. ",
