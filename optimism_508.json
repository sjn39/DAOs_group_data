(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): The Geo Web is creating the World Wide Web for the physical world. We\u2019ll achieve this by creating public consensus for geospatial augmented reality publishing & browsing. The core of the Geo Web is our partial common ownership/Harberger taxes smart contracts (deployed exclusively to Optimism) that administer a fair & productive digital land NFT market. Our land parcel NFTs are like 3D domain names/web pages. Licensors have the exclusive right to anchor any digital media (NFTs, AR, data, traditional web content, etc) to physical locations within the bounds of their parcels. Users discover this content on their smart device (eventually AR glasses) through a universal browser application that can resolve arbitrary content based on geolocation rather than a URL.100% of the Geo Web\u2019s land market revenue is used to fund public goods. This is done both to earn legitimacy (a private group shouldn\u2019t be the landlord of the world) and to create a flywheel of public/OSS investment & innovation. We can outcompete the closed metaverse(s), app stores, and attention economy algorithms in the next computing paradigm if we choose to coordinate. That\u2019s what the Geo Web is all about.

Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We haven\u2019t created any Dune dashboards yet as we\u2019re just building initial traction, but here are numbers as of submission:- 45 parcels claimed (Contract Address 0xba1231785a7b4ac0e8dc9a0403938c2182ce4a4e | Optimism)- ~.632 ETHx raised for public goods (registration payments + streaming payments = funding raised for public goods; Contract Address 0x5ad276439e3772fdb6696b6cb61401902d4e8b72 | Optimism) Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Over - https://www.overthereality.ai/ ; SuperWorld - https://www.superworldapp.com/ ; Arcona - https://www.arcona.space/ Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 1/14/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: The Geo Web is an application-layer manifestation of the Optimistic vision. We\u2019ve been living and building to the values of impact=profit, positive-sum coordination, and anti-plutocracy since before the Optimism mainnet was publicly announced (we started building in 2020 before we had a scalable, value-aligned network to launch on\u2026). We believe our use of innovative concepts (partial common ownership, permissionless public goods funding mechanisms) and technology (streaming payments, Diamond proxy contracts, p2p content) can solve the most important societal challenge of the next computing paradigm: who/what controls the default content/application platform for always-on, field-of-view smart devices. We want it to be public interests, not private.With the Optimism Collective\u2019s help, we can show another example of how crypto is about more than DeFi ponzis and overpriced jpgs. Instantiating prosocial values into our protocols/applications isn\u2019t a hindrance, but ultimately our superpower. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We\u2019re admittedly better builders than marketers. We\u2019ve built one of the most ambitious demonstrations of a full-stack web3 dapp, but need help exposing the masses to our new ideas and tech for it to matter. Our land market is explicitly designed to promote sustainable, utility-based value growth rather than speculative fervor. Our balanced incentive structure is why we\u2019ll succeed where traditional private property rights systems on the blockchain will fail. But in the market for attention, easy money & speculation are our short-term competition. Once we get people through the proverbial door, we think we can inspire them and keep them. A growth experiment grant to incentivize land claims would help jumpstart a flywheel of adoption and public goods funding for the open metaverse on Optimism. The legitimacy and attention bestowed on the Geo Web as an OP grant recipient would be almost as valuable as the financial incentives themselves. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: If we\u2019re successful with the Geo Web, a core piece of infrastructure for the open metaverse (think of our land registry like DNS/ENS for the AR metaverse) will live on Optimism. At one point, having a website was just for the nerdiest of nerds. Now, every business and many millions of individuals have them. Based on how they\u2019re used, licensing Geo Web parcels could become more widespread than that.We acknowledge that there are and will continue to be other digital land registries and competing closed alternatives. But the greatest value of augmented reality comes from concentrating consensus for shared human experiences\u2014not fragmenting reality. As a true public good, we have a unique opportunity to transcend the competition. We have the incentive structure (partial common ownership) and feedback loops (public goods funding) to make the desired coordination a reality. The Geo Web will help drive network effects on Optimism through sticky usage, but also as a sustainable engine of public goods funding. This is how we visualize it: : LOOPY (v1.1). Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: We have not applied to Optimism Governance directly for a grant, but we did receive a 20K OP grant via Superfluid (Announcing the Recipients of Our Superfluid Builder Grants for Optimism | by Superfluid | Superfluid Blog | Jan, 2023 | Medium). It is being distributed 60% to our core team as stipends over Q1 2023 for our full-time commitment to the project. The remaining 40% will be used on marketing efforts largely around ETHDenver (AR content, printing costs, travel to the conference, supporting/marketing partner integrations, etc.). Number of OP tokens requested: 25,000 (open to bigger initiatives if our size is not size  )) Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: In Process If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: We requested 50k OP through the online form around the time we were launching. We have not heard anything back. How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): We\u2019re a bootstrapped public good, so don\u2019t have the budget to match incentives. How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): 100%/25K OP - User rewards (via land claims/quests): direct incentives for users to claim Geo Web parcels and stick around as Geo Web publishers/licensors on Optimism. We\u2019re interested in either using https://quest3.xyz/ or we\u2019ll build our own simple module on the Cadastre that allows wallets that become Geo Web parcels licensors (min .005 ETHx payment) to claim their OP rewards. We\u2019d start with a higher per parcel reward (3~4 OP per parcel depending on the current OP:ETH price ratio) to incentivize early activity and scale down as we gain traction. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: 12 weeks/1 quarter seems like a reasonable ramp time, but would be open to feedback. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: The Geo Web isn\u2019t quite an open edition NFT mint, but the theoretical max number of parcels claimed is at least in the tens of billions. We\u2019re not minting out any time soon, so targeting a traditional 10,000 mint seems like a good stretch goal to justify the grant (given historical OP:ETH price ratios, we\u2019d immediately generate more in dollar terms for public goods funding than incentives granted\u2013plus ongoing streams of public goods funding from users would continue).The milestone to trigger the remaining 60% of the grant could be set to 2k parcels minted. This would prove our traction, but also account for marginal adoption (i.e. the next mint) becoming easier with compounding network effects. We\u2019re more than happy to adjust the milestone or add tranches. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Geo Web land parcels are utility NFTs, so our target audience/use case doesn\u2019t face the same mercenary incentives of DeFi traders/LPs seeking the highest yield. Incentives will help us bootstrap the initial adoption density to make the Geo Web land market interesting. From there, the ongoing utility of publishing on the network and a growing ecosystem of OSS tools/creators will justify continued participation in our partial common ownership market on Optimsim.

Think of Pokemon Go but rather than just a siloed application, relevant & composable content, applications, & information are discoverable at physical-world locations through a universal spatial browser (like a web browser that uses GPS instead of URLs). We use a novel property rights system (partial common ownership/Harberger taxes*) to administer a fair & productive market for who can anchor content where in the world on the network. Instead of installing apps on a device, publishers anchor \u201capps\u201d to locations on Earth for all visitors to experience in augmented, shared reality. 100% of the funds collected through the land market are allocated to public goods and the creation of positive externalities through market incentives. With this model, we can bootstrap a coherent open spatial web browsing experience that challenges the app stores & attention economy algorithms for supremacy in the metaverse era. *In short, partial common ownership requires landholders to continuously contribute to a public goods treasury fund proportionally to what they say their land is worth. Someone else can always purchase their land at that same self-assessed price in the open market. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: We\u2019re going to succeed because of our wholehearted commitment to and innovative implementation of public goods funding mechanisms/incentives. App stores and algorithms are the incumbent application delivery models that want to extend their monopolistic practices to the metaverse. At this point, it\u2019s not just crypto natives that understand this isn\u2019t the future we want. They\u2019re looking for credible alternatives. We can deliver. We have an elegant, decentralized mechanism (partial common ownership land NFTs) for creating an orderly, open, and useful AR metaverse experience. It so happens that this mechanism creates a sustainable revenue stream that we have wholly committed to funding public goods. We\u2019re not trying to build the future of the metaverse by ourselves. We\u2019re creating a flywheel of public goods funding and innovation for it to evolve as an open ecosystem:  How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate:   Geo Web Parcel License (GEOL) Token Tracker | Optimism  26 unique token holders 111 Geo Web parcels minted    How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism:  We need to overcome the cold start problem for our network. OP incentives would help us offset a user\u2019s direct financial cost of licensing a Geo Web parcel.  The minimum cost of claiming a Geo Web parcel is .005 ETH plus an ongoing fee equal to 10% of the self-assessed value of the parcel.   As more users claim land, the coordination value/utility of each parcel goes up and the need for external incentives goes down.  It will also give our team opportunities to learn from users to improve our UX and enable more use cases for landholders/publishers\u2013further increasing the core value proposition.   The Geo Web land registry (i.e. the source of truth for the network) is Optimism-exclusive. All Geo Web land transactions (primary & secondary) happen on Optimism.  It\u2019s also natural for any on-chain applications built for the Geo Web to be on Optimism so landholders/publishers don\u2019t have to manage cross-chain assets for a single use case.   All Geo Web land market fees are allocated to public goods funding. We can spur second and third-order usage on Optimism by funding an ecosystem of creators/artists, games, tooling, businesses, etc. that earn from their positive-sum contributions to the Geo Web.  Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.:  Public goods maxis & regens  We can directly reach out to ~14k unique contributors that have donated to the Geo Web Gitcoin grant previously Claiming and holding a Geo Web land parcel is like contributing to the Gitcoin QF matching pool, but you get a metaverse land parcel in return, so we can also target people that donate to other projects/the matching pool each quarter (and often post about it on Twitter).   AR/VR/3D artists  Creators are always looking for networks/mediums to showcase their work. They can be found through and engaged with social media, Discord communities, NFT marketplaces, etc as they share their work publicly.    How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?:  Land transactions - Partial common ownership requires an initial claim and an ongoing network fee stream. Publishing on the Geo Web will entail perpetual engagement on the Optimism network. Building & publishing on the Geo Web - Landholders and builders alike will interact with and create content, NFTs, apps, experiences, and tooling for Geo Web parcels. These assets would naturally default to being on Optimsim (better UX & that\u2019s where funding will be allocated). Public goods funding allocation decisions - At first periodically through quadratic funding rounds then via perpetual streaming mechanisms, landholders and Geo Web citizens will vote for/fund public goods on on-chain on Optimism. Browsing the Geo Web - Browsing content on the Geo Web currently does not require on-chain interaction with Optimism, but permissioning and interactivity will eventually provide another ongoing mode of interaction with Optimism for Geo Web users.  Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:   Demo: Claim Land - https://geoweb.land/, Browse the Geo Web (need to be at a parcel) - https://geoweb.app/   Website: https://geoweb.network/   Twitter: https://twitter.com/thegeoweb   Discord/Discourse/Community: Geo Web   Github: Geo Web \u00b7 GitHub   Technical/Economic Documentation: https://docs.geoweb.network/   Other:   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): 1.0197 ETHx - public goods funding raised since January 14, 2023  ETHx is ETH wrapped for Superfluid streaming  Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:   SuperWorld - Ethereum   Over - Polygon   Illust - EVM-compatible contract   Arcona - BNB Chain   Please link to code audits (if any): N/A  Team  Who are your founders?:   Graven Prest - gravenp (Graven Prest) \u00b7 GitHub   Cody Hatfield - codynhat (Cody Hatfield) \u00b7 GitHub   What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? We have a truly unique vision for how to bootstrap the open metaverse. We\u2019re audacious enough to believe it\u2019s possible and driven enough to do it right. We\u2019ve been on a public goods maximalist mission with the Geo Web since 2020 without taking shortcuts and leading by example. Better-capitalized and larger competitors can\u2019t legitimately co-opt our strategy. Eventually, they\u2019ll join us. Cody is a full-stack web3 engineer who\u2019s done everything from building our partial common ownership auction system, modular Diamond Proxy smart contracts, Superfluid streaming payment system, Ceramic + IPFS p2p content layer, and more. Since he\u2019s not the one writing this proposal, I\u2019ll just say he\u2019s a badass. I (Graven) am a mission-driven problem solver. I thrive bridging the gap between technical and business. I have a knack for complex system and mechanism design. Is this your first Web3 project?:  Cody - No Graven - Yes, but has been working on it since 2020.  If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): Cody\u2019s other web3 work:  GitHub - codynhat/ipfs-ios-backup: Backup iOS devices to IPFS Ligo-Protocol \u00b7 GitHub   Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 2,000 OP How do you justify the size of the grant?: We\u2019re a small project (so far), and this is a small grant request. We value the social signal of support for our experiment from the Collective even more than the grant allocation. We\u2019re attempting to bootstrap a new global property rights system that could be integral to the future of the open web/metaverse. Even if we\u2019re a bit early in the market, we don\u2019t think this is an outsized request to help jumpstart sustainable network effects.  Roadmap and Distribution Plan  Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan:  Create a fresh Safe on OP to hold the Growth Grant (3 of 4 signers; 2 separate hardware wallets x 2 Geo Web cofounders)  We\u2019ll utilize the CSV Airdrop app to manually distribute awards based on claims.   Release a blog post outlining the distribution table for parcel claimants (see next question) Kick off a social and community campaign to drive awareness about the Geo Web and the availability of OP incentives On a monthly basis, retrieve and submit the list of eligible OP recipient addresses and amounts for payout via the Safe Continue to engage users and drive new claims through office hours, community calls/Twitter spaces, Discord/forum conversations, use case deployment, and partner outreach  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives aligns with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here ): 100% of this growth grant will be allocated to user rewards for claiming Geo Web land parcels. Upon program commencement, each subsequent parcel claim would earn the claimant OP rewards based on the tranche in which their claim was made:  Claim #1 - 200 - 2.5 OP/parcel (Total - 500 OP) 201 - 800 - 2 OP/parcel (1200 OP) 801 - 1000 - 1.5 OP/parcel (300 OP)  This would represent a big leap forward in Geo Web adoption on Optimism and create momentum for continued growth on the network. This adoption would represent an identifiable audience for AR artists, games, and entrepreneurs to market to on the Geo Web as well. Each parcel claim would also immediately generate .005 ETHx in subsequent funding public goods (5 ETHx plus ongoing fees to be allocated through quadratic funding). The $ value of OP granted to claimants will be less than their required public goods contribution, so we can avoid mercenary incentive hunters and attract users interested in the long-term vision. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: We will distribute the in the three months following receipt of grant funds. Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use the distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  If we receive a grant, we will release a blog post announcing the Geo Web\u2019s OP incentive program and structure by April 17th We will reach the 200th new parcel claim by May 8th  This can be monitored at Geo Web Parcel License (GEOL) Token Tracker | Optimism)   We will reach the 600th parcel claim by June 17th We will reach the 1,000th parcel claim by July 17th Development progress targeted during the grant period:  We will release a Web3Auth sign-in & fiat-to-crypto onramp (pending compliance review) for the Cadastre to improve the claiming UX by April 30th We will release a persistent, shared, & cross-platform AR use case for Geo Web parcel licensors by May 31st    Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to the revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use the distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:  We will deploy the Safe to hold/distribute OP rewards by April 17th  We\u2019ll distribute rewards to users via the CSV Airdrop app that is integrated with Safe   We will pay the first monthly tranche of OP rewards by May 17th We will pay the second monthly tranche of OP rewards by June 17th We will pay the third monthly tranche of OP rewards by July 17th We will run our first public goods quadratic funding allocation round by the end of July 2023  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Geo Web land parcels are administered under the perpetual partial common ownership licensing system. OP incentives will help offset, but not exceed the value of ETH that the land claimant must commit to the public goods funding pool to mint a parcel. This means our program will not be a mercenary arbitrage opportunity. Users that claim land under these conditions are making a financial and time commitment to the Geo Web that entails continued engagement to return value. We will continue to drive network effects, improved UX, and new use cases that these landholders want. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contract addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): RegistryDiamond (view of our registry contracts) - Louper Geo Web Network Treasury (i.e. public funds, not the core team\u2019s) - 0x5ad276439e3772fdb6696b6cb61401902d4e8b72 Geo Web Core Team Wallet (operational funds mostly from Gitcoin grants) - 0xDE798cD9C53F4806B9Cc7dD27aDf7c641540167c. This will be the initial recipient of the funds before sending it to a smart contract for distribution. Geo Web Core Team Safe (holds an OP grant via Superfluid) - Safe  Optimism Relationship  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Yes, the Geo Web can solve two problems for the Optimism Ecosystem:   By supporting metaverse adoption on Optimism - Whether you hate the metaverse buzzword or not, the internet is undeniably becoming more three-dimensional and geospatial. The Geo Web can help establish a critical piece of infrastructure for the future of the spatial internet on Optimism and the spillover effects that entails.   By creating funding for public goods - 100% of the Geo Web\u2019s land market funds will be allocated to public goods and creating positive externalities. We are an app layer extension of the Optimism vision and will help drive more public goods building in the OP Stack.   Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: I don\u2019t want to repeat the whole proposal here so\u2026 The Geo Web will attract new users with unique NFT utility, by sustainably rewarding builders, creators, educators, & innovators with non-extractive business models, and by perpetuating the meme of public goods+coordination to the masses. Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes  Confirmations  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

MattL:  How does Geo Web plan to handle public goods (picking projects, distribution, etc.), and will there be any collaboration with Optimism public goods? Can you provide some details on the approach and any potential partnerships or collaborations in this area?   Great question! This is the area that we\u2019re most excited to experiment and collaborate in. Effective public goods funding allocation is what will allow the Geo Web to compete with proprietary alternatives. To limit complexity & maximize participation opportunities, we will use Gitcoin\u2019s Allo protocol to administer our initial public goods quadratic funding rounds. It\u2019s an OS protocol and leverages Gitcoin\u2019s years of QF experience, so we can run small rounds ourselves as we build momentum for the project. We\u2019ve had positive conversations with Gitcoin team members about collaboration/support for our efforts. RetroPGF will also grow into a great tool for our PG funding toolbox and we\u2019d welcome any collaboration opportunities within the Optimism ecosystem (anyone interested in collaborating, experimenting, or developing, hmu  ).     MattL:  Just to make it clear, will this reimburse the full cost of the parcel or more? I know that\u2019s related to the value of OP and ETH, though just want to see if that\u2019s the idea. Given it\u2019s all going to public goods anyway, I just want to make sure there isn\u2019t a profit incentive for users to claim large amounts and farm OP rewards.   The proposed incentive structure was designed to keep the OP reward (in $) less than the ETH cost (in $) of claiming a parcel for this reason. At current prices, the top reward would be $6.55 (2.5 OP x $2.62/OP) while the claim price would be $8.90 (.005 ETH x $1779.93) plus the ongoing PCO stream. That should be enough cushion to absorb relative price changes between OP/ETH and maintain the desired incentives, but if the ratio dramatically changed before the program launch we could adjust the allocations in this intended spirit.
