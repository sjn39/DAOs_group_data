I would make a small appeal to these users and societies to consider allowing for new voices into these positions, rather than dominating them across the board. It also seems it would be difficult to be a delegate across so many protocols. ",

Being a delegate is not about being \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cBMOC\u201d simply because of one\u2019s status in our current Web2 world.  IMHO we will see more of the same that society is being challenged by. As a woman in tech/web3 for over 2 decades, and speaking on virtual stages / IRL, it would be great to see a balance, a distribution of delegates that are not bound by any bias that clearly has presented itself in the space since its inception.  Authentic communication to different parts of society is vital to the success of the collective as well as the greater crypto space.  We are still so early, and it would be great to have more diversity, inclusiveness at all levels of our society. ",
