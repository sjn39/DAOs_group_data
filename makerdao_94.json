RWA Report 2021-09 The following report is provided as an August month end snapshot. The report is split into two overarching groupings: Centrifuge RWAS and Non-Centrifuge RWAs. Within each group, individual asset pools are observed separately. A higher level RWA group summary is also provided. For each asset pool the report is organised as follows:  Pool overview Pool series summary data Performance statistics Covenant management observations   Centrifuge RWAs Highlight summary:  NewSilver is the only tinlake pool with funds drawn from Maker Vaults. Fortunafi, HarborTrade and ConsolFreight have active Maker Vaults but no debt limit utilisation. NewSilver Vault debt utilisation is steady. Maker\u2019s debt share has grown from 47% to 56% in one month. Fortunafi existing asset pool is under close monitoring (see FF covenant section). A pre-onboarding assessment of Pipe will be done. Further risk mitigation actions from recent audit is under consideration. Harbor Trade new SCF buyer programs are close to launch. So is its Vault limit utilisation. ConsolFreight concentration limits are under review regarding single counterparties Vault utilisation thresholds.   New Silver As at Aug end: based on data reported by New Silver Pool overview: New Silver had a significant amount of new originations in the last reporting month. As Vault utilisation limit grows, NS is bringing concentration limits closer to expectations (e.g. maximum single state exposure, LTV/LTC/ARV ratios). Pool series summary:  Collateral: Commercial purpose real estate bridge loans Total loans outstanding (#): 63 Total loans outstanding ($): $13,629,450.00 New loans originated ($): $2,820,095.00 Avg loan amount outstanding ($): $216,340.48 Avg maturity (t): 12.38m Maker share of debt (%): 56.6%  Performance:  Closed/Paid loans ($): $1,168,000.00 Paid off rate (%): 7.89% In arrears ($): N/A Charge offs ($): N/A Delinquency rate (%): 0 Charge off rate (%): 0 Default rate (%): N/A Cured rate (%): N/A Recovery rate (%): N/A Payment rate (%): N/A  Covenant management: No covenant breach has been observed. We are closely monitoring the following:  Co-investors ratio: 29.06% (> 25%) Maximum single loan: 3.83% / 521K (< 10% of debt or 500K) Maximum state exposure: 27.91% (< 30% of book)  Note:  For maximum single loan the metric was setup when DC was at 5M. As DC was increased, % of debt outstanding is a  more appropriate concentration threshold.

Pool overview: Fortunafi has currently only one asset originator underwritting RSA contracts (Corl). The asset manager (FF) is looking to bring Pipe as a second originator in the near future, subject to pre-onboarding review of Pipe\u2019s performance and credit origination/collection processes. See further comments under covenant management.

However, we are closely monitoring the following which would be in breach of \u201csoft\u201d covenants in place: (mid-July data)  Min annualized revenue (SaaS): $739,620.00 (L6M >= 1M) Min YoY growth rate (sub 5M): -19.87% (>= 20%)  Explanations (provided by Fortunafi):  On annualized revenue (SaaS): the main entity in breach is performing. It has a positive growth trajectory and more than 100K of short term cash on hand and no other obligations than a small PPP loan. On YoT growth rate (sub 5M): COVID\u2019s impact on the global supply chain has had an impact on some of the businesses (inventory delays). Also, there is some volatility in the businesses that receive large contractual payments on specific months. This can create mismatches when comparing months YoY.  Team observation: More granular data is being requested to get access to underlying trends on RSA obligors. This will inform if the above are systemic or conjectural issues of underwritten assets in the pool. We also recommend a more thorough monthy report from Fortunafi to pro-actively demonstrate risk management of assets. Further risk mitigation actions will be made following Fortunafi audit  FF01834\u00d7437 49.3 KB   FF021048\u00d7379 39.2 KB  Key ratios:  SPV CR: 123.47% Vault CR: N/A Vault Underlying CR: N/A Max single investee: 3% of DC Max ratio of non-SaaS/RR (Corl): 4.33% of DC   Harbor Trade As at Aug end: based on data reported by Harbor Trade Pool overview: Harbor Trade Credit is well setup to utilise Maker Vaults. Delays related to COVID and contractual negotiations with its new SCF buyers explain the current limit utilisation of Vaults. The team has reviewed financial statements and memos from upcoming buyer programs. New programs will allow HTC to diversify outstanding pool balance away from its current borrower concentration setup.

More than 320 loans have been underwritten to date. It is well setup to utilise Maker Vault debt ceilings. The team has been negotiating bigger contracts with single counterparties lately. The CU is evaluating so these do not breach agreed covenant thresholds.

RWA Foundation is being created as we speak following some KYC clearance. We then have to onboard the crypto-broker and check that everything is fine. While this is for SolarX, the same will apply to such investment. Per the poll, short term investment-grade bonds were favored by the community. I was trying to find a non-US-based instrument with significant liquidity but not much success so far.     Planet_X:  Also - any progress on putting some legal framework around Centrifuge assets?

Summary Decreased lending demand driven by tightening financial conditions led to lower stability fees and recurring income.

It is a commonly reported metric in the banking world for these financial reports. See: JPM / WFC   Also i should just say that i love these reports!   Thanks for the kind words and comments Andy. We are working on refining a revenue and net protocol income forecast that we plan to share with the community during the upcoming QSR meeting. This forecast will also make it\u2019s way into the financial reports as well, but given how early we are in the protocol\u2019s growth and how volatile the lending markets are it likely not be very accurate until these markets start maturing. We are working on capturing D3M income, SFs and stkAAVE rewards but it is much more complex to build into our queries than the standard vaults. Regarding RoE, we are actively tracking in our financial statements but haven\u2019t added to the reports yet. Will throw it in next month      George_Goognin:  Hey @Aes, Thanks a lot for the detailed report! Could you please comment a bit on why the average APY is so shy (2.7%)? Is it correlated with an ETH price drop?   Welcome to the forums George! I believe you\u2019re referring to the average yield listed on the lending business slide correct? If so that is determined by the mix of risk-weighted assets. Recently we\u2019ve seen an increase in WBTC collateral locked which has resulted in a higher overall portfolio yield given the higher stability fee rate on WBTC vs ETH. ",

Please let us know your thoughts and comments on these pages. A particular thank you to @pipko who is with us for the summer and who put together an enormous amount of data for this report. As always, also big thanks to @Kayleigh for all the work putting it together.  Summary Overall Net Protocol Income was 6.7M DAI, +33% from May and -23% from June 2021. Annualized ROE on a rolling 6mo basis has begun sliding from 70-80 towards 30-40%.  After-effects from rapid deleveraging in Q2 continue to ripple through the crypto economy (LUNA \u2192 Celsius \u2192 3AC \u2192 etc.) ETH/BTC prices continued their decline throughout June  ETH/DAI: 1,955 to 1,024 WBTC/DAI: 31,611 to 18,718 This has driven a substantial amount (impact of -1.4M DAI) of the decline in recurring revenues as vaults liquidated and users covered positions   Collateral locked also in sharp decline as major institutional users exit lending amidst broader market deleveraging  ETH locked in protocol from \u039e2.2M to \u039e1.5M WBTC locked in protocol from \u20bf34K to \u20bf63K driven by vaults protecting positions, as of 11-Jul-2022 collateral is back to \u20bf39K (due to Celsius loan repayment)   Total interest income decreased from 4.3M to 2.4M (-44%) month on month Overall income up on liquidations from a volatile month \u2013 from 8.6M to 9.5M (11%)  We continue to work towards solving one of the greater urgencies our protocol faces, which is correctly monetizing our balance sheet to match the cost and duration of our liabilities.  Key Strategic Discussions & Next Steps  How do we increase the slope of our balance sheet?  MIP65, Backed Finance MIP6 and other ideas to monetize our PSM How are we managing the pipeline for new RWA onboarding (Blocktower, others)? How are we managing the pipeline for new crypto collateral applications? Can we optimize parameters for existing vaults to drive usage?     Can we restructure delegate compensation to align incentives and intelligently manage the total cap? Can we ringfence GUNI DAI/USDC LP for Maker use only to capture a greater share of the fees? Discussion around developing a framework for recommending capital investment in onboarding new collateral types and maintaining existing collateral types Ongoing work on rationalizing operating expenses => 20-Jul-2022 Meeting  @Recognized-Delegates Please come to the G&R call to discuss these and other topics. Kindly familiarize yourself with the materials ahead of time. Thank you.  Selected Observations  QoQ Recurring Net Protocol Income (rNPI) declined from 21.3M to 5.0M DAI (-76%) mostly driven by change in assets and ongoing yield compression, offset by lower oracle gas costs Total interest income decreased from 4.3M to 2.4M (-44%) month on month Collateral locked also in sharp decline as major institutional users exit lending amidst broader market deleveraging MoM help on workforce expenses driven by overall phasing of drawdowns of CU budgets  Reminder: workforce expenses are reported on a cash basis so some CUs will have a timing issues with higher expenses one month and lower the next   YoY ETH lending market stabilizing and no longer in severe downturn. Long-term trend remains negative ETH lending market resumed its decline (-19.7%) on month-end Dai outstanding stabilizing around 6.5bn   Selected Slides All chart legends are now in 12pt to facilitate legibility during G&R calls, but will still burn your retinas if you\u2019re in Dark Mode  Continued pressure on overall collateral prices and lending demand2001\u00d71385 374 KB   rNPI drifting into negative territory as lower collateral prices have depressed lending demand2001\u00d71385 287 KB   Collateral prices overwhelmingly drivers of negative month-on-month performance2001\u00d71385 303 KB   Large month for liquidations as collateral prices undergo rapid decline2001\u00d71385 181 KB   Overview of interest income model and how to think about the lending business2001\u00d71385 382 KB   Overview of interest income decomposition into ETC, BTC, RWA, PSM and Other2001\u00d71385 412 KB   Lending business continues to contract2001\u00d71385 242 KB   Large increase in DAI/USDC v3 LPs as a leveraged yield farming strategy2001\u00d71385 196 KB   Overview of Expense Rationalization Approaches2001\u00d71385 393 KB   Overview of oracle expenses by collateral type2001\u00d71385 293 KB   Cumulative contributed profit by collateral type2001\u00d71385 301 KB   Illustrative financial framework for collateral profitability2001\u00d71385 428 KB   EOA stabilizing as main use for Dai in circulation2001\u00d71385 236 KB   ETH market share stable but overall decline in lending market2001\u00d71385 267 KB   WBTC market share also stable with minor improvements in lending demand2001\u00d71385 260 KB   Key strategic decisions and discussion2001\u00d71385 333 KB   Selected Market Sentiment Readings  image932\u00d7846 60.1 KB  ",

                    "content": "    adcv:   How are we managing the pipeline for new RWA onboarding (Blocktower, others)?    Thanks for bringing this up, this feels really important given the current pipeline of potential issuers and the existing discourse. There is clear desire for reform and improvement of current RWA practices. There are strong opportunities in the near-term RWA pipeline (I can speak specifically to the Centrifuge pipeline, but my feeling this is true of all RWA partners/providers. The potential for long-term solutions seems to be more clear given recent governance proposals. A pipeline management conversation to balance all of these factors is exactly what is needed. My thinking is that this could occur productively along the following lines:   Identify current appetite. This should really be a discussion about desired size over the short-term timeline. Ideally informed by the Strategic Finance perspective (current portfolio, market trends, revenue needs and opportunities, etc.), but also balanced against existing resource capacity. When we talk about doing some deals, but then holding off for a reformed structure, it would be great to understand what that actually means from a size and timeline persepctive.   Immediate opportunities for improvement. Along with appetite, I think it\u2019s critical to have an understanding of what should be prioritized, both from an asset class perspective and a process perspective, in the near-term. Less real-estate? More geographic diversity? More process documentation? Better legal framework? Obviously there is a world of desired improvements, but understanding what the DAO feels is most strongly a concern and an opportunity area is useful for issuers and service providers. Identifying where there may be low-hanging fruit we can collectively execute on would be ideal.   Long-term governance reform. RWA is a critical touch point within the recent governance proposals and discussion, so I think it\u2019s necessary to discuss it in the context of the RWA pipeline. There was some great discussion at the end of yesterday\u2019s DVC on this (not to mention the past two weeks) and it was centered around desires, timeline, and implementation. Taking what our current appetite is, where there are immediate opportunities, and then balancing this against a prospective timeline will help to focus activity. This is the least developed area in my mind, with the most unknown unknowns and details of governance plans still being developed, so there is no expectation of hard deadlines and details. But simply starting these discussions within the RWA context is really important for developing the long-term view.   Appreciate any feedback or other ideas from folks on this particular topic. Thanks as always to the Strategic Finance CU for some fine work. ",

However, I had proposed allowing a portion of the vault collateral to be investable in DAO approved investment options while MKR maintains a claim on the collateral in case of liquidation. This has the potential to increase SF fees but also commission fees, i.e. a % of the collateral\u2019s investment return would be allocated to MKR for referring the funds to investment providers via a shared revenue agreement. It is important to note that this structure would not be possible under the existing vault configurations but could be considered in the creation of new vaults.

One_Pastrami:  However, I had proposed allowing a portion of the vault collateral to be investable in DAO approved investment options while MKR maintains a claim on the collateral in case of liquidation.   One approach to lower SF sustainably and increase ROA is to effectively create a new variety of ETH/WBTC vault that allows rehypothecating the underlying collateral in exchange for a lower stability fee.

Is there a Dune dashboard to dig into the unprofitable collaterals? I\u2019d like to better understand if it is just bad debt in the protocol caused by vaults with this collateral + implementation expenses, or some other costs too.   @pipko put in some great work in digging into operating Oracles for various collateral types. This analysis is not surfacing bad debt, rather, it is allocating overall Oracle gas unit usage to each ilk type and subtracting it from net interest income to derive a proxy for contribution margin. Associated Dune dashboard shows the effortized gas usage per vault type, as well as highlighting the enormous work the Oracles team have put in to optimize these feeds. The takeaway is probably along the lines of \u2018smaller collateral types require a higher minimum usage to justify ongoing Oracle operation\u2019 and our next step is to derive a quantitative framework for determining the cutoff.

I am hoping it does not impact us since presumably these coins are held in binance blockchain. Here is the fulls details.   Short-term probably not. This announcement probably means Binance has onboarded as a Circle customer so that they can unwind the token wrapper and manage it as BUSD effectively. In aggregate it is probably better for market efficiency to have more concentrated liquidity in a CEX. Over time it also means the default choice for people to withdraw to on chain will be BUSD. At the moment there is virtually no liquidity on Mainnet so volume share impact on USDC will be minimal at first. But over time and to the extent that we have a PSM we should probably also have multiple ones, including BUSD. ",

Given Binance (BUSD) adoption is much greater than Coinbase/Circle (USDC), BUSD adoption can grow pretty quickly and uncorrelated to USDC providing with a similar PSM opportunity. Getting a little ahead of myself, but potentially BUSD PSM funds would prove sticky enough and \u201ccheaper\u201d to convert to USD for similar MIPs than the Bond Strategy. ",

In short A challenging month following the May crypto crash leading to lower lending demand and income, as well as lower liquidation income. PSM income was up 2% and net recurring income was down 44% month over month. On a year over year basis, all key metrics are up significantly with recurring income up 669x.  Recurring income decreased to 7M (-44% vs last month) DAI was never so safe. We are now above 2.61% in CET1 ratio (risk-weighted assets leverage ratio). The peg is super safe as we have 63% of our assets as liquidity reserves (fiat-backed stablecoins) But we have now a 61% exposure to USDC which is probably too much on a single counterparty (see here  for our view on it).

Please let us know your thoughts and comments on these pages. A particular thank you to @pipko who is with us for the summer and who put together an enormous amount of data for this report. As always, also big thanks to @Kayleigh for all the work putting it together.  Summary Overall Net Protocol Income was 5.1M DAI, -8% from April and -23% from May 2021. Annualized ROE has held stable at around 70-80%. Volatility continues to increase in this market and all the macro and crypto indicators are pointing towards a prolonged bear market with constrained spending and investment. To weather it, we need to nurture and grow our whales, increase the frequency with which the DAO\u2019s makes revenue-generating bets and improve our asset productivity.  Celsius In recent news, we observe the circulating rumors around Celsius and its announcement of paused withdrawals. We may see this customer exit the Maker system eventually. Celsius holds ca. 10% of the overall asset mix in the Maker system. They do appear to be posting additional collateral as recently as today so we are hoping for the best for everyone involved and that they will remain a valued customer going forward. At times like these, we also observe with some relief the conservative strategy followed by other large players, who haven\u2019t left the Maker vault system altogether but have substantially de-risked their positions in anticipation of a crash of this magnitude. We welcome their conservative approach and look forward to serving them more comprehensively when the weather turns.  Selected Observations  QoQ Recurring Net Protocol Income (rNPI) declined from 23.6M to 9.5M DAI (-60%) driven by change in assets and ongoing yield compression, offset by lower oracle gas costs MoM hurt on workforce expenses driven by higher monthly CU costs vs April  Reminder: workforce expenses are reported on a cash basis so some CUs will have a timing issues with higher expenses one month and lower the next   YoY ETH lending market stabilizing and no longer in severe downturn. Long-term trend remains negative Stabilizing ETH lending market slightly up (3.8%) on month-end - before the events of 13-Jun Dai outstanding stabilizing around 6.5bn   Selected Slides All chart legends are now in 12pt to facilitate legibility during G&R calls, but will still burn your retinas if you\u2019re in Dark Mode  Slide31625\u00d71125 219 KB   Slide41625\u00d71125 274 KB   Slide61625\u00d71125 210 KB   Slide51625\u00d71125 138 KB   Slide71625\u00d71125 196 KB   Slide81625\u00d71125 235 KB   Slide101625\u00d71125 234 KB   Slide111625\u00d71125 238 KB   Slide131625\u00d71125 178 KB   Slide141625\u00d71125 137 KB   Slide151625\u00d71125 143 KB   Slide161625\u00d71125 192 KB   Slide171625\u00d71125 137 KB   Slide181625\u00d71125 156 KB   Slide191625\u00d71125 174 KB   Slide201625\u00d71125 159 KB   Slide211625\u00d71125 156 KB   Slide241625\u00d71125 261 KB   Selected Market Sentiment Readings  upload_d734234dae72d749ff0f7c1a55f2a0651280\u00d7720 49.9 KB  ",

Summary Another challenging month as lower appetite for credit and decreased stability fees led to lower lending demand and income. PSM income was down 78% and net recurring income was down 55% month over month. On a year over year basis, all key metrics are up significantly with recurring income up 94x.  Recurring income decreased to 3.2M (-55% vs last month) DAI was never so safe. We are now above 2.79% in CET1 ratio (risk-weighted assets leverage ratio). The peg is super safe as we have 64% of our assets as liquidity reserves (fiat-backed stablecoins) USDC exposure has increased to 62% which is probably too much on a single counterparty (see here  for our view on it).

Sir, if you\u2019re asking why more folks were trading MKR in 2019 versus the bull-run of 2020-2021, it is because MKR is a BORING token. There are currently ZERO incentives to hold (unless you love Governance and Maker), there are no fancy-pants Yield Farms, you can barely use it to borrow(AAVE is the only brave protocol that allows it), it moves like a TURTLE, and gets no LOVE from the DeFi community. MKR in DeFi is the equivalent of a BOOMER stock. You know like your Ford, GE stocks of the world that my grandmother has owned for 10 years and returned 1.1% annually(ok I am exaggerating but you get my drift). Ya\u2013that\u2019s how folks view MKR. Hence, who wants to trade it\u2026  Being an MKR token holder is like being the kid who gets drafted last in schoolyard dodgeball. You know the one kid they choose last when there\u2019s no one else to pick   ",

GFXlabs:  Why are the Surplus Buffer and Pause Proxy assets (labelled as Treasury) characterized as equity? Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities, and is not typically described as specific piles of segregated assets. CC: @Kurt_Barry   This schematic representation is consistent with all of our prior reports. I draw your attention to the month of August when we went into some of these representation choices. To answer the specific question, we draw a distinction between Equity and Surplus Buffer. In this view, Surplus Buffer is the equivalent of retained earnings from accumulated stability fees. The superset is Equity, which captures protocol-owned and governance-controlled assets. ENS received by governance is therefore part of the protocol\u2019s economic perimeter (it could be liquidated for USDC for instance) and is generated externally. ENS and AAVE are not segregrated assets and are held by the Maker Protocol. The surplus buffer is captured in the accrued stability fees in vaults. It doesn\u2019t show up as a separate account on the Asset side as it is captured in the value of the represented assets re: @Kurt_Barry question  2. Why are DAI generated by the permissionless portion of the protocol listed as liabilities?     GFXlabs:  Why are DAI generated by the permissionless portion of the protocol listed as liabilities? Users are generating DAI on their own behalf against their own collateral. What is the reasoning for putting those DAI on Maker\u2019s PnL as protocol liabilities?   When taking a balance sheet view of MakerDAO the protocol, user-controlled vaults are assets and Dai issued is a liability. Minted Dai is redeemable, which is why it\u2019s a liability to the protocol. We provide a non-contractual historical engagement that we will redeem DAI at peg. I draw your attention to the MakerDAO whitepaper:  Creating a Vault is not complicated, but generating Dai does create an obligation to repay the Dai, along with a Stability Fee, in order to withdraw the collateral leveraged and locked inside a Vault.  The fact that it is permissionless doesn\u2019t change this distinction. We take the view that even a permissionless protocol is capable of being summarized through a balance sheet and income statement, even if the only people taking \u2018decisions\u2019 about its use are users external to the DAO and MKR token holders. Also, MakerDAO can take a loss on permissionless positions as user vaults can become undercollaterlized.  3. Why are assets of users backing permissionless DAI generation listed as assets for the protocol?     GFXlabs:  Why are assets of users backing permissionless DAI generation listed as assets for the protocol? Those assets are not used by Maker in any way. What is the reasoning for putting those assets on Maker\u2019s PnL as protocol assets, given that Maker describes its vaults as non-custodial?   The contra side of the above point. As MakerDAO is a permissionless protocol, it is an interesting discussion on how to represent things accurately and in a useful way for the community. This financial report and its associated balance sheet view is one, hopefully useful, tool among many to inform token holder discussions. In brief, locked collateral is not on our balance sheet. The moment Dai is drawn, we recognize it. What is recognized is a loan against collateral, not the collateral, which remains non-custodial.    Financial Report 2022-08    Starting position1920\u00d71329 148 KB   Providing visibility into the collateral backing DAI is critical for both MKR and DAI token holders. Not accounting for those assets would not be in the best interest of those token holders.  Can we explore considering vaults as loan guarantees? Would be interested to hear more on this if you would like to elaborate, particularly if it helps your role as a delegate.  4. Is it possible to explore establishing contingent liabilities for losses?     GFXlabs:  Is it possible to explore establishing contingent liabilities for losses related to Maker assuming bad user debt and then having subsequent unsuccessful liquidations? Presumably the number will be small if using historical data, but it seems like a good line item to begin including.   From its design, the whole of the surplus buffer is supposed to be this reserve, and the excess burned or directed to the Dai Savings Rate. As the collateral types get more complex than pure crypto collateral, it certainly makes sense to think of a design for a specific loss reserve. However, as the surplus buffer was not designed with this tiering, a view where all of it could potentially be consumed in a bad liquidation (as happened in 2020) is probably more realistic. I\u2019d actually be a huge fan of something like a segregated senior capital reserve to shield against losses, particularly to protect Dai holders and the protocol against losses. It would have to be deployed as a separate contract, perhaps a custom vault type or a form of locked DSR (e.g. some form of fixed-rate tiered stDAI, maybe even with term specs to match Dai maturity). But this is just an idea. Maybe there is something we can build out on the DECO tech stack for this.    Simple MakerDAO \u2014 Governance from first principles    Conceptually, layers of senior or cordoned-off risk-capital can more appropriately allocate layers of risk on the Maker foundation depending on the type of project envisioned. In this framework, tokenized wholesale RWA lending could be a senior layer of stDAI in the capital stack.      Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 24 November 2022   stDAI Vault Max capacity: 10m DAI Term: 6mos Rate: 1.5%    5. Is it possible to separate out DAI that has been realized vs what has simply been accrued as a receivable?     GFXlabs:  Is it possible to separate out DAI that has been realized vs what has simply been accrued as a receivable? If not, what information do you need to do that in the future?   This is a great question\u2013in theory until a vault is repaid, DAI has not been paid. However, from the moment a vault is opened, an obligation to repay is created, whether through a user manually closing a vault or through a liquidation. So we take the view that when a vault is updated by the protocol, the revenue is realized. In this view, it would be impractical to track accrued revenue.    Financial Report 2022-08      It\u2019s a completely different story and WIP for RWA vaults though, completely concurr. We are hard at work building out the capabilities to understand this more deeply and will shortly prepare a proposal for our expanded mandate appropriately.  6. Tracking how numbers are arrived at     GFXlabs:  Given the restatement of past liquidation income and @Davidutro stating that the numbers listed for GovComms is not in agreement with that CU\u2019s internal numbers, is there somewhere we can follow how all these numbers are arrived at so discrepancies can be caught in real time and corrected at the source or here?   Our data is sourced from our Dune queries: https://dune.com/stratfi/maker-stratfi-directory. We will hopefully come up with something more extensive in the coming months but equally as open-source, stay tuned.  You can consult most of the data that we use on the following dashboard  We have variations of this query that break out more ilk types for some of the decompositions For liquidation income, we were querying a bucket of income that historically consisted of PSM tin/tout fees, D3M realized income, MKR mints, and liquidations. To derive liquidation income, we took this large bucket and subtracted the other types. An additional type of income has since been added into the mix and was thus falsely labeled as liquidation income; we have fixed this. It is also very important to note this was an isolated error; every other view did not at all rely on this distinction of income and just considered the large bucket of income as whole. Hope this makes sense.   We also check Core Unit on-chain draws and compare them to reported expenses on SES\u2019 expense dashboard. For the specific instance of GovComms\u2019 expenses, we will connect with @DavidUtro directly to reconcile the discrepancy and correct the report above.  These are all great questions thank you Paper. ",

Explain to me what -192% YoY Net Protocol expenses is? -192% relative to what?   My point here on using percents is they are only useful is the sign is the same.  Look at the Nov/Oct -1.7M to -2.0M net protocol income, claim is -13% over the month.  Makes no sense to annualize this into -192%.   Imo one would talk about increasing losses as a positive number and say that these losses are increasing at a rate of 192% Annualized. Now I am getting old and my memory may be bad but I have read a lot of 10-Q\u2019s and have never seen negative percents > 100 as percent as a unit doesn\u2019t really have a lot of meaning when negative.  Positive 1000% - yes it has meaning, -200% by itself doesn\u2019t really have much meaning since -100% is basically the limit of a negative percent use to my mind.  Second point.  I have said this before btw.   To me Market\u2019share\u2019 is defined as a fraction of the Market.   So you\u2019d want to track the % of the relative Market Maker has here.   Giving numbers while useful and somewhat informative is misleading when taken as \u2018Marketshare\u2019 because if the total available market expands or compresses by a factor of 2 - you miss whether your fraction of the available market is expanding or compressing in these instances. Also just a chart peeve of mine.  Please label axes with the units.   I don\u2019t like to have to fish for these in titles or legends even though it is stated in the title or worse reference notes.  I consider lack of units on axes a growing problem with people presenting charts.    Similarly lack of definitions of how numbers were arrived as is a problem. Example: above chart uses term BTC. Is this really all of BTC or wBTC or am I wrong about that as well in that it includes wBTC, renBTC and whatever other BTC?   See what I am getting at. One last thing I have asked for in these reports is some sort of report, analysis summary.  Something a delegate or MKR holder can read in 5 min and understand where Maker is succeeding or failing, or whether something is status quo (flat).    Having read a lot of 10Q\u2019s it is always useful to see the quarterly summaries before drilling into data. I always find these reports interesting, but I also find stuff I have to sit and think about to garner some understanding of what is happening.   Things I really like in these is like the Overview or Protocol Profitability both as number/table and as a chart.   These make it easier for me to track some sort of run.  Personally I would really like to see these go back a bit farther or be quarterly as looking back 12 months at least from the sense of market cyclicality isn\u2019t very useful (great for short term change tracking but not to look at longer term cyclicality).   Unfortunately Maker changes everything on the order of a year so one might not even be able to do such a long term historical comparision/chart. ",

Our quarterly reports used to be a good occasion to review progress in a zoomed out time scale. To take a step back, what would be great is a source of live and trackable financial information updated on a regular basis, more frequently than monthly, and a deeper synthesis on a less frequent basis, looking back over multiple months rather than just the past 4 weeks. We can definitely iterate in this direction, it is a good point. Thank you MM ",

                    "content": "Hey @adcv - this is a great report - however I do have a few suggestions:     adcv:     With respect to tokenized private credit - and classification of the Drop1- Tokens. I would suggest that the criteria shouldnt be tokenized private credit for the centrifuge vaults for the following reasons:  Drop1 tokens are not held in the vault as security - they are held in the tinlakemanager contract the actual collateral in the vault is a MIP21 token as our reliance is directly on the real-world agreements to enforce the security - furthermore the liquidation status is set to manual the same as HVB There are no secondary markets in the Drop1 token  If you do want to use the tokenized classification for RWAs I think that this would only be appropriate if 2 conditions are met 1) It is a recognized token that Maker has primary reliance on for realizing on collateral; and 2) Automated liquidation is turned on so there is no reliance on real world agreements to enforce on the collateral With respect to using earning or a net income statement for these assets I think this is somewhat flawed for RWAs that dont have a RwaJar. As effectively where there is a stability fee on an RWA - when the draws are below the debt ceiling - as in Blocktower - what happens is when Drip is called on a vault is it triggers 2 key transactions - 1 booking the stability fee as income in the SB and a corresponding increase in the vault debt with respect to the stability fee charge - so effectively we have accrued the interest - and whilst we have recognized it as income - from a cash flow perspective we have deferred its payment until the vault is closed or the collateral is liquidated. This is fine for crypto native as given the interest is accrued and collateralized against a highly liquid asset - there is likely a high probability that the accrued stability fee can be converted and will be realized. For RWAs especially where liquidation is manual I think there needs to be an offsetting entry to reflect the fact that the funding of the stability fee has been accrued to the vault - to accurately reflect that not withstanding the increase in the SB - realization of that fee will not occur until vault closure/manual collateral liquidation. Likewise for MIP65 I think that we need to show the returns on an actual cash basis ie. when payments are received through the JAR - after the accumulated NAV has been sold and distributed back to the SB - as opposed to using an indicated weighted average yield to forecast income - specifically, when jar payments are made the actual income will need to factor in sell commissions. Likewise in an emergency shutdown - where income may be reduced by sell commisions.  WIth respect to the issues raised by @PaperImperium on vault debt - I think the way you have presented the asset and liabilities is appropriate and very similar to the way dealers and brokers would show margin loans in accordance with FASB keeping in mind that under FASB the collateral is usually marked to market on a daily basis.  In essence what I am suggesting overall - is if the SB balance is being used to make investment and funding decisions - we ideally should generate a cash flow statement - that adjusts for accruals and other reserves we may wish to allocate to the less liquid RWAs ",

I don\u2019t have a satisfactory idea of how to square this with on-chain transactions\u2013in the ideal, every modification or entry would happen on-chain. So what is missing perhaps is a decentralized off-chain oracle for measuring RWA NAV values to allow for on-chain mark-to-market?

Summary Higher December stability fees drove higher net interest and recurring income, despite a 10% decrease in risk weighted assets from November. Net protocol income was up 40% month over month, driven by a 20% ($2.1M) increase in net interest income. On a year over year basis, net interest income increased 795%. Looking at the full year, net protocol income increased 2,541% vs 2020, driven by significant growth in risk-weighted assets which drove higher interest (+1,919%) and liquidation income (+3,342%). Overall protocol profitability is overstated due to oracle gas costs not being included (previously covered by the MakerDAO Foundation). Excluding the Oracle Emergency Fund, current expectations are for $18.9M in oracle gas costs in 2022 ($3M to repay Foundation oracle expenses from 8/1/21 - 12/31/21 and the balance for 2022).

Summary Ongoing drag on operating results as lending income  ETH/BTC looking for a bottom  ETH/DAI: 1,585 to 1,350 WBTC/DAI: 20,287 to 19,478   Slight interest income decline with some large vault exits Total income slightly higher from 1.6M to 2.4M (+51%) month on month Recurring Net Protocol Income down -2.0 from -1.4 last month  We continue to work towards solving one of the greater urgencies our protocol faces, which is correctly monetizing our balance sheet to match the cost and duration of our liabilities. To that effect, and after a lot of work, we are finally starting to receive proposals from credible counterparties. Thoughts, comments and requests on how to make the below materials more useful will be greatly appreciated.

This is simpler to manage and perhaps more reflective of the relative risk. ETH-B is not a particularly large vault type for us (end of May 60m against 1bn in ETH-A and ETH-C). Having all risk-assets at 1x is a fairly conservative view. Would be keen to hear your thoughts if you disagree though. Always happy to chat (incl on discord).

Please let us know your thoughts and comments on these pages. A particular thank you to @pipko who is with us for the summer and who is spearheading our efforts to organize a tactical budget reallocation process. Kindly vote on your targeted spend level for the next 6 months on the attached Signal Request.  Summary Overall Net Protocol Income was 1.6M DAI, -75% from June and -87% from July 2021. Annualized ROE on a rolling 6mo basis has begun sliding from 70-80 towards 20-40% and is now at 23%.  ETH/BTC prices bottomed out and began a slight recovery, still lower than May-2022  ETH/DAI: 1,024 to 1,710 WBTC/DAI: 18,718 to 23,733 Interest income recovery will lag behind price recoveries as vault users wait to reopen vaults before price consolidates   Major institutional users (notably Celsius) exited the protocol in tokens locked  ETH locked in protocol flat at \u039e1.5M WBTC locked in protocol down from \u20bf63K to \u20bf39K but flat before loan repayments   Total interest income decreased from 2.4M to 1.3M (-46%) month on month Overall income down with slowing liquidations from a reversing month \u2013 from 9.5M to 4.5M (-53%)  We continue to work towards solving one of the greater urgencies our protocol faces, which is correctly monetizing our balance sheet to match the cost and duration of our liabilities.

My analysis suggested (both in the past and still current) that the problem here is collateral.   If I have a choice of tossing $1USDC with virtually 0 fees to generate $1DAI that earns me some greater return somewhere I am going to do that vs. putting collateral into a vault and minting DAI.   The first comes with 0 fees and hence 0 risk, the second comes with SF fees and liquidation risk. Worse if the protocol does Emergency shutdown DAI basically converts to 80% USDC which sucks.  In fact this whole ES issue converting the $$ DAI value of my loan into 80% USDC is such a negative to me that I closed my DAI borrow on my ETH-USDC v2 LP, AND because if I look at security I also pulled the collateral from the vault. There are a lot of competitive protocols that are going to give you interest on your deposits while you borrow.    I have repeatedly suggested that Maker bring up a new rewards token MKR-R or people can search for my Maker3.0 proposal(  Proposal: Maker3.0 - The future of crypto lending. (RFC) ).   The point here is one can back and float a new rewards token that can in principle allow the protocol to achieve an effective negative rate without actually having the SF be negative.   One of the prime reasons to do a Maker3.0 is to be able to couple the MKR and MKR3 tokens with DAI and DAI3 to use two different Maker systems, with different goals to synergize each other from a collateral and vault perspective.  Maker3.0 also frees new ideas and DeFI experience into a new protocol and a new stablecoin potentially soft pegged to some other \u2018unit of value\u2019. After comments on G&R today by @ChrisBlec I am even more convinced a new Maker3.0 with DAI3 coupled with Maker2.0 and DAI with different goals and approaches could achieve significant synergies not possible with a single Maker.

This cuts into profits, but given there\u2019s runway & there\u2019s an alternative path to generating revenue from USTs, this could be considered imo       hexonaut:  This maybe makes sense once we have USTs online. The effects will be marginal though - we\u2019ve tried this in the past. The calculus for those seeking leverage is whether to take leverage or not, not so much the rates (within reason). This makes sense to me. Why do you care about if you\u2019re paying 1% or 2% when crypto is way more volatile even on a daily basis.       mhonkasalo:  Makes sense. The 2 ways to push back that come to mind here: 1. We can start lowering the rates & pull back up if there\u2019s no positive impact. We can find this out before much is sacrificed from the buffer (& move forward with the expectation that UST revenue will come in). 2. It\u2019s possible market has changed since 2020 & the impact would now be bigger (esp. with a marketing push). That\u2019s just a guess though I\u2019m not able to back it up with data.   ",

The market is noticing its strong peg, having resisted another major drop in assets prices, and its time to monetize the PSM but also prioritize USDC diversification. Both things can exist, the bond strategy\u2019s DC is currently 500M which is far lower than the current PSM balance amount, and MKR can create incentives to increase crypto vault usage and onboard other stablecoins.

                    "content": "No problem  Net interest income is generated from accumulating stability fees on yield-bearing vaults, deducted by our overall interest expense (which is the interest paid on Dai locked in the Pot, very little Dai and very little DSR atm) Non-interest income is mostly liquidation fees from vaults that are underwater and auctioned off. Maker collects something like 13% on these auctions iirc MKR outstanding is circulating supply yes, does not count the ~80k MKR in the Pause Proxy which we consider to be \u2018retired\u2019 and count it once it enters circulation again Book Value in this consideration takes the expansive view: surplus buffer + operating reserves. Operating reserves are funds sent to CU wallets for operating expenses. Theoretically they\u2019re \u2018out\u2019 of retained earnings and the DAO has less control over them than the surplus buffer or Pause Proxy. However, they are generally actually used for operating expenses and could be recalled back to the surplus buffer. So we count them as part of the same layer of \u2018Equity\u2019 that goes into Book Value. Book Value per token is just that divided by MKR outstanding. The thinking is to show a moderately comparable heuristic to TradFi banks (that rarely trade over 1.0x) and evaluate how the market is \u2018viewing\u2019 MKR tokens whatever that is worth. The higher the multiple ~ the greater the expectation for future growth essentially (which might become unrealistic expectations if the market pumps too much). PSM counts the vaults that hold USDP, GUSD and USDC for trading against DAI. We used to charge a fee on them which would show up in Trading Income. We don\u2019t at the moment so this is 0. We may go back to fees soon: [Signal Request] Changing USDC-PSM fees so it would show up in Non-Interest Income  Hope this is helpful, let me know if you have any other qs or comments ",

At the same time net profit for the period was 12.6m. My assumption was that the difference would be the cost of mkr burned. However, given the change in circulating mkr from March to April (-99 according to the FS) that would imply an average cost of over 17k for each mkr burned. Is there anything else explaining the movement in equity for the period other than the net income for the period and cost of mkr burned? ",
