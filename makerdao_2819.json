If this proposal is ratified, the YFI collateral type will be added to the Maker Protocol allowing anyone to lock YFI in a Maker Vault to generate Dai. Proposal Details This subproposal contains the domain work products required for the YFI collateral asset to be added to the Maker Protocol. More specifically, it includes the risk parameters, oracle solutions, and the necessarily smart contracts required for the successful onboarding of YFI.   Risk Domain Work: The risk domain team\u2019s work contains the following risk assessment for the YFI collateral type:  [YFI] Risk Domain Team Assessment    Smart Contracts Domain Work: The smart contracts domain team\u2019s work required to get YFI added to the Maker Protocol includes an assessment of the general and technical information about the YFI token, a risk summary, formal verification considerations, audits & related documentation, a contract logic summary, administrative addresses, and lastly a contract risk summary.
