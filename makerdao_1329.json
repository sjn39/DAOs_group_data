This post is not a reflection about the tactical events of the most recent days, that will be done somewhere else by many, but a nice and kind farewell to a project I have dedicated, with many others, several months of sweat and tears. Many, also among the NO voters (at least before the vote for LOVE became a proxy fight for the future of DeFi - whatever that means) have praised my work publicly and privately and also the good intentions of this Core Unit. For this, I am grateful. Those who worked with me over the months know that rather than being a plotter, I am just a fighter. Always have been. Hence I fought for the ratification of this Core Unit notwithstanding the changing times. And what a fight we put on. Those who worked with me over the months know also that beyond my sometimes abrasive tones I am a genuine hard worker and no BS professional, and I hope that by being that I have helped several pockets of this DAO to improve. Do nothing is often less risky in a complex organisation, but definitely not my style of living. This is definitely not the time of a financial oversight core unit in the DAO, but I will always remain a proud member of the community, a contributor, and a collaborator of some shape and form. Not sure what that will be, but I guess it will depend on the evolution of the community itself. Having married the great love of my life after we promised each other never to speak again - and we didn\u2019t for five years - I am too old and experienced to give definitive answer to what the future can be. Life is a repeated game. It is however a farewell to LOVE. And with this short letter, I want to thank fair supporters and opponents, and especially some CU colleagues that have made those last months of LOVE incubation insane yet awesome. In random order. I am missing many and I am sorry. @Retro, @wouter, @juan, @williamr, @Eumenes, @teej, @christiancdpetersen, @Aes, @adcv, @hexonaut, @Nadia, @MarianoDP, @monkey.irish, @Davidutro, @prose11, @LongForWisdom, @August, @SebVentures Do not go gentle into that good night ",

I don\u2019t think this was a vote against lending oversight or a second set of eyes on financial deals. I think this was a vote against a small group of people who are new to the protocol going to a cabal of VCs while actively excluding the community. For months now, rumors of closed meetings and slide decks always preceded each and every \u201cpublic\u201d information sharing by this group of you and those on the Growth Task Force. Even this upcoming call tomorrow only occurred after an email was circulating from you offering an earlier date to VCs. Trust has been broken over and over and over again, and I hope @Aes @hexonaut and @Hasu understand that they killed their own proposals. The lesson here isn\u2019t that Rune still has a lot of power. It\u2019s that when you look at the votes, people turned to Rune - a known dictator - over what they saw as a betrayal of Maker\u2019s ideals and encroachment by the funds on the DAO\u2019s autonomy, I think you generally do good work. I\u2019ve even heard people who lead the vote against you say privately that you did good work. But the methods that you and your colleagues employed managed to bring together a huge amount of tokens and raise a community outcry. I hope you stick around. But you\u2019ve got to learn to be more inclusive and less exclusive within a DAO. People reacted like this was a hostile coup because it was. Next time try to avoid such obvious special treatment to the funds. Good luck and all that jazz. ",

If you\u2019re interested in a chat, please feel free to DM me on the forums or reach me at [email\u00a0protected] As BlockTower made public on the LOVE vote, we voted YES precisely because we felt this was a vote for lending oversight and a second set of eyes on financial deals (both in crypto collateral and beyond). I think it\u2019s disingenuous to claim otherwise, despite some who viewed this vote as a proxy war about much more. All said, however, the lack of trust between community members is clearly an issue that needs to be resolved. I think you\u2019ve made some great points and would love to collaborate on some solutions ",
