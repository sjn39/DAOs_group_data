Resume  Today we store the bounties in a centralized database, I propose to store this data in arweave, decentralizing information from both the github base and the gitcoin base. Explorer There is no notification, it is necessary to be in discord or keep giving F5 on the page, or be notified by email of a new bounty or hackathon  Motivation I\u2019m an explorer, hunter and founder who loves being on gitcoin and I see exponential value in everything we build, I would like to improve this ecosystem. Specification  I estimate a 8 weeks  job between design construction, react application with all integrations  dExplorer Roundmap 1 and 2 weeks  build a new design Improve Search Filters Improve the Design of Featured Bounts built an application in React Integration with arweave  3 and 5 weeks  Mobile Application  6 and 8 week  Building a firefox/chrome extension as bounty notifications CrossChain Native - Ability to create bountys on any compatible EVM chain  Budget Budget required for construction is GTC 7736 GTC Why should this proposal go to vote? I am always thinking about improving the things I consume and use, I believe that improving the explorer will improve the relationship between bounty founders and hunters thus increasing the speed in building applications and joining web3 projects ",
