I realize we have a large Spanish speaking community and wanted to suggest two things   If I understand correctly, that category is just the Spanish section and has nothing to do with Latin America? Or am I mistaken? I think it should just be labelled differently as geography is a bit irrelevant to Maker.   Would we be better off marking that category as \u201cOther languages\u201d and set it up so people are free to create subcategories where discussions proceed in any non-English language? I imagine we have people who\u2019d like to discuss in German/French/Mandarin etc. and would be nice to let people choose to do so if they like.   ",

The Latin America Section was created as an idea from the Dai Action Groups, a MakerDAO CDIP of some groups bringing more adoption and education about Dai in LATAM. In order to answer going to go through the questions:   At the beginning it had to do with LATAM (also we started with some floks in Brazil), but it didn\u2019t get much adoption from Brazilian side. So yeah, right now don\u2019t know if it fits so well as LATAM. But as the people that do the most posts over here are from LATAM it might have some sense (?)   This can be a good idea, but as we saw with portugese maybe can happen the same and just the Spanish will prevail.       flipflopflapdelegate:  This is actually a good used-case for Discord\u2026   I agree with you ElPro, this is a very good example of why to use Discord.
