I am personally agnostic on which causes would receive income from the charitable trusts, but a major goal of the MPCU is to build constituencies that appreciate and value Maker\u2019s continued existence. That will provide us with advocates outside the cryptosphere as Maker demonstrates through concrete action that it is a force for positive change. Given that, can people propose possible methods of regularly (perhaps monthly) selecting charities to receive years of interest income from Treasury purchases? Note that I\u2019d like to avoid mention of specific charities. This is to brainstorm how we can distribute the (legally required in the charitable trust structure) stream of income to worthy causes without having everyone getting madder than a rained-on rooster every month. All suggestions welcome, just keep it to processes and not named causes. Thank you to @Planet_X for pointing out this may be a speed bump to consider ahead of time, as it is a requirement of the structure. ",

I\u2019d say that paying taxes (to a specific government, which funds x, y, and z\u2026) is as political as giving to charity, and that it\u2019s not possible to do anything meaningful without upsetting someone, somewhere. MakerDAO is a diverse community and we should probably avoid charities with a specific religious, political etc aim. On the other hand, there are charities that could directly or indirectly benefit the Protocol.  Girls Who Code ticks diversity and tech boxes, for example. (More cynically, what\u2019s the branding upside of that \u201cinvestment\u201d?) Or charities like EFF, which promotes digital privacy, free speech, and innovation - all of which I\u2019d expect just about any MKR holder would agree with by default, and without which, MakerDAO has problems. These are specific examples (sorry @PaperImperium) but I use them to make a point. There are both pragmatic and reputational benefits to the right kind of charity, as well as all the other reasons people typically give. ",

Some charities use their money far more effectively than others so I like the idea of referring to GiveWell or a similar organization to decide where the donations can have the greatest impact.     psychonaut:  GiveWell is mostly focusing on extreme poverty. I\u2019d like to see at least some money go towards shutting down the war against drugs   Fair point; I don\u2019t see why donations shouldn\u2019t go to different causes.     brianmcmichael:  I\u2019m not sure that these entangling alliances with certain regulatory jurisdictions, that consequently require us to make these inherently political decisions among participants of widespread beliefs, are in the best interest of the DAO or it\u2019s participants.   I hear you but I don\u2019t know that this is something we can escape. The world, and our activities in it, are inherently political and choosing to avoid dealing with regulators won\u2019t change the fact that regulators will have conversations and develop policies that can affect the way we operate, whether we like it or not. Having a voice in the conversation, however we choose to raise it, gives us an opportunity to express our vision and at least have a chance to shape the narrative. In terms of the different options we have for raising our voice, I think this one is pretty strategic.     omahalawyer:  Look at the top 20-30 charities or foundations that would qualify under your scheme (my guess Paper is you need one that is U.S.-based but can still have an international charitable purpose).
