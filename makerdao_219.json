                    "content": "Lately, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of cases where debt for popular vault types reaches their temporary ceilings. In some of these cases new debt is stopped from being issued even though DC-IAM is active and ttl cooldown since last ceiling increase/decrease has passed like in the image below.  2021-10-16_14-431134\u00d7988 103 KB  My concern is that these avoidable pauses in DAI issuance is pushing potential users to other similar services like Aave or Compound. A lot of the time issuance seems to spike suddenly right up to or just below the current ceiling, so I feel like timely responses would help growth. It\u2019s my understanding that there is a bot running to trigger these debt ceiling increases, though at this time it only runs once a day. I\u2019ve also triggered a few of these increases myself, like just after the above screenshot, but I don\u2019t think relying on observant users is a good strategy. Does anyone else feel like this is a problem, and if so, what can we do to mitigate it? Some suggestions:  Have the bot run more frequently (3 times a day now and 4 times a day when/if ttl is reduced) Have the bot actively monitor ttl for the different vault types and trigger once a possible adjustment opens up. Maybe consider how much gap has been eaten up since last increase and only trigger if say 30% or less remains. Have some sort of manual trigger in Oasis. Not a fan of this kind of solution since it increases complexity for users. Will also only help users using that specific UI. Have the Vat itself (or whatever appropriate contract) trigger the debt ceiling adjustment when DAI is minted. This will probably be way more expensive than my other suggestions and will also increase gas cost for DAI minting.  Thoughts? ",

If there is a profitable reward I guarantee one or more would perform that function. I also don\u2019t know how possible this is, but why not tie these to oracle changes? Sounds like the best way to deal with this is to have the bot run more often. ",
