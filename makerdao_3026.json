I\u2019m particularly interested in contributing to the Infrastructure grants but I am not all that techy and some of it is over my head. I think I am far less immersed in the ETH world than others here so I wanted to leverage the fantastic community we have going to crowdsource some crowdfunding ideas. Hopefully this can be an open thread for people to share their thoughts on the recent funding round and pitch why they are excited about certain projects/ grants. Cheers, OneBite ",
