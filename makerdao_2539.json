It\u2019s amidst struggling with keeping Dai from trading over $1 (which it has consistently for a long time). People just want Dai, have good reason to want Dai, have useful things to do with Dai, have ways to make money with Dai. We always knew, or should have known, or at least hoped that Ethereum would generate huge Sudden Dai Sinks. Just out of nowhere, a new product is launched that soaks up an additional, large amount of Dai.  We should have been imagining if suddenly 50 million additional Dai were needed, and planning for it. Well, it just happened, but with over 120 million Dai. How well did MakerDAO cope with this Sudden Dai Sink? The price spiked up, and if you wanted Dai you might pay $1.03, $1.04, or $1.05 (some paid more). Because suddenly people needed 120 million Dai, for reasons that made paying a few percent extra negligible. Personally, I think having only a few percent price spike in response to this event is pretty good, and should get better with scale. And scale MakerDAO should, since the next one might be bigger, and soon. ",
