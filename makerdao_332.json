Personally this has me optimistic that we will no longer be labelled as a USDC Proxy coin.  Note: This has nothing more to report, I do not recommend investment or anything of the sort.  ",

Celsius is even using PSM directly to acquire USDC, which is not surprising given that 3Pool on Curve, which has been the dominant and most important pool in terms of stablecoin price determination for quite some time now, has dai with a discount compare to USDC or USDT. Bascially dai is currently trading with a discount compared to USDC and USDT on the largest market, thus, PSM is the prefered vanue. This can change due to differnet things. Either supply of USDC, USDT increases in the AMM pools, or dai supply from volatile assets decreases.  ",
