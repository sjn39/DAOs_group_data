                    "content": " TL;DR  The MakerDAO community will be launching an \u2018official\u2019 DAI on Optimism L2. Optimism requires a 7 day lockup period when withdrawing tokens back to L1. The Maker protocol can reduce this lockup period and allow near-instant withdrawals of DAI. This solution can be expanded to cover other token withdrawals in combination with an AMM. Initial bridge soon. Fast withdrawals Q3/Q4 2021.  The most anticipated L2 solution Optimism is fast approaching their mainnet launch which is expected later this month. While Optimism brings with it the promise of much needed gas relief, there remains an unsolved problem with optimistic rollups in general - withdrawal times. Optimism\u2019s current design allows for transferring tokens from L1 \u2192 L2 near-instantly, but going in the reverse direction requires users to wait 1 week to allow for potential fraud proofs. This is a major roadblock to wider adoption if we want optimistic rollups to be a viable competitor to centralized alternatives.  1600\u00d7700 60.2 KB  The Maker protocol is uniquely positioned to provide a solution to this problem while preserving trustlessness and decentralization. Introducing the Optimism Dai Bridge with Fast Withdrawals - a bridge which will allow locking up L1 DAI to mint L2 oDAI as well as allowing oDAI to be burned in exchange for near-instant access to L1 DAI.  How does this work? First a quick overview of how optimistic rollups work. Unlike side chains, all the data to reconstruct the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) state is present on L1 at all times. There exists an unalterable transaction log called the Canonical Transaction Chain (CTC) which contains all of the individual transactions in a specific ordering. Anyone can look at this transaction log and reconstruct the OVM state. What this means is that although we have to wait 1 week to ensure that the result of the computation of the CTC is correct, we can have off-chain proof that the individual transaction is correct within a few minutes. Read more about Optimism.  1600\u00d7700 86.4 KB  The Maker protocol can take advantage of this by offering a token (fDAI) which represents a claim on the L1 DAI through a vault which allows locking up fDAI in exchange for newly minted regular DAI. fDAI is then validated by a Maker Oracle which can verify against the CTC. Upon finalization of the state, fDAI can be gracefully closed out and the vault loan repaid with interest. In effect we will have a stream of 1-week, very safe loans flowing out of Optimism and back into L1. This is a game changer not only for the Maker protocol, but the Ethereum ecosystem at large as we can finally offer a fast, trustless, decentralized off-ramp for optimistic rollups.  Maker as the Primary Optimism Off-Ramp  1600\u00d7700 61.9 KB  Maker has an opportunity to become the primary off-ramp for Optimism. The average user will not want to wait a week to get their assets into L1. The Optimism Dai Bridge can serve as the go-to service for exiting L2 in a timely manner. It would be unfortunate for Ethereum if we had to resort to a centralized provider to achieve this. We believe Maker can solve this problem for three reasons:  Liquidity - Maker has the ability to provide unlimited DAI liquidity. No Counterparties - Most other liquidity providers in DeFi require collateral lockup. This can result in high fees which is undesirable for users. With Maker there are no counterparties so the rate can be fixed. Trustless - Apart from the Oracles, there is no trust required to use this system.   General Token Swaps Expanding on this service we will be able to offer fast L2 \u2192 L1 swaps on any token by routing the trade through the Optimism Dai Bridge. Trades would work by swapping the token for oDAI on L2, swapping the oDAI for L1 DAI and finally swapping back to the L1 token. This requires an AMM to be present on L2 (such as Uniswap V3), as well as integrating with an L1 AMM. AMMs may want to support this directly in their own UI as well.  Timeline The project will be split into two deliverables:  Optimism Dai Bridge - Soon This will allow transferring L1 DAI to L2 oDAI and back again with the regular 1 week wait on the L2 \u2192 L1 direction.  Fast Withdrawals - Q3/Q4 2021 Allow moving from oDAI to DAI with near-instant settlement. Please note this deliverable is dependent on establishing the safety of Optimism L2 first and foremost.  Next Steps Due to the permissionless nature of Optimism, we will need to move fast to secure the initial Dai bridge. If the Maker community does not provide an official bridge then we risk another actor filling that role. The mandated actors will work to deploy the first version to coincide with the Optimism launch later this month. We will also be running a declaration of intent to confirm that governance wants to pursue building the fast withdrawal component. ",

On the other hand, if the order is transfer() followed by initiateWithdrawal(), the oracle should spot this. Either way, as soon as initiateWithdrawal() gets appended to the CTC, the oracle should know whether it is valid or not. If the oracle works correctly, there is no risk. If the CTC has a malicious tx and the oracle fails to spot it, Maker loses money no matter how we design the system since the user has DAI (minted from the vault).

In the opening post, it is claimed that  What this means is that although we have to wait 1 week to ensure that the result of the computation of the CTC is correct, we can have off-chain proof that the individual transaction is correct within a few minutes  So in what sense can the oracle fail/get tricked? Is it the double spend problem you highlighted earlier i.e. the individual transaction is correct but it is inconsistent with another one? If so, isn\u2019t the risk of this rather high i.e. can a user simply keep withdrawing DAI through the bridge and include enough double spends so that it becomes profitable for them? Or to ask differently, what is the risk of bad debt in this protocol? ",

We do not think this risk is high, but it\u2019s still there. If we allowed them to withdraw the DAI from the bridge directly then in the event of oracle failure, the users who have oDAI will lose funds as there is now more DAI in L2 than locked in the bridge. Imagine if the oracles drained all the collateral from the bridge then the L2 oDAI would become worthless. Using the fDAI mechanism shifts this risk to MKR holders instead. If the oracles fail then MKR holders have to take the loss instead of the average user on L2. This correctly aligns the incentives for MKR holders to prefer a very robust oracle system ",

But we still want a construction in which the attack on Oracles (or their technical failure) will hurt MKR holders, but not DAI holders. That\u2019s why minting DAI rather then simply releasing DAI from the deposit contract is, IMO, a safer, more decentralised and trust-minimised solution Releasing DAI directly from the deposit contract will make the bridge not much better than the M-Sig bridges that we seen all over the place today to other L1 chains ",

A brief update: We are working with their team who recently refactored their infrastructure (in particular the bridge design). We discussed opportunities to leverage their audits as we definitely want to be a part of their mainnet launch. I\u2019m not going to commit to a specific timeline right now as there are a number of different external entities involved (exchanges, oracle providers etc). Our conversation with them was very positive, we still have some technical questions we need to resolve, but all in all this is moving forward nicely. @ejbarraza , regarding Optimism, our team has been working on improvements to the Dai Optimism Bridge, including Echidna debugging work to; find invariant breaks, fix token interfaces in the L1 gateway, add directories to our yarn scripts, and more. I\u2019m in the process of setting up a follow-up call with the Optimism team to align our L2 fungibility design thoughts and bridge design progress. In both cases, our approach is to build a simple bridge, support fast withdrawals, and in due course look towards Maker Protocol deployment on L2 (although as you\u2019ll appreciate, this 3rd point is further down the road due to the complexities involved). In parallel we have also commenced discussions with StarkWare regarding Cairo and StarkNet - again supporting our Multichain Strategy. I\u2019ll provide a more comprehensive update and specific timeline once I have some more demonstrable details of the work completed. ",

Even with 2 days delay on governance actions, there should be plenty of time to coordinate action.\u201d Also, disconnecting the bridge would need an emergency Executive Vote? If so, how will the community deal with such a scenario that could take \u201chours\u201d to resolve?
