Monetalis charges about 15bps fee to connect Maker to the Baille GIfford funds so add that on and you get a .5% fee which is significantly lower than 1%.

                    "content": "Hi @Eumenes, Thanks for your response! There are two ways to best ensure that invested assets align with Maker\u2019s short-term liquidity needs, and both are interconnected. We\u2019re happy to highlight and provide additional color on top our original post:   Short duration assets: The target portfolio will invest in short duration assets. If you reference the Prime Auto ABS AAA example provided in MIP90, you will see that the top AAA tranche has a weighted average life (WAL) of 1 year and the second tranche has a WAL of 2.6 years. These investments will start paying back right after we purchase them.   Assets with low mark-to-market volatility: The best way to ensure that an investment has low volatility is to ensure that it is risk remote. We are seeking to purchase only AAA investments on Maker\u2019s behalf. These assets have deep, robust protections that make credit loss highly unlikely. As such, these investments seldom experience major mark-to-market drawdowns. To further reduce mark-to-market volatility, longer duration investments (which would otherwise be more exposed to mark-to-market volatility than short duration ones) will be invested in floating rate bonds, like CLOs. Floating rate coupons help insulate mark-to-market losses because the interest rate paid to investors rises and falls alongside broader market sentiment.   We have selected an asset mix that is short duration and insulated from mark-to-market risks. In response to your suggestion of investing in treasuries, we believe that short duration Treasuries are also a viable investment for Maker! Through MIP90, Maker will continue to gain exposure to Treasuries via the Money Market Fund portion of the investment plan. That said, the AAA rated securities offer a higher yield profile that we believe is an attractive risk adjusted opportunity to boost Maker\u2019s surplus buffer. In response to your concern about fees, we believe that this is an imperfect comparison. We are proposing an active portfolio management solution that has high fixed fees to maintain. In addition, I would point out that the fees you have mentioned are fees taken by ETF managers. This does not consider the cost of actually onboarding that ETF to Maker, which is considered separately in your referenced transaction. ",

SF are now mandated to direct onboarding of RWA collaterals. SF seeks to move forward with the work to onboard the deal outlined in MIP90 without waiting for a MIP ratification poll that wouldn\u2019t end until the end of January, essentially superseding the need for MIP90 to move to a vote. Approval of this poll will see relevant Core Units start the necessary work to onboard the deal that has been outlined in MIP90. This onboarding will still require an executive vote once appropriate work is complete. GovAlpha recommends a final onboarding poll to ensure Governance is happy with the relevant assessments before progressing to the executive vote. It is unclear at this stage what this means for MIP90. I suspect if this poll is approved, it will be withdrawn as it may no longer be necessary, but @Aes or @BlockTower will need to confirm this.
