(March 15th) The entire governance process from pre-proposal to formal onchain voting and execution of the code takes roughly 16 days not factoring additional time for debate to set specifics. So it is time to discuss the fee switch. Uniswap dwarfs the transaction volume of all the other dex\u2019s on Eth combined and LP\u2019s, while not earning UNI farming, make a killing from the transaction fees compared to lp\u2019ing anywhere else. My contention is a 5bps reduction will not have a material impact on people, and especially whales, lp\u2019ing in uniswap due the offset by the high transaction fees generated. Furthermore, large lp\u2019s are likely to also be large uniswap stake holders and will also benefit. Therefore I believe not only must we flip the fee switch, but the mechanism for rewarding uni stakers should be a buyback and distribution of uni tokens just like the sushiswap model. Burns simply do not work in practice as they do on paper for the material impact on the price of the token. Thoughts? And also why the lack of active discussion on such a monumental topic that could turn staking Uni tokens into a source of income for people for decades to come. ",

As for non-whale lp\u2019s, if bottom line was their biggest concern they would be lp\u2019ing on sushiswap already because you can earn sushi on top of transaction fees.

Also, we will never know if LP will leave or not if we don\u2019t turn on the fee switch to try it out. So let\u2019s just turn it on to see what happens.

Furthermore, when it comes to migration incentives, having the fee implemented across the board on V2 will help push LPs to migrate to V3 come May. Perhaps I\u2019m wrong though. Should that be the case, and there be a need to attract more LPs later on, it could be done with a portion of the fees earned from turning on the switch. So far as I\u2019ve seen the fees earned will accrue to the treasury. From there, it\u2019s a whole other matter what governance decides to do with that additional capital. ",

We have so much more to do than just focusing on the easy gains for now. We have to solidify our position as leading DEX. We have to ensure a nice migration to v3 and L2. We have to grow the ecosystem and dev community around v3. We should be discussing a new liquidity mining campaign to make up for the risks of moving liquidity to L2 (where smart contract risks are next-level compounded). I really think the main difference between Sushi and Uni is the short-term \u201cmuh gains & rewards now\u201d mentality vs. the long-term play and 4d chess Uniswap is playing. Uni v3 is probably going to reinvent DEX. We want LPs to migrate massively, we want to be as welcoming as possible to both LPs and swappers. We want new types of professional market markers to take advantage of concentrated liquidity so that swappers (retail) gets better prices (less slippage/price impact). It\u2019s not the time to be feeding on LP profit margins. When volume is up 10x, that will be the time. Until then, it\u2019s in our interest to focus on growth, not on rent-seeking. Also, we already have a HUGE treasury. What\u2019s the point to grow it with fees ? ",

I don\u2019t see engaging the fee switch on v2 as a short term \u201crent-seeking\u201d or \u201ceasy gains\u201d move. Rather, it goes hand in hand with the transition to v3, and LP migration incentives. At a base level, engaging the switch on the current protocol would work as a negative incentive for LPs to migrate. They would want to move from v2 pools with higher flat fees to v3 pools with lower or no fees (at inception) as those will naturally provide higher yields for them. In addition, the accrued fees from the switch help bolster the treasury. This increase in treasury funds can then be allocated, if needed, to additional positive incentives (UNI distribution) for LPs to migrate. In this way we can provide both positive, and negative incentives for LPs to migrate to v3 next Month. ",

Or at least just have a good debate on the matter. I guess it will make us, uni holders, feel more alive regardless of the outcome ! ",

                    "content": "First of all, I\u2019m super happy that a delegate with a sizeable amount of delegated votes comes here and actually discusses the proposals with us smaller holders/non delegates. It\u2019s not something that happens a lot.  Big delegates have been mostly absent and as a result, governance has been pretty much dead. I think this is changing, and I\u2019m really happy. We are hearing that community managers are being hired. As a sidenote I think we need more active moderation here. More precisely we need to delete threads about future airdrops as they are really counterproductive and encourage scammers preying on gullible users. We should have a big banner saying there are no more airdrops planned. Back on topic : I think we agree that our goal should be to have our LPs transition to v3, just like they transitioned to v2 about a year ago. V2 is the new V1 if you will. The transition should/will happen ; it\u2019s a matter of time essentially, insofar as V3 is a superior product and that it makes V2 (along with protocols who copy-pasted the code) obsolete. So turning on the fee switch maybe a couple of weeks (the timeframe is what should be debated here in my view) after V3 goes live on L1 (Ethereum mainnet) could help us give a wake up call to LPs who still haven\u2019t transitioned. But mostly \u2013 at least in my view \u2013 it would be a strong symbolic action for governance to take at this point. Because it will also serve as a huge reminder that UNI holders can come together and take a collective decision on a fee switch proposal. In this way, the DeFi community can be reminded that UNI isn\u2019t just a pure governance token : one of its main purposes is to act as a stake in future protocol fees. V2 fee switch also is a very nice compromise/middleground between no fee-switch at all and v3 fee switch. In any event I don\u2019t see the turning on of the v2 fee switch as having any bad consequences. The reason for that is that v2 will be a \u201clegacy\u201d product very soon and the volume should naturally drop sharply once v3 goes live (same as when v2 was launched, really). There are many advantages to a v2 fee switch turn-on proposal but one of them is that the code is extremely easy. As far as I know, it\u2019s a one-liner. I think one of the next step to envision is to come up with a full proposal and maybe post it on snapshot as an informal temperature check. But first we really need to debate this idea a bit more (especially the timeframe) and find additional delegates who would be willing to support this proposal. ",

I\u2019m no expert in this field but I can imagine that the concept of decentralized / distributed governance opens up quite some new research areas! I guess (and hope) this pro / con list for the fee switch will consider multiple perspectives though, in order to have a neutral baseline?  About the fee-switch itself: I\u2019ve got to admit that the Uni-Token having some additional financial, passive incentive was / is a (psychologically) nice thing, especially for small fish like myself (rather plancton). I do also understand the party that does reject this mechanism (why should you get money for \u201chaving stuff sitting around idle?\u201d\u2026 well\u2026 banks seem to have an answer about this :D). In the end I\u2019d have liked something like this: as long as you hold uni-token on an adress, all LP that same address actually provides receives a minor boost in collected fees. The more UNI you\u2019ve got, the bigger that bonus (though diminishing returns should really be considered). ALL of this bonus payment can be paid from the marginally increased trading fee that is enabled after activating the fee-switch. This way both UNI-holders and LP-providers would be fine and the distribution of UNI-token should even be optimized over time (due to said diminishing returns). I\u2019m not saying this is the best solution as I am very likely missing LOTS of aspects, but to me - so far - it seemed fair and interesting at the same time. ",

If UNI holders get rewards, more people trust in the protocol more people want to hold UNI \u2192 UNI is in the news.

We\u2019d love to get more insight from the community related to the following questions:   Which liquidity pools in v2 should be turned on? The idea of turning on the switch for three different pools that reflect the three fee tiers that exist in v3 seems like it might provide valuable data points in the event we decide to turn on the fee switch in v3.   In the event we do turn it on, should we turn it on completely (.05%, which is a 16% decrease in LP\u2019s income) or should we do something smaller to hypotest the sensitivity LP\u2019s have to a fee switch? For example, V3 allows the fee switch to be as small as .03% (a 10% decrease in income), and starting at 10% for v2 might provide insightful data for us to refer to later.   What is the best mechanism to reward UNI holders after turning the switch on? Burning tokens, buybacks, or consolidating all switch fees and converting to ETH/DAI/etc? There may be different tax consequences to each approach, so that is very important to consider here.   Additionally, it\u2019d be incredibly useful to hear from anyone who strongly believes we shouldn\u2019t turn on the fee switch in V2. ",

After what I learned from recent 88mph governance for their upcoming V3; I believe a buyback and distribute, to stakers in UNI, method would be best. Pros:   Creates an interest bearing token that could still be tied to governance (xUNI).   Auto-Compounding rewards stakers who remain holders and not speculators.   Cons:   Everyone will want to be staked and could lead to the overall pool being diluted. Split in liquidity between UNI and xUNI.   People could have their UNI locked up in different DeFi protocols and have to eat the gas to migrate over to the staking pool.   While I do think earning DAI from the risk of a potential bear market has merit, having a native token not tied to other protocols also decreases risk in my opinion. ",

This bonus could theoretically scale with the inidividual LP\u2019s amount of UNI-tokens, though I\u2019d highly recommend diminishing returns. With this approach LPs as well as UNI-holders would profit on the one hand while on the other hand UNI-hodlers would NOT be rewarded for idling around. The diminishing returns could be used to incentivise an increased degree of decentralisation / token-spread and thus keep some UNI-token in circulation. The said bonus-LP-gains would be funded 100% by the extra fees from enabling the fee-switch. I\u2019m no coder, but I guess it would be possible to realise this mechanism with some sort of staking of UNI-tokens. This way owners could put their UNI-token to use AND STILL be able to vote in governance (at least to my understanding). Something that - so far - did not work for UNI-token that are trapped in LPs. I see a problem with preventing UNI-whales to simply spread their UNI across several addresses and thus workaround the diminishing returns. But maybe there is a solution to this? In summary I guess I overlooked several red-flags and drawbacks of that idea, but so far it seems to me to incentivice new and small UNI-holders as well as LP-whales (but NOT UNI-whales) and negates the problem of UNI-hodlers being rewarded for not doing or risking anything.

                    "content": "Its time to get serious\u2026 I want to talk about the unfairness of the governance and the sustainability of the UNI Treasury value if the fee switch does not get turned on.  If we look at the submitted proposals, all of them besides one represented an attempt to dillute the value of UNI token holders and redistribute them to somebody else. Now, we have an attempt to siphon the funds for a DeFi lobby fund which represents yet another sell pressure proposal for the token.  Now, I dont know about you, but when I bought UNI token, I was buying it with the intent of deploying my capital effectively to propel the growth of Uniswap. I did not buy the token with the intent to become a piggybank for somebody else to siphon off all my value to 0. Proposing sell pressure proposals all the time is not sustainable for the growth of Uniswap\u00b4s treasury and presents a strong threat to the UNI token project as a whole. Afterall, who wants to hold a token which basically redistributes its value to other people?? Like the point of the token was it to be a governance token, but this is slowly becoming a charity type of a token where the only vote is to decide to whom we should give out money and how much\u2026  During the community call on the 2nd of June, there were people arguing against the proposal to turn on the fee switch who are not even UNI holders. People were arguing that paying the UNI token holders does not provide value to the Uniswap project as a whole, but this is completely wrong.  Let me explain: UNI has a treasury which holds a specific amount of UNI tokens. The value of this treasury is determined by the price of the UNI token. This means that if there are willing UNI token buyers, the value of the treasury grows. On the other hand, if there are willing sellers of the UNI token, the value of the treasury falls. Now, if we propose sell pressure proposals all the time with no buy pressure proposals, what is the incentive for anybody to be a willing UNI token buyer? Proposing dilution is clearly not a sustainable path for the token to be taking as it will diminish the buying power of the UNI treasury; therefore, there will be a limit on what it can fund.   Now, I think it would be much more beneficial for the protocol if we TURN ON the fee switch and PAY the token holders. This way we create a buy pressure proposal for the token which actively creates value in the form of a higher UNI price = more valuable UNI in the treasury = more things which we can fund in order to foster growth for Uniswap.   The main argument against the fee switch up until now was the fact the competitors would have an advantage by providing better LP fees and the fact Uniswap LPs would suffer. Now, I strongly think the situation has developed in such a way that these arguments do not hold true anymore. Uniswap V3 assured the dominance among DEXes with the timelocked code which cannot be copied over. This means that the competitors will not be able to simply adjust incentives to siphon off the liquidity of off Uniswap.   The second argument is also not valid because the LPs which suffer the loss of the income can simply offset it by buying UNI tokens and collect the fees to cover for the loss arising from the fee switch. Actually, this would be incredibly good for Uniswap as there would be a flood of willing buyers which would transfer their wealth into the treasury meaning Uniswap\u00b4s influence to propose sell proposals would increase tremendously in a sustainable fashion. Therefore, I see this as a net positive for the protocol All in all, I do think the time to turn on the fee switch has come. With arbitrum & optimism deployment around the corner, Uniswap is in the best position to further its position as the market leader among the DEXes & enhance the value of its treasury by a good margin.

                    "content": "From what I understand this argument relly on the fact that if the governance sells UNI the price must drop.  Proposing sell pressure proposals all the time is not sustainable for the growth of Uniswap\u00b4s treasury and presents a strong threat to the UNI token project as a whole. Afterall, who wants to hold a token which basically redistributes its value to other people??   Some context about my main point But there are multiple ways to go about selling lots of UNI :  Using a sell order (not a V3 based one as they are biddirectional until completion, a custom tiny fixed ratio swapping contract would be better I guess), this couldn\u2019t make the price fall by itself, this could only let it not raise. Proposing a project that is worth more in the mind of investisors than the cost in UNI for the governance, if the governance\u2019s project makes more people think \u201cwait shit this is cool I need to be a part of this\u201d and then buy UNI, than the number of UNI it sells, ok the price fall (or not rise with a sell order), but it will also rise more due to the influx of new buyers.   My main point So for me a project like an automated self rebalancing V3 position (like does charm.fi) where the profit are shared to UNI holders funded by selling UNI would rise the price more than it cost to do (because this is dope AF and this would sell the idea of high efficiency passive income on V3) and would force a bunch of people to buy UNI to take a part of the profits. The governance compete with almost no one and can just say \u201cwe are selling 25m UNI at 28$\u201d while people that will want to jump on board will have to compete with each others to get a part of the cake. Don\u2019t forget than governance could invest in other things too. I know some people were talking about investing in other new starting DeFi, then the governance would play an invesment funds like role.  0 sum games The fee switch is a 0 sum action, before you have 600$ of fee going to LPs, now you have 500$ for LP and 100$ for UNI holders, a UNI buyback, \u2026 This achieve nothing, you just moved a bunch of numbers arround, it\u2019s only changing the wealth distribution but doesn\u2019t create any new wealth. However if the governance use that money to provide it uniswap, it provides less price impact, will attract more transaction fees (from dex agregator such as paraswap, 1inch, 0x, \u2026). And thus the situation of the uniswap ecosystem is better in this state as the sum of LPs, UNI holders and governance is higher. There are ways to generate more money, why do you want to bother with something that bother LPs and just moves stuff arround ?  Other buy pressures Basically as long as when the governance sells UNI it uses them to create more value than the value of the UNI it sold (which is kinda like the whole point of invesment) the price of UNI can\u2019t drop just by a sell of UNI because their will be more buyers willing to buy thoses UNI. If there aren\u2019t thoses buyers that mean that the governance either messed up and is paying more money than something is worth or it isn\u2019t following profit as a target (like funding charity), at this point there is no reason to talk about making money, it\u2019s just not a goal anymore. Corporation (which you seems to target with dividend like rewards for UNI holders) invest all the time and they are mostly going fine. I don\u2019t see why the governance couldn\u2019t attempt this. You don\u2019t need to give money to UNI holders to create a buy pressure, you can sell them the idea of money but later.  A few sentences I feel commenting  Now, if we propose sell pressure proposals all the time with no buy pressure proposals, what is the incentive for anybody to be a willing UNI token buyer?  Because the uniswap governance would be capable to create more value with your money that you exchanged against UNI than you could doing yourself. Example with self rebalancing strategy, the bigger you are the more worthwhile this become (because gas fee become a smaller part of the total and you can rebalance more often)  The value of this treasury is determined by the price of the UNI token. This means that if there are willing UNI token buyers, the value of the treasury grows.  Distributing fees to LP is a bad way to go about it, if a higher UNI price is a target to you just do a UNI buy back with the fee switch money. Because there are 3 options with a fee switch distribution :  Markets are efficient and buyers perfectly match the value of the fee switch rewards, this is the same effect as a buyback but you wasted a lot and I mean a huge lot of gas doing a complex reward system. Markets are inneficient buyers under evaluate the opperation, the governance loose money, it could have won more using the fee switch dirrectly.  Buy backs are way clearer and achieve the same goal on the price. It is almost impossible to under estimate the value of a buyback, because well it is there and it is happenning, this can still lead to speculative reactions but they are all good for the price, everyone would consider twice selling his coins when a buyback is announced, because you know there is a huge buy pressure on the price. (actually they could sell instant if the buyback is a fixed size and instant  they could then try to be the first to arb it before others, but if it were to come from fee switch this would be a slow stream of buyback, not anything major to arb) For me there is way less chance for the buyback to be undervalued and the governance is yielding less results out of it, plus this is giving more power to the governance.  Simple path from A to B If the whole plan of a high UNI price is so the governance will be able to make money selling his own UNI in the future, why not keep the UNI in the governance and just use the fee switch to fund the thing the governance wants to fund in the first place ? It seems to me you have a huge complicated step of fee switch into UNI holders, the creating a buy pressure on the UNI price, then selling UNI in tresury to get funds. That can just be simplified by activate fee switch, use fee switch money to fund governance\u2019s expenses. This has way less unkown, is way simpler to do and require no middle man seeking to make money.  with the timelocked code  First forks are appearing, they aren\u2019t serious yet (only about ~15k$ of TVL) but we don\u2019t know how the situation will evolve, this is something really hard to enforce on the blockchain, the OFAC isn\u2019t capable to stop IRA from using ETH as an invesment medium, I have very high doubt about wether or not they can even force shutdown a concurrent that would steal V3\u2019s code.  The second argument is also not valid because the LPs which suffer the loss of the income can simply offset it by buying UNI tokens and collect the fees to cover for the loss arising from the fee switch.  Personaly, that not a problem for me, I\u2019m ok with LPs having less money, actually I\u2019m for a certain type of fee switch. My problem is that your option it\u2019s 0 summed.  A better fee switch alternative ? I think we should enable fee switch, all money would then be placed into providing liquidity on uniswap. This acknolege the other users of uniswap no one here seems to talk about, the swappers. What swappers like : high output for their swaps. This mean low swap fees and low price impact, the first one I don\u2019t think we need to change it, the 0.05% is already one of the cheapest way on the market. But the TVL we can just provide liquidity, own by a self rebalancing contract (for V2 pretty easy, litteraly receive LP tokens, and do nothing, there is no balancing and they compound by themself, V3 need a rebalancing stuff, there is also the question of does the V2 liquidity should be moved to V3 ? (I think yes, without a doubt personnaly)) This would draw more liquidity for everyone, as a transaction from an aggregator that would go on balancer would now go on uniswap instead, but this new transaction yielded by this better price impact would be shared accross all LPs. This will compound (up to a certain market saturation, we don\u2019t know how close is uniswap to it, maybe this can push so far that uniswap is capable to propose better prices than CEX, this might result in people who don\u2019t care about decentralisation but just want to trade to use uniswap then) and have really good results in the future. It\u2019s something we can setup now, not for us, but for the governance in 1 year, 2, or even more. As we all seems to agree on it\u2019s hard to get lots of money instantly, if the governance were to sell about 25m$ of UNI instantly, spliting accross multiple DeFi this would result in 11% of price impact. But if we setup a growing supply of money, in the future when needed this question will not be, just take it from the vault. ",

I\u2019ll then consider that all swaps on uniswap are made at 1% fee tier (the biggest).  feeSwitchRatio the part of that fees that are going for fee switch, I\u2019ll take 1/6 as this is the only possible value on V2.  numberOfDays is how long thoses fees acumulate, I use a plain multiplication and not proper APY as fee switch has no compounding feature, unless you manually go add them back yourself as LP (or other invesment) but this depends on case per case and complicates a lot for not a huge difference.  expectedUniAffectedByIt is the number of shares the fee switch is gonna be broken into, I\u2019ll take 564m970k520 as this is the current circulating supply of uni (according to coinmarketcap) and you can resonably expect it to be lower (as not all people would likely stake their UNI into a fee switch distributor contract)  UniPrice is the price of uni, this is used to normalise this with the volume with have on the left hand of the division (you could remove this to have a share per UNI)   Distributive fee switch Just trying to see how much USD would be yielded over one year per UNI gives use : (1500000000*0.01/6*365)/(564970520) = 1$60, remember that I\u2019ve already over estimated that likely. We can also include the current price too: (1500000000*0.01/6*365)/(564970520*27.27) we then see that per $ invested we produced 5.9 cents over 1 year (so ~6%). Fun thing then, given my estimation, how much should the price of UNI should be for the feeswitch yields to be equaly 40% apy (which was a high but still realistic target for V2), we then replace the price by x and ask to solve for x given a target of 40 cents produced per year: solve (1500000000*0.01/6*365)/(564970520*x)=0.4 for x = 4$. I\u2019m not saying that the price is gonna jump by 4$, nor that it\u2019s gonna lower it self at 4$. It\u2019s just that in comparision to the current price, if a distributive fee switch was enabled, the UNI price is very likely not gonna be effected much by it (it might actually crash if most people are here for the money, as if you want only money, a distributive fee switch makes no sense, sell your UNI and provide LP, use charm.fi and get way more money that way).  Buyback To compare this to a buyback it\u2019s a bit more hard, as this is a slow steady flow of money, I can\u2019t just go input that into 1inch and say \u201cwell the price impact is xx%\u201d as there is lots of trading on CEX such as binance too. So I\u2019ll just compare the number of money that this would generate per day to the trading volume of UNI. This is simply : dailyVolume*feeTierRatio*feeSwitchRatio as we don\u2019t try to correct for any length of time nor share between uni holders. This is 1500000000*0.01/6 = 2m5$ compare this to the ~400m of $ traded in the past 24h, and note that 400m$ is in the very low average compare to the past, if you go back 1 week we were arround 1b$.  Overestimation Remember that this is a huge overestimation since I don\u2019t even need precise value to proove my point, the 2m5 of fee switch money is already about twice the actual fees to LP in the past day (the main part is likely that most volume is made on 0.3% and 0.05%, not 1% like I estimated).

Not all of UNI would be accounted for in the first example, but I will not delve deeper there because nearly everybody agrees its not the optimal way to do things. In order to do a solid analysis of the buyback programme, you\u00b4d have to analyse sell volume and buy volume for the entire day and then add on top of the buy volume the amount which would the money coming from the fee contribute. Saying the contribution would be low is just outright irresponsible without conducting a proper analysis with deeper meaning. Another factors which cannot be accounted for via a simple analysis are the psychological effects of the market participants: there might be a switch of behavior when it comes to the supply of UNI which is totally left out. Such superficial estimates do not even provide a raw estimate of the effect the buyback programme would have. ",
