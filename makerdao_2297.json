The Request for Comments (RFC) phase continues until after the Timing Poll.  During this period, feedback and edits can continue to be made by the MIP Authors based on feedback from the community.    The Timing Poll is proposed on April 27th. This poll will provide the opportunity to select one of the two options listed below:  Proceed with the Ratification Vote of the 13 proposed MIPs and 2 sub-proposals immediately. Delay the Ratification Vote for one month (to allow time for competing proposals to be submitted by the Maker community).    The 13 Initial MIPs and 2 subproposals can be viewed below:  The 13 Initial MIPs MIP Editor Onboarding Subproposal Smart Contracts Domain Team Onboarding Subproposal  Timing Poll Outcomes 1. Proceed with the Ratification Vote If the Timing Poll resolves to proceed with the Ratification Vote of the proposed MIPs immediately, the vote will occur over four days, May 1-4. If that vote resolves to \u201cYes,\u201d the first Governance Cycle will begin on May 4. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between May 4 and May 6. 2. Delay the Ratification Vote for one month If the Timing Poll resolves to delay the Ratification Vote one month, a competition process would begin immediately. This process is a MIPs proposal process, where multiple versions of MIPs are presented as choices to the Maker community. For example, several versions of MIP3, which describe the Governance Cycle, might be presented. The deadline for submitting competing proposals would be May 20. The community would then proceed to vote for the proposal version they want to be included in the final MIP Set and put up for the ratification vote. Voting would occur May 23-26. Lastly, the final Ratification Vote would begin on May 27 and end on May 30. If the vote resolves to \u201cYes,\u201d the MIPs will be officially ratified and marked as \u201cAccepted,\u201d and the first Governance Cycle would begin on June 1. Once the Governance Cycle has begun, the formal submission of MIPs and Subproposals will occur between June 1 and June 3.
