Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Operating Agreement of 6S CAPITAL PARTNERS LLC (the \u201cCompany\u201d) or an applicable Series Supplement (as either may be amended from time to time, the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d). RECITALS WHEREAS, 6S CAPITAL PARTNERS LLC was formed as a Delaware series limited liability company pursuant to a certificate of formation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 14, 2020. WHEREAS, it is intended by the members that certain assets of the Company shall be a separate series with respect to the members of the Company and that the debts, liabilities and obligations incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a particular series of the Company will be enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the Company generally or any other series thereof, and none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Company generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series. WHEREAS, the members have created Series A pursuant to the Series A Supplement, dated _____, 202 WHEREAS, the Series A Manager is 6S Capital LLC. WHEREAS, Series A is a private lender authorized to make loans to fund the cost of the acquisition of real property and the development, re-development, retrofit or construction of single tenant retail and commercial real estate properties and improvements incidental thereto to (x) one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of 6S Development LLC or (y) one or more unaffiliated third-party real estate developers and to refinance stabilized property of such parties. WHEREAS, Series A of the Company is offering up to $30,000,000 of its preferred membership interests (the \u201cInterests\u201d) to fund a portion of the loans and the Series A operations. WHEREAS, Series A intends to enter into one or more revolving credit facility agreements in an aggregate principal amount up to $100,000,000 or more with one or more banks (a \u201cBank\u201d) or other private lenders to fund a portion of the loans and related expenses. WHEREAS, Borrowers desire to borrow monies from Series A from time to time subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth herein, the parties agree as follows: 1. The Guaranties To induce Series A to make loans to Borrowers, _______________ has delivered to Series A (i) a completion guaranty and (ii) a limited commercial guaranty (each a \u201cGuaranty\u201d) to secure certain obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement, the construction loan agreements, if any, notes, mortgages, title and hazard insurance policies, and other agreements executed by Borrowers in favor of Series A in connection with any loans made by Series A to Borrowers. (All documents referenced in this section, including this Master Loan Facility, are collectively the \u201cLoan Documents\u201d). The Form of Completion Guaranty and Form of Limited Commercial Guaranty are attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2, respectively. The Series A Manager or a Bank or private lender to Series A may request additional guaranties, each in its sole discretion, with respect to any loan made hereunder. 2. The Loans (a) Series A agrees to make one or more loans (each a \u201cLoan\u201d and collectively, the \u201cLoans\u201d), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein. (b) Series A shall only make Loans to Borrowers that have entered into an agreement authorizing Series A to receive certain management rights that allow the Series A Manager to participate in, or influence the conduct of, the management or development activities of the Borrower receiving the Loan in order to protect the rights of Series A as lender (a \u201cManagement Rights Letter\u201d), a form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B ). (c) Borrower shall submit to the Series A Manager in writing a request for each Loan describing the Project as set forth in this Agreement. For purposes herein, a \u201cProject\u201d includes the (i) acquisition of real property (whether title is held directly or indirectly through ownership interests in a special purpose entity (\u201cSPE\u201d) holding title to such real property), (ii) development, redevelopment, retrofit or construction of single tenant retail or other commercial real estate properties and other improvements incidental thereto, as the case may be, and the (ii) refinance of such stabilized properties. A Project may include one or more parcels of real property. (d) The proposed amount of each Loan shall be the amount set forth in the Loan Application and supported by the Budget and Appraisal (each defined below) as approved by the Series A Manager and or a Bank or private lender to Series A; provided, however, the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding, on a portfolio basis, shall not exceed the lesser of: (i) 90% of the appraised value of the assets underlying the Loans, and (ii) 100% of the hard costs to purchase and fully develop or construct the assets underlying the Loans. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201chard costs\u201d shall include the purchase price and other land and lot costs (including earnest money deposits for the purchase of land and lots); material supplies; fees to third parties; developer fees, construction management fees, interest expenses; and taxes and closing costs (including title insurance) as reflected on the applicable settlement statements. (e) No Loan shall have a term that exceeds the redemption date of the Interests under the terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement and Series A Supplement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Series A reserves the right to extend the term of an outstanding Loan and to make additional Loans after the redemption date of the Interests, so long as Series A can satisfy any redemption requests when made thereafter and subject to the approval of the Bank or other private lender, as applicable. 3. Loan Application (a) In connection with each Loan, Borrower shall submit the following to the Series A Manager: (i) A complete loan application in the form substantially similar as that set forth in Exhibit Cattached hereto (the \u201cLoan Application\u201d).

RECITALS WHEREAS, the Lender has agreed to provide to _____, a ___________________________ (\u201cBorrower\u201d), a loan in the amount of ______________________ and 00/100 Dollars ($.00) (the \u201cLoan\u201d) for the acquisition, development, retrofit, construction and lease of a single commercial retail or commercial space for __________________ to be located in _______________ (the \u201cProject\u201d); WHEREAS, the Loan will be evidenced by a promissory note made by Borrower payable to Lender of even date herewith in like principal amount (the \u201cNote\u201d) and will be secured by the Commercial Mortgage, Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Rents; Construction Loan Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d); together with any other documents governing or securing the Note (herein collectively the \u201cLoan Documents\u201d); WHEREAS, any defined term not otherwise defined in this Guaranty, shall have the meaning as provided in the Loan Documents. WHEREAS, the Guarantor has a financial interest in the Borrower and will derive a direct financial benefit from the construction of the Project; and WHEREAS, in order to induce the Lender to make the Loan to the Borrower, the Guarantor has agreed to execute and deliver this Guaranty. GUARANTY NOW THEREFORE, to induce the Lender to make the Loan available to Borrower, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:   Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Lender that the Borrower will acquire, develop, construct and complete the Project free and clear of liens in accordance with the Plans;   If the Borrower fails to do the matters specified in paragraph 1 above on or before the time periods set forth in the Plans, immediately upon such failure to perform, Guarantor shall:   (a) acquire, develop, retrofit, construct and complete the Project free and clear of liens in accordance with the Plans; (b) remove any lien arising from, acquiring, developing, retrofitting, constructing or completing the Project, and make payment in full to all laborers, subcontractors and materialmen on or before the date of completion for the costs of the Project and related costs; (c) pay all costs and expenses incurred in doing (a) or (b) of this paragraph 2, and pay to or reimburse the Lender for all expenses incurred by the Lender with respect to its carrying out of obligations otherwise imposed upon Borrower under the Plans.  The Guarantor expressly agrees that the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, without notice to or further assent of the Guarantor and without in any way releasing, affecting or impairing the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantor hereunder:  (i) waive compliance with, or any defaults under, or grant any other indulgences with respect to, the Plans; (ii) make advances for the purpose of performing any term or covenant with respect to the Plans which Borrower shall be in default; (iii) assign or otherwise transfer this Guaranty or any interest herein; and (iv) deal in all respects with Borrower as if this Guaranty were not in effect. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be unconditional, absolute and irrevocable and shall continue in full force and effect until terminated as provided in Section 16 below.   The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be primary, direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon pursuit by the Lender of any remedies it may have against Borrower, its successors and assigns, with respect to the Plans whether pursuant to the terms thereof or by law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lender shall not be required to make any demand on Borrower, or to sell at foreclosure or otherwise pursue or exhaust its remedies against the premises or any part thereof or against Borrower before, simultaneously with or after enforcing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantor. Any one or more successive or concurrent actions may be brought hereon against the Guarantor either in the same action, if any, brought against Borrower or any other guarantor or in separate actions, as often as the Lender, may deem advisable.   The Guarantor hereby expressly waives:   (a) presentment and demand for performance; (b) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and of presentment, demand and protest; (c) notice of any default hereunder or under the Plans and of all indulgences; (d) demand for observance or performance of, or enforcement of, any terms or provisions of this Guaranty or the Plans; (e) all other notices and demands otherwise required by law which the Guarantor may lawfully waive; (f) any defense to any action brought against Guarantor, including, without limitation, any defense based on any statute of limitations and on any legal disability of Borrower and any discharge and limitation of liability of the Borrower to the Lender whether consensual or arising by operation of law or any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor\u2011relief proceeding, or from any other cause; and (g) trial by jury in any action brought on or with respect to this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees that in the event this Guaranty shall be enforced by suit or otherwise, the Guarantor will reimburse the Lender, upon demand, for all expenses incurred in connection therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees.   If the Guarantor shall advance any sums to Borrower or its successors or assigns or if Borrower or its successors or assigns shall hereafter become indebted to the Guarantor, such sums and indebtedness shall be subordinate in all respects to the amounts then or thereafter due and owing to the Lender under the Loan Documents. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give the Guarantor any right of subrogation in and to the Loan Documents or all or any part of the Lender\u2019s interest therein, until all amounts owing to the Lender have been paid in full.   All rights and remedies afforded to the Lender, by reason of this Guaranty, the Loan Documents, or by law, are separate and cumulative and the exercise of one shall not in any way limit or prejudice the exercise of any other such rights or remedies. No delay or omission by the Lender in exercising any such right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver of any rights and remedies hereunder, and no modification or amendment hereof, shall be deemed made by the Lender unless in writing and duly signed by the Lender. Any such written waiver shall apply only to the particular instance specified therein and shall not impair the further exercise of such right or remedy or of any other right or remedy of the Lender and no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or any other right or remedy.   The Guarantor represents and warrants that:   (a) it has a financial interest in the Borrower; (b) it has examined or has had an opportunity to examine documents referred to herein; (c) it has full power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Guaranty, (d) this Guaranty is a binding legal obligation of the Guarantor; (e) the financial statements of Guarantor heretofore provided to Lender are, as of the date specified therein, complete and correct in all material respects, fairly present the financial condition of the Guarantor, and are prepared by financial professionals in a consistent manner; (f) there is no litigation pending or to the best of the Guarantor\u2019s knowledge, threatened against the Guarantor; and (g) no other fact or circumstance exists, which would diminish or negate the liability of the Guarantor to the Lender hereunder, or materially impair its ability to perform its obligations, and neither execution or delivery of this Guaranty nor compliance with the terms hereof will conflict with, or constitute a breach of or default under any agreement or instrument to which the Guarantor may be a party.   Until such time as this Guaranty shall have been terminated, the Guarantor shall provide to the Lender on each anniversary date hereof its financial statements in such form and detail as may be reasonably requested by the Lender. The Guarantor also agrees to provide the Lender with financial statements at such other times as may be reasonably requested by the Lender.   If any of the amounts required to be paid hereunder by the Guarantor, including, without limitation, the amount necessary to complete the Project and discharge all liens, is not paid within 10 days after the date written notice of such required payment is sent to the Guarantor by the Lender, the Guarantor hereby authorizes any attorney at law to appear for it before any court having jurisdiction and to confess judgment against it for the amounts then due together with interest, court costs, and legal fees in an amount equal to 10% of the amount due hereunder.

ARTICLE 2 THE GUARANTY Section 2.1 Indebtedness Guaranteed. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the prompt payment when due, whether at maturity or otherwise, of all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. If: (i) Guarantor fails to make any payment of any part of the Guaranteed Indebtedness when due; or (ii) the Note or Loan Documents under which such payment is due provide for any cure period, Guarantor fails to make any payment before the expiration of said cure period; then said failure shall constitute a default hereunder. Guarantor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Lender from any loss (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) resulting from any default by the undersigned under the terms of this Agreement. Section 2.2 Nature of Guaranty. This is an irrevocable, absolute, completed, and continuing guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection and shall not be affected by the release or discharge of Borrower from, or impairment or modification of, Borrower\u2019s obligations with respect to any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness in any bankruptcy, receivership, or other insolvency proceedings or otherwise. No notice of any extension of the term of credit already or hereafter contracted by or extended to Borrower need be given to Guarantor. The fact that the Guaranteed Indebtedness may be rearranged, increased, reduced, extended for any period, and/or renewed from time to time, or paid in full without notice to Guarantor shall not release, discharge, or reduce the obligation of Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Indebtedness, and Guarantor shall remain fully bound hereunder. It is the intention of Lender and Guarantor that Guarantor\u2019s obligations hereunder shall not be discharged at any time prior to the occurrence of both: (i) Payment in full of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; and (ii) Expiration of Lender\u2019s obligation to advance monies to Borrower pursuant to the Note or any Loan Document. This Agreement may be enforced by Lender and any subsequent holder of the Guaranteed Indebtedness and shall not be discharged by the assignment or negotiation of all or part of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. This Agreement may not be revoked by Guarantor and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or other debtor relief proceeding involving Borrower, or after any attempted revocation by Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made. Guarantor hereby expressly waives presentment, demand, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest and dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, and any other notice whatsoever on any and all forms of such Guaranteed Indebtedness, and also notice of acceptance of this Agreement, acceptance on the part of Lender being conclusively presumed by its request for this Agreement and delivery of the same to Lender. Section 2.3 Lender\u2019s Rights. Guarantor authorizes Lender, without notice or demand and without affecting Guarantor\u2019s liability hereunder, to take and hold security for the payment of this Agreement and/or any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security; to apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lender may determine; to obtain a guaranty of the Guaranteed Indebtedness from any one or more individuals or entities (\u201cPersons\u201d) and at any time or times; and to enforce, waive, rearrange, modify, limit or release any of such other Persons from their obligations under such guaranties. Guarantor hereby acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of all Persons to pay and satisfy the Guaranteed Indebtedness pursuant to their respective guaranties (including Guarantor\u2019s obligations under this Agreement) shall be joint and several. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Lender shall have complete discretion regarding whether, when, and how to exercise the foregoing rights. Section 2.4 Guarantor\u2019s Waivers. Guarantor waives any right to require Lender to (and it shall not be necessary for Lender, in order to enforce such payment by Guarantor to first): (i) Proceed against Borrower or any other Person liable on the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (ii) Proceed against or exhaust any security given to secure the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (iii) Have Borrower joined with Guarantor in any suit arising out of this Agreement and/or any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (iv) Enforce its rights against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; or (v) Pursue or exhaust any other remedy in Lender\u2019s power whatsoever. Lender shall not be required to mitigate damages or take any action to reduce, collect or enforce the Guaranteed Indebtedness. Guarantor waives any defense or right arising by reason of any disability, lack of corporate authority or power, impairment of recourse or of collateral or other defense of Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, and shall remain liable hereon regardless of whether Borrower or any other guarantor be found not liable thereon for any reason. Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation until such time as all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness has been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Guarantor does not waive any rights or claims it may have, or acquire, against the Lender or any holder of the Note arising from (i) a breach of the Lender\u2019s obligations under the Loan Documents, or (ii) such party\u2019s violation of law. Section 2.5 Maturity of Guaranteed Indebtedness; Payment. If the maturity of the Guaranteed Indebtedness is accelerated by bankruptcy or otherwise, then such maturity shall also be deemed accelerated for the purpose of this Agreement without demand or notice to Guarantor. Guarantor shall, forthwith upon notice from Lender of Borrower\u2019s failure to pay any Guaranteed Indebtedness at maturity, pay to Lender the amount due and unpaid by Borrower and guaranteed hereby. The failure of Lender to give this notice shall not in any way release Guarantor hereunder. Section 2.6 Lender\u2019s Expenses. If Guarantor fails to pay the Guaranteed Indebtedness after notice from Lender of Borrower\u2019s failure to pay any Guaranteed Indebtedness at maturity, and if Lender obtains the services of an attorney for collection of amounts owing by Guarantor hereunder, or if suit is filed to enforce this Agreement, or if proceedings are had in any bankruptcy, probate, receivership, or other judicial proceedings for the establishment or collection of any amount owing by Guarantor hereunder, or if any amount owing by Guarantor hereunder is collected through such proceedings, then Guarantor shall pay to Lender all court costs and Lender\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.

Any other action taken or omitted to be taken with respect to any security agreement, the Guaranteed Indebtedness, or the security and collateral therefor, whether or not such action or omission prejudices Guarantor or increases the likelihood that Guarantor will be required to pay the Guaranteed Indebtedness pursuant to the terms hereof; it being the unambiguous and unequivocal intention of Guarantor that Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the Guaranteed Indebtedness when due, notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, action, or omission whatsoever, whether contemplated or uncontemplated, and whether or not otherwise or particularly described herein, except for the full and final payment and satisfaction of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. Section 2.9 No Duty of Good Faith or Special Relationship. Guarantor acknowledges that Lender has no duty of good faith either to Borrower or Guarantor, and acknowledges that no special relationship, such as a fiduciary or trust relationship exists, between Lender and either of Borrower or Guarantor. Guarantor agrees that no such duty of good faith shall arise, and no such special relationship shall exist, unless pursuant to, and only to the extent set forth in, a written agreement that is signed by Lender and that expressly creates such duty of good faith or such special relationship. Section 2.10 No Duty to Mitigate. Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement, Lender shall have no duty to mitigate the amounts payable by Guarantor to Lender hereunder. Section 2.11 Application of Proceeds. Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement, Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that to the extent Lender realizes any proceeds under any Loan Document (including without limitation proceeds arising from the sale at foreclosure of any mortgaged property), such proceeds shall first be applied to that portion, if any, of the Guaranteed Indebtedness for which no person (including Guarantor) has personal or entity liability for payment, and shall then (and only after payment in full of the portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness for which no person has personal or entity liability for payment) be applied to the portion of the Guaranteed Indebtedness for whose payment Guarantor is liable. Section 2.12 Right of Setoff. In addition to all liens upon and rights of setoff against the moneys, securities or other property of Guarantor given to Lender by law, Lender shall have, with respect to Guarantor\u2019s obligations to Lender under this Agreement and to the extent permitted by law, a contractual possessory security interest in and a right of setoff against, and Guarantor hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges, and transfers to Lender all of Guarantor\u2019s right, title and interest in and to, all deposits, moneys, securities and other property of Guarantor now or hereafter in the possession of or on deposit with Lender, whether held in a general or special account or deposit, whether held jointly with someone else, or whether held for safekeeping or otherwise, excluding however all IRA, Keogh, and trust accounts. Every such security interest and right of setoff may be exercised without demand upon or notice to Guarantor. No security interest or right of setoff shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or conduct on the part of Lender or by any neglect to exercise such right of setoff or to enforce such security interest or by any delay in so doing. Every right of setoff and security interest shall continue in full force and effect until such right of setoff or security interest is specifically waived or released by an instrument in writing executed by Lender. Section 2.13 Subordination of Borrower\u2019s Debts to Guarantor. Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, whether now existing or hereafter created, shall be prior to any claim that Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower, whether or not Borrower becomes insolvent. Guarantor hereby expressly subordinates any claim Guarantor may have against Borrower, upon any account whatsoever, to any claim that Lender may now or hereafter have against Borrower. In the event of insolvency and consequent liquidation of the assets of Borrower, through bankruptcy, by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by voluntary liquidation, or otherwise, the assets of Borrower applicable to the payment of the claims of both Lender and Guarantor shall be paid to Lender and shall be first applied by Lender to the Guaranteed Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender. Guarantor does hereby assign to Lender all claims which it may have or acquire against Borrower or against any assignee or trustee in bankruptcy of Borrower; provided however, that such assignment shall be effective only for the purpose of assuring to Lender full payment in legal tender of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. If Lender so requests, any notes or credit agreements now or hereafter evidencing any debts or obligations of Borrower to Guarantor shall be marked with a legend that the same are subject to this Agreement and shall be delivered to Lender. Section 2.14 Additional Documents. Guarantor agrees to execute such documents and to take such actions as reasonably required by Lender to preserve and enforce Lender\u2019s rights under this Agreement. Section 2.15 Bankruptcy of Guarantor. Should Guarantor fail to pay Guarantor\u2019s debts generally as they become due, or voluntarily seek, consent to, or acquiesce in the benefit (or benefits) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, together with all amendments and revisions thereto (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"), or any other applicable liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, suspension of payments, or similar debtor relief law from time to time in effect affecting the rights to creditors generally (collectively, \u201cDebtor Relief Laws\u201d), or become a party to or be made the subject of any proceeding provided for by any Debtor Relief Law (other than as a creditor or a claimant) that it should consent thereto or shall fail to cause to be discharged within 60 days, then, in any such event, the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be, as between Guarantor and Lender, fully matured, due, payable (without regard to whether Borrower is then in default under the Loan Documents or whether the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any part thereof, is then due, owing or performable by Borrower), payable and/or performable in full by Guarantor to Lender upon demand, which, for purposes of Section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be the estimated amount owing in respect of the contingent claim created under this Agreement.

Lender shall have no duty to inquire into the authority or powers of Borrower or any officer, employee or agent of Borrower with regard to any Guaranteed Indebtedness, and all Guaranteed Indebtedness made or created in good faith reliance upon the professed exercise of any such authority or powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

This Note is performable in ______________ County, New York. NON-REVOLVING SINGLE ADVANCE NOTE. At closing of this Note (assuming no Event of Default under this Note or any other Loan Document) the Lender will, following compliance with Lender\u2019s requirements, make one or more advances at Borrower\u2019s request and Borrower will make payments, all as provided herein; provided, however, that there will never be owed on this Note, an amount greater than the principal sum of $_____________.00, and Lender shall not re-advance any amounts which may have been paid upon the principal balance. INTEREST RATE. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance of this Note from time to time outstanding which is not past due, calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed (the \u201cRate\u201d), except as otherwise provided herein, as follows: The Rate shall be the lesser of (a) the Loan Rate (hereinafter defined) or (b) the Highest Lawful Rate (hereinafter defined). The term \u201cLoan Rate\u201d shall mean the sum of __________ percent (___%) and the Index as hereafter defined. The Loan Rate shall be subject to change daily with changes in the Index. Any change in either the Loan Rate or the Highest Lawful Rate shall, after Lender gives only such notice as may be required by applicable law or regulation, be effective for purposes of determining the Rate as of the opening of business on the date of any such change. The Index is the maximum \u201cLatest\u201d \u201cU.S.\u201d prime rate of interest per annum published from time to time in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal (Central Edition) or in any successor publication to The Wall Street Journal (the \u201cPrime Rate\u201d). Borrower understands that the Prime Rate may not be the best, lowest, or most favored rate of Lender, and any representation or warranty in that regard is expressly disclaimed by Lender. Borrower acknowledges that (i) if more than one U.S. prime rate is published at any time by The Wall Street Journal, the highest of such prime rates shall constitute the Prime Rate hereunder, and (ii) if at any time The Wall Street Journal ceases to exist or ceases to publish a U.S. prime rate or if such U.S. prime rate is published infrequently or sporadically by The Wall Street Journal, Lender shall have the right to select a substitute rate that Lender determines, in the exercise of its reasonable commercial discretion, to be comparable to such prime rate, and the substituted rate as so selected, upon the sending of written notice thereof to Borrower, shall constitute the Prime Rate hereunder. The \u201cHighest Lawful Rate\u201d is the maximum lawful rate which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received, or reserved by Lender in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of New York (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under New York law), taking into account all charges made in connection with this Note which are treated as interest under applicable law. If at any time (i) the Loan Rate, (ii) interest on matured unpaid amounts, if applicable, as provided for herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, together with (iii) all fees and charges, if any, contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by Lender in connection with the loan evidenced hereby which are treated as interest under applicable law (collectively, the \u201cCharges\u201d), computed over the full term of this Note, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate of interest payable hereunder, together with all Charges, shall be limited to the Highest Lawful Rate; provided, however, that any subsequent reduction in the Loan Rate shall not cause a reduction of the rate of interest payable hereunder below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest earned hereunder, together with all Charges, equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued at the Loan Rate if such interest rate had at all times been in effect. Changes in the Loan Rate resulting from a change in the Index shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph. The rate of interest which may be charged under the terms of this Note shall never be less than __________**percent (%)** per annum (\u201cInterest Rate Floor\u201d). If at any time during the terms of this Note, because of this Interest Rate Floor, the actual rate of interest charged on the unpaid principal balance is more than provided elsewhere in this Note, then Borrower understands that at such times, the Interest Rate Floor as established in this paragraph will control over other provisions of this Note. PREPAYMENT. Borrower may prepay this Note in whole or in part at any time without being required to pay any penalty or premium for such privilege. In the event a prepayment is made, such payment shall be applied first against accrued but unpaid interest, then to the discharge of any expenses for which the holder of this Note may be entitled to receive reimbursement under the terms of this Note or under the terms of any other documents related thereto and lastly against the principal hereof. Any partial prepayment shall not postpone the due date or change the amount of any subsequent installment due hereunder. PAST DUE PAYMENTS. Lender may charge and collect a late fee of up to two percent (2.00%) of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment more than 15 days past due to the extent not prohibited by law. The annual interest rate on matured unpaid amounts shall be the Loan Rate plus two percent (2.00%) (the \u201cDefault Rate\u201d). DISHONORED CHECK CHARGE. Lender may charge and collect a processing fee of up to $35.00 for each check given by Borrower to Lender as a payment on this loan which is dishonored. PAYMENT TERMS. This Note shall be due and payable as follows: Interest only, shall be due and payable monthly, as it accrues, on the ] day of each and every calendar month, beginning [, 202_], and continuing regularly and monthly thereafter until [___ 202_]. Thereafter, principal and interest shall be amortized over [twenty (20]) years (the \u201cAmortized Term\u201d), with monthly installments of principal and interest, payable on the [] day of each and every calendar month, beginning [________**, 202], and continuing regularly and monthly thereafter until and including [_________, 202]**. Annually, monthly installments in each succeeding twelve (12) month period shall be adjusted to equal the amount necessary to amortize the unpaid principal balance over the remaining portion of the Amortized Term of the Note; interest being calculated on the unpaid principal to the date of each installment paid and the payment made credited first to the discharge of the interest accrued and the balance to the reduction of the principal. On _______**, 20**, all principal and interest then remaining unpaid, shall be then due and payable. THIS NOTE IS PAYABLE IN FULL AT MATURITY. BORROWER MUST REPAY THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE NOTE AND UNPAID INTEREST THEN DUE. THE LENDER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THIS NOTE AT THAT TIME. BORROWER WILL, THEREFORE, BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENT OUT OF OTHER ASSETS THAT BORROWER MAY OWN, OR BORROWER WILL HAVE TO FIND A LENDER, WHICH MAY BE THE LENDER, WILLING TO LEND BORROWER THE MONEY. IF BORROWER REFINANCES THIS NOTE AT MATURITY, BORROWER WILL HAVE TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF THE CLOSING COSTS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW LOAN EVEN IF BORROWER OBTAINS REFINANCING FROM THE LENDER. THIS LENDER WILL CONSIDER AN APPLICATION TO REFINANCE THE BALLOON PAYMENT AT THE TIME PAYMENT IS DUE, ON THE SAME BASIS AS ALL OTHER NEW COMMERCIAL LOAN APPLICATIONS. WAIVER. Except as otherwise expressly stated in any of the Loan Documents, Borrower waives notice, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand, presentment for payment, and protest and agrees that this Note and all liens securing its payment may be extended and re-extended and the time for payment extended and re-extended from time to time without notice and agrees that its liability on or with respect to this Note shall not be affected by any release or change in any security at any time existing or by any failure to perfect or maintain perfection of any security interest in such security. TIME OF THE ESSENCE. It is agreed that time is of the essence in the performance of this Note. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each Event of Default under the Loan Agreement constitutes an Event of Default under this Note: A default shall not be an Event of Default, if a monetary default is cured within 10 days and a non-monetary default is cured within 30 days following the delivery of or the mailing of written notice from Lender to Borrower\u2019s most current address as reflected in Lender\u2019s business records specifying the existence of any such default. If such default is not cured within the applicable period, the default shall be an Event of Default without need of any further notice or action by Lender. ACCELERATION AND WAIVER OF NOTICE. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the entire unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note to Lender shall, at the option of Lender, become and be due and payable forthwith without demand, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate, or the acceleration of the maturity hereof, notice of nonpayment, presentment, protest, or notice of dishonor, all of which are hereby expressly waived to the full extent not prohibited by law by Borrower and each other liable party. Failure to exercise this option upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise such option in the event of any subsequent Event of Default. COLLECTION COSTS. If the unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest due and owing on this Note is not paid at maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or suit is filed hereon, or proceedings are had in probate, bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, or other legal proceedings for collection hereof, Borrower agrees to pay Lender its reasonable collection costs, including a reasonable amount for attorneys\u2019 fees. LOAN CHARGES. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower and Lender at all times to comply with the applicable New York law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits the Borrower to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under New York law). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Note or under any of the Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received with respect to such indebtedness, or if Borrower\u2019s exercise of the option herein contained to accelerate the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is Borrower\u2019s and Lender\u2019s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender be credited on the principal balance of this Note (or, if this Note has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby and by the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the usury ceiling from time to time in effect and applicable to such indebtedness evidenced hereby for so long as debt is outstanding. To the extent that Lender is relying on the Texas Finance Code, as amended, to determine the Highest Lawful Rate payable on such indebtedness, Lender will utilize the indicated (weekly) rate ceiling from time to time in effect. To the extent United States federal law permits Lender to contract for, charge or receive a greater amount of interest, Lender will rely on United States federal law instead of the Texas Finance Code, as amended, for the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law now or hereafter in effect, Lender may, at its option and from time to time, implement any other method of computing the Highest Lawful Rate under any other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable law now or hereafter in effect. RIGHT OF SET OFF. Borrower grants to Lender a contractual possessory security interest in and hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges, and transfers to Lender, all Borrower\u2019s right, title and interest in and to Borrower\u2019s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings or some other account), including without limitation all accounts held jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future, excluding however all IRA, Keogh and trust accounts. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or set off all sums owing on this Note against any and all such amounts. ADDITIONAL SECURITY. This Note is secured by all security agreements, collateral assignments, assignments, guaranties, mortgages, deeds of trust, and lien instruments executed by Borrower (or by any Guarantor) in favor of Lender or any other holder of this Note, including those executed simultaneously herewith, those executed heretofore and those hereafter executed, and by all such agreements, assignments, guaranties, and security instruments securing the payment of all other indebtedness of Borrower to Lender. REMEDIES OF LENDER. Lender shall have all rights, remedies, and recourses granted in this Note, the Loan Documents and all other instruments securing the payment hereof and the payment of all indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, howsoever evidenced, and those which are available at law or equity, and same: (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent; (b) may be pursued separately, successively, or concurrently against Borrower or any other liable party or against any one or more of them at the sole discretion of Lender and in such order as Lender, in its sole discretion, shall determine; (c) may be exercised as often as occasion therefore shall arise, it being agreed by Borrower that the exercise or failure to exercise any of the same shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy, or recourse; and (d) are intended to be, and shall be, nonexclusive. If any part of this Note cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of this Note. This loan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States federal law. NOTICES TO BORROWER AND OTHER PARTIES. Any notice under this Note shall be in writing and shall be effective when actually delivered or, if mailed, shall be deemed effective when deposited in the United States mail first class, certified mail, postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Note. Any party may change its address for notices under this Note by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party\u2019s address. For notice purposes, Borrower shall notify Lender immediately if Borrower changes its current address. JURY TRIAL WAIVER. IN RECOGNITION OF THE HIGHER COSTS AND DELAY WHICH MAY RESULT FROM A JURY TRIAL, THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING HEREUNDER, OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THIS CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Note and all other instruments executed in connection herewith and/or securing repayment hereof or performance by Borrower (the \u201cLoan Documents\u201d), including but not limited to: (a) The Additional Security as described above. (b) Commercial Mortgage, Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Rents executed by Borrower for the benefit of Lender and any subsequent holder of this Note, of even date herewith.

Right to Contest . Borrower may withhold payment of any tax, assessment, or claim in connection with a good faith dispute over the obligation to pay, so long as Lender\u2019s interest in the Property is not jeopardized. If a lien arises or is filed as a result of nonpayment, Borrower shall within thirty (30) days after the lien arises or, if a lien is filed, within thirty (30) days after Borrower has notice of the filing, secure the discharge of the lien, or if requested by Lender, deposit with Lender, cash or a sufficient corporate surety bond or other security satisfactory to Lender in an amount sufficient to discharge the lien plus any costs and attorneys\u2019 fees or other charges that could accrue as a result of a foreclosure or sale under the lien.

Policies shall be written in form, amounts, coverages and basis reasonably acceptable to Lender. BORROWER MAY FURNISH THE REQUIRED INSURANCE WHETHER THROUGH EXISTING POLICIES OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY BORROWER OR THROUGH EQUIVALENT INSURANCE FROM ANY INSURANCE COMPANY AUTHORIZED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. If Borrower fails to provide any required insurance or fails to continue such insurance in force, Lender may, but shall not be required to, do so at Borrower\u2019s expense, and the cost of the insurance will be added to the Indebtedness. If any such insurance is procured by Lender at a rate or charge not fixed or approved by the State Board of Insurance, Borrower will be so notified, and Borrower will have the option for five (5) days of furnishing equivalent insurance through any insurer authorized to transact business in New York. Borrower, upon request of Lender, will deliver to Lender from time to time the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender, including stipulations that coverages will not be cancelled or diminished without at least ten (10) days\u2019 prior written notice to Lender.

If Lender elects to apply the proceeds to restoration and repair, Borrower shall comply with the Lease terms in repairing or replacing the damaged or destroyed Property in a manner satisfactory to Lender. Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of such expenditure, pay or reimburse Borrower from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration if Borrower is not in default under this Mortgage.

If Lender holds any proceeds after payment in full of the Indebtedness, such proceeds shall be paid to Borrower as Borrower\u2019s interests may appear. Unexpired Insurance at Sale. Any unexpired insurance shall inure to the benefit of, and pass to, the purchaser of the Property covered by this Mortgage at any sale held under the provisions of this Mortgage, or at any foreclosure sale of such Property.

EXPENDITURES BY LENDER. If Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this Mortgage, or if any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender\u2019s interests in the Property, Lender on Borrower\u2019s behalf may, but shall not be required to, take any action that Lender deems appropriate. Any amount that Lender expends in so doing will bear interest at the Note rate from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Borrower. All such expenses, at Lender\u2019s option, will: (a) be payable on demand; (b) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (i) the term of any applicable insurance policy or (ii) the remaining term of the Note; or (c) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note\u2019s maturity. This Mortgage also will secure payment of these amounts.

The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law.

Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver. Tenancy at Sufferance .

Waiver; Election of Remedies . A waiver by any party of a breach of a provision of this Mortgage shall not constitute a waiver of or prejudice that party\u2019s rights otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy provided in this Mortgage, the Indebtedness, in any Related Document, or provided by law shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower under this Mortgage after failure of Borrower to perform shall not affect Lender\u2019s right to declare a default and to exercise any of its remedies. Attorneys\u2019 Fees; Expenses . If Lender institutes any suit or action to enforce any of the terms of this Mortgage, Lender shall be entitled to recover such sum as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorneys\u2019 fees at trial and on any appeal. Whether or not any court action is involved, all reasonable expenses incurred by Lender which in Lender\u2019s opinion are necessary at any time for the protection of its interest or the enforcement of its rights shall become a part of the Indebtedness, be payable on demand and shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of expenditure until repaid.

Limitation of Interest.  All agreements between Borrower and Lender are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever whether by reason of advancement of the proceeds of the Indebtedness, acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness hereof, or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the money to be advanced hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, (to the extent not preempted by federal law, if any) and any subsequent revisions repeals, or judicial interpretations thereof, to the extent any of same are applicable hereto and thereto.  If, from any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of any provisions hereof or of the Indebtedness or any other agreement referred to herein or therein shall, at the time fulfillment of such provision be due, involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law that a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto the obligations to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any circumstance the Lender shall ever receive as interest an amount which would be excessive interest, it shall: (a) be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the Indebtedness; or (b) be refunded to Borrower and not to the payment of interest.  It is further agreed, without limitation of the foregoing, that all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged, or received on the Indebtedness evidenced or secured hereby that are made for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum lawful contract rate, shall be made, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by amortizing, prorating, allocating, and spreading throughout the full stated term of the Indebtedness so that such rate of interest on account of such Indebtedness, as so calculated, is uniform throughout the term thereof.  This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between Borrower and the Lender. Merger.  There shall be no merger of the interest or estate created by this Mortgage with any other interest or estate in the Property at any time held by or for the benefit of Lender in any capacity, without the written consent of Lender. Severability.  If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Mortgage to be invalid or unenforceable as to any person or circumstance, such finding shall not render that provision invalid or unenforceable as to any other persons or circumstances.  If feasible, any such offending provisions shall be deemed to be modified to be within the limits of enforceability or validity; however, if the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be stricken and all other provisions of this Mortgage in all other respects shall remain valid and enforceable. Successors and Assigns.  Subject to the limitations stated in this Mortgage on transfer of Borrower\u2019s interest, this Mortgage shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.  If ownership of the Property becomes vested in a person other than Borrower, Lender, without notice to Borrower, may deal with Borrower\u2019s successors with reference to this Mortgage and the Indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Borrower from the obligations of this Mortgage or liability under the Indebtedness. Time is of the Essence.  Time is of the essence in the performance of this Mortgage. Waivers and Consents.  Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Mortgage (or under the Related Documents) unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Lender.  No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right.  A waiver by any party of a provision of this Mortgage shall not constitute a waiver of or prejudice the party\u2019s right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision.  No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Borrower, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender\u2019s rights or any of Borrower\u2019s obligations as to any future transactions.  Whenever consent by Lender is required in this Mortgage, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required.

All such books, records and documents shall be made available to Lender promptly upon written demand therefor; and, at the request of Lender, Borrower shall furnish Lender with convenient facilities for the foregoing purpose. All contracts let or amended by Borrower or its contractors and subcontractors after the date hereof relating to construction of the Improvements shall require agreement to the foregoing inspection rights, except where such rights have been waived by Lender in writing. 5.2 No Duty to Inspect It is expressly understood and agreed that Lender shall have no duty to supervise or to inspect the construction of the Improvements or any books and records, and that any such inspection shall be for the sole purposes of determining whether or not the Obligations of Borrower are being properly discharged and of preserving Lender\u2019s rights hereunder. If Lender, or the Independent Inspector acting on behalf of Lender, should inspect the construction of the Improvements or any books and records, Lender and the Independent Inspector shall have no liability or obligation to Borrower or any third party arising out of such inspection, except for liabilities caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender or the Independent Inspector.

Lender\u2019s failure to inspect the construction of the Improvements or any part thereof or any books and records shall not constitute a waiver of any of Lender\u2019s rights hereunder. Neither Borrower nor any third party shall be entitled to rely upon any such inspection or review. Lender and the Independent Inspector owe no duty of care to Borrower or any third person to protect against or inform Borrower or any third person of the existence of negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of the Improvements. 5.3 Borrower\u2019s Responsibilities Borrower shall be solely responsible for all aspects of Borrower\u2019s business and conduct in connection with the Property, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) the quality and suitability of the Plans; (ii) supervision of construction of the Improvements; (i) the qualifications, financial condition and performance of all architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers and consultants.

Borrower shall pay all fees for all inspections of the Property. Furthermore, if Lender determines in connection with any such inspection that extra services will be required of the Independent Inspector as a result of noncompliance with the Plans or any Legal Requirement, as a result of deviations from acceptable construction practices, or as a result of Borrower\u2019s failure to satisfy the requirements of any other agreement, then Borrower shall pay, in addition to the fees for such inspections, the cost of all such extra services. The fees charged by Lender for the services of the Independent Inspector shall not exceed the sum of $500.00 per month.  ARTICLE VI  ADDITIONAL SECURITY 6.1 Construction Contracts As additional security for the payment of the Indebtedness, Borrower hereby transfers and assigns to Lender all of Borrower\u2019s rights, title and interests, but not its obligations, in, under and to the Construction Contracts upon the following terms and conditions: (a) Borrower represents and warrants that each copy of any Construction Contract furnished to Lender is a true and complete copy thereof and that Borrower\u2019s interest therein is not subject to any claim, setoff or encumbrance, except as otherwise disclosed to Lender. (b) Neither this assignment nor any action by Lender shall constitute an assumption by Lender of any obligations under the Construction Contracts; and Borrower shall continue to be liable for all obligations of Borrower thereunder, Borrower hereby agreeing to perform all of its obligations under the Construction Contracts. Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold Lender harmless against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees) incurred by Lender and resulting from any failure of Borrower to so perform, unless Borrower\u2019s failure arises from Lender\u2019s gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of Lender\u2019s obligation under Loan Documents. (c) Lender shall have the right at any time (but shall have no obligations) to take, in its name or in the name of Borrower, such action as Lender may at any time determine to be necessary or advisable to cure any default under the Construction Contracts or to protect the rights of Borrower or Lender thereunder. Lender shall incur no liability if any action so taken by it or on its behalf shall prove to be inadequate or invalid, and Borrower agrees to hold Lender free and harmless from any loss, cost, liability or expense (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in connection with any such action. (d) Prior to an Event of Default, Borrower shall have the right to exercise its rights as owner under the Construction Contracts; provided, however, Borrower shall not cancel or amend the Construction Contracts or do, or suffer to be done, any act which would impair the security evidenced by this assignment without the prior written consent of Lender. (e) This assignment shall inure to the benefit of Lender, its successors and assigns, including any purchaser upon foreclosure of the Property or any grantee under a deed in lieu of foreclosure, any receiver in possession of the Property and any corporation formed by or on behalf of Lender which assumes Lender\u2019s rights and obligations under this Addendum. 6.2 Plans As additional security for the payment of the Indebtedness, Borrower hereby transfers and assigns to Lender all of Borrower\u2019s rights, title and interests in and to the Plans, and hereby represents and warrants to and agrees with Lender as follows: (a) Borrower represents and warrants that the original counterparts of the Plans furnished to Lender are true and complete.

(d) Lender may use the Plans for any purpose relating to the Improvements, including, but not limited to, inspections of construction and the completion of the Improvements. (e) Lender\u2019s acceptance of this assignment shall not constitute approval of the Plans by Lender. Lender has no liability or obligation whatsoever in connection with the Plans and no responsibility for the adequacy thereof or for the construction of the Improvements contemplated by the Plans. (f) This assignment shall inure to the benefit of Lender, its successors and assigns, including any purchaser upon foreclosure of the Property or any grantee under a deed in lieu of foreclosure, any receiver in possession of the Property and any corporation formed by or on behalf of Lender which assumes Lender\u2019s rights and obligations under this Addendum.  ARTICLE VII  LENDER\u2019S COMMITMENT 7.1 Loan Upon the closing of the loan evidenced by the Note, Lender shall advance the balance of the Note which has not been advanced for closing costs, as approved by Lender, into the Advance Account.

THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. 10.3 Binding Effect All covenants and agreements contained herein shall bind and inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or not, and in particular shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the holder of the Note. 10.4 Amendment No modification, consent, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by an officer of Lender, and then shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. 10.5 Severability If any of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. 10.6 No Waiver No failure or delay on the part of Lender to exercise any right hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by Lender of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 10.7 Correction of Errors and Omissions Borrower hereby agrees to execute such documents as may be required by Lender in Lender\u2019s sole discretion to correct any typographical inaccuracies in any loan documents, and any additional documents which Lender may require Borrower to execute in conjunction with any loan transaction. 10.8 JURY TRIAL WAIVER IN RECOGNITION OF THE HIGHER COSTS AND DELAY WHICH MAY RESULT FROM A JURY TRIAL, THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING HEREUNDER, OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THIS CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 10.9 Prime Rate Disclosure If any promissory note payable to the order of Lender by Borrower bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus or minus a spread, Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that it has been disclosed to Borrower that the \u201cWall Street Journal Prime Rate\u201d is one of the indexes used by Lender as an index for short term loans to substantial and responsible commercial borrowers and that the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate has been used in the Note only as an index, there being no representation by Lender that it actually charges such substantial and responsible commercial borrowers greater than or less than the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. In the event that there is more than one prime rate listed in the Wall Street Journal, the rate that shall govern Borrower\u2019s loan will be the higher of the rates listed. 10.10 Election of Remedies Lender shall have all of the rights and remedies granted in the Loan Documents and available at law or in equity, and these same rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be pursued separately, successively, or concurrently against Borrower, Guarantor, or any property covered under the Loan Documents, at the sole discretion of Lender.

If from any circumstance whatsoever the fulfillment of any provision of any of the Loan Documents, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto, the obligations to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity; and if from any circumstance the Lender shall ever charge or receive as interest or otherwise an amount which would exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law, the amount, if any which would exceed the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law shall be applied to the reduction of amounts, (other than interest) due under the Note, and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds such amounts (other than interest) due under the Note, the amount of such excessive interest that exceeds such amounts (other than interest) shall be credited or refunded to Borrower. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the indebtedness of Borrower to the Lender or otherwise shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread through the full term of such indebtedness until paid in full so that the actual rate of interest on account of such indebtedness is uniform throughout the term hereof. This Section shall control all agreements between the Borrower and the Lender. This provision overrides other provisions in any of the Loan Documents.

Loan Parameters The Loan parameters include, but are not limited to, the following:   Retail or commercial single tenant real estate projects or properties in the USA.   Borrower is or has engaged a developer with at least 10 years of real estate development experience or otherwise acceptable to Lender.   Borrower consents to background check and results of background check are acceptable to Lender.   New construction or refinancing of stabilized completed projects.   Stabilized means a project that (i) is collecting rent from the tenant or (ii) has been delivered to a tenant which is obligated to pay rent, and all operational obligations of Borrower are satisfied.   The tenant lease must be executed and enforceable at or prior to closing of the loan. The lease may be build-to-suit or ground lease; either double net or triple net.   Term of loan is determined by the Series A Manager, provided that the term may not exceed the term of the tenant lease. The Series A Manager may agree to a loan renewal option upon maturity of a loan subject to the requirements of our Bank (or other secured lender), as applicable.   No Loan may have a term that exceeds the redemption date of the Preferred Membership Interests under the terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement and Series A Supplement. However, we may extend the term of an outstanding loan and make additional loans after the redemption date of the Preferred Membership Interests, so long as Series A can satisfy any redemption requests when made thereafter and subject to the approval of the Bank (or other secured lender), as applicable.   Floating interest rate or fixed interest rate loan.   Loans may be interest only or amortizing.   Minimum equity requirements (measured at closing date only) on a loan portfolio basis:   a. 30% for new construction loan b. 15% for refinancing of a finished project for approved tenants c. 20% for refinancing of a finished project for discretionary tenants Equity includes (i) capital deployed (with supporting documentation to the satisfaction of the Lender) by Borrower into Project, (ii) the difference between the appraised value of the collateral and the loan amount, provided that such collateral falls within the scope of activities authorized by the Lender, or (iii) cash or cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities in an account subject to a control agreement in favor of the Lender. Example: Appraised value equals $8MM and the loan amount is $5MM. The $3MM difference would be equity so long as we have a senior lien on the entire project. For multiple loans with the same Borrower, the Lender may request cross collateralization. Likewise, the Lender may, in its sole discretion, determine the equity amount on a portfolio basis to the same Borrower. Our Bank (or other secured lender), as applicable, may require us to increase or lower the above equity requirements.   100% secured, first priority security interest in favor of the Lender and enforceable assignments, as applicable   For construction or retrofit loans, construction must be ready to begin within 30 days or less of closing the loan   Written reports from the Borrower including:   a.

It is seen as giving more legal certainty that the contents of the agreements are interpreted by professional judges only. Regarding arbitration, the documents I\u2019ve seen so far are subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts, i.e. no arbitration clause. For financing transactions I do not see a lot of advantage in arbitration. It would make litigation more expensive since parties would have to pay, in addition to their own legal team, the arbitrators (normally 3) as well as the institution under whose rules the arbitration takes place, such as the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).
