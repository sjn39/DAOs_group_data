Usage metrics will include TVL, transaction volume, daily-active users, and more.  Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):  The 0xHabitat team and community is a collection of governance and scaling nerds, united in a vision of affordable on-chain governance for decentralised communities and collectives across the Ethereum ecosystem. We value open-source collaboration, decentralisation, and security. Habitat is operating as an holocratic organization, growing our community by using several coordination tools, which include 0xhabitat\u2019s token governance, democratic signaling, and multisigs. Optimism enables balanced scaling for better user adoption, and 0xHabitat wants to utilize this scalability to provide optimal governance and smart contract tools that are not currently suited for Mainnet.  Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):  DAOs on Ethereum struggle with low participation rates, plutocracy, and stop-gap tooling. The main reasons are high gas costs on Mainnet - not only resulting in less voting turnout but also in missing features for incentives or new solutions. Rollups bring a new and extended design space for DAOs and communities. Scaling voting, delegation, treasury management, and many more social features and tools. Habitat is building with EIP-2535. This standard allows organisations to use already existing contracts (facets) on Ethereum and easily develop new ones. Making it easy to share and iterate working DAO tools. With the HBT token DAOs can upvote highly demanded solutions (contracts) that are then implemented and used by everyone. Our goal is to provide developers, decentralized organisations and teams a place on Optimism to grow their community in their tailored way. The EIP-2535 (Multi-Facet Proxy / Diamond Standard) allows to host a set of features within our unified framework, Gemcutter. The Habitat project is part of a broader mission that gives normal people non-technical control over their underlying contract, which is achieved through EIP-2535\u2019s innate modularity. This can be realized through contract upgrade preset packages stored on-chain and contract node package libraries stored off-chain. The shared javascript library between Gemcutter and an onchain app can allow for a git-like, crowdsourced development infrastructure that leads to more developer and DAO-to-DAO collaboration. The goals of our mission will be met by:  Evolving the Gemcutter hardhat plugin and development environment for writing modular contracts as front-end components using automatic ipfs verification, natspec, and React hooks with useDApp. Publishing a UI with the same functionalities as Gemcutter, which includes a presets and facet modules library that auto-generates a front-end for any contract made with Gemcutter.  The Habitat governance modules will be natively integrated as part of this larger ecosystem of builders. We are in active collaboration with useDApp and Sourcify, and have received considerable support from the creator of EIP-2535, Nick Mudge. We also have a designated channel for our Gemcutter framework on the Official EIP-2535 Discord. Once the Habitat Application is ready, users can deploy their Diamond and use Gemcutter to manage it, which will provide most of the needed tools to operate a DAO on Layer-2. In cooperation with the communities launching on Habitat, our project will look to extend the Habitat DAO toolset library. Using the native Habitat token, new features can be voted in, and will be verified to ensure the security of each DAO that implements the feature (Token curated registry). With this proposal we ask the Optimism Community to support the growth of the Habitat Application to make DAO tooling more accessible for Ethereum users, Developers, DAO-members, and in general; Builders of a better World.  823\u00d7305 26.4 KB   How will the OP tokens be distributed?   45% of OPs dripped into HabitatDAO treasury and the answer for \u2018how will this amount be distributed?\u2019 will be given through the HabitatDAO voting process(creating proposals and accepted by voting power holders majority)  Proposals on launch Usage / Incentivation   45% for developer grants to build management modules for Habitat ecosystem or integrate into Habitat  new modules open bug bounty operations   10% for public testing with marketing  Unlock of OP is based upon the following Milestones:  Milestones   Prototype - In Progress   1. Deploy Prototype version on kovan-optimism - July  DAO Factory (only blockchain) HabitatDAO for dogfooding   Modules to be managed: governance, treasury, subDAOcreation  Decision types: VPMERC20 (VotingPowerManagerERC20)  Token creation, distribution and staking for producing VotingPower       2. UI for prototype (factory excluded, only Habitat DAO usage) - July  3. Cover with tests prototype - August  MVP   4. Deploy MVP to testnet  Launch Wizard for user DAO creation new Module: Token Launchpad new Decision Types: Multisig Server for security services   5. Cover with tests mvp  LAUNCH   Public beta testing Bug bounty program Deployment to Optimism   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?  By providing a secure, modular platform that optimally rewards communities, users, and developers, liquidty and usage can grow cyclically. OP tokens will be used to incentivize the activity of DAOs within the Habitat app, natively on Optimism. Through a gradual token distribution (drip), Habitat will provide users with educational experiences of DAO processes, giving both decentralized governance beginners and experts a home on Optimism. Developers that are aiming to extend the functionalities of the Habitat app, the Gemcutter framework, and/or compatible contract modules can also receive OP Tokens from 0xhabitat in a grant-style process. Doing so will allow the platform to scale, serving larger communities with more capital.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Using our underlying framework, Habitat hopes to create a cyclical economy of DAO-to-DAO collaboration that rewards developers for their contributions. Developers may gain the ability to monetize the usage of their contract modules and Habitat could help enable this if the community decides it is in our interest. In addition, we aim to gain loyal users of our community governance modules due to their ease of use. The modular approach would allow customizations and a variety of management modules specifically tailored for secure upgradeability and inter-DAO coordination. Moreover, due to the lacking upgradeability of other DAO management platforms, coupled with the fact that migrating DAO treasuries require considerable coordinative effort, we believe that communities would benefit from an upgradable Diamond proxy that they control. That way, if their contract needs an additional feature, they can implement it within their own development environment, or they can use Gemcutter, thereby contributing to the entire ecosystem through open re-usability of the new module.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  Distribution and rate would be based on initial traction and interest into the Habitat product offering. Targeting 9 to 12 months, we would adjust distribution to properly reflect community growth after the first few months.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  This will be subject to Habitat community vote after launching the application. Habitat would be looking to allocate 5% of total token supply matching co-incentives to the OP Token.  Future  0xHabitat is open to run Onchain Governance Funding for Optimism in Q4. The Optimism Collective is welcomed to use 0xHabitat for community operations and spearheading scalable on-chain governance within the Ethereum Ecosystem.

What stage of development and use would you expect to be in at that time?   As soon as the testnet app is ready, we could do testing incentives, so we get feedback and learn what can be improved. (July - August) After that, and once internal governance system is running, the OP tokens could be allocated to a dedicated treasury within the DAO. Same goes for the developer grants to build new modules. (August-September)     Justin:  Incentivizing DAO usage is interesting \u2013 what kinds of specific activities would you expect to incentivize. Once incentivized, which uses do you expect to be the stickiest for OP users?   Creating a Community, creating attached treasuries, creating budgets and subDAOs within these could be incentivized. Reaching a certain TVL within the communities and treasuries is important to support the idea. Frequent and organic usage can be measured with data. Incentives could be allocated on a weekly basis to avoid \u201ctourists\u201d.     Justin:  Are you creating a public good that would be eligible for retroactive public goods funding?   We plan to decentralize all aspects of the application and look to make it available for as many people as possible. I don\u00b4t know if that qualifies for RAPGF. ",

Deployment still open - therefore hard to judge, no social proof Requested OP amount is too high, will be adjusted to represent projects unproven status. Distribution is good, Usage of DAO treasury needs more detail.  The 0xHabitat team is eagerly working in the background, to get this deployment running for future consideration among the OP Community. @OPUser / @Justin / @ScaleWeb3 / @linda / @polynya / @Bobbay_StableLab / @lefterisjp / @SEED_LATAM_Joxes It means a lot to us to get your eyes on our progress and your input towards our mission. OP and Ethereum ecosystem is a place for builders of a better world, and your meaningful and polite commentary shows that clearly. Thank you all again and see you soon in the future rounds! ",
