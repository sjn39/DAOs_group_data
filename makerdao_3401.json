Next Steps   @juanjuan to summarize today\u2019s call & proposed Working Group Representative List (this post). There will be separate forum threads for each Representative Group so anyone can propose themselves as a Representative > these will be decided within that group. (Coming soon, and will be linked bellow). Core Units in RFC. Public Draft, or that have been Approved can go to @amyjung or @juanjuan or we will reach out to get the sentiment on how they want to move forward with incentives/MKR while the overarching framework is being defined.

Below is the summary of current sentiments. This ongoing document outlines more detailed answers. This comment thread will be updated with more core unit responses.  Questions  Are/were you planning to include vesting in your core unit? What are some of your expectations on vesting for your core unit? (Details around amounts, time frame, structure, etc will be helpful) Would you be willing to wait for a higher level framework from the working group? If so, what timeframe are you willing to wait for a framework to develop? Are you willing to adapt to the framework that is developed?   Current Positions     Name Core Unit Position Comments     Derek Protocol Engineering Maybe Moving forward with the proposal in place. If the WG comes up with a competitive framework then we will for sure assess.   SebVentures RWF Yes Waiting for WG Framework, looking for something quick and fair.   Wouter/Juan SES Maybe Will hold off until Freeze Day ~ 3 Weeks   Kathleen Strategic Marccoms Yes The team is flexible to adjust its incentives when a higher-level framework is developed. Looking for end of year.   LongforWisdom GovAlpha Yes Willing to wait for WG Framework til it\u2019s done, or it\u2019s decided one is not needed.   Doopson Risk Yes Mostly fine to go with WG solution, ideally solution is \u201c1 month before next possible adjustment for our quarterly budget\u2026 I may only not like to correlate MKR bonus with Maker\u2019s performance, which would have some conflict of interest problems for Risk.\u201d   Seth Content Production Yes It would help our proposed hiring process if we could get something figured out by the end of May.
