                    "content": " Background Recent discussions in the community have brought back old concerns regarding existing Centrifuge legal structures. While such discussions contribute to improvements in governance, they also bring more long-term uncertainties to the collaboration between Maker and the 3rd party borrower community. Centrifuge is an integral part of that long running network. Recent proposals for an arranger model and other RWA-related R&Ds have created a further option to the future relationship between Maker and the borrower community via scalable intermediaries, called \u201carrangers\u201d. While these discussions are still at consultation stage, Centrifuge has expressed its willingness and commitment to becoming an \u201carranger\u201d and upgrading its structuring framework to accommodate Maker tokenholders\u2019 requirements.  Motivation This consultative poll has two purposes:   Committed and uncommitted debt ceilings: To consult the community and MKR tokenholders on whether they wish to have a global debt ceiling cap implemented across vaults utilising old Centrifuge structures.   Discretionary debt ceilings: To consult the community and MKR tokenholders on whether they see a discretionary debt ceiling as a viable option to Centrifuge-related projects that prove the establishment of acceptable structuring by the DAO (i.e. upgraded and robust). Discretionary is an exception rule applied on a case by case basis. It is not globally set. See notes below for clarification.   The definitions for terms used in this poll are described below.  Current state Below are the current committed and uncommitted debt ceiling amounts (in DAI) by each Centrifuge-facilitated project. Committed DC total DAI 64M. Uncommitted DC total DAI 165M. Global DC: 229M.

It\u2019s an aggregated DC for all DROP issued via Centrifuge. The total is calculated by summing up the committed debt ceilings, the uncommitted debt ceilings plus any discretionary debt ceiling. Global debt ceiling cap: The maximum amount of global debt ceiling (in DAI) that can be committed to the aggregate of all Centrifuge RWA Vaults. It\u2019s a maximum cap for all DROP.  Note the intention of a global debt ceiling cap is to prevent the total debt ceiling from exceeding a certain amount (in DAI). MKR tokenholders have discretionary rights to increase the global debt ceiling cap should they have reasonable reasons for its review (e.g. acceptable legal structuring).  Committed debt ceiling: The total amount of Vault debt ceiling (in DAI) that is committed to all Centrifuge RWA Vaults. The definition of commitment is based on an on-chain vote post-risk assessment in which a requested DC by the borrower was specified and approved by vote. Recent signal requests still under deliberation are not included in the calculation (e.g. RWA006). These may be considered discretionary debt ceilings (see below). Uncommitted debt ceiling: The total amount of Vault debt ceiling (in DAI) not yet committed to any Centrifuge RWA Vault. The definition of an uncommitted debt ceiling is based on a requested DC by the borrower (e.g. asset originator or fund) for MIP6 applications still under due diligence. Discretionary debt ceiling: The amount of debt ceiling (in DAI) that is available to a specific Centrifuge RWA Vault. The discretion of approval is entirely up to the community of MKR tokenholders. Think of this as a risk policy exception to the global debt ceiling cap.  Should a global debt ceiling cap be implemented?  Only applicable to old CFG structures.      Yes No Abstain     0 voters      If a global debt ceiling cap is implemented, what should it be? Select one of the following options.     Current committed DC, no more. (i.e. $64M) Current committed DC + 15M Current committed DC + 40M Current committed DC + 70M Current committed DC + 100M Current committed DC + 130M Current committed DC + 170M Abstain     0 voters      Should discretionary debt ceilings be allowed? Only for CFG counterparties (e.g. AOs) that have A) implemented DAO accepted legal structuring standards* and B) obtained a DAO accepted legal review by an independent 3rd party.     Yes No Abstain     0 voters      *Important note: the definition of an unanimous DAO-wide acceptable structuring standard is not clearly defined. A few attempts at comparing structuring standards are available here and here. More on the topic will come from a trained and experienced legal counsel. Therefore the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d question above assumes that a consensus of the DAO is reached. And the proper consultation with DAO stakeholders has been done.  The poll will be running until 26 November 2021. Subject to consultation feedback, a more formal signal request will follow. Questions, comments and clarifications are welcomed. @Recognized-Delegates @Real-World-Finance @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @SES-Core-Unit @collateral-core-unit @spin @martin @ctcunning @roollie @rune ",

                    "content": "Thanks for putting together this poll. I have one question on the poll format, @williamr: Your question on the debt ceiling numbers I think should be interpreted as follows: A vote on +100M should count as  vote for both +40M & +100M. Correct? As for Centrifuge\u2019s position, we\u2019ve described it in a lot more detail in this thread but I want to highlight how I think about the questions above:   Should a global debt ceiling cap be implemented? The legal structure that our first pools went live with was never intended to be scaled indefinitely. There is a roadmap for improvements that we are working on together with members of the DAO. We proposed to limit debt ceiling for the current setup and are in agreement here.  If a global debt ceiling cap is implemented, what should it be? Our post initially proposed the most conservative: not raising any debt ceilings until improvements have been made. We wanted to be conservative but I believe issuers who have been working already for months to get onboarded to Maker would appreciate having some flexibility. If an additional debt ceiling should be allowed it could be used for new collaterals to start onboarding while the DAO organizes its legal review process and deploys the trust setup.  Should discretionary debt ceilings be allowed? We believe that with a new legal setup issuers should be going back to a standard process the DAO uses to allocate debt ceilings. This is currently in shift with the proposal of the arranger model but also other ideas. I don\u2019t know though if at that point we should still call it discretionary? Isn\u2019t it just business as usual at that point?  ",

                    "content": "@spin Great questions. Let me try to clarify them and the intention behind the poll.     spin:  A vote on +100M should count as vote for both +40M & +100M. Correct?   The calculation for DC cap is always current committed + a buffer. So, if a vote is for current +40M it means: 64+40 = 104M. For current + 100M = 64 +100 = 164M and so on. Note that it is a single option voting, so it implies voters are voting for the highest DC cap only. On the questions themselves, they were intentionally drafted with a \u201ctransitory\u201d period in mind. i.e. the period between the current legal structuring being in place and one in which Centrifuge and its partners have worked out a legal framework the DAO is ok with (has signed off on). While that period might be relatively fast (say one month), in reality this could take longer. Hence the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d DC is an optionality for MKR tokenholders should they decide to onboard a new collateral in that interim. For the sake of the example, let\u2019s assume asset originator A is experienced with structuring in tradFi and has got a legal setup that the DAO accepts, subject to legal reviews. And let\u2019s assume that it can be done faster than a common CFG legal framework. At that point, MKR tokenholders could have the optionality but not the obligation of approving a transaction for that specific AO A debt ceiling (i.e. discretion to approve). So all of this consultation is only for this transitory period. Once an \u201carranger\u201d framework is in place for CFG, a new consultation will be done. ",
