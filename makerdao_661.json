Introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper is live currently, with voting running through Thursday. The poll stems from this signal - [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn. The intention and title of the signal lead to me to utilizing this misleading summary:  image1240\u00d7442 58.2 KB  However, as noted in the body of the poll, this vote is simply about the technical implementation of a Rate Limiter, and will have no immediate bearing on MKR Burn rate. I encourage all voters to read through the body of the poll, and am tagging the @Recognized-Delegates to ensure they see this announcement and take it into consideration when voting. This post will be pinned until the end of the polling period to give all voters the best chance to see the announcement. Polls are unable to be taken down or modified once posted, so please share this announcement with known MKR voters. Upon the conclusion of the poll I will conference with @LongForWisdom to see if we can still accept the poll results as valid. Some potential recourse here might include reissuing the poll if necessary. I apologize for the confusion this oversight might have caused and thank @Primoz for pointing out the misleading nature of the summary. ",

Consider this quote from the signal request itself:    [Signal Request] bring back the MKR burn   This Signal Request is about to find out if we  want to keep the Surplus Buffer at a level that prevents MKR burning and come up and implement a totally different solution (dutch auctions, other adjustments to the Flapper like adding a minimum price\u2026) before going back to burning (Do Nothing) want to get back to the previous decided path of lerping up the Surplus Buffer to 90 MM by 1 MM every week  (discussion) - but also adding the above patch to the Flapper (Apply Rate Limiting and get back to burning asap)    Given that the signal requests lists these two options in the introduction and the one containing a patch to the flapper clearly stating that it also intends to return to the previous decided path of lerping it is not unreasonable to expect that as part of the proposal.

As much as I\u2019d like to believe people will click through and carefully consider the copy we write every week for votes, the ability to vote from the list of polls page means many will naturally only expand the details when they aren\u2019t sure how they feel. If someone were to vote based on the sentence summary alone they would mistakenly think that they were voting on resuming the burn through that poll. Yet, the outcome of the poll has nothing to do with burning, as this is a technical solution that would be implemented, having no impact on the Surplus Buffer which is the thing currently preventing burning from taking place.

I have to admit I would have expected the resulting onchain poll to cover that. But it actually does not really mater - we won\u2019t have an immediate effect anyway: Getting back to the same lerp rate as we had before the Flappy Friday would bring us to a Surplus Buffer of well above 10 MM to the current System Surplus. There is not a lot of burning potential in the next weeks anyway. Nevertheless, if this poll is only about addint the Rate Limiter and not about returning to the same lerp config, I would like to see a follow up on chain poll - could be done well before the Rate Limiter is implemented. If the community wants to change directions to \u201cno more burning for mid term\u201d - that\u2019s fine, but the USR and the follow up SR do not indicate that we want to stay in the 250MM situation longer than necessary. My intention was to offer a way back to the situation we had before - the current onchain poll is not following this intention  ",
