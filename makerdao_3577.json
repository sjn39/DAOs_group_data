This could be CUs, projects asking for grants, or entities offering to provide services to us directly. This is not specific to new CUs, but I see no reference to very standard things like verifying employment history, credit checks, criminal background checks, etc. These are routine things that need to be done before handing millions in operating budget to what are effectively contractors scattered across multiple jurisdictions. Is there some standard process for due diligence on people/entities that wish to do business with us? We have one for collateral, and we need one for parties we fund or do business with directly. At the least, a standard process would make for a fairer evaluation of those requesting to do business than doing it ad hoc each time. This is an urgent need ",

I think we can probably pick a threshold where it\u2019s risky to not know who we\u2019re doing business with. Want to do business above X amount with us? Then we need to know who you are and that the things you say you\u2019ve done in the past are true. Don\u2019t like it? Find someone else to be the responsible party for your proposal. I can think of other reasons we\u2019d want to know who we are outsourcing our needs to, but just ask yourself where else in the world can you go and on the basis of some forum posts and maybe a Zoom call and be seriously considered for millions of DAI in funding? This doesn\u2019t need to be something onerous. But a basic level of confirming that people are not financial criminals or scammers is a must. We\u2019re starting to throw around large amounts of money, and we need a way that\u2019s not ad hoc to do due diligence on people. I should stress this is not about any specific proposals before us right now \u2013 any due diligence will have to be ad hoc unfortunately. But we need to have a process in place so that basic due diligence is evenly applied to all future requests from unvetted parties to do business with us. Otherwise we open ourselves up not just to the risk of being scammed or defrauded, but also just of being accused of not treating people equally when they come to us with proposals. So a process we can point to protects us from the most obvious attempts at fraud/conning, protects us from favoritism that promotes bad ideas for funding, and protects applicants from any discrimination that could prevent good ideas from receiving big funding. I feel like this is a no-brainer. You can\u2019t even be a bank teller without a credit check. Are we honestly going to fund or incubate startups that themselves have no history and not check on the people who are running them? The proposed SES unit in particular should have an interest in shaping this process. @juan @wouter I believe are the folks I should have tagged at the beginning. ",

There are lots of drawbacks to working for the DAO, but a huge advantage is the lack of traditional gatekeeping that stops qualified individuals from being able to contribute with their skills and expertise. Much like how we manage the risk of our vaults we ask MKR holders to manage the risk of distributions. If they are unhappy with a proposal they can vote it down (happens more frequently with things like Signal Requests, but I\u2019d say part of that is due to our robust structure of requiring MIPs to be open for feedback for at least a month before they are submitted). The reason you haven\u2019t seen as much questioning on the background of CUs so far is because they are more or less completely know entities. They are the people that have helped build the DAO to what it is today and are the ones brave enough to take the first steps of the transition while others wait to check the temperature of the DAO. The fact is anyone can bring up topics for debate on the forums and perhaps that includes some elements of DD you reference, but one of reasons the protocol was created to avoid the biases of traditional finance systems. Would be quite odd if we provided that for interacting with the protocol but took things like credit checks as gospel for dealing with Governance. ",

                    "content": "    PaperImperium:  The proposed SES unit in particular should have an interest in shaping this process. @juanjuan @wouter I believe are the folks I should have tagged at the beginning.   We will indeed be looking into problems like this. As always, however, I would urge anyone who wants to pick this up to not wait for us. We won\u2019t be able to solve all scaling challenges and will be working on the problems we see as the absolute priority. The first thing we would do, is to make the risk visible. @lollike, myself, and others within SES are currently starting to document protocol and DAO risks (operational, legal, technical, etc.), and potential projects (large and small) that can mitigate these risks. We\u2019ll make sure to include the risk, and the due diligence process as a potential mitigation. More about this soon. A number of thoughts:   Pragmatically speaking, right now\u2026 Many of the core units that are currently being proposed, consist largely of Maker Foundation members. The Maker Foundation has  been running these checks. This is circumstantial but it reduces the immediate urgency a fair bit in many situations. I do agree the question becomes a lot more pertinent the moment a core unit composed only of (relative) outsiders is presented.   I think it would definitely be a big plus for a Core Unit to include background checks of their wallet signers into their process. As to who will be verifying this\u2026 This is one of those aspects where a trusted external party can play a big role. For example, the core unit can work with their self-accountability auditor for this. This is not a hard guarantee, but of course background checks never are.   The SES budget proposal has a multisig wallet setup that should be well suited to reduce this particular risk, as you are probably aware. See this paragraph. It offers three features in this regard:  The Auditors Wallet with external DAO representatives to check the monthly budget statements. Separate multisigs to isolate the major budget categories. The operational wallets have 3 signers and they are not the same signers for every operational wallet. (Still, the facilitator and team lead together do have a signing majority.)    So what about new joiners? This is another reason why we believe incubators will become so important for the health of the ecosystem. There are no legal obligations, things do rely on smart contracts and trust\u2026 but we want to grow and be welcoming to new people. But how can the, hopefully many, new joiners gain our trust? Incubator programs are the perfect environment to test the waters. For months, these teams will be collaborating closely with the incubator core unit. During that time, their budget is managed by the incubator and they are only paid for work done. The incubator can perform these background checks. It can help assess and shape the practices and procedures that the new core unit will follow in order to reduce risks like this. And it can also have an advisory relationship beyond the incubation program, once the team has spun out as their own independent core unit.   In general, I do agree that this is aspect is a risk issue and it should be treated as such. The bigger the amounts at risks, the more thorough the checks should be that are in place. I can imagine that we will have a framework sooner or later to quantify the risk and evaluate this against the relevant mitigation measures that are taken. Background checks can be one of those measures that reduce the risk of losing funds. In the case of pseudonymous contributors, there may be different possibilities.   Last but not least. Background checks largely assume malicious intent or at least coercion\u2026 What about the security practices of the signers though? The reality of blockchain is that the risk of losing private keys or getting them stolen may be bigger than bad intentions.   ",
