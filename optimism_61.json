Is there some value perhaps in having a system whereby these discussions on Governance take place in a more decentralised way?  For example, have a metamask account (to connect with) and OP tokens.  Or just have some wallet value.  I don\u2019t know, any ideas ?  We always seem to come back to old school email account, password, logon, database.  Would be nice to just connect my wallet and have our discussions immutable like crypto itself.  DeBank have a rudimentary system for proposing ideas.  Not discussions though. Maybe there is already a system like this.  Or perhaps this is a good project idea in itself.  Who knows! ",
