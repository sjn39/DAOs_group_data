That\u2019s one of the widely promoted advantages of it   Without blaming anyone for this, the EIP1559 discussions were quite mysterious in that it was promoted for one set of things on Magicians, and a totally different set of things on Reddit and Twitter. Broadly speaking everything it was promoted for here it actually delivers, but the same is not true of what highly-followed people with bat emojis said about it on Reddit and Twitter. With 1559 miners will still be able to choose which transactions they select for blocks, and we can expect them to select the ones that make them the most money. There will also be no particular change in the marginal cost of including any given transaction to the miner; Previously to include Transaction X would cost the miner in terms of fees foregone from leaving out Transaction Y to make room for it, whereas now they don\u2019t get the fees for either X or Y, but they have to pay ETH holders an equivalent amount (by burning ETH) to include X. The cost changes from being an opportunity cost to being a regular cost, but the impact on the bottom line is the same. Equally, there\u2019s no change in what you will have to do to incentivize a miner to include Transaction X. If the miner was happy to accept a chicken as payment before, they should be happy to accept a chicken as payment after. The is a difference related to economic abstraction in that someone will have to provide ETH for the protocol to burn to pay the transaction, so you can\u2019t completely cut the \u201cETH\u201d currency out of the loop in the way that you otherwise could in PoW Ethereum. But if they\u2019re making 100 DAI from including a transaction by MEV, or getting the equivalent in chickens, there\u2019s nothing to stop the miner paying the cost of the ETH that need to be burned as the cost of earning that revenue, any more than miners\u2019 need to pay electricity bills in Chinese Yuan forced Ethereum users to use Chinese Yuan. There does seem to be one little glitch in the way the thing has been specified, in that it seems to be required that there be enough ETH in the sender\u2019s account to pay the basefee at the point the transaction is made. This wasn\u2019t necessary economically, but it\u2019s how it was implemented. But if the miner is stumping up the ETH in any case and taking payment in MEV or chickens, there\u2019s nothing to stop them adding a transaction to credit it to the sender\u2019s account to make the transaction go through and unlock the MEV or the chicken.

This is the distinction I\u2019m talking about: Tim Roughgarden\u2019s analysis is an excellent piece of work based on sound economics that matches the claims that have been made and tested here. The (really interesting) Justin Drake interview on Bankless is in a different category, although he works for the EF they\u2019re his own opinions and a lot of them haven\u2019t been posted and discussed here at all, since they\u2019re generally not considered the point of the EIP, as it was presented here.     Shymaa-Arafat:  why would a miner pay ur fee instead of u!!! Unless there\u2019s a much larger MEV he will gain, like u r making an exchange that will increase the value of his savings for example.   It seems like you know the answer to your question? The miner would pay the fee instead of you because they make more than it cost them some other way. That could be a that they can make money through MEV, or because your transaction pays them in another token and the sender account doesn\u2019t have gas, or because you have some other arrangement with them. They would only normally include your transaction if the revenue from doing this is greater than the cost to them. As I\u2019ve explained, economically the situation is the same now: There is already a cost to the miner including your transaction. The reason people some people don\u2019t fully appreciate this is because it\u2019s an opportunity cost, ie it takes the form of revenue that they had to give up by leaving out a different fee-paying transaction, rather than money they actually have to pay someone. But the impact on the miner\u2019s bottom line is the same. Consider this example where a miner is trying to decide whether to include a transaction with no gas but 2 of the currency of your choice in MEV, in a block where it would normally have cost 1: Pre-1559: Get +2 in MEV and 0 in gas, give up 1 in gas for the next transaction you leave out, basefee is 0 since it doesn\u2019t exist yet, so net gain from taking the zero-gas tx rather than the next in the queue is  2 +0 -1 -0 = 1  Post-1559: Get +2 in MEV and 0 in gas, give up 0 (except a trivial tip) for the next transaction you leave out (since that would have been burned rather than given to you), subtract the basefee of 1 that you\u2019ve stumped up on behalf of the sender, so net gain is  2 +0 -0  -1  = 1  Does that make sense?

To be clear, 1559 does cost them revenue, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re upset. Filling out the previous example: Pre-1559, no MEV: Revenue 1 (gas fee from non-MEV tx) Pre-1559, take MEV: Revenue 2 (MEV revenue from MEV tx) Post-1559, no MEV: Revenue 0 [+ teensy tip] (non-MEV pays tx gas but it\u2019s burned) Post-1559, take MEV: Revenue 1 (MEV revenue from MEV tx - burn) But the loss of revenue is nothing to do with MEV, and the gain from taking the MEV is the same in both cases, because 2-1 = 1, and 1-0 also = 1.
