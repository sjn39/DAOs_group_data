The overall focus this week will be to continue the discussion about the practicalities of clustering workforce and transitioning core units and other resources into the MetaDAOs if the Endgame Plan is approved and into its Pregame phase. We will discuss this both at today\u2019s call, and tomorrow\u2019s call. In addition, during todays Wednesday call I will start by going through various replies and comments that have been made here on the forum that I haven\u2019t had time to reply to yet, but that I think provide some useful perspectives to better describe the details of the Endgame Plan and its underlying principles Wednesday 9pm CEST Endgame DVC meeting: Launch Meeting - Zoom Q&A of various forum posts and recent feedback, and continue the clustering discussion. Thursday 9pm CEST Endgame DVC meeting: Launch Meeting - Zoom Continue the clustering and transition discussion started last Thursday. ",
