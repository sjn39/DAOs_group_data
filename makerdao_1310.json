Additionally, based on the latest financials provided here, there is only 1 million of recurring lending annual interest income projected based on existing vault usage. To combat this, I am putting together an informal poll to generate ideas on how the protocol can recuperate some TLV and revenue.  The below would be for new wallets/users only with the exception of the referral rewards option, which is my favorite given word of mouth IMO is the best client acquisition strategy. Voting is anonymous and will be aggregated with other member\u2019s votes. The poll will close at July 1st 11:59pm ET, I will summarize the responses in the comment section.    Ideas that the DAO should test to incentivize DAI borrowing? (New Wallets Only)  0% Stability Fee for 90 - 180 days (for ETH, BTC, etc) 0% Liquidation Fee if Liquidation occurs within 90 - 180 days (for ETH, BTC, etc) 5% MKR rewards for 90 - 180 days (Capped at X amount) 5% DSR for 30 - 90 days (Capped at X amount) Referral Rewards via 30 - 90 days of 0% stability fee for every new wallet that opens a vault using their referral code None of the above - Please insert idea in comments     0 voters     ",

Fundamentally, Maker can escape the trap of being anchored to the price of BTC/ETH by managing its balance sheet more actively (e.g. investing in US-Treasuries) and expanding the scope of its lending activities to collateral types that have lower correlation to the price of crypto assets (e.g. wholesale real-world lending, see Dune chart below)  image1920\u00d71096 74.5 KB  This would allow Maker to reenable the DSR for e.g. which could also trigger a virtuous loop of Dai demand and new minting demand.

That said, we would need to think about how to prevent these things from being gamed.  How do you stop people from making their own vaults for referral promotions?  What about closing old vaults and reopening them after the reward period so they can get a new promotion with the same funds? Anyway, it would be interesting to experiment with these things.  But even if you are successful with borrowing promotions, you\u2019ll eventually need holders for generated DAI so the path we\u2019re on to be able to increase DSR permanently is most important. ",

Thats really interesting, will be tough because of the industry but deadlines and fees would be a a possible deterrant or maybe something around wallet creation dates. In any case, if the promotion leads to an increase in activity it would be a win I believe. Also, totally agree on the priority should be NII for assets via bond investing. Even that though lets say we are able to make 2-3% on a portion of PSM (500M of 3.5B) that may translate to 0.25-1% interest on DSR which although respectable may not be enough to incetivize new DAI holders.
