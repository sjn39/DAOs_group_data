The Ethereum Magicians donation page only accepts ETH. Do you want me to convert these to ETH and just send to the ETH address, or can the Ethereum Magicians happy to get $NAME tokens off-chain?  To which I replied:  Hi! That\u2019s a great offer, thank you. Yes, ETH would be best. We don\u2019t currently have a way to deal with anything else.  So if this was not meant for EthMagicians as a whole it should go somewhere else. I have no particular opinions on how to use extra funds at this time but we DO need to discuss it. And I still need to write up a public thank you to TOBPB  ",
