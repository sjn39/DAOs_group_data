The features we\u2019re releasing today are all about enabling the best governance UX possible by helping users make informed decisions. We want to provide users with access to information that drives the Maker governance process. We\u2019re always looking for new ways to improve verifiability and help users process information. We hope these features will add transparency and make governance a little bit more accessible by presenting key insights into the voting process. As always, if you have any questions, comments, or just want to chat, drop by our Discord, provide feedback on our idea board or visit our public Notion page.  Feature Changes  Poll Vote History One of the biggest new features we\u2019ve added is poll vote history. Now you will be able to view the poll vote history for any address. Initially we scoped this feature out to just the delegate profile page, but then we asked ourselves, why stop there? We\u2019ve created a new account page which now displays the poll vote history for any address. And for delegates, we also display participation metrics as well as the delegate\u2019s credentials. We\u2019ve also added a visual indicator to plurality polls, making it easier to quickly get a sense of where the votes are going.   Screen_Shot_2021-09-03_at_3.25.23_PM.png1940\u00d71498 316 KB    Delegate Stats Another new feature we\u2019re releasing today is a quick view of relevant delegate stats added to the bottom of the the delegate profile page. This displays the amount of MKR delegated to this address, the total number of addresses who have delegated to them, as well as MKR delegated by you.   Screen_Shot_2021-08-31_at_4.17.28_PM.png773\u00d7207 7.41 KB    Visualizing Poll Vote Breakdown We\u2019ve added a visual enhancement to the poll detail page in the form of a packed-circle chart. Now you can see a scaled visual representation of which addresses are voting for a particular poll and their weight in MKR.   Screen_Shot_2021-09-03_at_3.28.25_PM.png1288\u00d71814 225 KB    Delegate Names In the \u201csupporters\u201d sidebar on the executive page, you can now see the delegate name instead of simply an address.     Avatar Hover Hovering your mouse over a delegate\u2019s avatar allows users to see a bigger version of the delegate picture and a quick glance at stats.   Untitled 1.png725\u00d7404 77.8 KB    Full Release Notes   Introduces profile tabs on the delegate\u2019s profile, allowing users to switch between \u201cDelegate Credentials\u201d, \u201cParticipation Metrics\u201d and \u201cVote history\u201d   Introduces the page/address/[address] that serves as an address summary for delegates and non-delegates addresses.
