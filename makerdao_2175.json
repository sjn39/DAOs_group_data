The Stability Fee of the MIP65 vault (RWA007) is 0% but all value increase is due to the Surplus Buffer, the 0% was just used as it is impossible to have a fixed value. Per MIP65:   All surplus generated by the legal structure must be manually sent to the Maker surplus buffer every quarter.   The following document detail a process to implement this sentence. The sentence could be interpreted in different ways, but the following seems the most accurate after working on it. It is not an advice on how to proceed from SF CU, just an operationalization of the original MIP.  Process  Calculation of the surplus At the beginning of each quarter, anyone can look at the MIP65 Dashboard (or reconstruct one). One need to subtract the vault loan amount at the end of the previous quarter by the value of the assets (shares of the ETFS)*(last NAV of the quarter). This number will be called the surplus if it is positive (nothing else to do if negative). For avoidance of doubt, the effective NAV for the surplus calculation should be the most recently published NAV as of close of business on the final day of March, June, September, and December. The Surplus will then be prorated by the assets allocation to find how much each asset type should be sold. The 30bps normalized fees will be deduced and each amount will be converted to an amount of shares using the last NAV of the quarter. A spreadsheet is provided to ease the maths and the input numbers can be taken from this Dune Query. 2023Q1 is filled with last to date information just to show how it works.  image1450\u00d7146 6.22 KB   Issuance of a DAO Resolution Then anyone with given power to add items to an executive spell can create a fork of the following template and update the missing fields with data from the previous step. MIP65 - Resolution Template - Surplus return process (to be rechecked)  Notification and execution After the spell is executed, the resolution will be notified to the trustees of James Asset Trust for execution. This should be done by Monetalis, or any third party in case of default. ",

We understand, the sentence wasn\u2019t very precise and encourage anyone to amend the MIP if there is a will. Some amendment could be of interest for community:  A monthly process would better smooth the Surplus Buffer evolution and the monthly financials. It would therefore be easier for the broad DeFi to get more clarity that if using quarters. Building an internal buffer in MIP65 would have some sense. There is little duration risk, therefore the vault could become undercollateralized for some time (or just due to some internal expenses as well). We can discuss more in detail but 1% would solve the issue and make community and the broader DeFi space at easy that we (almost) never misreport undercollateralized vault. Selling the excess is costing some fees (less than 30bps), as we have no need for liquidity for now (selling will just increase USDC PSM), we could just increase the Debt Ceiling of the vault and funnel the proceed to the Surplus Buffer (as the vault would already be overcollateralized).
