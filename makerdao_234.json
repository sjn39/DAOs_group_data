However, Frontend products like Oasis.app that is delivered by a distinct business entity have to adhere to the legal framework they are operating in, or face severe consequences which ultimately may mean they are being shut down. Adhering to regulatory requirements to block sanctioned countries is an example of things Oasis.app has to do to stay operating for the rest of the world. ",
