                    "content": "The recent discussion about whether to exclude certain categories of contributors from sourcecred slid into a debate concerning delegates and their role. It seemed to reveal a gap between expectations and reality of what delegates do and what they should be doing that I think there can be some value exploring. I\u2019ve put together an overview of the current state of requirements for delegates along with some expectations I\u2019ve seen expressed around on the forums. My goal is to initiate a discussion about those expectations and maybe get a clearer consensus from the community on what kind of delegates we want going forward.  Current state The formal requirements to become a delegate is as follows:  Sharing contact details Publishing a delegate platform post. Appearing on a live call to speak to MKR holders and community members to answer questions about their platform. Publicly agreeing to follow a Code of Conduct.  Following the code of conduct gives certain responsibilities that requires a time commitment:  Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal prior to the submission of their vote Delegates should ensure that they communicate the rationale behind each of their votes in a clear and accessible way. Delegates should maintain a working knowledge of developments at Maker and in the wider cryptocurrency space. Delegates should - within reason - be accessible to the community to answer questions, respond to comments, and discuss issues.  These formal requirements give a substantial space for interpretation on how much time is required to fulfil them. The background of the respective delegate will also influence how time intensive several of these are. Being a contributor at MakerDAO in a different capacity can be a good way to \u201cmaintain a working knowledge of developments at Maker\u201d, but it\u2019s not the only way to do so. Similarly, being a contributor at another project or being involved in an entity that does delegate work for several DAOs can assist in \u201cmaintain a working knowledge of \u2026 in the wider cryptocurrency space\u201d. When it comes to \u201cmake a professional and unbiased review of each proposal prior to the submission of their vote\u201d this can involve a lot of research depending on what background a delegate has. As an example, a delegate with a legal background would presumably spend less time on giving a solid opinion on a poll of a largely legal nature. The sheer scope and diversity on being involved in every single vote the protocol makes still makes this requirement fairly time heavy, since it requires making informed choices on a broad range of topics. One task that is implicit in the role that also requires a time commitment is trying to secure MKR to be delegated. Similarly, to how a politician must campaign for votes a delegate, at least a freshly starting delegate, will have to put in work to convince MKR holders to delegate to him or her.  Expectations Some expectations that I think is worth discussing is listed below. Here are some issues that concerns delegates that is not covered by the current code of conduct and that there might be different opinions on. This list is not meant to be exhaustive but serve as a conversation starter.  Should delegates work full time as delegates (time commitment expectation tied to compensation) Should delegates stick to Maker exclusively or be free to work for other protocols at the same time (non-compete considerations) Should delegates be part of a core unit (possible conflict of interest) Should delegates initiate governance processes like signal requests or MIPs (possible separation of powers issue, same person initiating and voting on a proposal) How closely should delegates be involved with Core units? (time costs, possible infringement on CU autonomy) Should delegates communicate with outside entities on behalf of Maker? (possibly creating expectation of protocol action)  One question I personally have been wrestling with recently is how active should delegates be in trying to shape the community? A delegate is entrusted to act in the best interest of the protocol. Should this primarily be expressed through voting, or should delegates attempt to influence proposals prior to the vote? Part of the motivation for asking is that I fear having delegates too involved too early in the process centralizes decision making. On the other hand, delegates should ideally be in a position to have a good understanding in how proposals affect the protocol as a whole and should thus be able to offer informed advice. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the post @JustinCase, I\u2019ll share some of my thoughts with relation to your questions below:     JustinCase:  Should delegates work full time as delegates (time commitment expectation tied to compensation)   I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on this one yet. In theory, in an efficient-market for delegates full-time delegates should be able to make stronger decisions, and would therefore crowd out part-time delegates (MKR Holders would prefer full-time delegates.) However, humans and the market aren\u2019t perfectly efficient. Right now, I think there is room for both part-time and full-time delegates.     JustinCase:  Should delegates stick to Maker exclusively or be free to work for other protocols at the same time (non-compete considerations)   Working on other protocols is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand it allows a greater scope for coordination and cooperation between protocols to the benefit of all. On the other hand it\u2019s a competition for time and attention, and opens the delegate up to accusations of favouritism. I wouldn\u2019t want to say \u2018delegates can\u2019t do this\u2019, but it\u2019s something that MKR Holders should consider when delegating on a case-by-case basis.     JustinCase:  Should delegates be part of a core unit (possible conflict of interest)   We\u2019ve given our point of view on this previously, but to reiterate: GovAlpha does not believe that MKR Holders should delegate MKR to Core Unit members. It gives one class of contributor (Core Units) too much power over the protocol, potentially to the cost of MKR Holders. We\u2019ll talk about this more when we end up writing about separation of powers, sometime later this year.     JustinCase:  Should delegates initiate governance processes like signal requests or MIPs (possible separation of powers issue, same person initiating and voting on a proposal)   In my view, this is fine so long as delegates follow the general recommendations for signals and proposals. Someone in the DAO needs to write proposals so that we can collectively improve the DAO and the protocol. Delegates generally should have more time and a longer-term focus available to do this when compared to many Core Units who tend to be concerned with short/medium term issues and work. I believe @prose11 may have a different interpretation of this from what we discussed last time we spoke about separation of powers, but I leave it to him to comment if he feels necessary.     JustinCase:  How closely should delegates be involved with Core units? (time costs, possible infringement on CU autonomy)   Yeah, this is a hard one to answer. Too much involvement and it starts to prompt similar issues to core unit members themselves being delegates. That said, Core Units work for governance, and governance is informally personified by the delegates. So long as both Core Units and delegates keep in mind that the delegate is not speaking on behalf of governance as a whole, relationships like this should help improve efficiency and quality of decision-making. One important point here though is that such conversations should default to public forums wherever feasibly possible. It\u2019s very easy to fall into the habit of having these conversations privately, and excluding a portion of the community and governance that may have valid and useful input into these conversations.     JustinCase:  Should delegates communicate with outside entities on behalf of Maker? (possibly creating expectation of protocol action)   Communicate with outside entities, yes. \u2018On behalf of Maker\u2019 very much no. Delegates represent a minority of governance power in the protocol. Delegates should be aiming to communicate in a hopefully informative, but non-committal way. Instead of \u2018MakerDAO thinks this\u2019 \u2192 \u2018It looks like a majority of the MakerDAO community and governance thinks this.\u2019 I would say avoid this until governance elects some core unit or role specifically for the purpose of \u2018speaking for the DAO\u2019 (which may never take place, rightly or wrongly.)     JustinCase:  One question I personally have been wrestling with recently is how active should delegates be in trying to shape the community? A delegate is entrusted to act in the best interest of the protocol. Should this primarily be expressed through voting, or should delegates attempt to influence proposals prior to the vote?   I think this is up to the delegate in question. I certainly don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with delegates attempting to shape the DAO and opinion within it prior to votes. I would just tend to caution everyone else involved to ensure they understand the limits of what delegates can and can\u2019t do. A delegate can\u2019t speak for the DAO, if a delegate is speaking against something, it doesn\u2019t mean that you should do something differently purely because of the MKR they control. If they have a good argument, and they convince you of something, sure. But don\u2019t assume that one or more outspoken delegates speaks for the majority of governance. It\u2019s always better to go to a vote to make sure a delegate\u2019s views are shared by governance as a whole.     JustinCase:  Part of the motivation for asking is that I fear having delegates too involved too early in the process centralizes decision making.   This can be a risk, for sure. I feel like this plays into my previous point. People need to understand the limits of delegate\u2019s power well enough to know when they should and should not ignore their feedback prior to a vote.

                    "content": "(edited thanks to big brain @juan who pointed out TLDRs do very little at the bottom of a long post  ) The TL;DR - The community does need to be careful when evaluating proposals made by recognized delegates, but for many of the same reasons we should treat all proposals as suspect. At the end of the day, more people getting involved in governance is generally a positive force and I encourage anyone putting time and effort into improvement ideas to broadcast them and make a formal proposal when a consensus starts building.      LongForWisdom:  In my view, this is fine so long as delegates follow the general recommendations for signals and proposals. Someone in the DAO needs to write proposals so that we can collectively improve the DAO and the protocol. Delegates generally should have more time and a longer-term focus available to do this when compared to many Core Units who tend to be concerned with short/medium term issues and work. I believe @prose11 may have a different interpretation of this from what we discussed last time we spoke about separation of powers, but I leave it to him to comment if he feels necessary.   This is a tricky one for sure, but fully agree with Long\u2019s logic. Our system is such that anyone can make a proposal. I think it\u2019s worth noting that it would not be hard for a delegate to use a sock-puppet or friend in the community to propose their ideas. By allowing delegates to propose signals and MIPs we encourage them to do so transparently which allows the community to make an informed decision. Danger still exists! So for that and some of the points mentioned above I think it\u2019s important that we allow delegates to make proposals, same as anyone else. However, the community needs to be warned that delegates do make a particularly risky group of proposal authors. This is primarily because:  They can swing a lot of voting weight, making their proposals more likely to be acted upon. The delegation of their voting weight means that delegates are not necessarily incentive aligned, ie they could be voting with a vast amount of MKR despite not being personally exposed to the price action.   So far we have been blessed with very contentious and committed recognized delegates. But the community must be prepared for that to not always be the case. The problems presented can also apply to Core Unit members/facilitators making proposals, and pseudonymous authors mean that there can always be doubt about the personal motivations behind proposal authors.

                    "content": "\u201cExpectations of a Delegate\u201d is a crucial conversation for the community to have right now. I\u2019d like to see this thread get a lot of attention and comments because what\u2019s more important than coming to a consensus here, is to have transparency and clarity about where each of the Recognized Delegates stands on the deeper questions of meta-governance. Live Free or DAI As we all strive for the best decentralization has to offer, diversity and creativity in how a Delegate can serve the DAO should be encouraged. For ACREinvest, I am taking a decidedly non-activist approach and seek to conduct this work on a principles basis. Such principles favor process, rules and long-term, strategic vision. New Recognized Delegate @Hasu has floated the idea of an Executive Delegate System to provide more structure around agenda setting and CU oversights. I agree wholeheartedly that the DAO needs a better system of executive accountability and oversight in order to fulfill our potential in the medium and long term. Judicial Approach Without there being an explicit mandate from the community for Delegates to operate in this mode, ACREinvest views the delegate role more in the vein of a Judiciary actor. Accordingly, from my perspective initiating proposals would not be appropriate especially if the proposal includes a paid role for the Delegate or an affiliate to provide other services to the DAO. Dispassionate neutrality across the entire scope of matters before the DAO is what I\u2019m striving for! Core Unit Support Limited engagement with Core Units is appropriate if there are areas of expertise a Delegate brings to our shared work, and contributing that expertise would be an overall benefit to the community. In my case that might include legal, regulatory and compliance issues, and deep engagement with \u201cRegenerative Finance/ReFi\u201d. Separately, there should be NO limit to the time we spend supporting, encouraging and getting to know each other on a personal level. Private Meetings - Internal I am not supportive of private conversations and meetings that pertain to specific proposals if such engagement becomes a forum to privately influence, lobby or persuade a Delegate to vote in a particular way. Recently there have been two Delegate only calls organized with each of RWF CU (2/28) and Monetalis (3/8) that I joined. I will no longer attend off the record meetings of this sort. Information should be shared publicly on the forums, and AMA video meetings organized for presentations that are open to the community at which Delegates and all can hear the same information at the same time. As I said on March 8 in a private group DM with @Recognized-Delegates: I am uncomfortable with this trend of private Delegate Group meetings creating a forum for interested parties to lobby and influence us directly. I also do not want to create any impression of my consent or endorsement of recommendations from \u201cthe Delegates\u201d by virtue of being on these calls where some voice opinions, while I may prefer to listen only. No one can control what another does privately in terms of backdoor influence, but we should proceed with caution as to what is being billed as Delegates acting collectively. I realize there is some tension here with the expectation that we available to the community for discussion and communication. I\u2019d like to find the right balance that is also sustainable and efficient in terms of time spent in one-on-one meetings or dialogue where appropriate. Proper Procedure Side note related to my comments here https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-real-world-asset-fast-tracking/13563: The community has voted in a Core Unit to handle on-boarding Real World Assets. I will not spend time on and will not vote in favor of real-world-asset proposals that are not cooperating with RWF and seek to gain approvals directly from Governance. As we work together on a framework that can scale and is inline with a larger strategic approach, all interested parties should go through the procedures we have gone to great lengths and expense to put in place. If the current procedure is inadequate, then that should be addressed directly and holistically, but not on behalf of a particular proposal or potential counterparty. Otherwise would be chaos and introduces unacceptable risks of overall failure. Private Meetings - External I am not generally in favor of Delegates holding private meetings with outside entities explicitly in their capacity as MakerDAO Delegates to discuss business operations and opportunities with the DAO. While I believe it is appropriate for us to be Ambassadors for MakerDAO and to support industry education and DAO marcomms, this is distinctly different from holding oneself out privately as having a kind of special influence within or authority to speak on behalf of the community. We must be very very careful here as most people do not understand DAOs and how we are operating. The role of \u201cRecognized Delegate\u201d to most ears would suggest a level of centralization we should not project. Final Thoughts My views expressed here are no doubt influenced by my legal background and draw inspiration from ethical and professional responsibilities as codified in the New York Rules of Professional Conduct and the New York State Standards of Civility. So while I am not operating in a legal capacity in my work with MakerDAO, these rules address many of the challenges we face in our role as Delegates and serve as a good framework for me to consider how best to conduct Governance along the DeFi frontier.

Doo Delegate Platform   Delegate Thoughts: Although Delegate\u2019s role is different from director, I found the following tweet quite interesting and here are some of my takes. https://twitter.com/XavierHelgesen/status/1510304744102772741?t=HeUsN5olsM6efZBpiCqIVg&s=19 \"Good Director knows they only have two jobs:  Hire and compensate the right CEO. Approve the budget and strategic plan.  Bad Director thinks their main job is to provide good ideas. They think the board\u2019s job is to micro-manage the CEO.\" Which can be translated as onboard and compensate the right CUs and approve the budget and strategic plan. \"Good Director trusts the CEO completely until they don\u2019t. Once they don\u2019t, it is time to make a change. There\u2019s no in between. Bad Director constantly tests and scrutinizes the CEO, making them feel insecure in their role and always on the brink of being fired.\" I am probably guilty of it. Will try to be less scrutinizing. \"Good Director knows that management can only focus on 1-2 things at once. Bad Director forwards an article they read with the subject line: \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t We Doing THIS?!?!\u201d\" Come to think of it, I think many of us make this mistake to CUs. \"Good Director always remembers that they are a fiduciary of all shareholders. Bad Director looks at every decision as: \u201cWhat is in it for my firm/pocketbook?\u201d\" Very true that delegates should make decisions that ultimately support the Maker system and MKR holders. Just thought it was interesting how it helped me to reflect on some of my mistakes.   And also the follow on post by @Allan_Pedersen    Doo Delegate Platform   Hi @Doo_StableLab , Perhaps I can add a little bit to further your reflections. I wrote this article some years ago for a set of new independent directors I was working with. I have found this \u201ckey relationship\u201d angle quite productive as a starting point for thinking through a governance role. https://boardmembervalue.brick.do/   While I don\u2019t think being a delegate is a direct comparison to being a board member I think there is enough similarities to learn something from the sources posted. Thank you for sharing. The main difference to me is the lack of a CEO or similar day-to-day manager function. As such the Maker delegates right now seems to me to be more directly involved in the community. Finding the right balance between active participation and letting the CUs figure out the optimal solution is a tricky one. For my own part I\u2019m drawing on my military background that emphasized mission based leadership which in essence means telling \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d something needs to be done but leaving out the \u201chow\u201d. This allows the ones solving the mission to find the best solution and to react when circumstances change. It also means seeing and backing solutions you did not envision when the objectives were first established. ",

I might have made the offhand comment before that we\u2019re sort of board directors with no executive team to support. IMHO, this empty space is an opportunity for the DAO. Your framing around mission(s) is great.      ACREinvest:  to lobby and influence us directly   FWIW, this was def not the intention behind organizing a call, any call, with delegates. Though, in hindsight I see why that\u2019s problematic and appreciate you for flagging the concern. Moving forward if i personally organize any call, I will save the recording and flag for anyone who wants to view it.  Delegate Ops Office hours doesn\u2019t seem to be a good model, curious what the community would suggest is a good way to get delegates aligned or in one place? Also curious what the appetite is for a category for delegates here on the forum. One mega thread to voice opinions and conversations was probably not going to scale. Apologies in advance @Patrick_J  ",

Again as I\u2019ve said in a few places, I support Delegates approaching this work in a variety of ways. One Delegate may want to do Office Hours, or have an active DM inbox. Another Delegate may want to be more aloof to maintain actual or externally perceived neutrality. I am in the camp right now of extremely limited one-on-one communications, except when targeted to support the effective operation of Core Units and enhance my own understanding of their going concern work. Some of my reasoning is principles based, but a big chunk is practical. To give my best here, I have to adopt a strict and disciplined approach to how time is spent so I can cover as much ground as possible in fulfilling Delegate duties. In many cases, I do not need to receive individualized attention to evaluate a proposal. I can read the Forum and documentation, attend community presentations and decide. But I love having this conversation and keeping an open mind on how my view of the role could evolve. I look forward to hearing the insights of others and what the MKR holders want from us! ",
