                    "content": " As some might be aware, HUSD broke below the peg as Huobi Exchange announced to delist HUSD. It was once over $1 billion marketcap but now hover around $58 million. While HUSD is very different from DAI, there are several lessons the community can learn from.   Not all centralized Stablecoins are the same Often times, we heard the argument that centralized stablecoins are simillar especially those that have Paxos as custody. However, although Paxos intitially supported HUSD. It was later revealed that the USD backing it is actually stored in Huobi Trust. But transparency and communication were lacking.   Risky management of Stablecoin Some tactics by HUSD were leaked later in public but while helping with Maker\u2019s business team in Asia, I encountered many stories of HUSD aggressively trying to expand their marketshare by selling their stablecoins at a favorable rate. In theory, they could invested with fiat USD into something more profitable than a small favorable margin they are providing. However, considering many Asian partners have bankcrupted or shutdown simillar to Celsius situation in the West, some of the investment likely turned sour while request for redemption soared, effectively turning it into undercollaterized stablecoin.   This goes back to an issue for Maker as well where stablecoin collateral within Maker should be utilized but should be managed carefully or else will face liquidity issues as well. While we will have to see what actually happened. It\u2019s unfortunate for all those who were impacted by it and hope we can see a more resilient stablecoin ecosystem in the future. ",

Hi Doo, on this point would like to ask you how you see Monetalis and the other Centralized entities who are interested in Maker\u2019s USDC? The revenue from this should be going to buy ETH and other assets so we can have like a backstop right? Thanks! ",

I believe they are good opportunities for the Maker protocol and fortunately both of them especially @Allan_Pedersen have been actively communicating with the protocol. However, of course, the community always should be aware of various risks of utilizing such assets.     RoFz:  The revenue from this should be going to buy ETH and other assets so we can have like a backstop right?   The protocol will likely have the reward eventually in crypto assets, but I am not sure whether it will be ETH. Even if it\u2019s ETH, since it\u2019s volatile, I can imagine it will be a small portion though ",
