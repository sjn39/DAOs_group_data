However, SourceCred payouts have continued even as contributors have secured positions as Core Unit paid employees or Recognized Delegates. The amount of money flowing to new contributors is reduced. For example, @PaperImperium was initially attracted to the forums (from Reddit) due to SourceCred. Given that @PaperImperium now works for @GFXlabs as a paid Recognized Delegate, SourceCred compensation is no longer a major factor in his motivation. @rune also feels that SourceCred is wasted when paid to people who are already paid by MakerDAO. Pros:  Contributors receiving SourceCred will receive larger payouts Hopefully, Maker will attract more contributors because of large payouts  Cons:  Those people who receive income from both SourceCred and as formal MakerDAO contributors will receive less moolah Some MakerDAO-affiliated people may contribute less to the forum     Stop paying people with SourceCred who are already being paid by MakerDAO  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This Signal Request will remain open for two weeks and close on 2022-02-15T08:00:00Z.

For one thing, a master list of anyone receiving regular compensation from the Maker protocol would need to be maintained and updated at least weekly. Maker currently has 100+ paid contributors, so the simple maintenance of this list is extra overhead for @GovAlpha-Core-Unit. Even the exclusion of specific posts like scheduled weekly updates may be an extra burden to put on the GovAlpha staff to track and remove from the SourceCred algorithm. Given human labor costs and the relatively low expense of SourceCred, that may eat up quite a bit of any possible savings. Add in the whack-a-mole game of anon accounts created to preserve what (to an individual) might be a material amount of earnings, and it just seems like a lot of work without sufficient benefit. There is also the simple fact that seeing whose Cred score would have prompted payment, but was zeroed out, will make public via payments flows on the easily accessible SourceCred site who on the forums is a paid contributor, even if their role is rank-and-file. That might or might not pose additional privacy concerns for individuals in a variety of jurisdictions and personal situations. I believe there\u2019s a reason why the GovComms list of DAO actors is being handled in a GDPR compliant way. If the goal is to increase the amount available to attract new members of the DAO, the clearest path would be to increase the size of the SourceCred pool or have a second instance that has payments only for contributors with less than X months\u2019 time on the forum.

I am not considering quitting my offchain job for 12k/month, additional 1k-2k/month more is not going to make a huge difference on my decision (this month related to the Signal Requests (here, here) I initiated last week after Flappy Friday. The baseline is usually just coming from the summaries of the MOMC-meetings (we had two this month - here, here) Moving to some kind of company structure for following my passion (surprise: that\u2019s MakerDAO and all of the people related to it!) full-time is absolutely not an option as I want to stay independent here. We all need to decide together how we want to spend our profits, so far I\u2019d say we have been pretty generous with CU-compensation and vesting and what not. At least for me personally this SR confirms my doubts that my work is valuable enough for the DAO to go all-in.  Edit (thanks @psychonaut for reaching out and asking questions): Looks this was a very german way of saying: Compensation for Recognized Delegates is not enough to go all-in (and solo!) right now, so removing source-cred does hurt (my feelings)  This is a different discussion, and should probably not be mixed into this.

To keep it revenue neutral for them, we can increase the maximum delegate compensation by 3000 DAI per month.

I disagree that the solution is to further increase delegate compensation unless you also require delegates to do a lot more than the things listed here.

It has always been the case that some delegates do work that goes above and beyond their role as a delegate.

My thoughts on this are the following:   I think it is problematic for Maker if our polls and execs are such that the amount of effort required to vote in an informed manner is equivalent to a near full-time job. This would mean that the only people who can understand and vote on different issues are those delegates who treat delegation as a full-time job.

Direct democracy (a close analogue of our structure) works reasonably well for entire nation states (for example, in Switzerland) so it should also work for a protocol like ours which has a much narrower range of issues that gets voted on.   I view the basic task of delegation as the following: Vote as an informed MKR holder would + tell people why you voted the way you did. Neither task should require full-time or near full-time amount of work. In some ways, it is probably the way you view RWA (also a domain I am unfamiliar with).   I think that delegates will find/have already found areas within Maker that they are passionate about and will develop expertise and contribute substantially there.

Or that\u2019s my personal, totally-not-based-on-anything-but-anecdote. Does anyone feel differently?   Completely my impression as well for the past few years.   The amount of material, posts, etc to review is growing by some power law (which isn\u2019t even remotely linear at this point which would be bad enough on its own). Number of CUs increasing at what 1-2/Q or more.  RWA itself is one complicated beast that I don\u2019t think any one single person has enough expertise to handle (this requires a team of multiple experts and eyes). I would hazard the delegates as a team simply don\u2019t have the required time/expertise to manage this. SourceCred is interesting and a good way to involve people that, when compared to delegate compensation actually is cheap IMO. I have from last GovAlpha financial report SourceCred expenses 25K/month.   This is for all contributors - across the board.    We can look at where the DAI is going and make some adjustments I think given the total amount of contributions (in terms of actual man hours) what we pay is cheap for what we get honestly. Even @s_ben has been adamant that communities should continuously adapt their rewards to fit their goals because stagnant SC instances over time end up being farmed/gamed/mined.   The Maker community via forums and chat/discord I have generally found to be of the highest quality of ALL of the DAOs I participate in.     AstronautThis:  It has always been the case that some delegates do work that goes above and beyond their role as a delegate. For example, your work with MOMC, starting various signal requests, etc. has nothing to do with being a delegate and should therefore be compensated independently on top of whatever delegate compensation model we have.   I think this is a difficult distinction and a general problem with respect to quantifying work effort against quality or value of work.   There is a general tendency at EVERY DAO, and community I have worked with to basically take what they can for free, and pay the least for what they need. I think we should stick to the topic at hand and think about how SourceCred could be a bonus to all of the people being paid at Maker (having one SC instance we fund for bonuses for people who are already paid) and another just for people who are NOT being paid.   Though honestly we are distinctly back to the sybil problem here.   I know a number of people who have multiple handles in the forums so we are back to deciding how much to pay for what. Given forums are one of many important social communication mechanisms for everyone I think we need to have a reward component for ALL paid Maker players - as a bonus and one for everyone else.   Fortunately it isn\u2019t hard to have two SC components running and adjusting funding. ",

Because currently, most of our delegates have a full-time job that\u2019s unrelated to Maker. And this is the right setup in my opinion and it should stay this way.   With respect to @PaperImperium and @MakerMan\u2019s posts above, I disagree that Maker has become so inscrutable that it is impossible to be an informed voter without spending several hours a day on Maker related items. Is it easy to be an informed voter? No, it takes some effort. Is it as hard as being suggested here? Also no, and evidence of this beyond my anecdotal experience is that delegates hold full-time non-Maker roles.   The first step of governance is to have signal requests on the forum. These run on the premise that a forum participant is presented with the governance problem, able to understand the issue via a forum discussion and vote on it. If many delegates feel that this is not doable without extensive research, then I think I am not the only one who would disagree. On-chain votes is just an extension of this process. My thoughts on delegates taking on additional roles of becoming subject matter experts and recommending policy directions is in my previous posts. But I view this is an \u201cabove and beyond\u201d activity and more importantly, one that is not exclusive to delegates. Happy to discuss this issue in a separate thread to see how the community expects governance participation to work in the near to mid-term future. ",

It seems like you regard the current situation with Recognized Delegates as if the Maker ecosystem has achieved its goals and there is no scope for change or improvement. Okay, your view probably isn\u2019t that one-sided, but let\u2019s assume it is just for the sake of discussion.      AstronautThis:  most of our delegates have a full-time job that\u2019s unrelated to Maker   This would be expected given that the delegate compensation program is still in a trial phase, not even ratified as a MIP. In addition, it is not clear to me what the appropriate level of compensation is. I\u2019m not sure whether we are compensating delegates enough to face the prospect of MKR holders undelegating from them. The job is practically never secure. It would be prudent to keep a backup job around, at least at the current compensation level.     AstronautThis:  My thoughts on delegates taking on additional roles of becoming subject matter experts and recommending policy directions is in my previous posts.   I don\u2019t know whether most MKR holders share your views on this. I expect that there is a constant pressure for Recognized Delegates to come up with creative and compelling reasons to attract MKR interest. My sense is that we\u2019re just getting started as a DAO and that we\u2019ll see a lot of novel and surprising ideas tried out in the future.  ",

I would hazard the delegates as a team simply don\u2019t have the required time/expertise to manage this.   This is compounded by the fact that a significant proportion of contributors are non-native or advanced English speakers, which for many requires a significant extra effort to communicate at an appropriate level.   Add to this the fact that many of us have no experience in finance, IT or blockchain technology. We also have huge differences in culture, living standards and education and communication, which can also lead to misunderstandings.

In my brief time as a Delegate (6 weeks) I can see great value in Recognized Delegates over time developing areas of focus or specialty within the DAO. One could easily work the equivalent of full-time job on any number of proposals and initiatives currently underway. Since 100% voting participation is the goal, a divide and conquer approach to Delegate Voting would mean as a group we develop complementary areas of expertise. Each RD can then somewhat rely on the deeper work other Recognized Delegates are doing to understand and contribute to specific work streams. This coordinated approach would help inform voting decisions where a particular RD does not have the expertise or cannot dedicate time to be appropriately and expertly informed. I also support the notion that having Recognized Delegates who are active in other communities and doing other work in the Real World is enormously valuable to the DAO. ",
