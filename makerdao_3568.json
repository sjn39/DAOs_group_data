You can see more details in the covenant forum post and poll .  Real-world assets exposure Still only one pool: New Silver  image981\u00d7389 16.7 KB   New Silver You can find the covenants definitions in the risk assessment . This month we have some data issues as I didn\u2019t take a snapshot at the end of the month, which is why the loan value (Maker, loan tape at the end of month) is so low compared to the Centrifuge one (as of today). The DROP amount/price is of today. Therefore the CR and NewSilver TIN investments are less good than reality (but still above the threshold). This shows what would happen if two loans were fully in default.  image818\u00d7770 47 KB  Concentration in Florida is decreasing from last month and the pipe will decrease it further. You can check the previous report for a more detailed discussion on this point. The RWA Committee is assuming that the maximum state exposure makes sense at the full use at the DC to give to get diversification as a small pool is unlikely to be diversified. Analyzing the document also showed a discrepancy between the dashboard and the Risk Assessment. We wrote the LTV max was 80% but the executive document at the time showed 85%. Since then the executive document was updated to 90% max LTV. The dashboard has an \u201cExposure high LTV\u201d line that shows what is above the 85% limit. The 15% allowance was set at the creation of the report. I told New Silver to keep the exposure below the threshold. I will have another call with them to discuss the matter. The average LTV of the portfolio remains at 72%. This shows that we need to formalize our monthly audits something we will address next month and give the audit report to the RWA Committee (and to the public if this seems possible). As New Silver is growing they will ask for a DC increase, this will be a good opportunity to address those points and have a community call with New Silver. Previous reporting:  April 2021  ",

Does the RWA team see it differently, or Y\u2019all are also looking into such?   This is very a valid concern. Price where increasing already before Covid. Probably @prankstr25 (New Silver) has the best knowledge to enlighten you on that. We will look at it independently (maybe @Philinje has something to comment), but always hard to call a bubble when you are in it. To my personal opinion, we are in an everything bubble anyway and the best solution would be yield generating assets (like real-estate but not fix&flip loans). But that would probably not be the best match for MakerDAO due to the length of the loans.  image1155\u00d7428 35.6 KB  ",

A maximum average of 75% and 15% of the exposure in 85-90% LTV does seem okay to me personally if there is a business reason and if New Silver increases their TIN exposure like they are currently. As much as I like numbers, I like to understand the real risks, they are taking risks with their equity so I would start there. Numbers are usually just an approximation of a more nuanced situation.

That\u2019s a constructive way to frame it.   NewSilver changed the conditions of the Tinlake Pool following the contractual DROP agreement. We focused on the APR change (that doesn\u2019t change anything for us) and maybe missed the change in the LTV. Maybe we talk about it and didn\u2019t seem important at the time (which would be a mistake). It was detected during the monthly audit as there are here for that. The Centrifuge model is \u201ca posteriori\u201d as the assets are small and need flexibility.   I would frame it as minor as we can always liquidate which would freeze the pool assets anyway. The fix would be to disable the ability to change after the launch.   We need a more formalized covenant being signed by the AO and be upfront that it will be followed. And even put in the Tinlake Agreement directly. At some point, we can even use the on-chain data to trigger liquidation directly. For that, we need to have the tooling to even let the originator to understand the impact of adding an asset (not needed for the LTV). Adding rigidity will decrease the speed of onboarding and even remove applications. This is why I think size is important to take into account. We need to find the best solution.   ",

                    "content": "Happy to chime in. This has been a learning process for everyone, us included, and we are working hard to be transparent and originate quality debt. We are 100% committed to this process and want to see it be successful. I believe RWA and specifically, short term bridge loans, are relatively safe collateral type and we work hard to make sure we originate the best possible loans, to the best of our ability. Regarding risk, here is a great post from PeerStreet, which is a multi-billion dollar bridge loan aggregator and asset manager. They buy similar loans from originators across the country and hold them to maturity, and their risk profile is similar/higher than ours. So at the end of 2020, with 6766 loans on the books, 3.68% had foreclosure notice filed and only .53% went to REO, and out of those, only 0.31% had any principal loss. I believe this is another great data point proving the relative safety of the asset class. In our business, there are a few metrics that work well for measuring collateral valuation risk. Loan To Cost (LTC), is probably the most representative and accurate risk valuation on the entire loan, including rehab. We lend up to 90% LTC which is fairly standard in the industry. This means that the most qualified borrowers have to bring at least 10% equity to the table, and often more. Across the entire book currently on Tinlake, our average LTC is in the low 80s%. Another great metric is After Rehab Value (ARV), and we lend up to 75% ARV. This means that no loan can be above 75% of ARV. Loan to Value is a relatively good measure of the value today, and our average across Tinlake is in the low 70%. On a case by case basis, if there is very little rehab needed, LTV may be a bit above 85%, but on the average, is below that. The portfolio is well de-risked with the borrower equity and junior capital sitting above Maker\u2019s investment. We will continue to strive to keep the covenant of total volume of loans with LTV above 85% to below 15%, which is were we are now. As we were starting off with 0 balance, as the portfolio grows, it will be further de-risked and diversified. And as I hope the Peerstreet article above illustrates, there is a fairly low risk of loss on these types of assets. For any material changes we communicate with Drop investors 2 weeks in advance via email. Perhaps this process needs to improve, we are completely open to that. This is new to us just like it is to everyone else, and we are committed to improving and making it a success. ",

I know New Silver doesn\u2019t run Tinlake, but would you happen to know if the numbers on this dashboard are correct? It says the pool has a NAV of 6,395,516 DAI, with 31 assets and average financing of 226,067 DAI. Does this mean that assets with a present value of 6.3 million DAI are financed with 7 million DAI in loans? The executive summary suggest there will be a daily NAV disclosure. If those numbers are incorrect or misleading, is this because of a lag between value after rehab vs before? Is LTV calculated based on present value or expected future value? If this is an error in the data displayed on Tinlake, do you have a snapshot for us on these numbers? Thank you so much for yet again patiently engaging with us. ",

The appraisals of the underlying assets, LTVs etc are shared privately with Maker and this is is what is used as the input for the dashboard that Seb publishes (and where this screenshot is from). On the average financing of 226,067 DAI this must be a bug that we are looking int. It seems the underlying graph also counts failed transactions. It took us some time to figure out why the numbers didn\u2019t add up. Unfortunately the tinlake-subgraph is also indexing failed transactions which leads to certain borrow amounts to be counted in the aggregate (Asset 27 was counted as having borrowed 3 x 210k = 630k because there were 2 failed transactions). The on-chain data is correct and looking at the asset tab on the Tinlake Dapp shows you the correct data with an incorrect sum. We will address this in an update to the graph data in the coming days.

Centrifuge has raised and spent millions on this topic and has published every single piece of infrastructure as open source code and publicly available legal agreements. I want to emphasize that we are in this for the long run and welcome everybody with aligned interests. We have overwhelmingly positive support for our work in the community by MKR holders (the most recent inclusion poll, Peoples Company which saw quite a bit of discussion in the fourm had 30k yes and 1.5k no votes). To answer your questions more specifically:   I could argue the opposite: Maker is extremely subsidized. Centrifuge has been developing our product in close collaboration with the Maker community over more than two years. In that time we have not received a single dollar from MakerDAO or the Maker Foundation. In that time we supported business development efforts to bring Asset Originators into DeFi at a time when no one believed this was possible. When it became clear that the foundation was unable to do any work on Real World Assets and the DAO would not be able to get together a legal domain team we started paying lawyers out of our own pocket to devise a strategy and this is still a major work on our end (our next step here is hiring independent directors). We hosted calls with our lawyers to answer questions. We proposed MIP22 and developed it along with @equivrel\u2019s work on MIP21, we worked on the spells for our assets and short of the PSM probably wrote one of the technically most complicated components not developed by the PE team. All of this was done at our risk and at our cost.   Maker is funding less than 15% of all pools on Centrifuge. New Silver has been prioritizing drawing DAI from Maker as opposed to raising capital from other investors. It would be no problem to replace  Maker here. There are currently > 56 NS2-DROP token holders (see etherscan.io) and only 2.8M DAI of 7.2M DAI are funded through Maker.   The SPVs are not making any money. That might be a misunderstanding of yours. The SPV funnels all proceeds from any loans on its books to token holders (minus management fees to pay for tax filings etc.). The Asset Originators have different business models, some invest in the junior tranche, some charge an origination fee. In the instance of New Silver, they are an established and profitable business that has existed outside of our world of DeFi for a few years and is in good standing (as verified and described in the risk evaluation that was originally published) and they charge an origination fee but also have their own money in the junior tranche. Changing the rate doesn\u2019t have any impact on this. The rate was adjusted to respond to market conditions. Remember this pool was launched during some of the darker times of the pandemic and higher interest rates were prudent at the time. @prankstr25 posted a good summary on the asset class and how it performed more recently a few posts up.   I am sure the community is not opposed and Maker could build something similar to the CropJoin adapter that was proposed for farming other rewards.   ",

Let me rephrase \u2013 I would like evidence that they are generating net positive cash flow.     spin:  The Asset Originators have different business models, some invest in the junior tranche, some charge an origination fee.   All of them receive liquidity rewards (which go to the AO and not the SPV). AOs \u2013 including New Silver \u2013 are receiving tens of thousands per day in CFG tokens, even if you give a substantial discount to the current quoted prices for your token.     spin:  The rate was adjusted to respond to market conditions. Remember this pool was launched during some of the darker times of the pandemic and higher interest rates were prudent at the time. @prankstr25 posted a good summary on the asset class and how it performed more recently a few posts up.   Not an unreasonable explanation. But you have to understand why it gives me pause that a significant reduction in payout to other investors has occurred \u2013 which we are just now discovering \u2013 while simultaneously receiving rewards from Centrifuge that literally pays the AO to make SPVs to borrow money.     spin:  I am sure the community is not opposed and Maker could build something similar to the CropJoin adapter that was proposed for farming other rewards.   Does this mean that yes, Maker will be given CFG at the same rate as all other investors going forward? I want to clarify. I know I put you on the spot, so it\u2019s ok to say you need to think about it, but want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page about Centrifuge\u2019s reply. I know a lot of this sounds adversarial to Centrifuge, and I apologize it has come to this. I\u2019m sure it is beginning to sound like a rug pull from your perspective and how far along all these deals are. Ultimately, the fault lies with us, as there were clearly many material facts to these deals that were either missed by our due diligence process or glossed over in the excitement to finally bring real-world assets into the Maker ecosystem. I will be calling for renegotiation of these deals. Perhaps it will pass, perhaps not. But do expect me to call for all of these to be re-opened for discussion next week, likely accompanied by an urgent request through our governance process to pause while renegotiation and further fact finding can occur. I have come to be associated with tight purse strings and stringent oversight. I keep trying to distance myself from that role because it is not pleasant to always be asking uncomfortable questions. But this has been quite the rabbit hole, with new facts coming to light every week \u2013 and few of them encouraging. I do not fault you or your AOs for trying to negotiate the best deal possible for yourselves, but please understand that Maker needs to do the same thing. I do still think Maker and Centrifuge can continue to do business together, but Maker needs to be able to clearly understand the incentives of all parties involved. It is worrisome when all other parties are being subsidized heavily. Not only from a fairness standpoint \u2013 why should Maker be denied the same terms you provide to others \u2013 but because I would like to know that this will not collapse when subsidies end. The worst thing that can happen for Maker is to be invested in a wide array of these pools and then have all of the co-investors leave because the 300-700% yield they were getting is now reduced. ",

Keep in mind the property is being bought distressed and below market, this is not someone buying at market hoping to flip a year later for more, which is pure speculation.  I represent parties that do this.  In my area the bubble started happening right when Covid shut down started, and is still going.  In December 2020 for example, I assisted in the purchase of a distressed home, for $146k.  It was a house that before the bubble a year before would probably sell in good condition for $160k, with the bubble my client estimated $200k or more.  The key why the client went ahead and did it is the client\u2019s assessment was the repairs and improvement would take no more than 10 weeks and about $30k - pretty quick for a bubble to burst and burst $25k to go below $176k.   On another, in good condition with the bubble RE agents believed it would sell for just under $700k, but before the bubble $550k.  The party selling wanted $500k.  There were multiple interested fix and flip parties, but only one would pay more than $450k, and the reason being the repairs and improvement would cost at least $110k and would take at least 6 and maybe 8 months, and thus the risk the bubble could burst during the repair process was much greater - and the fix and flippers were factoring in that risk.

                    "content": "  Given that New Silver already reduced expected returns to DROP holders by 20% (from 5% to 4%), can the SPVs on Centrifuge still reliably make money without these CFG tokens?   With regards to New Silver\u2019s SPV, the goal of the SPV is to have enough funds to cover its on going expenses and to have some cushion for the \u201cknown unknowns\u201d, not to have a profit at the end. In our modeling, we did not account for any CFG derived revenues, since at this point, its mostly speculation and we do not know if/when the reward token will be liquid. So in our case, the SPV can be solvent without any help from CFG. I should also add that in addition to reducing the DROP rate (which was a move based on strong demand and to allow the AO to position itself for stronger market share), the revenue to us, the asset originator, was also reduced at the same time. Most of the DROP reduction is being passed on to our borrowers. ",

Prudent debt investment demands that the ability to meet all obligations of a borrower be considered more important than mere seniority structure. Debt of an equivalent seniority to that of Maker experiencing a 100 bps cut to interest is not comfortable to see. I think it was partly the shock of learning of the change of terms nearly three weeks after your communication with debt investors on or about May 21st that caused such a strong response with regard to New Silver. Adding more points of contact \u2014 which will soon be proposed \u2014 should prevent that communication breakdown in the future. I wish you well, I look forward to the DAO providing you with more channels of communication to avoid unpleasant surprises, and I hope this is merely a bump in a long, mutually profitable relationship.

We simply cannot have Vault\u2019s in this system where any changes to material parameters (i.e. the parameters MKR holders control on all Vaults) can be made without an on-chain vote, especially by the borrower themselves. This is not that hard to do for New Silver, just make these parameters materials terms in the legal agreements (for which drafts should then be published and not siloed with a core unit) and appoint an independent director who will have to sign off on the changes if and only if the change is verified by MKR vote.

Perhaps a lot of this comes from there being a mismatch of expectations of what is expected to safeguard against a variety of risks in financial services. Right now I see a lot of key person risk and an open advocacy by a lending platform for increasing corruption risk. The first can be reduced fairly easily and the latter should be expressly forbidden, not just for the RWF CU but for any CU that is involved with operations or decision making for an asset. ",

While I\u2019m always glad to see new people get involved, please try to ensure you have a good understanding of the issues before accusing mandated members of the DAO of conflicts of interest. In this case, as @SebVentures has explained, investing in DROP brings him into closer alignment with the protocol (which is also effectively investing in DROP) and gives him access to documentation and legal recourse which can be used on behalf of MakerDAO recover value to all DROP holders in the event of an unforeseen issue. \u2013 Minor conflicts of interest do exist in many other places as @spin describes. The example of UNI is a good one. If the protocol onboards the UNI token as a vault type, that could represent a conflict of interest for mandated actors that own UNI because they might benefit from the existence of the UNI-A vault. The NS-DROP example is different, because anyone can invest in DROP outside of the Maker Protocol already - onboarding it gives @SebVentures no personal advantage, and his token investment in it gives the DAO a massive advantage because it adds a Protocol aligned DROP holder that exists as a legal entity and can interact with the legal system (which Maker cannot.) To address conflicts of interest in general, these definitely exist in some places and are very difficult to mitigate given the anonymity of the blockchain and the tendency for projects to airdrop tokens to everyone. I would like to see a more consistent and structured method for mandated actors to communicate these conflicts of interest, so that might be a MIP worth working on, if someone has an interest and some time. However, it is worth mentioning that there can be no requirement for community members to reveal conflicts of interest and these can often go unnoticed unless explicitly mentioned. Unfortunately, this will always be an issue the DAO must deal with in its internal community interactions. ",

It is always difficult to defend oneself against accusations of favoritism. I understand that the picture is that we might have 4.5 Centrifuge assets soon (People starting at 0 like 6S) while we have only 0.5 other kinds of assets (6S). At the same time, the Centrifuge model is simpler, more easily upgradable, and there is a whole team working on it for years. And the first one is harder than the following ones. This is why our main focus now is on Trust-based investments which are 6S and SolarX currently. For SolarX, we told them for months that they just have to wait for 6S and do the same. The reason we are now contemplating a new trust way (but for the most part a copycat of 6S idea) is because we have a legal expert on our team and we start to have legal firms to help us. We are working closely with the borrower and its counsel to move forward. At any point in time, they can go directly to the community. And the community can decide that our proposed structure is not good. 6S chose a way to interact more directly with the community than the RWF CU which is fine by me. There was little value add we could provide at the time. And for what I understand, it\u2019s a done deal. To be clear, I am not, not expect to, delaying or blocking any DC increase executive for 6S. MKR holders have access to a great amount of information and had all the time needed to ask for more if they wanted to. My job is to present the information I find to the MKR holders and facilitate RWA, not decide. If some of that information is wrong anyone can correct that as well. If you think I\u2019ve missed something you can raise the point. And any opinion from the community adds a data point for MKR holders to use (or not). I think this thread shows that the community can be quite vocal and have strong opinions. ",

In the future if he buys NS DROP (which is not an investment in Centrifuge) that is an investment aligned with Maker and is a benefit to Maker for a very reason that has been brought up about the % of Maker investment in this deal in relation to other Drop and Tin investment being too great.   Would I like to know about future investment if it was being done while one was still negotiating a deal or increased debt ceiling for Maker?  Sure, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Not bagging on you Tosh at all but at this negative forum conversation generally, what @williamr said, this conversation is not constructive particularly in a public forum. ",

There needs to be specific tax exclusions for withholding tax on interest paid to borderless smart contracts. Congress is severely behind; however, they are always taking recommendations. I have taken the first crack at modifying the code to make sense of all of this. Section 861 should be modified to read: (1)Interest from the United States or the District of Columbia, and interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations of noncorporate residents or domestic corporations not including\u2014 (A)interest\u2014 (i) on deposits with a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership if such branch is engaged in the commercial banking business, and (ii) on amounts satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (B) of section 871(i)(3) which are paid by a foreign branch of a domestic corporation or a domestic partnership, (B) in the case of a foreign partnership, which is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business outside the United States, any interest not paid by a trade or business engaged in by the partnership in the United States and not allocable to income which is effectively connected (or treated as effectively connected) with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States; and (C) in the case of a decentralized lending protocol, interest that would be considered portfolio interest under section 871. section 871(h) should be modified (h)Repeal of tax on interest of nonresident alien individuals received from certain portfolio debt investments (1)In general In the case of any portfolio interest received by a nonresident individual or decentralized lending protocol from sources within the United States, no tax shall be imposed under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(C) of subsection (a).

You can see more details in the covenant forum post and poll. This is the first batch. We are still figuring out some details.  New Silver You can find the covenants definitions in the risk assessment.  image821\u00d7758 46.6 KB  As you can see most covenants are checked except the state exposure. There was a significant deal flow in Florida lately. We set a 30% for no reason except it seemed clever at the time. Since then, we are in the process of maybe onboarding SolarX which is for 100M DAI invested only in NY or farmlands all located in Iowa. Moreover, the Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust 2020-EXP1 RMBS is located at 62% in California and that didn\u2019t prevent credit rating agencies to make the senior tranche AAA (the highest grade). We had discussed the matter with @prankstr25 and there is plenty of opportunities to resolve the matter: 1- avoid Florida loan origination: This will slow the increase of the exposure or even remove it completely. 2- change the risk assessment: It is our perception that increasing state exposure is not significantly risky (investing in non-vibrant states is way riskier). Nevertheless, having such sensible covenants allows raising awareness. 3- New Silver has some origination from Massachusetts and NY but they are too big to fit the pool covenant at this stage (1-1.5M). Some of those borrowers are repeat customers from New Silver which feels safer. With the expected origination trend, those loans will be covenant-friendly in a few months. 4- New Silver is also expanding in California. This will take a few months, but this might increase geographical diversification as well. Therefore there are plenty of options. It is probably not important enough to take significant governance bandwidth. At the same time, it\u2019s always good to have a discussion with a diverse group. This problem seems well fitted for a MIP46 Parameter Proposition Group with a mandate to make suggestions based on RWF inputs. Happy to get feedback on the idea. ",
