                    "content": " Dust Parameter Definition dust is the minimum permitted debt for a vault. Users must borrow at least this amount to open a vault, and cannot repay their debt below this amount unless they pay off the entire remaining balance. Higher dust values make vaults less accessible for smaller users, but also protect Maker from risk of vaults being too small to liquidate profitably. You can learn more in the documentation here.  Gas Price Environment Since the collapse of Terra, Celsius, and 3AC in May and June of this year, Ethereum gas prices have compressed significantly.  1306\u00d7476 31.5 KB  Source: ycharts Activity has increased over the past few weeks due to market crashes and significant repositioning as some crypto platforms slid into insolvency. However, gas prices remain far below sustained highs seen in 2021 and early 2022.  Dust Limit Review Dust Limit Analysis Sheet Dust Simulation Due to lower ETH and gas prices, our existing dust limits may provide a greater than necessary buffer against bad debt from small vaults. Reducing dust limits could allow for greater accessibility and user acquisition. There is some risk of negative user experience for small vault users, if ETH and/or gas prices risk in the future and Maker is forced to increase dust parameters. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the ability to repay vaults with collateral using flash loans, available through Oasis and others. It\u2019s also worth noting that the effective cost of using a small value Maker vault has declined significantly, which means the potential utility of small vaults has increased somewhat versus when prior dust changes were made. And declining gas cost and ETH price mean that users can be expected to defend their positions at smaller borrowing levels (vs alternative of allowing position to be liquidated and paying penalty).  1600\u00d7805 262 KB  Source: User cost analysis sheet  Source: Dust analysis sheet For comparison, neither Compound nor Aave have dust parameters preventing users from opening small vault positions. While each protocol has accumulated some bad debt as a result of small vault positions, the total amount of bad debt accumulated is very small relative to TVL and protocol revenue. This suggests that potential losses Maker could face from small vault positions is manageable, and could be more than offset by benefits to user acquisition and PR.  1420\u00d7466 63.8 KB  While average gas prices are low, there is still a potential for them to spike significantly during sharp market downturns. For this reason, it is recommended to target parameters that can accommodate up to 1,000 gwei gas prices. Selecting a conservative gas target here also has the effect of compensating for potential increases in ETHUSD price, which impacts USD denominated transaction costs. Accommodation for potential intra-hour drawdowns in collateral prices varies by vault type, and is generally centered on 15% for large cap assets (ETH, WBTC, WSTETH), and 20-30% for mid-small cap assets (YFI, MANA, etc). For ETH-A and WBTC-A, accommodating 1,000 gwei gas and 15% intrahour drawdown yields target dust value of roughly 5,000 DAI.  1268\u00d7654 111 KB  WSTETH vault types should generally correspond with their comparable ETH vault type; while liquidation ratios are higher (which improves Maker\u2019s margin of safety with respect to small vaults), this is offset by greater potential downside volatility due to limited stETH liquidity.  1270\u00d7654 107 KB  ETH-B and WBTC-B vault types could have dust lowered to as little as 10,000 DAI while maintaining resilience to target gas and drawdown metrics. However, because these vaults are inherently riskier, it is recommended to set dust at 15,000 DAI instead. In the event that gas or ETH prices increase quickly, this additional buffer will prevent excessive accumulation while Maker governance considers possible dust parameter increases.  998\u00d7656 94.8 KB  ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B could have their dust values reduced to roughly 2,500 DAI while accommodating target gas and drawdown metrics. These vaults may offer significant utility for small users through low stability fees, while still providing Maker with significant protection through their high collateral ratios. And this debt size is still large enough for Maker to recoup tip incentives paid to liquidators (requiring a minimum debt size of roughly 2,000 DAI given 250 tip and 13% liquidation penalty), which helps protect against possible \u201ctip farming\u201d where users would purposefully open small vaults and allow them to be liquidated to claim gas incentives.  1540\u00d7658 118 KB  Small cap vaults (CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, YFI-A, LINK-A, RENBTC-A, MANA-A, and MATIC-A) could have dust reduced as low as 3,000-5,000 DAI while maintaining adequate buffers against liquidation losses. However it is proposed to set dust to 10,000 instead to avoid a buildup of small positions in vault types with high market risk and less certainty of continuing support in the Maker protocol. This will help prevent negative UX where users can\u2019t hold their positions open for long enough to amortize gas costs (either due to volatility forcing users to deleverage, or collateral offboarding).  1402\u00d7654 116 KB  (vaults with 165% liquidation ratio)  1404\u00d7656 115 KB  (vaults with 175% liquidation ratio) Remaining LP token collateral types (UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A) are recommended to maintain their current dust thresholds. For the stablecoin LP vault types, these vaults require significant amounts of capital invested for users to break even on gas costs and earn a positive return, so the existing 15,000 DAI dust limits present no limitation to organic usage. And with each of these LP vault types, there is less certainty of Maker maintaining support over the long run, which makes it less suitable to encourage small vault usage through reduction in dust limits.  Proposed Changes Based on changes in gas and ETH price environment, the following updates to dust are proposed: Option 1 This option includes broad reduction of dust limits across vault types.  Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 5,000 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 2,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 15,000 DAI Reduce dust for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, MANA-A and RENBTC-A to 10,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A  Option 2 This option includes more limited dust reductions, targeted towards large cap vault types with highest potential utility for small users while limiting risk of liquidation losses.  Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 7,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 3,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 25,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, MANA-A, RENBTC-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A   User Impact Analysis Because dust limits are either remaining unchanged or being reduced, the proposed updates will not adversely impact UX for any existing vault users. In fact, these changes may improve usability for some vault users who opened positions before the most recent dust limit increases. However, users who open or maintain small value vaults (particularly below the pre-change dust values) should be aware of the possibility that dust limits may be increased again in the future if gas and ETH prices increase. The figure below shows the rough number of vaults affected by the last dust limit increase passed in late 2021 (data as of 11 November 2021). This may offer an indication of potential user impacts of future dust limit changes in response to increasing transaction costs.  978\u00d7159 16.8 KB  Source: Dust analysis sheet, data sourced from mcdstate site  Next Steps We\u2019d like to pose the question of whether to decrease dust limits to delegates via on chain polling in the coming weeks. This should include each of the above options, as well as an option for no changes. In the meantime, community members and delegates are encouraged to share their opinion of proposed dust limit changes or raise any alternative changes they\u2019d prefer. ",

I provide passive liquidity to Uniswap for ETH/USDC on Arbitrum/Optimism/Polygon/mainnet and I get between 15% and 30% APY. I used to provide liquidity for DAI pairs but the yield was much lower (still is?) so I quit doing that. ",

If gas price over the last x months < Y gwei, then set dust to Z, kind of algorithm.   I\u2019m thinking about that from a vault owner perspective, it adds more risk and complexity. This would need a fair bit of education. Could we build shared vaults?

                    "content": "Hi all, with the new year and governance back in full swing, I\u2019d like to push these proposed dust changes to an on chain poll. I\u2019ve attached some updated data to account for recent changes in market conditions. TL;DR:  ETH price and gas prices have increased since time of initial post Original recommendations and poll options are still appropriate given market conditions   Market Conditions Analysis was initially performed at an ETH price of ~$1,300, where currently ETH is trading close to $1,600. This will increase the DAI denominated transaction costs of participating in liquidations. However, all of the previously proposed dust parameter changes included a significant margin of safety, and they are still generally appropriate even with ETH having increased by 20-25%. Gas prices have also increased, but this doesn\u2019t significantly impact the analysis as we target resilience against gas spikes of up to 1,000 gwei, far higher than any recently seen conditions.  1144\u00d7398 33.6 KB  yCharts  Dust Limit Review Updated data in this workbook: Maker Dust Analysis (January 2023) ETH-A and WBTC-A: Dust value as low as 5,000 DAI remains appropriate to accommodate 15% intrahour drawdown and 1,000 gwei gas.  1420\u00d7738 116 KB  WSTETH-A: 5,000 DAI dust remains appropriate, considering higher liquidation ratio but also potential for greater drawdown vs ETH-A.  1426\u00d7748 114 KB  ETH-B and WBTC-B: The previous proposed 15,000 DAI dust limit was very conservative, and is still suitable to mitigate risk for these vault types.  1124\u00d7748 101 KB  ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B: Original recommendation of reducing dust as low as 2,500 DAI remains suitable for these assets despite increase in ETH price.  1600\u00d7687 250 KB  Small cap vaults (YFI-A, LINK-A, MATIC-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A): Previous proposed 10,000 dust limit was very conservative and remains sufficient to limit risk from small cap vaults.  1576\u00d7746 120 KB  (165% liquidation threshold)  1576\u00d7744 119 KB  (175% liquidation threshold) Uniswap LP vaults (UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A): No changes are proposed. Existing dust limits remain suitable. GNO-A: This is a newly added vault that is primarily expected to be used by Gnosis DAO. No changes to the existing 100,000 DAI dust limit are proposed. Inactive vaults (MANA-A, RENBTC-A): Since the initial post, these vaults have had their debt ceiling and exposure reduced to 0 DAI. Therefore, no dust changes are proposed.  Proposed Changes The initially proposed options are still suitable and will be presented in the governance poll unchanged. Option 1 This option includes broad reduction of dust limits across vault types.  Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 5,000 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 2,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 15,000 DAI Reduce dust for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, and MATIC-A to 10,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for GNO-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A (along with 0 DC vaults RENBTC-A and MANA-A)  Option 2 This option includes more limited dust reductions, targeted towards large cap vault types with highest potential utility for small users while limiting risk of liquidation losses.  Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 7,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 3,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 25,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for GNO-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A (along with 0 DC vaults RENBTC-A and MANA-A)  Option 3 No changes to current dust parameters.  Next Steps Risk-001 @Risk-Core-Unit would like to push these proposed options forward to an on chain governance poll next week. If any changes are supported, they will then be included in a following executive vote. ",
