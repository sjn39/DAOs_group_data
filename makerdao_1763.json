Navigate to the DAI Accounts tab  of the Maker instance to see your current DAI balance and total DAI earned.  Cred Stats A total of 8.472 Cred have been generated in the last two weeks, with 109 topics and 926 posts created. As we can see in the first graph below, the activity has been quite uneven, with a rise in activity during the first week and a noticeable drop in the second reaching the lowest levels of the year. The second chart underscores the abrupt change when compared to the same period the previous year, which shows a much more stable transition between weeks.  773\u00d7501 22.2 KB   767\u00d7535 11.3 KB  Top 5 Categories Below are the top 5 categories of the period, ranked by Cred generated.

Discord It may be one of the factors that explain the current drop in forum participation, although it is probably not the only one. Ideally the forum is where one can better articulate ideas and concepts and where discussions can be developed in more depth. In that sense, looking for example to increase the weight of some categories such as RFC or SR seems a good option to encourage qualitative discussion. Another idea could be to make the system a mean to certify the reputational factor linked to Cred, visible to the whole community and validable for other communities where Maker is widely respected. I think the symbolic factor is important within Maker and in the general ecosystem and is something we haven\u2019t explored yet. ",

We are here with the most recent information on what has been going on with SC over the past few weeks! If you want to check our instance you can find it here. Please leave your comments below if there is anything else you would like to see added.   Announcements The governance facilitators submitted an on-chain vote last week to gauge MKR voter support for the remotion of DAI funding for the two Sourcecred instances for delegates and non-delegates. The governance decision was to stop funding the contributions with DAI, therefore payouts will cease to be effective as of November 1, and this month will be the last in which GovAlpha will issue them. GovAlpha is still working to find alternatives to keep using Cred as a collaborative and reputational incentive tool. We will have news on this very soon. In the meantime, the Proposal Bounties Program continues with its regular operation and we hope that everyone can join and participate!  Cred Stats In the last three weeks, a total of 4,454 Cred have been generated, with 82 topics and 706 posts created. As we can see in the first chart, the activity has been decreasing week by week, reaching in the last one lowest value to date, breaking the 1000 Cred floor. The second graph reinforces the low activity of the period when contrasted with last year\u2019s values, where in some cases production quadrupled.  788\u00d7497 23.9 KB   776\u00d7537 12.3 KB  Top Contributions Below are the top 10 topics created in the period, ranked by Cred generated.
