                    "content": "As the redditors among you may have seen. I posted a reddit thread last week titled: MakerDAO: Looking for Governance The aim was to increase voter engagement and bring more MKR holders to this forum ahead of the ratification votes on the Foundation\u2019s proposals. While there was some moderate success to that aim (hello and welcome to those that started posting here in response to that thread!) there were also many useful responses detailing why people are not participating in voting.  It seems that most of these reasons can fall into three categories: Procedural: Lack of understanding around the voting process, or a failure to know when votes are taking place. Practical: Too much understanding of the realities of voting with a small amount of MKR. Emotional: Doesn\u2019t feel good about voting or doesn\u2019t feel \u2018prepared\u2019 enough to vote.  Procedural Reasons: #2. Moving the discussions to the forums killed participation. - True for a few people, but in general participation in reddit governance was already waning before the move to the forum. #3. UI around polls needs to be improved. #6. Governance discussion and information is scattered between three forums and a blog. #5. There is no good introduction on how to vote / MKR Holders don\u2019t know how to vote - *A series of video tutorials that explain the voting process in more detail about help mitigate this. Also the voter on-boarding guide. #7. The voting contract bug caused users to realize the risk they were taking by voting. #13. Majority may not know voting is even happening. #15. No simple and safe user interface to use to vote. #18. Institutional Investors don\u2019t currently have custodial solutions for voting. - Not sure we can do anything about this one, are Coinbase are working on this stuff?  Practical Reasons #1. Voting is not worth the cost in time - We need to minimise the informational cost in some way. Governance Twitter account, Governance and Risk Meeting edits, Better \u2018Governance at a Glance\u2019 thread? #10. There is no incentive to voting - Need to be careful about directly rewarding voters as it doesn\u2019t incentivize informed voting. Tabling for now as any changes here are complex and require engineering work on the system. #11. The average speculator doesn\u2019t care about MKR governance. - This might be a matter of the system just not pulling in enough in fees yet. Once there is 1 Billion Dai in circulation, we might see investors become governors. #16. Opportunity Cost is too high. - At least some MKR holders have MKR locked in uniswap instead of voting, can we reward voting in some way? If MKR is locked to vote, can it be used to earn interest? #17. Non-voting MKR holders feel that voting MKR holders are doing a good job. #19. Voting is not worth the tx costs - Tx costs for voting are actually very small, even still, there may be some solution here with Gas Station Network  Emotional Reasons #4. Whales outweigh most other voters, making voting feel like a waste of gas. -  This has been discussed, but there is probably no good solution here. #8. Waning excitement with the timeline of MCD. - Definitely a contributing factor, launch of MCD will hopefully draw a number of these people back. #9. Lack of transparency leading to MKR sell-off among previously interested parties. #12. Purple pill affair caused interested voters to sell their MKR or cease participating. #14. Voting twice a week is overkill and leads to voter apathy. - Reduce the frequency of voting. Once (sometimes twice) a week is a high demand on peoples time and attention. In the future, look into automation. Reducing granularity could help here, but this has it\u2019s own trade-offs.  Common Themes   Cost of voting is too high. There is a combination of informational, opportunity and gas costs that make voting undesirable.  Lack of transparency in the past has hurt participation.  Delegation was brought up multiple times, generally positively. Some users said that they would be willing to delegate, but not to vote themselves.  Rewarding Voting was also brought up a couple of times, the implication being, more users would vote if voting was directly rewarded.   At some point I\u2019ll do a proper write up of what I perceive to be the issues with the voting system, but for the time being we are stuck with it, so it might be worthwhile to think about how we can counter some of these cited reasons. As a brief look, some of them are more valid than others, some are flat out wrong and some we can do nothing about. If we can get a discussion going, I can summarise people\u2019s thoughts on these reasons and add them to the list in-line. There are 17 I managed to pick out, between us, we ought to be able to cover all of them and in some cases, figure out a response. ",

Either:  One long video, and a 5min highlight edit (but who makes this?) Split the video into sections.  That\u2019s more work for @rich.brown though. Getting a governance twitter account up and running could be a good way of prompting engagement and spreading information about votes and such. I think @kwadrax was looking into this? ",

Also I agree that introducing delegation as an additional option is a good Idea. I believe this can be done just as extension of a system not a change, but for sure requires solid code review process since lot of funds (and power) will be at stake and (even more importantly) emergence of some new proffessionalized entities that (kind of rating agencies) present their views on the health of a system and related to this voting decisions ",

The MKR token is mostly held by whales. They are going to make the decisions. If not all the times, when it really matters.  ~1000 Holders at ~10MKR  This would still be a small 1% of total supply, and at the moment I can\u2019t even see 50 people, let alone 1000, which are active in the discussions around forum/reddit, etc. So, again to my point. People want to (and should be incentivised to !) participate to Maker with ideas, enthusiasm, proposals, etc. But they don\u2019t necessarily need to vote with their 7.3MKR to be useful. In fact they are vastly more useful, overall, just by discussing interesting ideas (as LongForWisdom does often) for the public. What the foundation should do, rather than expecting people to take risks, pay fees, and use their 7.3 MKR to vote, is  to promote transparency: people need to know what is actually open to discussion, what need ideas/discussion, and what does not. This requires honesty.  For example: now we have this fast governance schedule to do because MCD is close. The foundation wants mostly quickly approval of these key things to make progress. What they don\u2019t need now is excessive discussion and/or excessive ambition in what the governance should/can do. Let\u2019s be clear about that. Fake democracy leads to frustration.   answer often to questions/requests,  Now we will have a Rich Brown in the important role of \u201cfacilitator\u201d di bridge the distance between the foundation and the community. Because there is quite some distance now! Let\u2019s hope for some improvements. The community (not whales) can do a significant \u201csocial\u201d work off-chain in my opinion. Sure, they can also vote, but a single drunk whale (there used to be a whale on the maker chat, claiming to be drunk all the time, and they proved to have a couple of millions in MKR at least) can outweight their small share of votes. What a whale cannot outweight easily is:   discussion and visibility in the (off-chain) Maker community: take for example the activity done by LongForWisdom. It\u2019s completely irrelevant if LFW has voted with 1, 10, or 1000 MKR. His activity has been more significant off-chain imho.   lead and educate others, ultimately influencing the vote more than what could be done with 7.3 MKR.  To do this, active (and educated) members of the community need to be supported by the Foundation (assuming the foundation servers the purpose of \"bootstrapping the system). Again, pushing the example given by LongForWisdom, all his significant time investment has been observed/read/appreciated only by the very few active members following this forum or the governance calls (<50 in total I\u2019d say).   just my 0.02 DAI.

In fact, I hope not every MKR holder will end up voting. The (educated, \u201cscientific\u201d) voting process requires a lot of thoughts, education, time to follow the news/ideas/developments, etc. Not many MKR holders have these things. I think that, while it\u2019s legitimate that the Foundation hopes to get more MKR-holders onboard with voting, it should not be expected nor desired to see more than 4-5% of the MKR holders to vote. This is not supposed to work as a democracy whose voting system is conceived to \u201caccept to get a decent sub-optimal outcome, focus on avoiding the worse\u201d. We need (and want, as MKR holders hoping for financial profits) some kind of voting habits designed to \u201cget good results, try to achieve the best\u201d. ",

If I remember correctly, there is a project now under development to integrate Maker with Aragon. So I think we might see delegated votes possible in 12-24 months.

I think vote delegation would be fantastic. Small MKR holders collectively form a large block. I believe that most are rational actors and would be fairly proactive about delegating their MKR if the tools were appropriate and simple. Here are some of my ideas, but I\u2019m not entirely sure how feasible they are. I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable participating unless I maintained full custody over my MKR. I think this is crucial to any delegaton. In an ideal world, vote delegation could occur from a phone app. Something where I can see where my vote is delegated, see what my delegate is voting for, links I can click on to see the reasoning behind each vote. Going one step further, I could imagine being able to split vote delegations between multiple delegates. ",

Discourse got mad at me the last time\u2026     LongForWisdom:  Moving the discussions to the forums killed participation.   Governance engagement was dead in Reddit long before we moved to discourse.     LongForWisdom:  All of this is anecdotal, so if you can link to an instance of an institutional investor (or someone claiming to be so) saying that they need a good custodian, or that they are not interested in voting and only looking for a passive investment, I\u2019ll add those reasons to the list.

I will never stop asking this: If anyone knows of any research that proposes a voting incentive mechanism that is not gameable for profit, PLEASE let me know.     mrabino1:  Is it possible in the future to allow for message signing that the foundation \u201crecords\u201d instead of on-chain voting? food for thought\u2026   We\u2019ve been discussing metatransactions ala Gas Station Network internally. If the fees, and not the risk of moving large sums of MKR around, that is the friction, we can solve that.     LongForWisdom:  I\u2019d suggest reorganising how the governance and risk meetings are uploaded to youtube. Currently they are uploaded as one long video, it might be easier to consume in a shorter format.   We\u2019ve discussed this as well. It involves a significant amount of time and effort though, and we haven\u2019t found anyone willing to do it. It already takes just over a full person day just to get the  transcripts/summaries/github/forum/reddit/twitter/youtube/soundcloud stuff done.     Adam_Skrodzki:  Also I think Maker team should make some deep analysis of MKR holders addresses to find out more about reasons why there is not so much minority voting   There are a lot of very smart people in our community and it\u2019s all on the chain. It\u2019s my hope that the community can step up and do this kind of analysis as well.     The_Ratj:  I think vote delegation would be fantastic.   I posted a bunch about this in chat earlier today, but the short answer is that we are working with a team that has expressed interest in setting up vote delegation system that will use aragon as a wrapper. There is a shared doc where the community is welcome to add suggestions and help brainstorm. My take on the apathy problem: Having watched every second of the governance process since inception there is no doubt in my mind that the primary reason is simply that it\u2019s not fun anymore. We\u2019ve exhausted the level of engagement we can expect from people. No one wants to tweak the same number every single week. Nor can we reasonably expect a large segment of users to stay up to date on the volume of data we produce. There could be a host of other contributing factors but ultimately: it\u2019s too much like work. ",

I do not think such thing can occure without incentive. As You have stated \u201cit\u2019s too much like work\u201d Of course the question is if such analysis is actually needed. Have You ever consider something similar to \u201cEthereum Grants\u201d program but in MakerDAO space ? It works quite well for Ethereum ecosystem. ",

                    "content": "    Adam_Skrodzki:  Have you collected information about any of following ?  How much MKR where Locked for voting in previous system How much MKR is Locked now What percentage of locked MKR\u2019s participate in certain votings.    This is all visible on-chain, we don\u2019t currently have a dashboard or any analytics too to surface this sort of information though. There is a \u2018help-wanted\u2019 thread here.      jernejml:  My point being, i would guess #11 is currently the most important factor, and no matter how you will optimize on other reasons, there will be no significant gain in voting of small mkr owners.   I\u2019ll add your thoughts to the OP.      jernejml:  I don\u2019t think actual increase in voting addresses should be high on \u201cpriority list\u201d and main focus should be to get as many people commenting on this forum to get as many perspectives as possible.       iammeeoh:  I personally hold the (very debatable) opinion that at this stage it is far more important to have discussion than to vote , at least for small fishes, and to see the discussion having some kind of measurable effect.   I find it interesting that other people feel this way too. Having more eyes and brains thinking about the system is probably more important in the long run than having a high percentage of MKR voting. (And thanks for the kind words Meoh.)      mrabino1:  As a parallel in the stock market, most folks that own stock do not vote. They rely on the directors / mutual fund (proxy whales) / and the occiasional shareholder activist to vote to take action\u2026   I actually disagree that this parallel is 100% valid. We have the potential (though it\u2019s not yet been fully met) to make voting and informing oneself on votes far, far cheaper in terms of informational and temporal cost than participating in a shareholder vote. I believe and fervently hope we can do better participation-wise than shareholder votes. All we need to vote is an internet connection and a little gas, I\u2019d guess that for most shareholder votes there are many more hoops to jump through.      Adam_Skrodzki:  But I agree that it is more important to have discussions and if voting effects are not controversial I believe it is perfecly reasonable there is low attendance rate.   Low attendance is okay so long as it doesn\u2019t leave the system open to manipulation by a single MKR holder. Ideally I think we would have a minimum level of participation that exceeds the holdings of the largest non-voting MKR holder (Though right now this is probably not feasible.)      Jeffshaw:  \u201cThere is no good introduction on how to vote.\u201d and \u201cMKR holders do not know how to vote\u201d. If a series of step by step video tutorials could be put together of the different ways to vote and the associated pros/cons/inherit risks, we would see an immediate increase in participation.   I\u2019ll add these to the OP. Welcome to the forum @Jeffshaw       iammeeoh:  We need (and want, as MKR holders hoping for financial profits) some kind of voting habits designed to \u201cget good results, try to achieve the best\u201d.   Agree, I\u2019d love to be able to do better than current democracies around the world. With a combination of scientific governance and consensus decision making I think we can get there. As you say, it may not involve a huge amount of MKR actively voting on a regular basis.      Tarpmaster:  I used to vote every week regarding the stability fee. Just sort of seemed pointless after a while. I would definitely vote for asset parameters, as long as it doesn\u2019t become to granular and burdensome.   Thanks for your input, Tarp, and welcome to the forum. I\u2019ll add granularity as a point in the OP.      The_Ratj:  New to posting in the forum but hoping to get more involved\u2026 I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable participating unless I maintained full custody over my MKR.   Welcome to the forum, Ratj. We definitely need a delegation solution that doesn\u2019t give anyone else the ability to withdraw your MKR, unfortunately any implementation will require that it be locked in a smart-contract (at least for executive votes with the current implementation of DS-Chief.)      kwadrax:  I am very surprised people are waiting for and in favor of vote delegation   Heh, I\u2019m not. While I am all for decentralised governance we need to recognise the limitations, most people just can\u2019t make the commitment to keeping up with the arguments week after week. I think the best we can hope for is liquid democracy (or plutocracy I guess): allowing MKR holders to revoke their delegation at any time and change their vote so long as the voting period hasn\u2019t ended.     kwadrax:  Are we going to fork out the bad actors MKR and the MKR of the holders who delegated their vote to them? I think we should.   I agree to an extent. I don\u2019t think we should fork out the entirety of the delegating party\u2019s MKR (Though the voter should lose all of theirs). Slashing say 10% would probably get the point across. If there is too big a penalty then people just won\u2019t delegate at all, if I was going to delegate at the risk of losing the entire stack, I would only delegate to someone I knew and trusted in an offline setting. Is there anyone you know online to whom you would trust your MKR?     kwadrax:  My opinion is that if you can\u2019t make an informed decision on the state of the system, you also can\u2019t know who you should delegate your vote to.   I disagree, I don\u2019t see these two things as linked. I know to trust the conclusion of a mature journal article written by a leader in a scientific field that has been cited by a few hundred other papers without needing to fully understand the science in the middle. When you delegate you are trusting the entity to whom you are delegating, and it is usually easier to determine whom you should trust over making your own mind up. I\u2019m not saying that making your mind up isn\u2019t better, but it\u2019s also much more expensive in terms of time. My hope is that any delegation system will enforce a 1:1 equivalence between the MKR held by the voting party, and the total MKR being delegated to that party. In this manner, the incentives are appropriately aligned. But this does limit who can be delegated to based on their total MKR, which is the trade-off.      ginworkflow:  However if the risk you describe becomes to big at some point one could maybe consider reducing the weight of delegated votes so e.g. 1 MKR delegated vote only counts as 0.1 MKR or something similar.   Interesting thought, I hadn\u2019t considered that before. Thanks.      rich.brown:  Governance engagement was dead in Reddit long before we moved to discourse.   I think \u2018dead\u2019 might be a little strong, but I agree there wasn\u2019t a lot of engagement, I\u2019ll add this to OP.     rich.brown:  I can confirm this is that case from talking to institutional investors, but I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate for me to name names so people will have to decide for themselves if this is anecdotal or not    To clarify @rich.brown, do you mean they are not interested in voting (looking for a passive investment) or looking for custodial solutions? Based on previous conversations I\u2019ll assume the later unless corrected, and add this to the OP.     rich.brown:  I will never stop asking this: If anyone knows of any research that proposes a voting incentive mechanism that is not gameable for profit, PLEASE let me know.   I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s room for improvement over the current system, I need to dedicate a solid block of time to think about it though, I\u2019ll make a post at some point.     rich.brown:  We\u2019ve been discussing metatransactions ala Gas Station Network internally. If the fees, and not the risk of moving large sums of MKR around, that is the friction, we can solve that.   I\u2019ll add this to the OP.     rich.brown:  Having watched every second of the governance process since inception there is no doubt in my mind that the primary reason is simply that it\u2019s not fun anymore .   Definitely a contributing factor, the novelty of it does wear off after a little while. That said, I still find this sort of thing fun. Where else can you help shape the future of enterprise and human interaction?     rich.brown:  No one wants to tweak the same number every single week.   I do!      tbone:  Find it hard to believe that tx fees are a reason for voter apathy.   Agree, it\u2019s just not that expensive, I suspect it\u2019s used more as a proxy of \u2018it\u2019s not worth the time and effort to vote in an informed way\u2019 rather than a genuine issue of iteself.

                    "content": "Just reviewed this thread and it really seems to me that almost every reason can be summed up in this short list: 1. I don\u2019t understand how to vote (technical) This is easily solvable with some good demo videos, which we are working on. All MKR holders are smart enough to figure this out. 2. My vote does not matter (practical) It makes sense that a minnow can get frustrated when whales are clearly deciding most of these votes. Providing a DAO solution i.e. Aragon that allows people to \u201cunionize\u201d could help with this. However we should be careful that the Aragon solution is specifically designed to only attack this problem, and not problem 3 (emotional). 3. I don\u2019t have enough info to feel good about my vote (emotional) This is the hardest obstacle to overcome. We first need to acknowledge that people will only vote if it makes them feel good. It is currently very hard for a \u201ccasual\u201d MKR holder to gather enough info to make an educated vote that they can feel good about. People simply won\u2019t vote if they don\u2019t feel passionate & confident about their choice. A \u201cset it and forget it\u201d Aragon solution to try to solve this problem would be self-defeating. We need to find a way to provide every holder with digestible, informative & maybe even entertaining information on a regular basis that can help them make their decisions. These videos I just made for Compound\u2019s Community Vote are a good example of how we may be able to do this. https://youtu.be/wX6tUpDJpaA It will also be equally important that we present voting options that make sense to casual holders. Presenting a poll with 10 different voting options can be extremely counterproductive to an audience that is already feeling overwhelmed and uninformed. ",

One change I\u2019ve made is to change technical to procedural, as I think that word better captures all obstacles related to the act of voting or discussion that can cause an otherwise motivated person to not cast a vote. This leaves the other two categories to focus on practical and emotional motivation problems. I\u2019ve edited the OP to divide them in this way.  Welcome to the forum!     ginworkflow:  The automatic adjustment could then be supplemented with \u201cmanual\u201d adjustments whenever needed.   We\u2019ve talked about this before, in general the consensus seems to be that it\u2019s too easy to abuse if the rates are algorithmic. There was discussion of having an automated system that could \u2018suggest\u2019 rates on a weekly basis which could be confirmed or ignored, but I believe development on this has stalled.     ginworkflow:  Personally I would probably put the majority of my MKR into uniswap (assuming it is secure enough and the return is high enough) and only vote with a small portion of my MKR.   Uniswap returns can be seen here: https://zumzoom.github.io/analytics/uniswap/roi.html, make sure to select MKR from the drop down. Why would you keep a small portion for voting versus the majority in uniswap or compound?     Ironrand:  That may be true in certain fields of study. But this is economics / politics not math or hard science. So I must agree with kwadrax\u2019s assertion that delegation requires understanding.   I feel like you may have missed my point here, that example was meant as a specific instance of a general truth, namely that: It\u2019s generally easier to figure out whom to trust for an answer than it is to figure out or verify an answer for yourself.

There is no good introduction on how to vote / MKR Holders don\u2019t know how to vote - *A series of video tutorials that explain the voting process in more detail about help mitigate this.

I hope that there will be something that convinces me that it\u2019s safe to participate, but I don\u2019t know what that will be. I\u2019m waiting for some sign of legitimacy / recognition. Coinbase adding MKR is a good step in the right direction. That\u2019s my primary reason anyway, my secondary reasons are all related to not having time to be responsible about doing due diligence on votes and/or auditing the smart contract upgrades. Assuming that I did vote some time in future:  Voting incentives wouldn\u2019t make any difference to me, it\u2019s my external responsibilities that keep me from allocating time to voting. Having curated easy to read list of arguments for/against each vote makes a big difference to me. I would prefer not to delegate my vote, but instead look for consensus among all the known parties that I trust (\u201cdelegated consensus voting\u201d perhaps , or perhaps just removing my vote from a previous vote and adding it to consensus on the next one to help it progress )  ",

Usually I do not vote, because I value my time more than adding some votes to a decision I already agree with. Exceptions are occasions such as the recent peg deviation or emergencies.

Inherently this becomes a cost vs. opportunity issue imo which is not going to get better with increasing tx costs.   Literally cost to vote relative to MKR held is a real issue for people especially as polls now are like 5x a few months ago with no real sign of decreasing and tx costs are up 20-50x leading to a 100-250x cost to vote over a few months ago.   Over time this adds up. There is also a hassle factor involved.    I am completely mixed on ability to accept and use Uniswap MKR pairs to vote but I think it might help. Now if one coupled the idea of associating wallet addresses with voting MKR I think it would be interesting to use SourceCred for paying out to people who actually vote.   The idea of refunding voting/polling tx fees is probably one that would also help.  (i.e. when voting fees for some wallet accumulate to more than what 500x typical tx fees are pay back the accumulated voting tx fees to the wallet).    This could even be random and as accumulated tx fees are not paid back there actually is an incentive to vote to get back the accumulated tx fees.  Only after this is done might there be a dis-incentive to vote. Tough call here.   Regarding voting it really would be nice to see breakdowns not just on total MKR voted but also the breakdown of winning votes by \u2018number of wallets\u2019.    I really don\u2019t have a good feeling whether 1 or 2 MKR whales are voting over the 10-60 MKR minnows or not. ",

I thought I would outline my voting decision calculus, some issues with the system I see, and some small things I could try to help. Please let me know if things in this are incorrect, or if you have opinions on what I could do to contribute. Why I vote:   I like MakerDAO and want to support it. The best way to do so for me is to increase the number of votes cast, even if the result is a foregone conclusion. More votes is a simplistic measure of legitimacy, and the benefits purported by taking polls of incentivized voters don\u2019t show up unless many people vote.   I own MKR, which will gain in value if I contribute to the good governance of the MakerDAO system.   The second reason is the one that will sustain the community\u2019s governance going forward, but has several flaws for me, which luckily, smarter people than me are currently working on:   Votes are not directly linked to better governance because outcomes are already determined by large voters   Votes are not directly linked to better governance because it is hard for me as a voter to understand some of the votes, therefor my vote might be hurting the community, and in the long run, hurting my MKR value.   The possible benefits of me voting are small, and can be outweighed by the fees associated with voting and time it takes to research the votes.   I forget   Humans are bad long term thinkers and bad at considering indirect benefits. Voting now to help set up a system that may not reward my investment until later is already a challenge. Then factor in the fact that I am not sure my votes are helping or are even properly informed.   I have a couple thoughts on what I can do to address these issues myself, as a true governance-only member of this community (by that I mean I am not crazy technical, and do not work in this industry). Please tell me if these are reasonable, or if they are a waste of time.   Make a Reddit post a week asking a dumb question. I think this forum is great, but Reddit is where a lot of people not on this forum are. I also think this would help address issue #2 for myself and others. Additionally, if it increases participation, it could help with issue #1.  I have I have a lot of dumb questions that I am afraid to ask. I assume others are the same way. Examples include: Who is doing the voting each week? Why doesn\u2019t MKR pay a dividend that gets larger with time held when the system is gaining in use and fees? What does SourceCred reward? What stops someone from staking ETH to validate, and also using it as collateral in a CDP (I\u2019m assuming its just code, or the fact that you ETH is committed somewhere)?   Publishing my votes, possibly also to Reddit or here. This one I don\u2019t know the safety concerns of. I believe it would be helpful to see votes and why they went each way. Rather than explain issues, I like seeing people defend their sides of issues. Also I think it would just help keep me accountable to vote. I think this could help issues 1, 2, 4, and 5.   ",

I don\u2019t know how difficult it would be to do this but maybe it would even be possible to do ranked choice delegation? A voter could lock up their mkr in a contract with a ranked list of delegations, then those preferences are used on all future votes unless the voter alters their preferences. This would avoid issues we see where political parties are forced into a 2 party system which could happen with single preference delegating even if the actual votes are ranked choice. At the moment our governance is probably not sufficiently complex that they\u2019re would be many \u201cparties\u201d but I\u2019m just brainstorming here. ",

Totally agree, we are currently working on a new version of the Governance Portal to bundle polling transactions into a single tx. I will be happy to share the mockups once we have created the user flows.   So glad to hear on this thank you @Derek I can\u2019t wait to see the mock ups. I know vote delegation has been on the minds of the foundation folks. @rune I think talked about it a lot but I might be thinking of someone else. I looked up here previous threads with \u201cVote delegat\u201d and came up with:     Vote delegation is not something we should be striving for Governance       Very much agreed. I guess my expectation is that most of these problems are solved at the base level by having actual MKR holders collectively careful about who they proxy their vote to, who they lend to, etc\u2026 so any separation of concerns is originated by someone who has a stake in not giving power to a bad actor. That may be a naive take that gets thoroughly falsified in the future though!   I see, but that doesn\u2019t help with a bad actor borrowing MKR? What I mean is that the initial concern i\u2026     and     Is our goal more individual voters, or more MKR locked? Governance       I\u2019m working on video content designed to encourage people to vote on Maker issues. I realized that I\u2019m a little foggy on how we\u2019re gauging success here.  I was just reviewing the balances of the top MKR holders on Etherscan. The top 50 MKR holders control well over 50% of the total voting power.  If we simply got these 50 wallets to vote and achieved 50%+ MKR on every vote, would that mean \u201csuccess\u201d?  Or is our immediate goal to get more unique wallets (a.k.a. minnows) voting, which would mean t\u2026     So we have been down some of these roads before. When I think about community engagement I don\u2019t just think about MKR but also about Vaults and DAI holders.   I had this idea about doing surveys.  Businesses do this.  Sometimes they will do it for free otherwise they wlll offer a coupon or some other kind of reward that makes sense for the part of their client base they are trying to incentivize for something.   DIgesting the sourceCRED stuff     Maker SourceCred Trial Governance       Intro As some of you may be aware, myself and @rich.brown have been working with SourceCred to deliver a trial implementation of the SourceCred algorithm on the Maker forum. We hope that this will encourage high-quality participation and increased governance bandwidth.  The details of this trial and the timeline moving forward can be found below. But briefly, the way this works is that weekly cred scores will be computed based on recent and historical participation on this forum, including posts\u2026     I think we can do some really interesting stuff with audience engagement in connection with wallet signatures and on-chain tx\u2019s rolled up in terms of providing rewards for various kinds of engagement that the community can manage to minimize gaming and maximize engagement return. What we really don\u2019t have is a way to take and connect the on-chain actions into a kind of sourceCRED system but that literally is what we are talking about I think. I am back to questions I know I asked in the older threads that we did poll on somewhat.  What is the goal? How to measure achievement of that goal?  I am hopeful after this sourceCRED trial we get an interesting perspective of how to redo community engagement using some new tools and on-chain recording.   Changing the mechanics of what we do on chain so we can roll up lots of actions into a single on-chain tx would be way cool.   Using these techniques and UIs to engage MKR holders that say have MKR in the governance contract vs. MKR in the wild and vault owners that actually borrow and hold DAI debt vs. ones that just deposit and DAI holders who either have cDAI (some other version of DAI) vs. DAI proper or CHAI etc. I think would be a very interesting way to gather feed back and engage the entire community in ways that would be very valuable. I have not even mentioned an idea I had until now about engaging vault owners wiped out after this whole compensation thing is done to ask them if they would come back to Maker, are they totally turned off.  Or better questions of vault or DAI holders.  Are they more or less likely to use Maker now that centralized coins are being added as collateral against DAI, etc. I am excited in many ways by what we are doing and building, but daunted because the task seems so large.   I have large plans but want to take the best measured and achievable steps towards achieving them. So I have a 3rd question here.  What is the low hanging fruit we need to clear that we can grab easily?  I think making a more efficient, cheaper, easier to use polling or surveying system is probably good low hanging fruit we can pick. Maybe keep improving polling/surveying analytics, analysis.  Maybe not low hanging fruit because it will be a moving target.  Already we broke some of our analytics with changes to ranked choice voting (which I am all for).   But it means we need to provide means to keep up on this stuff.  Is this low hanging fruit? I\u2019d like to engage more of the community in terms of people but feel like we are stuck with wallets.  I also don\u2019t really know what I want in terms of a success measure for community engagement.  This really doesn\u2019t feel like low hanging fruit, but it feels like something we want to grab when we can. I have more generally on this topic but this post is already too long\u2026 ",
