                    "content": "Good day. I am wondering of anyone can help me. I sent DAI from Ascendex on the DAI chain to Binance without realising that it doesnt support the DAI chain. It was send to an ERC20 network. I have the transaction ID and I can see that the transaction was confirmed on the DAI chain, but now Binance is saying they cannot retrieve it for me. Happy to pay a small fee to retrieve this cash that I really need. Is there anyone at DAI chain who can send it back to the original Ascendex address please. Look forward to some positive news as it has been 5 stress filled days being sent back and forth between the exchanges. Kind regards and thank you in advance ",

I thought it would go to ERC20 network as to be honest i never knew there was a DAI chain. I\u2019m not that clued up on crypto yet. Learning fast through hard knocks. So it was sent from Ascendex on the DAI Chain will attach a photo to a BINANCE wallet with the ERC20 selected as the network.  2DFFE0E2-CC07-43BC-95BC-BC21BFEB6977828\u00d71792 134 KB  ",
