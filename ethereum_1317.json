Put briefly, I have introduced a new EVM instruction that permit introspection to be applied to the original transaction data by being able to access the original data payload as well as the original recipient of the transaction, the to address. This would primarily allow more complex types of \u201cbasic\u201d contracts to be created, such as ERC-20 tokens that are aware of exactly what type of action (i.e. \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d) is performed on a DEX like Uniswap. To properly function, it relies on EIP-3508 which still in a Draft phase.
