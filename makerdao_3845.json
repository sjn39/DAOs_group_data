                    "content": "The Gelato Network has submitted their MIP6 application for the G-UNI token. I would like to make an argument for fast-tracking this collateral to replace a good chunk of the PSM-USDC exposure. First, I\u2019ll explain how G-UNI works and its relation to Maker. G-UNI is an ERC20 tokenization of a Uniswap V3 position. It works for arbitrary pairs with arbitrary ranges, but for the purposes of Maker we are going to focus on a fixed range for the USDC-DAI pair. There are many projects building ERC20 tokenizations of Uniswap V3 positions, but G-UNI is the most straight-forward implementation I have found so far. G-UNI does not have farming rewards of random tokens, admin upgradability (it technically does, but they will turn this off) or large/complex code. It makes our job much easier for doing the analysis to protect vault user\u2019s funds. G-UNI takes the standard approach of having an operator (Gelato Network nodes) re-invest the profit back into the pool. Node operators get 1% of the profit re-invested, so they are incentivized to do a good job. Node operators do not have access to funds beyond a portion of the immediate profit. Since re-investment will occur fairly frequently the amount of funds at risk from a malicious node operator at any given time is minimal. My idea is to provide a standard vault with very high leverage on this DAI-USDC G-UNI pair at a fixed spread of 0.9994 - 1.0014. This range should cover most of the trades where the peg is breaking high. The specific numbers are a feature of Uniswap in that the price ranges are bucketed to certain numbers. This is actually to our advantage as the only prices available are 0.9994, 1.0004 and 1.0014 which means actively managed positions can\u2019t really outcompete us by much.  Screen Shot 2021-06-29 at 10.58.21 AM1224\u00d7589 51.8 KB  Looking at recent Uniswap numbers, APRs on this pool are around 4% based on the 140M TVL. If we offer 100x leverage (101% CR) then this APR raises to 400% which should attract a lot more capital. This should be enough to attract a couple billion TVL into the pool (depending on the SF) which will indirectly unwind the PSM as minted DAI is sold for USDC. Furthermore with such a massive amount of liquidity, the Uniswap pool will become a great place to do trades between USDC and DAI of virtually any size. This will help to increase fees and attract even more capital.  Why not use the PSM USDC directly in the pool? I see two advantages of not just using the USDC in the PSM:   Complexity. The fee re-investment in Uniswap V3 is not trivial. It requires front-run protection mechanisms to ensure that rebalancing the two tokens doesn\u2019t result in excessive loss of fees. So far the common strategy I\u2019ve seen is to have a trusted operator take care of this. Building this internally at Maker will take a lot of time. By using a third party solution with external token we can minimize the amount of work required on our end.   Blacklist risk. It\u2019s not clear how much of a concern this is, but at the very least it is causing hesitation with some folks in the crypto space. By adding the G-UNI token as just another vault we no longer have USDC on our books. USDC does not touch any of the Maker smart contracts, so Circle would not be able to blacklist the Maker protocol directly. They could still blacklist the G-UNI token, but that becomes more like blacklisting a Uniswap pool which seems like a very bad PR move as there is collateral damage. As of right now the PSM USDC is entirely owned by the protocol - this change would make the vault users owners of the USDC again.    Pros  Unwind the PSM Start earning fees on the USDC that would otherwise be sitting in the PSM Blacklist risk mitigation Uniswap USDC-DAI swaps can take very large trades Minimal work to onboard (Standard GemJoin and Oracles are straight forward)   Cons  High leverage is much more risky to the protocol Giving up some fees to users in exchange for blacklist mitigation Takes some time that is otherwise used for other more productive collateral   Vote    Do we want to prioritize adding high-leverage G-UNI for the USDC-DAI pair?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will run until Thursday July 8th, 2021. If accepted (and the MIP6 vote is greenlit) then the relevant Core Units will begin work onboarding G-UNI as a high priority item. ",

What is different with G-UNI when the peg breaks?     hexonaut:  APRs on this pool are around 4% based on the 140M TVL\u2026 This should be enough to attract a couple billion TVL into the pool   If the pool gets this large, doesn\u2019t the APR go way lower making the SF of 1% unsustainable? And lastly, I\u2019ve had this question even about the v2 USDC-DAI LP tokens so I may as well ask here. Doesn\u2019t leveraged use of these vaults effectively make DAI unbacked? If someone did utilize the 100x leverage on these vaults and DAI\u2019s value crashed, the LP token collateral would lose value at the same time. How does it make sense under an emergency shutdown?

Perhaps I should think about this more too but these do not seem to be the same thing to me. DAI vaults are not a problem as you correctly explained but USDC-DAI LP token vaults are (even without leverage). For instance, I put in an LP token worth (1USDC + 1DAI) as collateral and mint 2DAI with it. If DAI goes below peg, the collateral transforms from (1USDC + 1DAI) to 2DAI. If we now perform an emergency shutdown, the 2DAI in the vault is worth less than 2USD (because DAI is below peg) but it backs 2DAI. In the extreme case where DAI value goes to zero due to external factors, the vault collateral also goes to zero simultaneously leaving DAI completely unbacked. Leveraged use of such vaults makes this problem even worse. Now that I think about it, maybe all xxx-DAI LP tokens used as collateral have the same issue? ",

One thing to keep in mind is that we are at at a low point in terms of volume, so if/when things pick up again we are ready to snatch a good chunk of those fees.

The nice thing about smart contracts is you don\u2019t necessarily have to trust anyone. We can read the code ourselves and evaluate the risk. This type of token is one of the safest implementations possible apart from something like WETH or LINK. A lot of others such as WBTC, USDC, etc have admin access controls which makes us less certain about the guarantees we have. An immutable smart contract with no admin access is ideal for us which is what G-UNI is (in the version we have requested).     MakerMan:  Implications for the protocol if the markets for some reason go out of this band one way or another.?! (i.e. the two basic edge cases).   If the price goes above 1.0014 then there is an arbitrage opportunity with the PSM, so it won\u2019t stay there.

Exactly how are the oracles to be structured and where is the penalty via fees?   As with other instances of DAI/USDC the oracles can just be set to $1.

Why buy DAI at 1.001 USDC when one can just borrow some DAI using some other collateral and lever up with USDC using the vault?   When leveraging this position you are doing the opposite. You flash loan 100x your deposit in DAI (maybe with the new flash mint module), you take roughly half of that and sell it for USDC on the market (as it is probably a better rate than the PSM), you then mint a bunch of G-UNI with your DAI and USDC, open a vault and put the G-UNI in, mint as much DAI as possible and use that DAI along with your initial investment to repay the flash loan.     MakerMan:  You suggest this will unwind the PSM but not replace it. Can you explain how this works to unwind the PSM and what then will replace the PSM?

So you\u2019re right that it technically doesn\u2019t give us any more protection from a smart contracts perspective. I would argue that it does give us some cover though. Currently the Maker protocol owns all of the USDC in the PSM which makes MKR holders the sole owner of this USDC in a way. If a regulatory agency wanted to come after us and not collapse DeFi this seems like a good route to me. By instead distributing the ownership of the USDC to a bunch of users it would seem to me that this becomes a lot more tricky legally. Granted this is mostly conjecture and there is some degree of irrationality when it comes to blacklist fear of USDC. We do know it\u2019s a PR problem for us having this much USDC on the books. Whether that bad PR is coming from centralization risks, blacklist risk or just that a stablecoin shouldn\u2019t be mostly backed by another stablecoin to be a \u201cgood stablecoin\u201d it\u2019s hard to say. I think we will get some positive benefit by moving a chunk of the USDC off the books even if that benefit is just in the minds of crypto folks.     lollike:  Also, I\u2019m not sure PR considerations vs risk of blacklisting make much sense.

Yes PR damage was not a good reason as you are right Circle likely doesn\u2019t want to do any of this. It would be more likely a legal thing, and as I explained above removing us as owners of the USDC will likely help shield us legally. ",

I tend to find analyzing the cases where this doesn\u2019t work to lead to more fruitful solutions that are more robust to market forces.

I keep seeing this - honestly have to wonder why we are giving a free pass to these when we can just enable liquidations out of the gate.  If there are fees we would want to do this anyway which would mean people could not lever up the full amount because they need a SF fee buffer, and the protocol needs a liquidation buffer.  If we are going to play the fixed oracle and liquidations off on vaults for the protocol.

First step isn\u2019t going to happen.  I have already been there and these markets are for the most part using the PSM to conduct the trades at least the ones I have been doing.  But I would be happy to see ANY real stats or analysis of DAI-USDC or USDC-DAI trades that lay out where the trades are doing.  example I used 1inch a few times and it routed through the PSM so are those accountable for as 1inch or as PSM?  No clue and no data.   I am just pretty sure most of the time the best price on either side of that trade is the PSM.     hexonaut:  Selling lots of DAI for USDC will lower the price of DAI/USDC which will cause the PSM to unwind.   not if the majority of these trades end up going through the PSM.   I am honestly not sure if the return is say .05% someone is going to eat the fees to do this.   If using G-UNI requires the PSM then I don\u2019t see how it will reduce USDC exposure in the protocol.   Seems like it is going to increase this.  But I have not dedicated formal time to analysis on this.     hexonaut:  So you\u2019re right that it technically doesn\u2019t give us any more protection from a smart contracts perspective. I would argue that it does give us some cover though.   yeah but what does \u2018cover\u2019 mean really?   All it does is put a layer between Maker and USDC but puts users and G-UNI in the cross hairs.   The more I am looking at the issue of \u2018hard\u2019 currency in crypto the more I come back to DAI as a potential hard currency - but as soon as DAI becomes wrapped USDC DAI becomes only as hard as USDC - which basically is soft as shit when it comes to legislation and black listing events. I honestly keep coming back to whether we are going to build a financial economy that is borderless, permissionless, and decentralized/antifragile or whether we are just going to build a new economic engine that is permissioned, centralized, and bordered.   imo we are rapidly coming to a point here where Maker and DAI is going to have to make some hard decisions in this regard and I honestly am thinking a vault owner poll would be useful in this regard.     hexonaut:  Granted this is mostly conjecture and there is some degree of irrationality when it comes to blacklist fear of USDC. We do know it\u2019s a PR problem for us having this much USDC on the books.   I think with 60% of all DAI backed by USDC this isn\u2019t just a PR problem it is a real pragmatic issue and I do not think there is an element or irrationality here.   The people (including myself btw) who want to build a permissionless, borderless, and decentralized economy have very significant concerns that with the PSM and huge amount of USDC on the books we pretty much have given up on decentralization in favor of the PEG.     hexonaut:  Yes PR damage was not a good reason as you are right Circle likely doesn\u2019t want to do any of this. It would be more likely a legal thing, and as I explained above removing us as owners of the USDC will likely help shield us legally.   Exactly the point.   Circle may have no choice in the future and Maker as well as the whole DeFI ecosystem could be heavily damaged. If there was a poll from our vault owners, and DAI holders it could be based on the following: There appears to be a Maker Trilemma that can\u2019t easily be satisfied. comments cut here and link to thread regarding this below.     Maker Trilemma - PEG, Decentralization, DAI 1:1 collateral backing - USDC Discussion Proposal Ideas       I honestly can\u2019t find a good topic catagory (apologies @LongForWisdom )  I pulled this from the tail end of another post.   I believe the topic is even more important currently.  We can make it a formal poll but I am going to refrain unless people consider this an important discussion and we can frame a poll appropriately.  The issue that seems to be cropping up in different ways is the fact that USDC is now backing 60% of all DAI and this is leading various people to have significant concerns a\u2026     ",

While in an average instant, the Maker balance sheet from this PSM would contain a fraction in USDC and a fraction in Dai, in an actual tail event, it would contain only USDC as the price moves out of range. As such, Maker would retain the same effective USDC exposure. It may make sense from the perspective of deploying the capital in a potentially more efficient way, but it I think it\u2019s unclear whether it is more efficient. It in effect means that the spread between minting and redeeming through the PSM will be much narrower. It then comes down to the fees from volume that will be experienced in this setting vs. on the initial PSM spread. There are possibly benefits to increasing Dai\u2019s liquidity through something like this, but it should be compared against the alternative of just narrowing the current PSM spread directly. To be fair though, I\u2019m not sure which will come out on top here. ",

The major differences are, retail likes Uniswap so there are some extra revenues there, and the \u201cownership\u201d of the USDC. In the PSM the protocol owns the USDC, and it\u2019s very clear who to go after with the blacklist. With Uniswap tokens that are A) owned by users and B) used for many protocols there becomes a lot of collateral damage for blacklisting. It would be like Circle blacklisting Uniswap to take us down. It doesn\u2019t cover us completely, but I would argue it gives us some degree of legal cover. ",

One thing to keep in mind is that we are at at a low point in terms of volume, so if/when things pick up again we are ready to snatch a good chunk of those fees. Also, liquidity begats liquidity so having DAI/USDC on Uniswap with 1B+ in TVL may attract trades that are otherwise going to Curve/1inch atm.   What would you suggest setting the DC at once the smart contract work is complete? Given the low ROI I\u2019m apprehensive about scaling quickly especially with other USDC investment options on the table once we can solve the legal entity and KYC issue. ",

Yes this is not the most capital efficient setup, but there are many trade offs at play as I outlined above. Beyond blacklist risk mitigation we get ease of implementation. Smart contract dev resources are currently our main bottleneck, and the PSM does not generate much revenue inside or outside of Uniswap. Better to get some easy PR wins and devote resources to higher quality collateral than spend too much time messing around with the USDC. ",
