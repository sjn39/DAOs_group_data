                    "content": "I think that we have a serious problem with the possibility of losing the peg if we can\u2019t scale the magnitude of available collaterals soon enough. the Dai adoption has been growing in the last few months and it will likely to continue to grow and so should the Dai supply. since we are still working with Ether as the only available collateral. This means we have a limit to which we can grow the Dai supply securely. I mean we can\u2019t expect to have 20% or 30% of Ether supply locked in cpd (this will be very dangerous if we have a significant decrease in the Ether value) that\u2019s why I think that probably 5% is the maximum supply of Ether that can be safely used in cpd. 5% with current prices of Ether will allow us to generate 400m Dai, so this means that currently with SCD 400m Dai is the upper limit. If the adoption and usage of Dai would grow to more than 400m in the coming months (before implementing MCD), we would lose the peg and there is no think we can do except shutting down the system (Global settlement). Now it seems that there is a small possibility that the Dai supply will grow to more than 400 million in the coming months before MCD, so we will be ok in the next few months (probably). after implementing MCD we will have two problematic scenarios: the first problem that we can\u2019t scale soon enough: I mean ERC-20 tokens (which can be used easily with MCD) have a total market cap of 4% to 5% of Ethereum market cap\u2026 so it is almost nothing! Building a secured non-custodial bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin looks like a very difficult task to do\u2026 which can delay the usage of bitcoins as collateral for years! I can\u2019t imagine how the system will survive with only 400m Dai as a maximum limit for years especially with the growing usage of stable coins! The second problem is the immature usage of DSR: today we have about 4 billion dollars of centralized stable coins. even if we offer Dai with very low DSR for example 1% to 2% this could increase the adoption and demand for Dai largely and we will very easily hit the 400m ceiling. we could see fast shifting from the increasing 4 billion supply of centralized stable coins into Dai. so I think we have two options to prevent us from losing the peg due to slow scalability solution. first, -ve DSR : which I just don\u2019t like it although it could be better than shutting down the system. second, using a basket of centralized stable coins like Tether, Libra and Usdc\u2026 with stability fees of zero and only 100% collateral. this will provide us with a good scalable source of collaterals until we can solve the technical problems and build the infrastructure that will allow us to scale with Bitcoin, security tokens or other significant assets which can be used in the future I know that a basket of centralized stable coins is not an ideal solution but it is probably better than losing the peg and shutting down the system.

DAI currently is used mostly for leverage and Stability Fee must be kept crazy high to actually shrink the supply   There are already rising Tokens like WBTC I expect that if there will be need for it It will expand quite soon and that significantly increase possible max supply. I believe super proportionally since any liquidations harm foreign chain (Bitcoin) not a Home chain where MakerDAO sits (Ethereum) so we can go for more than 2-4% of total supply if needed.   DSR will not change much (unless it will be crazy high) since You already can get decent interest rates on holding DAI for example on compound   ",

To be clear, I would not recommend we use anything with any significant amount of centralization as collateral without careful assessment of risk and risk parameters.  Even if the asset looks strong and risk parameters are set reasonably, centralization makes that asset junk in the defi space.  I am only agreeing that we should evaluate these options if the future @mmoossttaaffaa is envisioning comes to pass, as it would be more desirable solution to scaling than global settlement. I could be convinced otherwise, if someone suggest an alternative that allows for growth without compromising on decentralization. @mmoossttaaffaa, again, great work on the forward thinking.  It had not occurred to me that we would have trouble scaling MCD with quality collateral as early as 400mm DAI, although we could probably stretch that to 800mm DIA in MCD by pulling in ERC20 tokens or creating ETH collateral with more conservative risk parameters. P.S. your fingers want to type CPD, transposing CDP.   I have a similar problem when I type DAI, as there is another acronym in my life that is DIA. ",

The extreme iteration of this would be shrinking collaterals while we exploit this mechanism to print DAI.  We also have no risk parameters or tunable knobs around this.

I think that minting Dai in exchange for locking MKR tokens should be designed carefully to be a mechanism to compensate for the lost DAI. so newly minted DAI should practically be collateralized by the lost DAI + the locked MKR (in case we overprinted DAI) I can imagine 3 possibilities for the lost Dai problem: 1- it will be very small to the point that its effect can be neglected 2- there would be a moderate effect in which we don\u2019t lose the peg but we have near 0% DSR and low fees that are barely cover primer risk fees and governance fees. 3- It would have a severe effect in which we lose the peg to more than 1$ even with 0% DSR and 0% SF in the 1st scenario we should just ignore the minor effect because we don\u2019t need more unnecessary complexity in the system. in the 3rd scenario, I think that minting new DAI with correct parameters would be fairly safe the 2nd scenario would be problematic! because of the lost DAI we could have artificially strong DAI which would prevent us from raising the DSR. yes, we are still keeping the peg but we are giving away a very potent tool, the DSR, which is one of the strongest tools to grow DAI adoption. so we have 2 options here losing DSR or experimenting with a possibly dangerous game!

Maybe. It depends how low the lowest SF is, we need some room to move the DSR.

If we forget about debt ceilings, I guess we will see the DSR permanently decrease ever closer to the lowest SF, until the amount of \u201cfree money\u201d isn\u2019t worth it anymore. And so any additional unit of riskier collateral would have a multiplier effect on the total amount of collateral in the system: by increasing the DSR it unlocks free money to be grabbed by anyone with safer assets (until DSR goes back down mechanically).
