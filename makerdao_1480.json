                    "content": "@collateral-core-unit , @Protocol-Engineering  and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit  CU\u2019s have made the decision to delay this week\u2019s executive due to extra time required for running tests, making code reviews, and coordinating the work required with RWF and LTS(incubating CU). The combination of the above has pushed us past our typical weekly deadline. The code review and feedback rounds by PE have required minor changes to be made in the code base implemented by CES and new tests to be run. Due to the code base changes, new smart contracts have been deployed which requires LTS to update a set of legal agreements that include smart contract addresses relating to the HVB deal specifically between the Ankura Trust, RWA foundation and Genesis trading. The community can track the spell code and executive vote contents as they evolve. Thanks to all CUs contributing. ",

Unfortunately these changes required an update to some of the legal agreements that had included the original addresses and which caused the delay to the spell.
