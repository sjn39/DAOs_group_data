Unfortunately MIP10 has inconsistencies and doesn\u2019t conform to the monthly governance cadence that the Maker Improvement Proposal framework is built around. This has generated a backlog of Oracle proposals. While MIP10 is refactored to conform to the regular MIP process, Oracle proposals such as this one will utilize the more liberal weekly governance cycle. While strictly speaking this makes them not subproposals, they are included in the subproposal archive as a point of provenance to serve as a paper trail.  Specification  Introduction The dYdX team plans to use the oracle in an ETH-USD Inverse Perpetual trading pair (GitHub - dydxprotocol/perpetual: Ethereum Smart Contracts and TypeScript library used for the dYdX Perpetual Contracts). They are currently using the BTC-USD oracle for a BTC-USD Vanilla Perpetual (dYdX) which has been live in production for months.  Oracle Name ETH/USD  Customer(s) dYdx - [email\u00a0protected]  Whitelist dYdX - 0x538038E526517680735568f9C5342c6E68bbDA12 - Medianizer  Requirements For each customer address to be whitelisted:   Is the contract source code verified on etherscan? Yes https://etherscan.io/address/0x538038E526517680735568f9C5342c6E68bbDA12#code   Is the Oracle data used in a permissioned manner that would prevent parasitic behavior? Yes, the only contract intended to use this data is the same type of contract already using the BTC-USD data, which prevents public read-access of the data. perpetual/P1Getters.sol at master \u00b7 dydxprotocol/perpetual \u00b7 GitHub   Is Oracle data written to storage? No   If Oracle data is stored, is it stored in a private variable? N/A   If Oracle data is stored, is the value accessible on-chain exclusively by the protocol? N/A    Fee In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees are waived for the first year and determined by MKR Governance after that.
