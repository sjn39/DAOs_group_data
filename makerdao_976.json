                    "content": " Summary  The stablecoin liquidity buffer (i.e. mainly stablecoin PSM) lost more than 1B DAI in the last month. The fall has many reasons, but the main theme is the unwinding of some yield farming. Those might have migrated to Stargate, launched on March 19th that achieved 2B TVL on March 24th and 4B TVL on April 4th. It doesn\u2019t have a DAI pool. Yield farming pools should be considered as non-sticky DAI holders. Currently, Fantom + Avalanche + Curve is 2.5B, far below the liquidity buffer (>5B DAI)   Last month liquidity buffer analysis The stablecoin liquidity buffer achieved an all time high on March, 18th 20222 with 6.2B DAI in stablecoins. It is now only 5.1B DAI, meaning a loss of 1.1B DAI within a month. This is far from putting any pressure on the peg, yet it makes sense to analyze it\u2026  858\u00d7352 12.3 KB  The following waterfall illustrates the reasons for the fall of the liquidity buffer.  1600\u00d7875 35.7 KB   Avalanche There is currently 768M DAI on the Avalanche Bridge which is 284M less than 1 month ago (March 20th). The biggest user of DAI seems to be Aave that is incentivized with AVAX token.  858\u00d7403 14.5 KB   Compound Compound has reduced significantly liquidity mining rewards executed on March 19th.  806\u00d7346 9.93 KB   Fantom There was a spike of presence of DAI on Fantom for yield farming but it is decreasing linearly.  804\u00d7347 13.7 KB   DEX/3pool A lot of DAI are sitting on Curve 3pool. This pool is not a great opportunity by itself but is pushed by metapools on it. As you can see on the capture from Convex, it is mainly FRAX, UST and MIM metapools that are the reason for the TVL of the 3pool. The 3pool itself is quite useless.  986\u00d7346 32.6 KB  The inclusion of a 4pool will most likely remove most of the DAI from Curve, therefore the loss of 110M DAI might just be a beginning.  803\u00d7349 8.95 KB   ETH Loans There was an increased demand for ETH loans, which, by construction, reduce the stablecoin liquidity buffer if those DAI are not held. Most of it comes from Nexo, which tends to sell them. The rest stayed quite stable.  Conclusion As we have seen, most of the decrease in DAI demand is due to yield farming. We can assume that a good chunk of it is due to Stargate not providing a DAI pool at launch. Yield farming users are not sticky. It is also quite unclear if those users are borrowing on Maker at all or just using DAI when it makes sense. This might be a shift from history where people borrowed on Maker to yield farm and payed back their loan when they stopped farming (which isn\u2019t making any liquidity issue). Going forward, we might label some DAI usages as yield farming and consider those at a liquidity risk. The risk currently would therefore be 2.5B DAI. Our current liquidity buffer is far above that (>5B). ",

                    "content": "Following, the last ALM liquidity update, here is another analysis of the evolution of liquidity. As you can see on the chart below, our liquidity reserves (stablecoins) have fallen from 6B to 4B in less than 3 months. This is still strong liquidity.  image770\u00d7487 7.81 KB   Crypto-backed loans On an unfortunate green effect (counter-cyclical), the decrease of crypto loans since mid-February is beneficial to the stablecoin liquidity. Indeed, most of the loan decrease is coming from Nexo which is not, as I know, involved in keeping the DAI borrowed for farming activities in DAI. 7-Farmer on the other side, is usually quite delta hedged and any decrease in borrowing should be reflected as well as a decrease in DAI demand.   Bridges The main driver of lost DAI demand is the bridges. Outflows are from Avalance, Fantom and, in a lower scale, Polygon. This isn\u2019t compensated by growing chains like Near.  Beside the Stargate situation already discussed last time, rewards on Avalanche Aave v3 are not in favor of DAI presence.  image707\u00d7264 21.1 KB  We still have around 1B of DAI on bridges that could be at risk, of which 410M on Avalanche and 250M on Fantom.  image1054\u00d7509 48.6 KB   Curve situation All of the fall in Dex DAI usage is due to Curve. While we started with almost 2B DAI there at the start of 2022, only 826M remains. Half of the fall is directly attribuable to the UST issues of the last weekend. People seem to have exited UST to USDC and DAI (which were overweight in the pool around 40%), while the forces trying to keep UST peg were providing USDT mainly (which is now clearly overweight).  image1057\u00d7480 21.4 KB  As the 3pool remains large and the situation is most likely not related to DAI (or USDC), a rebalancing of the 3pool would increase our liquidity buffer. The huge amplification factor of the 3pool doesn\u2019t incentivize much this rebalancing. Nevertheless, we need to be aware of the imminent arrival of the 4pool which exclude DAI. 823M DAI are still at risk.  Secondary lending We\u2019ve lost around 500M on Compound and 250M on Aave.  Conclusion As we have seen, DAI continue to lose demand. The main reason is the lack of third party incentivization of DAI. Opportunistic DAI holding is therefore falling. Yet, we can take confidence n the fact that organic DAI demand (defined here as holdings in a EOA wallet according to Dune), remain very stable (growing from 3.2B to 3.4B).  image723\u00d7353 20 KB  ",
