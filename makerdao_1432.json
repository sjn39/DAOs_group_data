                    "content": "  tl;dr delegate contracts are nearing expiry, which requires action from delegates and their delegators. This post explains why, and how to respond. Your MKR tokens are never at risk of being \u2018stuck\u2019, however you are encouraged to migrate if applicable.   Context MakerDAO\u2019s vote delegation system is based on VoteDelegate smart contracts, which can be generated by anyone and expire annually by design. Read more about vote delegation contracts and the concept of expiration here. Expired delegate contracts are no longer able to participate in Maker governance, so those delegates and their delegators will need to migrate. Note that delegators will always be able to withdraw their delegated MKR from delegate contracts\u2014even after expiry!  Migration: Governance Portal Feature DUX Core Unit has developed a feature for the Governance Portal which informs users when they need to take action, and then facilitates the migration process for both delegates and delegators. Successfully migrating a delegate contract establishes a link between the old and new owner address, upon which certain metadata is aggregated in the Governance Portal UI (more specifically: The delegate profile markdown, performance metrics, voting history, and commenting history). This results in smoother UX both for delegates and their delegators. The linked addresses can be found in a file on the Governance Portal GitHub repo, accessible (and therefore verifiable) by anyone. We will also ask Recognized Delegates who successfully completed their migration to confirm their new delegate contract address in this thread. Migration is not supported for Shadow Delegates and never will be\u2014upon expiry they can simply create a new Shadow Delegate contract through the Governance Portal UI using a different owner address.  Migration: Steps for Delegates @Recognized-Delegates will start seeing a banner on the Governance Portal if their delegate contract is nearing expiry. Through the UI, recognized delegates are guided through the following steps:  Prepare a different owner address for the new delegate contract (note: the new owner address cannot already own a delegate contract). Whilst connected with the current delegate contract owner address, submit the new address in the migration flow and wait for confirmation by DUX CU. Switch to connecting the new address to the Governance Portal to resume the migration process. Generate a new delegate contract. Migrate any of their own delegated MKR, and encourage their delegators to migrate.   Migration: Steps for Delegators When delegating MKR to an expired delegate contract OR when delegating MKR to a contract which has been renewed, a delegator will start seeing a banner on the Governance Portal prompting them to migrate their delegated MKR. On their Migration page (seen below) they\u2019ll find all the expiring delegate contracts they delegated to, and the renewed ones. They can then easily undelegate and delegate between those.  Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 16.35.59979\u00d7727 204 KB   Closing words In consultation between DUX, GovAlpha and PE the conclusion was drawn that the design of VoteDelegate smart contracts can be improved in various ways, and the intention was set to work on those improvements to the VoteDelegateFactory contract at a later point in time. For now\u2026   \u2026to keep the protocol safe and free of stale MKR sitting in its governance contracts! ",

The Migration Process Unfortunately I did not think about doing screenshots when I was doing the supervised beta-test I did with DUX, but more or less they were just letting me do my stuff without any guidance (good way to check out if the UX works as intended).

I think we should move to a model where the expiry doesn\u2019t cause all voting power to disappear, but only cut it in half. We could also use some more elaborate model of decay over time or similar. Random, sticky votes that never leave a delegate cause their own problems, but IMO should still have some permanent voting power in all cases, and I would say 50% is a good ballpark. This would be a good discussion to have now that we are seeing the undelegations come up, and have to deal with the consequences (my guess is that a lot of votes will unfortunately not be redelegated) ",

Curious to hear more, as we could then take it into account when revising the VoteDelegate contract design later.   For context, I\u2019m thinking about a post-voter incentivization world. Without voter incentives I think it should be even higher, maybe only drop to 75% since everyone who votes now does it for some sort of reason. Basically you can\u2019t know for sure if a given permanent vote is a random, sticky vote (someone who just delegated randomly to get the voting rewards), or is simply someone who supports a delegate and remains satisfied with their performance, but would actually move the vote if the delegate starts voting in a way that is damaging. So on average you would lose some information by completely discounting permanent votes, and by reducing their voting power but still keeping some of it online you still capture some of this information, but reduce the likelihood that it can cause an attack on the protocol or abuse of its processes because the honest voting power will have such a significant advantage.
