In my previous article, A Vision of a System Registry for The World Computer, I talked about the vision behind dType, a Decentralized Type\u2026 Reading time: 6 min read        Aside from the type libraries and storage contracts, developers can create  contracts or libraries with pure functions , that know how to interact with the chosen types. We are separating business logic from the state. And this is the first step to a general functional programming system on Ethereum. If you register these pure functions in the  dType Registry  and tell the Registry what type of inputs and outputs the function has, you can start doing some awesome things. You can have automation in the system.  And the implications are big considering possible future inter-op with the proposed Libra network, and finding commonality with Libra\u2019s smart contracts (known as \u201cMove Modules\u201d).
