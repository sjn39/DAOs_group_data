                    "content": "As I said in the other post: Now I just wanted to say my two cents: The cutoff date is more than fair because if it was announced say 1 day before it was going to take the snapshot, only a group a people (could be a couple hundred, thousand, million idk) that understand crypto would abuse the hell out of the snapshot since there is no limits to the amount of accounts you create or the amount of private keys people can generate. Keeping it random like this implies that no one else had a much better chance than you (now I know the devs could have told people, but I\u2019m thinking of this in general with billions of people rather than just a couple of individuals). In the banking world, those with insider trading would be able to do way more (continue to buy until the date to sell) but here, they are limited to 400 UNI each. I believe this is fair due to the fact that there has been so much time to use this protocol and, to be honest, this has way more risk like every other dex there is. If you had barely come to Uniswap, I can infer maybe 2 things. 1) you are new and that you barely stumbled upon Uniswap but still needed to research and understand what it is (DYOR). or 2) you have been here for awhile and have used other services until you stumbled upon Uniswap and either skipped it or barely missed the time. If you missed the time, I feel sorry for you since yes you were the closest to getting the UNI but missed it. But couldn\u2019t you say the same about people who didn\u2019t purchase or missed the bottom. Asking to extend the date of the snapshot is like asking any asset to go back to their bottom so you can buy in. I, personally, have been using crypto for less than a year and found uniswap in the spring-summer. As a new user, I saw the risk of putting my funds into something that I might not get anything back but still took it anyways. That is why my wallet received 400 UNI. And I didn\u2019t expect anything from using this protocol and no one really should in crypto since this is where you are responsible for all you do here with no safety net. You may disagree with me but that is fine but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s suppose to be fair, could you offer a better way it could be fair without any abuse. Until then this is what I think about this. ",

                    "content": "It is definitely not fair to Uniswap users who sold their UNI at $1-5 because of uncertainty in the price, or for those who are buying at the current prices, for suddenly others getting free UNI which they can proceed to dump on loyal Uniswap holders at $8-10 dollars when they receive it, which I see very possible. As a Uniswap holder I feel less incentivized to keep my UNI or purchase more knowing that people will be receiving UNI at the prices we\u2019ve helped maintain and will most likely plummet the price. I\u2019m not really supportive of anymore Airdrops at all. People will keep coming up saying that for some reason it\u2019s not fair they didn\u2019t get free tokens. It will be very hard to keep everyone happy. If you want to get UNI, you would need to support the ecosystem in some way, like buying and holding your tokens, participating in governance and LP. I feel that would be the most fair approach. ",

                    "content": "@kbridge I agree that it is very hard to keep everyone happy and it will never be perfect. However, the point of the UNI token (in my eyes) is just for governance, not price appreciation for the long term. If you are a loyal Uniswap holder then you would care more about the community and improvement of the protocol, not trying to get massive gains. The massive gains is a secondary measure and is dependent on the direction of where this community goes. It is basically how the Yearn.Finance token exploded in value (besides scarcity) along with the protocol\u2019s use function, it became valuable because it allows the community to dictate the next step forward. I don\u2019t believe buying and holding your tokens is a good way to go especially since this token will be inflationary in 4 years. Besides, we all agree that some LPs will be rewarded in UNI and it is not hard to imagine that they will dump as well every time they get paid, they are essentially getting their UNI for free since I assume they also get the LP fee. Also if it was just through buying then only people who know about when the sale starts and those with huge bank accounts will take extreme advantage. The way Uniswap did seems to be the best decentralized way they could think of for those that actually used and supported the protocol. ",
