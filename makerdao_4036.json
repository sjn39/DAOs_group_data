I don\u2019t think we will see MakerDAO running on other chains, simply the security, liquidity and trust of the projects is on Ethereum.

Having half our reserves in a centralized stable coin is against our main goal and a massive attack vector. I am not even a purist who would say we should have no centralized stable coins in our reserve. I think the most basic requirement we should have is the ability to comfortably withstand all centralized stable coins in our reserve being frozen without a complete breakdown of the protocol 10% vs 50% would be reasonable.

But the reduced stability fees is precisely to stop the USDC in the PSM from growing further and it may even result in a reduction, if DAI drops below $1. Lower stability fee = more incentive to open vaults = more DAI supply = lower DAI price. I don\u2019t think moving to another chain helps solve this problem. If anything, it results in a higher demand for DAI, which would only put more USDC into the PSM. ",

Aave is doing a much better job at attracting users, for example the integration with Polygon proved to be a good move. You can\u2019t deny competition   Veiled from this point, DAI is focusing more and more on larger Vaults, going over 10k to 15k, and soon vauls to $150M. DAI treads heavily on any Sidechain, Chain being EVM or not being EVM as SOL \u201chttps://saber.so/#/pools/dai/deposit\u201d This gives a clear view that the star Product of the DAI protocol is used, and used strongly. You mentioned Aave, DAI is the 3rd asset with the most deposits in Polygon\u2019s Aave and the 2nd in Stablecoins. That\u2019s great, it will allow users to deposit WETH, WBTC or USDC and borrow DAI with no minimums and very dynamic interest rates. It is not that Maker is lagging behind, because DAI is there, people want DAI, because of what DAI represents for DEFIs. ",
