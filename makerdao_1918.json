Many of the CeFi players hit via contagion from 3AC and Terra has kept \u201cinstitutional vault\u201d opportunities on the back burner as liquidity has tightened and yields in DeFi have been overshadowed by better, risk free yields offered with treasury bonds.  Highlights For the past months, in collaboration with Strategic Finance, we have developed and executed on a revenue share strategy with the PSM. After months of negotiations, we received the Coinbase USDC Institutional rewards proposal (MIP81) and the Gemini Marketing Initiative in September. These posts captured the attention of others which resulted in proposals from CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP86) and OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) 1 Additionally, these proposals have generated a lot of media attention with articles in Bloomberg, Bankless, Defiant, Coindesk and more. A large theme at Devcon was on L2s and particularly ZK rollups. There is a lot of interest from different zero knowledge and optimistic roll-up teams to have native DAI support and fast withdrawals via Teleport and ultimately MCD deployed fully on these ecosystems. Other important news are:   Pyth added DAI support for its price feed which allows DAI usage on chains like Solana.   ODOS dex aggregator with support on Ethereum, Polygon and Abritrum, is now integrated with the PSM ( all 3: USDC, GUSD and USDP).   Jet Protocol will now add DAI after a vote passed in the JetDAO community to onboard DAI (thanks to Stablenode for the help proposing).   RWA interest picked up significantly the past couple months, following the launch of the HVB deal and the media exposure it garnered, it was a key conversation topic during Messari Mainnet.    Regulatory The narrative coming out of Washington has continued to be skeptical towards crypto and the approach of \u201cregulation by enforcement actions\u201d looms over the space. SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, has insinuated that the commission could classify tokens in proof of stake networks as securities. Janet Yellen, Treasury Secretary has suggested the U.S. government crack down on crypto scams and operational failures and called on her agency to increase enforcement on digital assets (and this was before FTX\u2026). We can only assume these calls will intensify in light of recent events.

Thanks for the updates!! Kudos to what the team is doing   After the recent event of FTX. Govt is watching this space very closely to enforce very tighter regulations, Do you think $DAI which is a decentralized stablecoin (A token that is very difficult to understand and keep track for governments) will be affected? How are you guys planning to do some activity on this? Maybe social media posts or twitter spaces?     MakerGrowth:  Looking ahead Continuation on the PSM revenue share strategy  I don\u2019t think PSM is a very good model from the product side because of centralization issues, (example USDC MIP got approved with a coinbase institution)  Working with key L2s to increase DAI usage/functionality  Any low-hanging fruits we have in the pipeline?
