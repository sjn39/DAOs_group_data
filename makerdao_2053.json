                    "content": "Link to tonights call: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89326394914 Over the holidays, and in my efforts to practically implement a first version of the Endgame Constitution, I have developed another set of improvements to the design of Endgame and formalized some of the changes that have already been discussed over the last quarter. The Endgame Call today, and this post will help give a high level overview of what these changes impact in the short term and in terms of the timeline and priorities.  Terminology simplification First some terms that are being overhauled to help better understanding the rest of the post: All the terms are described using this format: New term (the old term it replaces) Endgame Constitution (Endgame Plan) SubDAO (MetaDAO) Mandated Actors (Core Units/Councils/Tribunals/GovenorDAOs)  Timeline changes: Short term and long term focus The biggest change to this new approach to the Endgame Constitution is that it pushes back the estimated launch of the SubDAO tokens with 6 months, aiming to launch summer 2024 rather than late 2023. The main reason for this is that the crypto space is in such a severe crypto winter that it is very unlikely that summer 2024 will be at the top of a new bubble, or that there will be any severe competitive pressures making launching the SubDAOs time sensitive. So we have some extra time, and it is beneficial and helps reduce risk to take this extra time and use it to better prepare, since it allows us to include more crucial features in the launch. Generally, it is better to wait as long as possible with launching the tokenomics and SubDAO elements of the Endgame Constitution because if it is launched too early - in a crypto winter state where a major crash is still possible - gamification elements may backfire and draw in users prematurely who then leave again as the space continues to crash. Instead the Endgame Constitution will be split into two parts. The short term version, or the Pregame Constitution that will be proposed early 2023, will contain only a subset of the Endgame Constitution elements that are relevant to the short term phase before SubDAOs are launched. The full Endgame Constitution will then be proposed in 2024, as it has been developed, discussed, iterated and improved over the course of 2023. This means that while on one hand we can give ourselves more time to build out more future proofed and solid constitutional mechanisms that are, we also can start working on more relevant short term goals that focus on fundamental value creation and are independent of the Endgame Tokenomics.  Compliance and short term products Another set of useful improvements is compliance and legal resilience from leveraging the increased knowledge we have as it relates to various legal and regulatory risks and opportunities. This additional risk reduction allows to move faster with certain products and launches with the safety of following best practice on defi frontend compliance. This in turn puts us in a better position to develop strong long term solutions for unbreakable decentralization.  Tokenomics changes There are also a few Endgame Tokenomics changes, including shifting fixed costs for mandated actors from being paid through income, to become paid through fixed token emissions distributed through a gamified competition in order to deal with the long term challenge of mandated actors making recommendations on their own compensation.  Implementation All the concepts described in this post will be implemented through the Pregame Constitution described above - so only if and at the time the proposal passes will the changes take effect.

It has been suggested that the work these CUs currently do would be funded and managed through SubDAOs , but if SubDAOs are not launching until well into 2024 then that creates a significant gap in both employment and work done. We will need to consider carefully if we want to set up an alternative system to handle this, or simply deem that work as unnecessary or easily managed by other CUs. ",

Aren\u2019t councils, tribunals, and governorDAOs specific functional pieces of the endgame model? Generalizing them all into Mandated Actors seems counterproductive.     rune:  long term challenge of mandated actors making recommendations on their own compensation.   An alternative solution to this challenge could be to have a compensation & oversight committee made up of a few MKR holders, Delegates, Dai Foundation board members, and some hired independent contractors. Run it like a board. Set up some sort of plurality or majority voting requirement and have the results be authoritative. This would remove the need for mandated actors to vote on their own and others\u2019 compensation while still giving them a forum to raise their voices. The advantage would be that all comp decisions run through a single group, so there will be consistency and fairness in the compensation landscape. ",
