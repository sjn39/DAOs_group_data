                    "content": "eip: 5173 title: NFT Future Rewards (nFR) Standard description: A multigenerational reward mechanism that rewards\u200c all \u200cowners of non-fungible tokens (NFT). author: Yale ReiSoleil yale@iob.fi, dRadiant (@dRadiant), D Wang, PhD david@iob.fi discussions-to: EIP-5173: Non-fungible Future Rewards Token Standard type: Standards Track category: ERC status: Draft created: 2022-05-08 requires: 165, 721  Abstract In this EIP, we propose the implementation of a Future Rewards (FR) extension which will enable owners of EIP-721 tokens (NFTs) to participate in future price increases after they sell their tokens. Through the implementation of EIP-5173, the creators, buyers and sellers create a giving circle in trading practice. A giving circle is formed when all participants work in a framework to build greater wealth through each other\u2019s success. One does not expect the same amount of return from the same person when they give someone a portion of their profits. There is no quid pro quo. Rather, they are confident that someone else in the same circle will give them the same benefits, with a smaller or greater monetary value, from other participants in the same circle later on. Owners of the EIP-5173 compliant tokens can benefit in two ways from such a gift economic framework:  An increase in price during their holding period; They continue to receive Future Rewards (FRs) after the token is sold.  The realized profits from the sale of the EIP-5173 compliant tokens will be shared across the chain of historical ownership if the seller is not the original Minter and therefore not the very first seller. Through the NFT Future Rewards (nFR) framework, the same seller, as well as every other seller, will receive the same FR distributions. Everybody pays it forward, forming a giving circle. Giving circles are groups of people who work together to improve a situation that is typically much larger than it is at the moment. Some of the characteristics of a giving circle are community interdependence and delayed reciprocity. In a well-designed circle of giving, givers may be able to receive more than they give over time, so giving is not the only thing involved. As a result, the traditional model of platform versus user and user vs. user relationships has been fundamentally altered into one, shared objective: if others succeed, I succeed more. EIP-5173 establishes a standard interface for a profit sharing framework in all stages of the token\u2019s ownership history desired by all market participants. In a giving circle, art buyers/owners are compensated for their participation in the instrument\u2019s trading price discovery process. We embrace and promote a new gift economic model, which is similar to the Copyleft and open-source spirit as opposed to traditional copyrights. The advancement of technology has enabled such implementation in trading for the first time. In the same way that open-source software has changed the software industry and society, we can also change the financial industry. As in trading, most traders lose money, but the proposed Future Rewards framework is designed to help average traders do better. Additionally, as we will explain later, it discourages any \u201cunder-the-table\u201d deals that may circumvent the rules set forth by artists and marketplaces. https://github.com/dRadiant/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-5173.md Implementation ",

That needs to change:   Everyone\u2019s on the same page with a success-based model;   Exchanges only get paid when users make money;   Both buyers and sellers benefit from rules;   Traders are encouraged to do the right thing instead of \u201cbuying, selling, and buying\u201d;   It\u2019s finally possible thanks to new technology.

The FR distribution giving circle makes the community more cohesive, akin to what you call a \u201chyperstructural relationship.\u201d However, this EIP is not directly related to the price or supply. But it is having a similar effect on the community\u2019s bonding. It allows all members to create value together, which we call \u2018a giving circle.\u2019 The early buyers may have a slight upside advantage, but all subsequent buyers can benefit from a cascading profit dynamic. The EIP-5179 tool is one of a series of tools needed to enhance the functionality of ERC721-based trading. You\u2019re not the only one noticing a certain similarity between it and the bonding curve design (@anett beat you to it! ;-)). I like the general idea of the bonding curve, but at the interface level, EIP-5173 is designed around the idea of a chain of ownership among the users, which has some fundamental incompatibility with the bonding curve every time there is a new \u201cbuy\u201d order that results in a new token insurance. If you have any suggestions or new ideas to incorporate the bonding curve into this, I would appreciate hearing from you. As for your second question, obviously it can be used for NFTs, but there are many other applications as well. Once the platform building is complete, we plan to release several other EIPs. One of its advantages is that it fosters a strong community. As of now, many people abandon a project/community once they sell their tokens. With EIP-5173, however, their interest will remain personal. Future Rewards will continue to be paid to them forever. This rotating benefit is enjoyed by everyone. Moreover, team token offerings can use this mechanism to create an equitable token structure, in which investors own the entire tradable tokens, whereas team members own only the non-tradable o-token (o for originators). Team members receive their income after investors make profits. As long as the terms of the treasure holding are clear and fair to all investors (such as restricted trading or a time lock), teams can designate some EIP-5173 tokens as treasure holdings. By removing the rug-pulling in cryptos, inequality would be greatly reduced, insider trading would be reduced, and common interests would be aligned. ",

When you trade, you\u2019re playing another person\u2019s game. What happens when you play other people\u2019s games? You\u2019ve got no control. Those in positions of power and influence and\u2026 a highly disciplined few, they are the ones who win. Not you. The majority of market participants, casual traders like most of you, are just losers, by design. It\u2019s likely that Jesse Livermore is the most successful trader in history. But what happened to him in the end? He had to kill himself. The guy who made billions in today\u2019s dollars from trading was unhappy.  So what\u2019s the problem here? Traders are forced to operate under a zero-sum mentality. One person\u2019s gain is another\u2019s loss. This can lead to traders being driven by greed and fear constantly when making decisions. A nervous wreck. The result is losing. You know most traders lose everything within 6 to 24 months. Exchanges are often structured in a way that their function is to transfer wealth from the majority to a small group of winners. It gets worse. There are times when exchanges themselves do unethical or even illegal things against their customers. Platforms are built on conflicts of interest.  It\u2019s time for a change. EIP-5173 proposes a revolutionary asset transaction protocol based on gift economy principles to change this dynamic. Each non-fungible token, or NFT, creates a Giftchain using a protocol based on EIP-5173 we proposed last year. EIP-5173, a new process of wealth creation, ensures that one person\u2019s success does not hurt another, but rather benefits the entire society. The result is: No more zero-sum trading; no more conflict of interest, and more for you is also more for me. And there is the ability to capture part of the future growth weeks, months, or even years after you sell your token. By implementing EiP-5173, untrading changes the relationship between creators, buyers and sellers entirely. No more your win is my loss as all users create more value together. ",
