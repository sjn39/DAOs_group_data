Contingency Planning - Scenarios. Return Excess Funds. Unwinding and Defunding. Proposal Parameters.   Specification  Motivation The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit will support MakerDAO through the critical transition from its current operational structure to the Endgame Plan structure with MetaDAOs. To this end, sufficient funds need to be provisioned to guarantee the success of the Maker ecosystem in the long run.  Core Unit ID SES-001  Budget Implementation  Modifications from the Original MIP40: MIP40c3-SP55  Updated budget transparency graphic & link. Minor grammatical and formatting updates.   The budget is split into two separate categories: Permanent Team and Incubation Program.  1478\u00d7808 78 KB  SES Auditor Framework Details  Multi-sig Wallets The following multi-sigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multi-sig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role based multi-sigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have 2 roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants. The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have 2 signers, both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multi-sig will also have 2 signers, both GovAlpha team members. Both roles will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multi-sig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a back-up. This multi-sig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallets.   The Operational Wallets \u2013 One wallet for each budget category. These are 2-out-of-3 multi-sigs controlled by SES. Signers include the facilitator, the team lead, and one other SES member from the permanent team, responsible for the associated budget category.  The Permanent Team Wallet  The Incubation Program Wallet      Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 15 days of each month, SES will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month\u2019s Actuals, i.e., the actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast, based on the latest available information, of the budget (in DAI) required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team.  MKR Vesting Overview \u2013 this schedule has the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallets to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallets that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    The Monthly Expense Reports can be found on the SES Expense Reports page of the expenses dashboard.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first 5 days of the month, SES submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.  Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, SES submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallets that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallets to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallets balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 SES creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull - The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the SES DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.  Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by SES to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist, and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings.  A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the SES\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals \u2013 Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer, and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallets.   Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer. As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.

Increasing Value to Maker Token holders SES will support MakerDAO, through operational support and software development, to organize the critical transition from its current operational structure to the Endgame Plan structure with MetaDAOs. Once the new structure is established, it plans to further develop and maintain MakerDAO\u2019s Decentralized Operations platform, again including both operational support and software development.  Auditor Framework & Operations. Legal Research. Community Calls. Project-based Budgeting. Support transition to MetaDAOs.  Development of the Decentralized Operations platform. Offering operational support.   Replace the SES Incubation Program with a self-learning and onboarding platform.   Roadmap and Objectives We\u2019ve fulfilled the vast majority of initial roadmap items and discovered new ones along the way.  We are still collecting and prioritizing longer term roadmap items also based on the overall direction of the DAO. Here\u2019s a glimpse of what is on the roadmap right now.  Decentralized Operations Platform Already released in its more limited variant, the Expenses Dashboard, we plan to further evolve this platform until it covers the full range of Decentralized Operations, including decentralized workforce, capital, and work. This is in line with the Endgame Plan\u2019s Unified DAO Operational Toolkit. Future milestone ideas:  Porting and extending the existing functionality to their MetaDAO equivalents: Core Units become Administration + Contributor Teams, etc. Roadmaps with long-term vision and KPIs, as well as short-term, concrete project deliverables. Ability to perform reviews and quality control on these deliverables.  Project-Based Budgeting for teams: extend the current budget reporting with project estimates, actual spends, and timelines. Project-Based Budgeting for governors: prioritize the list of projects and determine which ones make the budget limit cut. Decentralized successor to the SES Incubation and Grants programs, enabled by self-learning, onboarding, and skill development through Maker Academy. People management, evaluation, and comp-related features based on Maker Academy skill trees. Pseudonymous user profiles with reputation-based blockchain identity: separating signal from noise in the community by filtering based on token ownership and expertise. Maker Core administrative mechanics such as DVCs, scope maps, committees/tribunals, etc. Where it saves money, replacing manual governance processes with automated equivalents, for example the Dai Foundation\u2019s intangible asset register, or legal operations functionality.  Note that we\u2019re following an agile development process, which means that all roadmap items and their priorities are subject to change based on evolving insights and rapidly changing circumstances. The provided list gives an idea of which modules to expect and does not entail a commitment to deliver these particular items within the one-year timeline.  Project-Based Budgeting Bootstrap Implement a transition in 3 phases, in the first place for SES itself, towards a Project-Based Budgeting (PBB) model. The initial plan looks like this:   Preparation phase, already covered by the active MIP40, would involve the creation of a software module and the necessary documentation to define KPIs, and estimate and propose projects. The process can be tested initially by SES before it is made available for other contributor teams.  Simulated PBB phase for 3 months, which runs the project-based budgeting process but with a fixed budget cap to allow for initial optimizations needed to make the model work well. MakerDAO voters would determine prioritization of the projects and provide feedback.  Active PBB phase from May 2023 onwards, when the Project Budget Cap will be set by MakerDAO voters on an on-going basis. A Retention Budget Cap will be maintained to cover preliminary research, analysis, and preparation of the project proposals.   2323\u00d7889 29.3 KB   We believe that Project-Based Budgeting will critically improve the ability of MakerDAO to effectively prioritize and execute on its roadmap. Project-Based Budgeting is the best way to reduce overall MakerDAO budget during times of falling revenues. It allows MakerDAO to pay only for the highest-impact work, and is a flexible way for contributor teams to scale up and down. Project-Based Budgeting is a much needed preparation to pave the way for the implementation of the Endgame plan. It will allow MetaDAOs to operate transparently and efficiently, and propose valuable work for the Maker Core scopes; with or without RFP process.  Once the 3rd phase goes into effect, it\u2019s likely that a new budget MIP will be submitted to replace the current proposal in order to reflect the new structure. Note that we\u2019re following an agile development process, which means that all roadmap items and their priorities are subject to change based on evolving insights and changing circumstances.  Operational Support for the DAO  Operational support for change management between MakerDAO today and its future Endgame form(s). Continued community calls support. Continued advisory to Core Units, and later the MetaDAO Administration and Contributor Teams. Continued auditing services for Core Unit finances.   Legal Research  Continued development of the Self-Insurance Fund. Legal risk analysis for MetaDAOs and Maker Core. Maintaining external expert relationships for specialized advise Monitoring of regulatory developments wrt. DeFi and DAOs   Incubation Program transition The SES Incubation Program is in the process of winding down and will be replaced by a self-learning and onboarding experience to reduce costs, while continuing to leverage the openness of the DAO. This will be intergrated with the rest of the Decentralized Operations Platform. The current incubees will be moved to a Project-Based funding model. This transition:  Will give the MakerDAO community more direct control over their roadmap and budgets. Create more flexibility for cross-team resource allocation, allowing more resources to be allocated to the highest priority projects.   Contingency Planning In a super bear scenario, the SES Core Unit could temporarily or permanently abandon broader objectives such as:  The rapid development of the Operations Platform. Maker Academy. Offsites + Conferences. Research.  The Core Unit could then use its remaining resources to focus on the most pressing needs of the DAO. It could operate in this state for a considerable amount of time. Retention and team morale may become an issue.  Unwinding and Defunding Within one month of the ratification of the offboarding proposal, the Facilitator will submit a proposal to the community documenting the plan for wind-down of SES-001. This plan will include line items of the necessary tasks to complete unwinding, a projected timeline, as well as a cost estimate for completion of the wind-down proposal. After the completion of the shutdown, any remaining budget will be returned to the DAO with the following exceptions:  Any outstanding payments that are owed to external parties and contributors but have not yet been paid. If SES-001 and/or its contributors are involved in active litigation and need to retain a subset of the budget to resolve legal disputes.  SES-001 contributor MKR vesting will be accelerated to the nearest 6-month vest on completion of the wind-down. This means a contributor vesting 10 MKR annually would vest 5 MKR at completion of the wind-down. The above clause overrides the 12-month cliff.  Return of Excess Funds As defined in the Budget Implementation section above, excess funds above the 3 month forecast will be returned on a monthly basis, meeting the requirements of MIP4c2-SP14.  Proposal Parameters This MIP40c3 subproposal provides the following options, fully described above, for ranked-choice voting:  A: Abstain B: Approve Speedy Dashboard budget C: Approve Standard Operations budget D: Reject budget   Transactions SES\u2019s Auditor & Operational Wallets will hold more than the designed minimum funds in both the Auditor Wallet (2 months) and the Operational Wallet (3 months) to start the budget period. Any amount over the designed minimums will be returned to the DAO via DssBlow. Funds in the Grants Wallet will also be returned to the DAO since the budget and operations of SES Grants will stop.  Smart Contract Implementation This budget implementation uses the DssVest. One of the two following budget streams is approved based on the rank-choice voting outcome of this MIP\u2019s ratification polling.   Speedy Operations Platform Budget Stream A total of 3,199,200.00 DAI will be streamed to 0x87AcDD9208f73bFc9207e1f6F0fDE906bcA95cc6 starting 2023-2-01 and ending 2024-1-31.   Standard Operations Budget Stream A total of 2,719,200.00 DAI will be streamed to 0x87AcDD9208f73bFc9207e1f6F0fDE906bcA95cc6 starting 2023-2-01 and ending 2024-1-31.

Not sure I get this one. Can I get some paraphrasing or clarification please?     fumoffuXx:   I assume the addition 60k for speedy is additional expenses to hasten whatever projects as an incentive?    It\u2019s not incentives. The rationale is to get more development power behind that project.     fumoffuXx:   please indicate a target/milestone to initiate wind down process. if not its never gonna happen.    There is a requirement to indicate how a Core Unit would proceed to wind down if and when Governance requests it. This was created mainly for Governance to understand which services they would be losing in the case of a wind-down.     fumoffuXx:   can you provide the scope of service or deliverables from the incubation and the permanent teams?    Our mandate can be found in the corresponding MIP39. This is similar for pretty much every mandated Core Unit within Maker.     fumoffuXx:   redundancy on legal research? there is risk for that no?    Are you asking if there\u2019s a risk in doing research? Or if the Legal Research is aimed at mitigating the risk? Not sure where you\u2019re trying to get at. ",
