In theory, if this decision holds up, the SEC would have to provide a jury for all in-house administrate proceedings which will present challenges from an operational standpoint. Not to mention, instead of an administrate law judge deciding the matter, the finders of fact would be ordinary individuals sitting for jury duty. This decision also could have far reaching implications beyond the realm of the SEC. For example, there are many other administrative proceedings that involve, potentially, someone\u2019s liberty and freedom, which do not provide a right to a jury, including New York State Department of Motor Vehicle administrative proceedings, Child Protective Services proceedings, as well as Department of Correction disciplinary proceedings, to name a few. Why does this matter you may ask ? Well, if you ever find yourself in such a scenario in front of a regulatory body, you might want ordinary people deciding your fate, or,  you may want to waive that right and have an appointed political bureaucrat make the decisions. Either way, giving an individual the right to a jury allows that person (and presumably their counsel) to make a tactical informed decision, and that is very important. ",

The decision also held that congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the SEC and the Take Care Clause in Article II of the Constitution was violated. As to the jury trial aspect, the court held that the Seventh Amendment guarantees  a jury trial because the SEC\u2019s enforcement action is akin to traditional actions at law to which the jury-trial right attaches.
