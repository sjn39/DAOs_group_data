It was an amazing smart-contract achievement for the time: many people bought their first MKR tokens in Oasis, me included. Currently, however, Oasis Trade seem to suffer the very high Ethereum fees. For example, there is a spread of about 5% on the DAI/WETH pairs: https://oasis.app/trade/market/WETH/DAI To address this problem, it might make sense to launch OasisDEX on a L2 chain. QUESTION 1: there is this emerging L2 chain called xDAI (https://www.xdaichain.com/). The fees are currently negligible, and they will stay low thanks to PoA. Would it be possible to officially port OasisTrade on xDAI? QUESTION 2: Of course this will require some support/resources from the Fundation. If these are not directly available, could the Fundation quote us a figure (price)? The MakerDAO might use the returns of the SF to pay for it (if the community votes on this, of course). QUESTION 3: Perhaps we could introduce some fees on the trades, so this could generate revenues for MakerDAO too? If there is enough interest, I could try to run a poll on this topic. But first let\u2019s see what is the response in this thread. ",

Regarding the PoA validators, here is the list: https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/news-and-information/current-xdai-validators As you (i.e., generic reader) can see, it includes MakerDAO. So we are kind of already have a foot in the game. In any case the technical aspects of xDAI can be perhaps better discussed in a specialised thread? One important point: it seems to me like launching officially OasisTrade on xDAI would not generate direct negative risks to MKR-holders, DAI-peg, or anything like that. The only \u2018players\u2019 taking risks are are the traders, but that is true for almost all activities in crypto. We will definitely need to add a big disclaimer somewhere. But, again, that is pretty much standard in Crypto. ",

Porting it to L2 might bring new life to it, and possibly some revenues. It\u2019s true that maybe Uniswap is working on \u201cL2 limit order trading\u201d but:  that is Soon\u2122, vs Working Now and Tested a lot. even if Soon\u2122 actually comes soon, it\u2019s not obvious that it will be better than what we already have. In general it\u2019s good practice to keep value in what you have, and it would be a shame to just forget about Oasis Trade. There would be good marketing for MakerDao in having the first limit-order DEX exchange on L2.  I agree with  I would prefer if the Community works on this versus the Maker Foundation Devs, as they are already overwhelmed with work.  but how can we proceed concretely? ",

I am sure there is still a lot to do to improve security/decentralisation/etc, but it\u2019s running now.
