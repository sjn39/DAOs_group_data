Welcome to Know Your MIP episode #13. My name is Gala, and I am with GovAlpha. We are here today to talk about the MakerDAO delegate MIP Set.   Presentation  Payton Rose 07:10  Delegation MIPs(77-79)1565\u00d7893 65.9 KB   Delegation History @ Maker (The Briefest of Overviews)1570\u00d7880 180 KB   MIP77 - MakerDAO Delegates1568\u00d7892 131 KB   MIP77 - Major Changes / Potential Controversies1565\u00d7873 139 KB   MIP78 - Recognized Delegate DAI Compensation1566\u00d7885 148 KB   MIP79 - Recognized Delegate MKR Vesting1567\u00d7884 127 KB   Some feedback from the forums1565\u00d7810 110 KB   Questions 37:04 - CodeKnight: How do we distinguish between good and bad requests for retroactive compensation for CUs? 39:10 - Raphael: How can we mitigate conflict of interest? Delegates voting on their comp is super not an easy thing to do because we like getting paid. How do you approach that? 42:36 - Raphael: Have you thought about the term limits for delegates? 47:06 - David Utrobin: Are there any benchmarks for delegate compensation? 52:42 - Kianga Daverington: It seems like there is not a lot of available MKR to bring into the governance contract. 54:43 - Mark: Should we partner with exchanges to facilitate smaller delegations?  Outro  Gala 55:27  Thank you, everyone, for joining. Let us keep the discussions at forum.makerdao.com    Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call.  ",
