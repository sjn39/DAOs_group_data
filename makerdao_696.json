                    "content": "After studying the MakerDAO whitepaper, my impression is that there are at least two factors which are responsible to keep DAI pegged at 1:1.   Stability fee: When DAI price falls below $1, the stability fee is increased to discourage the creation of new CDPs, as well as encourage the payback of existing loans, which reduces the amount of DAI in circulation. This, in turn, increases DAI price.   Liquidation ratio: If DAI price falls, a borrower can buy x amount of DAI from the market at a price lower than \\$x, but use those DAI tokens to pay a loan worth \\$x (since the target price of DAI is $1, protocol always treats 1 DAI to be worth of $1, no matter what the market price is).   My questions are as follows:  Is my understanding correct? Is there any other factors that I overlooked that help DAI maintain its price? If the stability fee is a key factor to control the DAI price, then it seems to me it needs to be changed very frequently to keep the DAI price under control. How frequently is the fee changed? Changing the stability fee seems to be tricky. An aggressive increase or decrease can make DAI  swing on either side of its target price. How is the new stability fee calculated? Once the stability fee is changed, how long does the market take to react to converge at the new price?  ",

                    "content": "    sherl0ck:  Stability fee: When DAI price falls below $1, the stability fee is increased to discourage the creation of new CDPs, as well as encourage the payback of existing loans, which reduces the amount of DAI in circulation. This, in turn, increases DAI price.   This part is correct.   The Single Collateral SAI system used exclusively the SF to manage the SAI PEG.     sherl0ck:  Liquidation ratio: If DAI price falls, a borrower can buy xxx amount of DAI from the market at a price lower than $x$x$x, but use those DAI tokens to pay a loan worth $x$x$x (since the target price of DAI is $1, protocol always treats 1 DAI to be worth of $1, no matter what the market price is).   I don\u2019t think Liquidation Ratio is really the right term   The second pillar for the PEG is that if the DAI price was above $1 vault holders could borrow DAI and sell it for more than $1 worth of \u2018anything\u2019.   Then IF the price of DAI fell below $1 they could buy it back for < $1 making a profit and then pay down their loan. I honestly think that the ability to short DAI when the price was > $1 and buy it back when DAI was < $1 was one of the reasons people liked DAI. In the loosest sense having a vault open with a DAI loan and selling the DAI for something like USDC was a great way to short DAI.   If DAI ever dropped below $1 you could then buy it back making some profit.   Today trading DAI in this fashion is no longer possible/profitable due to the PSMs.     sherl0ck:   Is there any other factors that I overlooked that help DAI maintain its price?    The PSMs with stablecoins acting to buy DAI should price drop below $1 support price (if these run out of stablecoins then the only thing to manage DAI PEG will be the stability fee), and on the high side the PSM and vault Debt Ceilings.  Should the PSM\u2019s manage to get maxed out they no longer will function to keep the DAI price below $1, and we then will be left with vaults again.     sherl0ck:  If the stability fee is a key factor to control the DAI price, then it seems to me it needs to be changed very frequently to keep the DAI price under control. How frequently is the fee changed?   The PSMs (for now) have rendered the use of the Stability Fee for PEG management somewhat obsolete.  Loosely speaking in the SCD system I think rates were changing pretty fast, and SCD SF on ETH went from almost 0% to as high as 20% in as little as 6 months to try to control the SAI price.     sherl0ck:  Changing the stability fee seems to be tricky. An aggressive increase or decrease can make DAI swing on either side of its target price. How is the new stability fee calculated?   This is one of the many reasons the PSMs were brought on line.   In effect the new stability fee is calculated by looking at markets, and ideally the state of the PSM inflows or outflows (full, near empty) would be analyzed as well.     sherl0ck:  Once the stability fee is changed, how long does the market take to react to converge at the new price?   This is unclear as market conditions are dynamic.  In the SCD system the PEG would move quite a bit within a week time period, governance only could act every 7 days or so.   The real problem wasn\u2019t just DAI price but also available liquidity.   These markets are pretty complex so I don\u2019t think there ever was a good handle on how SF affects DAI liquidity, mostly because no experiments in \u2018market testing\u2019 rate changes were ever conducted even when markets were in steady state to measure market reactions (before the PSMs were implemented).  To this day Maker does not experiment with SF changes but the MOMC simply tries to keep Maker competitive so Maker doesn\u2019t lose market share. The dynamics of vault holders and deposits against borrowing/rates to borrow I don\u2019t think is well understood and should be a more active area of research not just in Maker but across the larger DeFI protocols.  So far I don\u2019t see much research in this arena but I hope to see some more detailed vault analytics coming forward over time. ",
