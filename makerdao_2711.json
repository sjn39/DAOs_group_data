Who The working group currently: @mrabino1, @spin @williamr, @monet-supply, @equivrel, @sava , @allanca, @Planet_X, @schmittlea and @SebVentures People can join by contacting @SebVentures. How There is a working document I will maintain. This is open for transparency but the target for the working group is to have something more clean to present to the community at some point so it can be enforced by end of November (if we do signal + governance poll). Moreover, the community will be probed on specific subjects by polls. Calls will be scheduled to get community feedback/insights along the way. A RWA call is scheduled which will present shortly the working group. Let\u2019s get things done! ",

On the plus side, valuation doesn\u2019t change often. Notice also that the plan is to invest in securitized portfolios of RWA. There is therefore diversification and Maker has a safety buffer by investing only in the senior tranche. For instance, even with the subprime crisis, AAA (senior tranche) subprime RMBS lose only a few percentage point overall. ",

Over a large portfolio of assets you can build a general risk model that that can give a valuation of the portfolio with relatively high accuracy. We believe that this transparency must be available not just to Maker but anyone on chain. Therefore we\u2019ve gone to great lengths to make sure this transparency is available on chain: the asset originators report loan by lone on a risk score and valuation of the asset and the pool models expected losses and revenue of these individual loans into the pool being able to give an accurate NAV to anyone investing in the pool. The asset originators will share their underwriting and origination process to determine if this is an asset they should add to the pool along with the data that they collect to feed into the credit model. As we scale this to a larger size, data that should be brought on chain by third party entities to verify that the on chain price model is correct. This data could for example include:  Personal Credit Score if there is a personal guarantor on the asset Real estate pricing: think of an oracle bringing zillow\u2019s zestimate on chain for each NFT in the pool Cluster risk: an analysis of cluster risk on the entire pool such as (large counterparties, geographical risk, currency risk etc.)  As this entire structure scales up to larger amounts, these data sources can be integrated and the model overall will become more secure and more importantly not solely dependent on trusting the asset originator entirely.
