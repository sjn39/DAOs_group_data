This development was the reason for yesterdays Mid-month Parameter Proposal of the MOMC and this Signal Request is about to follow up on an idea @Primoz brought up: providing a new WBTC-vault-type with a higher Liquidation Ratio. To summarize: if we encounter a large market downturn on WBTC vaults running with a higher Liquidation Ratio are less likely running into liquidations resulting in a loss for the protocol (and with that also the vault owner). More details on the state of WBTC can be found here. With the introduction of WBTC-B the situation might get even worse, as the capped line for WBTC-A might force users in the even riskier vault-type.  Shall we add a new WBTC-based vault type with a higher LR?  Pros  we could offer a WBTC-based vault with a lower Stability Fee - attracting more risk averse users if it gets adopted, we might be able to support more DAI from WBTC getting minted without increasing the fees (as the need to cool-down is lower)   Cons  we will likely see some WBTC-A vaults moving over to the new one, resulting in fewer revenue on them this is not just a configuration, but requires work in the Core Units      No Yes Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-11-19T15:00:00Z, its outcome will result in an on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary.

Just want want to get you view on one quick thing. Here you say that \u201cMaker also became the largest holder of WBTC, surpassing Aave and Compound. As much as this sounds promising, it means Maker carries the largest liquidity risk.\u201d Introducing a third vault, and especially one that requires more WBTC in collateral, could most likely lead to Maker becoming an even larger holder of WBTC. How do you think this risk balances against the reduced risk of liquidation losses due to higher collateralisation on these vaults? ",

This incentivizes people to have relatively less overcollateralization (less money they would lose if Bitgo was hacked, etc). Maker also faces this custody risk, where if Bitgo lost funds vaults could become undercollateralized even if they started with a high collateral ratio. So one could argue that Maker gets relatively less benefits from high collateralization with WBTC versus ETH vaults. I\u2019m in favor of trying this out, but don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see quite the same level of adoption as we have with ETH-C  ",
