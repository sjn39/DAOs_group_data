                    "content": "Alright came to a few questions after poking around:   Is there a point where the leverage offering isn\u2019t worth the squeeze for B.Protocol? From the thread on the initial proposal @yaronvel mentioned that in CeFi 100x leverage is a thing so you weren\u2019t as worried about 10x. It seems like there are a few limiting factors for the Maker Community, namely keeping the 13% liquidation fee and avoiding wading into over-leveraged vaults. Would something like a 120% collateral requirement be exciting enough for your team?   From this report (https://businessblockchainhq.com/business-blockchain-news/makerdao-loans-can-be-gamed-to-hold-out-funds-from-liquidation/) and some postings on B.Protocol\u2019s Medium it\u2019s clear why doing things with the B.Protocol backstop makes a lot of sense for Maker. What about the lost revenue from liquidations though? Would Maker benefit from the liquidation profits from B.Protocol\u2019s keepers? Under the ETH arrangement, it makes sense to give these up completely, but if we are providing collateral from the Oasis platform I think it makes sense to be compensated somewhat for the extra liquidation profits we would be bringing to the table.   We touched on the idea of using ETH on the original forum post, how much value do you see from B.Protocol\u2019s side with adding another asset and are adding some more valuable than others from your prospective? Assuming the Maker Community is fine with adding another asset under B-Protocol\u2019s liquidators and the risks that brings, could we test the additional leverage with something like BAT that is tremendously underutilized compared to our DC?   Sorry all that is so unrelated, if it\u2019s more helpful to answer these outside the presentation feel free to do so! ",

We are live for one month, backstopping around $10m of ETH-A collateral and $3.5m debt. A first successful demonstration was done during the sharp market crash last Thursday.  B.Protocol introduces the concept of relying on committed liquidators, who get priority in the liquidation process, in return to their commitment.  In ETH-A collateral we are an opt-in system, where users can decide to manage their Vault with us, and give prior\u2026      ",
