It was really a one-off though, and not likely to be done again without a really clear gap in the current Ethereum ecosystem, and a similar presumption of an eventual role for the LF in that.

A reply in email does not work as it should, it seems as if I am required to first go to the Forum website to reply. Hopefully I can figure this one out too, but not optimistic. ",

My response: Right now it looks like most want something that is more accessible on the web, and further splitting discussion doesn\u2019t seem helpful, so proposing to keep building on EthMagicians. Threading (which Gitter among other chats doesn\u2019t do) is my personal must have. Jamie is working on configuring Discourse so that reply-to works as well. Or will shout for help at me  Then we can do a trial run with a topic / group in Discourse on EthMagicians that is members-only write, world read, and anyone can join. Basically means we can ban bad actors or those that are off topic, but by default has no barriers to entry. I personally don\u2019t really want a Stanford domain hosting this, and definitely don\u2019t want Google hosting it, but would also be fine with mailman (or other tools). Once setup, any particular solution is not that hard to self host. ",
