For the first year, the governance assets vault will be receiving 14.33 mil UNI/month, so there\u2019s an opportunity for continuation. This topic is meant to give us an initial idea of what\u2019s the community sentiment is.    1. Should the liquidy mining program be continued at all?  Yes No Not sure     0 voters        2. In comparison to the initial liquidity mining program, should we:  Increase the budget Keep the budget as it is Reduce the budget Not sure     0 voters        3. When it comes to the pools that participate in liquidity mining program, should we:  Keep them as they are Change them Not sure     0 voters        4. If we were only to restructure the existing pools, should we:  Keep them as they are (4 pools, even split, uneven APYs) Make one shared pool with even APYs Make one shared pool and replicate the current APY ratios Make one shared pool with different APY ratios Other Neutral Not sure     0 voters     If you\u2019d like a deep dive into the implications of one shared pool system, here\u2019s the topic.    5. Presently UNI tokens that are locked in liquidity pools are not allowed to vote. Should we include UNI/ETH pair to the liquidity mining program?  Yes, add it as soon as possible. Yes, but only after we allow pooled UNI to vote No Neutral Not sure     0 voters        6. Should we include anything other than ETH, USD, UNI, BTC to the liquidity mining program?  Yes No Neutral Not sure     0 voters        7. Should we add USD-USD pairs to the program?  Yes, on even terms with other pairs Yes, on worse terms than other pairs No Neutral Not sure     0 voters     Cheers. ",

Not just a few of them. That being said, I\u2019d love for any liquidity pool token to be used for the UNI liquidity mining program. Budget could be the same, or could be reduced. In case there\u2019s more pairs, there\u2019d also be much more liquidity locked for UNI farming, so it\u2019d make sense to keep the budget the same (for now). It would be nice to have \u2018locked\u2019 UNI be eligible for voting. After all, it\u2019s part of the ecosystem and it would (hopefully) increase voting participation. Again, Uniswap governance should only be used where needed and not just for small topics - but these ones seem major enough to me.  Just my 2 cents on this topic. Edit, would encourage anyone to continue the conversation at : An upgrade for UNI liquidity mining distributions system [similar tokic] ",

We must realize how liquidity mining rewards are an extremely powerful tool to incentivize liquidity. However, we should us it tactically and sparingly; rewards should be increased to ward off competitors and, likewise, should be decreased when there is no immediate threat (down to a baseline level to further decentralize and distribute UNIs). If a competing DEX dominates a certain pair, then liquidity mining rewards should be used to incentivize the same pair on Uniswap to gain market share (provided the pair involves respectable tokens).

I know it feels bad for someone to have bought at ATH and to see the token slowly decrease in value, but it is what it is. If you are indeed worried about the price, then fear not!

Yeah i see that perspective. That seems to be the consensus here which worries me. The token model clearly has no support for holders right now. All benefits go to the LPs.

Imo, stable coin pairs such as usdt/usdc pairs should be out, as curve and other platforms have better dynamics in place for that. I think wbtc pairs should be targeted, as wbtc will continue to grow as eth grows. We need to find pairs with sustained long-term volume not chasing flash-in-the-pan new coins. Introducing more wrapped coins (not sure who will be custodian - perhaps even uniswap could), might be beneficial to tackle incoming competition from platforms such as pols. Regardless, we should definitely use the funds to continue to give uniswap a competitive edge over competition and maintain its role as DEX market leader.

It is also much more fruitful to wait until Uniswap V3 is released before activating it, as the rewards distribution will get much cheaper. The main pro of activating the fee switch is that UNI holders will get part of Uniswap\u2019s fees. The main con is they take that money from the 0.3% commission LPs currently get. So any liquidity mining program becomes much more fruitful for UNI holders after that event happens. Before that, I find it highly unlikely that small pools could participate in the program. As I\u2019ve said earlier, presently, the only reason to vote for a pool getting additional UNI rewards is if you are an LP in the pair you vote for. So only big pairs have a chance to get the rewards in the near future. ",

These are still very high fees. For LPs, the main problem is not the commissions they receive. These commissions are these high in the first place to compensate for the high risks they take due to the impermanent loss problem. As a matter of fact, there are technical solutions that help deal with the IL problem. And if they\u2019re successfully implemented in Uniswap V3, the risks LPs take will get drastically lower. And with drastically lowered risks, it makes sense to reduce the reward as well. In this scenario, I\u2019d argue that reducing the overall fee is reasonable too, but it\u2019s not something we got control of. ",
