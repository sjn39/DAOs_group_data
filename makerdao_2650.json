                    "content": "Note, the SourceCred program has now been discontinued - Moderator  With the extension of the Maker SourceCred trial, the team running the Maker SourceCred instance has received feedback that it is difficult to find information on opting in to receive payments and about the trial in general. This post is meant to be a useful resource for information on SourceCred and how it pertains to Maker.  What is SourceCred / Why should I be interested? SourceCred is a way of paying contributors based on the value they add to a community. In the context of MakerDAO, using SourceCred has been proposed as a way to compensate contributors and workers post Foundation. As a forum member, you can be earning DAI for your valuable contributions to the community today! This is achieved via a clever algorithm to determine what work is valued by a community and through the power of having internet native currencies, such as DAI. @LongForWisdom talks about the initial motivations behind the trial  here. And @s_ben wrote a post on the initial trial kickoff here. If you are interested in going deep into the rabbit-hole on SourceCred their docs can be found here.  How to opt in! At the end of the month,  contributors that have opted in  to receive payments and have at least 20 DAI accrued can redeem their balance for DAI on-chain. Scores and dai values are updated weekly. On-chain payouts are made typically on the first week of each month. To opt in, please fill out: this form This indicates your desire to participate in the trial. You will need to provide an Ethereum address to send payments to. Note that  transactions are public  and that the payment will be reflected in the UI (e.g. the balance); i.e. the ETH address you provide may be tied to your forum identity. Once you have submitted your info, @sourcecred-trial-adm will send you a direct message to validate your submission.  Payouts You can view your cred at the SourceCred instance here. This is not trivial to convert into dai, but will give you a rough idea of how your contributions compare to that of other members of the community. Most recently the Foundation increased weekly payouts to $2,500 / week distributed according to the SourceCred algorithm to all opted in contributors. Moving forward, this instance will be the source of truth for Cred scores and DAI balances. Cred scores are now automatically updated every 24 hrs, and DAI balances are updated every week. ",

Announcement     SourceCred Pilot Extension Governance       With the initial trial nearing completion, the success metrics are looking good (final report coming soon). However, to determine if SourceCred is suitable for paying contributors from the protocol, more data is needed. As a result, the Maker-SourceCred working group has decided to extend the trial for another three months using funding provided by the Maker Foundation.  At the end of this three month extension, barring overt gaming or strong opposition from the community, the working group plan\u2026      And week 13 DAI distributions so people who want to opt in can see what others are getting.     Week 13 DAI Distributions - SourceCred trial Governance       The 13th week of SourceCred trial payouts are here! On-chain payments for DAI earned in August will go out in the next few days.  In case you missed the news, the trial has been extended for another three months, after which the Maker-SourceCred working group plans to propose ongoing payments directly from the protocol!   See the announcement post for details.  Also, a reminder that payouts are now only going to those that have opted in to the trial. See the week\u2026      ",

Also: can we opt in with a Metamask address, which is on the xDAI network (custom RPC), to receive DAI?   Hi @Vincent-M-E-Verheyen, as the post says, you will need to fill out the Google form linked to in the post, which will include a field to add your ETH address. We will then send you a DM on the forum to confirm the ETH address. While this process is a bit clunky, we did it this way so we could inform people of the implications of receiving cryptocurrency income, and receive their consent to that. Once enrolled (and you have >$10 worth of DAI accrued in your balance), we\u2019ll send DAI to you on-chain. You can then use any wallet that supports DAI.     iammeeoh:  +1 to this idea! As far as I know, SourceCred is indeed also active on the xDAI network (they work with 1Hive, i.e., the Honey DAO). So this should be possible.   @iammeeoh, SourceCred is indeed being used to distribute rewards on the xDAI network for 1Hive, in the form of their community currency HNY (an ERC-20 token). SourceCred is not doing the distributions though. 1Hive is doing the distribution themselves using an Aragon DAO running on xDAI. From SourceCred\u2019s perspective, there is little difference what network is being used to distribute  tokens. If the Maker community wanted to use xDAI instead, we could explore that. The xDAI network is relatively new however, and there are still some UX pain points being worked out. That could make the onboarding even harder than it already is . ",

It\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s super simple to create new wallets, and while someone could always \u201cfollow the money\u201d on the blockchain, it gets pretty difficult even if it\u2019s just being layered a few times over. The transparency while definitely being essential for the MakerDAO community to function, also adds several benefits to the SourceCred program. We want users to be able to see who is being rewarded the most for their engagement and what they are bringing to the table. Moreover, the weekly rundowns (most recent one here) gives the community a chance to see how well the program is working. Without reveling the usernames of the people getting paid, it\u2019s pretty hard to track how the program is doing with new members and you wouldn\u2019t even be able to point to posts that SourceCred rewards without outing the users that participated in them. Privacy should always be of the upmost concern, but I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect members who value their pseudo identity to take a few steps to obscure their primary wallets (and ID) rather than make it so the entire project cannot be subject to checks and balances.
