The choice has been to not include it because it might create some vicious cycles/loops in the system. This always felt kind of reasonable to me. It is today possible, however, to use 3rd parties solutions to get DAI from your MKR. For example: Aave allows: MKR\u2013>TUSD (borrow) Maker allows: TUSD \u2192 DAI (cdp) And these 3rd party solutions will probably just expand in number and liquidity over the next few months. So, my question is: Question: does it still make sense to exclude MKR from the list of assets? ",

If this gains traction it would elicit the creation of a MIP6 for MKR.  @Jtathmann I agree that in the past that may have been true for SNX, but they are in the process of adding other collateral options as well (ETH). Since MakerDAO already is primarily backed by ETH I think that if we were able to choose a pragmatic debt ceiling and liquidation ratio that never allowed MKR to be more than a certain percentage of total debt then we would be find.

If you were to try to create a model for the value of an MKR token, it would be directly linked to the safety and amount of assets under collateral in the protocol. In the event of a crypto sell off, we would still expect the value of MKR to decline vs the dollar due to many exchanges using bitcoin to trade for it. However, the price would be somewhat protected as long as our programming didn\u2019t lose money by preforming collateral liquidations. In the event that MKR is heavily collateralized we have two big issues in the event of a downswing based on the fact that we will be forced to further drive down the cost vs the dollar for MKR due to vault liquidations:  our stakeholders will have their purchasing power drastically reduced to the point where they too might have to sell MKR tokens to prevent financial ruin even if our stake holders are not forced to sell, by the platform preforming liquidations of MKR we will be pushing vast amounts onto the market, making it easier for malicious actors to take control of the platform.  I believe the two currency platform functions so well precisely because they are independent of each other. Allowing users to put up MKR for DAI increases our risk while allowing very little extra functionality. As is stated above, there are plenty of places people can collateralize their MKR if they wish to do so, no reason to add fuel to a future forest fire. ",

Your concerns are valid (and indeed this is the reason MKR has not been included as MCD collateral from the beginning). However, since other platforms allow you to borrow DAI in exchange of MKR, I see the risks you discuss as already (at least to a rather big extent, if not fully) present in our current scenario. In fact, many MKR are available on Aave/Compound and this is the source of the flash-loans governance attacks we had to discuss recently.     SebVentures:  Not sure it should be a priority. A DC of 10M is unlikely to change the world (unsure where the risk ceiling is).   Not a priority, but something to put in the queue?

We can add others and achieve the same positive outputs without the downside to the safety of our system.

If MKR were collateral, and MKR underwent a pullback that caused liquidations, then we could see a few undesirable consequences.  The liquidations could cause further MKR price drops and a downward spiral of yet more liquidations.  This means the system accrues bad debt.  That bad debt is handled by first the surplus buffer, and second with flop() debt auctions that will further dilute MKR\u2019s price to attempt to recapitalize the system.  This could, in turn, cause even more liquidations, and down the spiral we go. This would pull MKR out of the governance contract, which would be highly undesirable.  We already have a problem with MKR moving to other lending platforms that threaten the skin-in-the-game mechanism design.  We should be actively encouraging the opposite.  There is certainly a design where we could collateralize the IOU token based on MKR price, which would ensure the MKR holder was locked in the chief, but this is more work than a simple collateral. On the topic of mechanism design, MKR holders should be self-interested profit seekers.  Once they become Vault holders, it\u2019s hard to imagine this isn\u2019t just a case of the fox guarding the hen house.  They are less incentivized to raise rates on themselves when it\u2019s needed to balance the peg or adjust the myriad of other risk parameters appropriately against themselves.  If you\u2019re an MKR holder and a protocol user, ask yourself how many times you let your book dictate your choices in a way that just an MKR holder would have rationally voted for.  These are a few reasons off the top of my head.  I personally try to think of MKR as collateral as roughly equal to printing unbacked DAI.

Without going into too much detail, the argument that \u201coh you can borrow Dai against MKR in Aave so why shouldn\u2019t you be able to do it in Maker\u201d is misconstrued. If the price of MKR drops, and liquidations happen on Aave that don\u2019t cover the outstanding debt, then AAVE stakers are on the hook to cover the shortfall. In the case of the case of the Maker Protocol, MKR holders are on the hook through MKR dilutation, which further lowers the price of MKR, potentially generating more MKR liquidations. Because of the different lender of last resort implementations, Aave offering MKR loans does not justify including MKR as collateral in the Maker Protocol. As such I maintain my position that adding MKR to the Maker Protocol is undesirable. Another way to think about it is conflict of interest. MKR holders are essentially insuring the collateral portfolio. Can you really trust MKR holders to insure themselves in a responsible manner when they have every incentive to misprice the risk (too high debt ceiling, too low collateralization ratio, too low stability fee). I sure don\u2019t. As a greedy MKR holder, I could leverage my MKR to generate Dai to invest in this \u201cbull market\u201d and have a stop loss that is essentially the amount of Dai I generated. And If I get liquidated, fine, I lose my MKR, but I\u2019m not the one getting diluted. Do you see how this could be an issue? Every individual MKR holder is incentivized to vote for this, but from a systems perspective this is a disaster. ",

I see it like this: MakerDAO lends money (DAI) to anybody with any type of asset, but it cannot lend money to its own owners! Here is where I see the issue, an MKR holder, like anyone else owning another type of asset needs some DAI as well to do something else in some specific moment, and the fact is that ourselves cannot help in that case? Well maybe not the best solution, but sharing some thought on this. Let them borrow from the surplus buffer (maybe not all of it, at least a part), and let them vote from those \u201cvaults\u201d  as well. Don\u2019t add interest to the Surplus buffer, use a percentage of it already as the \u201ccollected interest\u201d. This have several consequences:   The MKR there is not really backing the DAI lent (that DAI is already backed by some other collateral).   We create the DAI, and we create the MKR, not needing anybody to do the liquidation, if the system needs to liquidate simply burn those MKR at the price in the oracle plus the 13% liquidation fee, probably this is something more effective than the normal auctions and probabilities of having a bad debt here are lower.   MKR holders wants to borrow more?, well they\u2019ll have to increase the surplus buffer then, or at least the part that can be lent to them.   MKR holders don\u2019t want to increase the fee there? Tricky one, but not impossible to solve, don\u2019t let those having MKR in those vaults to participate in this specific type of vote (ie. in a normal company when there is a decision that benefits a given shareholder, typically the others are the one who can vote for it, and not himself).   Well, not sure if this is that a good of a solution, but adding some Pros:  Increases DAI in circulation (directly from the surplus buffer, or MakerDAO reserves or whatever). Permits that MKR  holders use their assets (MKR) to do other stuff (participate in some nice farming, liquidity pools, others, with the borrowed DAI). MKR holders will prefer to let their MKR here that give them to another protocol like AAVE (reducing the possibility of using that MKR as a flash loan against us). We collect more fees here as well.  Cons:  We need greater Buffers which could be used for this (not sure if this is bad TBH, but it\u2019s a tricky one) The implementation of what was described above it is for sure very complicated!  Well, I could be missing important points here maybe, but letting this around for further discussion ",

Indeed, if I have 1MKR (out of, say, ~1m DAI in total) I am morally the owner of 0.0001% (i.e., 1/1million) of the surplus, and it makes sense that somehow I can leverage it.     SebVentures:  Yes, I don\u2019t want any MKR token holder to have to sell his MKR if he need cash for a short period.   Yes, that was exactly my main motivation.

                    "content": "Hello, after some thinking, I came up with a possible solution to allow MKR holders to obtain some DAI in case of need. GOAL: Allow MKR holders to get some DAI without selling their MKR to the market. PROPOSED SOLUTION: We currently have in place a MKR burning mechanism. I propose that a MKR holder could:  send their MKR to the burner The burner, when ready (i.e., when it has enough DAI to spend, a parameter regulated by Governance), \u2018burn\u2019 these MKR and sends the DAI (at market price) to the user. \u2013> Note: this avoid buying MKR on the market. No fees/inefficiencies, etc   The burner, however, also sends the user a MKR CALL OPTION (it can have a limited duration) at current market price. During the period of validity of this option, the user can therefore re-buy their MKR from the burner for the same price they sold them earlier to the burner. Of course, if Governance decides, the MKR-holder might be charged a fee for this service.  There are two outcomes: Case 1)  the MKR holder never returns the DAI (i.e., they never use the CALL Option). This is an optimal case: the burner has got/paid the MKR to burn from the MKR-holder, rather than from the market. This is more efficient.  Case 2) the MKR holder eventually (within the period of validity of the CALL option) uses the CALL option and gets back their MKR. This basically undo\u2019s the burning   but ultimately no DAI is lost (in fact, if fees are applied, some money is gained by MakerDAO)  What do you think? It seems to me like this is a relatively low risk approach, given that the money \u2018involved\u2019 in this process is capped by the rate/amount of MKR that MakerDAO decides to burn. ",

I copy and paste here the following comment of @SebVentures in the chat, just in case somebody is not reading the chat:  the idea is sound, but it seems complicated. Option pricing is always complex. But your idea of saying let\u2019s use 10% (or 25%) of the surplus buffer to cover for a MKR-A vault is not bad (not exactly the proposition, but the underlying idea). We just have the SF high enough to be sure this facility is only for Maker holder in the need of quick cash.  ",
