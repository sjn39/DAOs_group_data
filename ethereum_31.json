NiceHash\u2019s specification for Ethereum stratum mining protocol v1.0.0: https://github.com/nicehash/Specifications/blob/master/EthereumStratum_NiceHash_v1.0.0.txt  Ethereum does not have official stratum protocol. It supports only GetWork, which is very resource hoggy as miners need to constantly poll pool to obtain possible new work. GetWork thus affects performance of miners and pools. Due to demand for more professional Ethereum mining, several versions of \u201cstratum\u201d for Ethereum emerged. These \u201cstratums\u201d utilize GetWork on server side (pool side) to obtain work, which would be fine, if careful considerations and precautions were taken when creating such protocols.
