                    "content": " Overview stETH is gaining populairity as DeFi collateral. Within Maker the adoption has slowed down since about late February, see below.  Maker stETH adoption  Screenshot 2022-03-21 at 10.26.212176\u00d71530 164 KB  Aave has launched stETH around the time that the interest for borrowing against stETH started to dwindle, and has seen a great adoption since. See this dune dashboard: Dune Analytics. The adoption of stETH on Aave is logical, as users can draw debt in ETH, and thereby just going long on stETH yield. However, MakerDAO should have a discussion about how the competitiveness of ETH & stETH can be increased on the Maker protocol.  AAVE stETH adoption  Screenshot 2022-03-21 at 10.55.551488\u00d7896 57.2 KB   Increasing competitive advantage There are multiple options MakerDAO can undergo. The ones I focus on here are: adding vault-types for stETH, and onboarding Aave Interest Bearing ETH (aETH) as collateral in Maker. Other options can be proposed and discussed in this thread or different threads.  Adding vault-types for stETH Summary of the options: adding a vault-type for stETH with lower liquidation ratio & higher stability fee (stETH-B), AND/OR adding a vault-type for stETH with higher liquidation ratio & lower stability fee (stETH-C)  Shall we add a stETH vault-type with a lower liquidation ratio?  Pros  Allow users to increase their exposure further on stETH Higher stability fee can be asked for this.   Cons  Could see usage of ETH-B moving to this new vault-type, which could increase risk to Maker protocol Increases risk to Maker protocol in case of depegging between stETH & ETH     stETH-B  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Shall we add a stETH vault-type with a higher liquidation ratio  Pros  Allow users to get cheaper liquidity with their stETH, attracting more risk averse users Can increase the total amount of stETH collateral in the Maker protocol ETH-C users might switch, which could net more SF revenue if SF for this vault-type is higher   Cons  stETH-A users might switch, which could net less SF revenue if SF for this vault-type is lower   Increases risk to Maker protocol in case of depegging between stETH & ETH       stETH-C  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Onboarding aETH as collateral in Maker AAVE Interest Bearing ETH (aETH) is what a user gets when depositing ETH into the supply side on AAVE protocol. As more people start going long stETH / short ETH on Aave, the interest rate for the supply side for ETH increases. This makes it cheaper to borrow stables on Aave against ETH. Therefore, onboarding aETH into the Maker protocol as collateral might make a lot of sense.  Shall we request core units to investigate aETH as collateral in Maker?  Pros  Allows users to go long on the supply side interest rate for ETH on AAVE Adds downward pressure on the interest rate on AAVE for ETH, making borrowing DAI more attractive on Maker with ETH   Cons  The downward pressure on the ETH interest rate on AAVE might make stETH on AAVE even more attractive.     aETH  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next steps The informal polls will run until 2022-03-28T10:00:00Z. After that based on the results, signal requests and/or a MIP-6 application for aETH will be made.  Update March 31st 2022  stETH-C \u2192 moving forward towards onboarding stETH-B \u2192 likely not feasible for risk/reward aETH \u2192 potential systemetic risks, so ditching for now.  ",

It does however increase risks of indirect stETH exposure as ETH supplied to Aave will be borrowed in large quantities and collateralized by stETH, so we might want to treat aETH risk profile as stETH with some layer of protection (depends on average LTV going forward). It is interesting to think how aETH holders will be becoming increasingly exposed to risk of stETH but won\u2019t switch to it completely for better yield. As if new risk profile asset emerged for those not 100% convinced by Lido, but still want some yield benefit and partial exposure. stETH/ETH leverage strategists are basically boosting their stETH yield by sharing Lido risks with aETH holders and paying for it. Market will tell what happens, I kind of speculate aETH holders will become aware of this fact and migrate to stETH completely or seek Lido isolated ETH supplying on other markets. Or maybe this new third risk profile asset persists - partial exposure to stETH through aETH. ",

                    "content": "tldr; wstETH-B; Lower LR, Higher SF - Probably low demand and hard to compete wstETh-C; Higher LR, Lower SF - Higher potential to get traction (~80M debt from Aave) aETH - Probably added risks outweight the benefits Comparison of Lido stETH positions between Maker and Aave In order to better understand the potential effects of the proposed vaults in this forum post, we looked at the current Lido stETH positions in Aave and Maker. For sake of simplicity, we only looked at largest accounts, in Aave 10 largest stETH suppliers represent ~75% of total supply. The estimated Aave stETH-stablecoin borrow market is approximately $245M, 113% larger than MCD wstETH-A (115.23M dai), or in other words, Aave controls ~68% of wstETH collateralized stablecoin debt. The Aave stETH-ETH debt is at ~$795M, which is hardly addressable by Maker, due to different market risk profile of position. Liquidation ratio (LR) Some of the stETH collateralized positions in Aave use cross-collateralization, actually 8 out of 10 use it, but over all, almost 90% of collateral is from stETH. This shows that the feature is valuable to users, but not essential, as stETH is still dominating. Position debt type varies between positions, some of them are single asset debt, while others are multiple asset debt, but in total, ETH represents 73.82%, USDC 17.44% and DAI 3.83% of total debt respectively. The collateral ratio of these positions also varies. The ones which borrow more in ETH tend to have lower collateralization, which makes sense, as risk of liquidation due to market risk is much lower. The lowest CR positions are thus stETH-ETH, which range between 145-175%, with CR buffer of 12-40%. The positions which borrow stablecoins range in CR between 167-384% CR and CR buffer of 35-250%, while the stETH-stablecoin average collateral weighted CR is at 245% with 111% CR buffer. This tells us that the majority of these accounts are quite risk averse and do not strive for high leverage. Compared to MCD wstETH-A, these positions would be set at 270% CR on average (160% + CR buffer in Aave). While the collateral weighted average CR in MCD wstETH-A is at 553% and 393% CR buffer, majority of Aave positions could still be built in MCD with the similar safety buffer. This tells us that lower LR is likely not the advantage we seek right now, and probably shows that wstETH-B; lower LR, higher SF would not see large demand. Also note, that if we want to compete with lower LR, we would also need to set SF below ~3% in order to offer similar priced product, which is likely not acceptable from risk perspective alone and in addition, we use OSM price delay which makes this kind of a position much riskier for us compared to Aave which uses live price and faster liquidations. Effective interest rate The MCD wstETH-A SF is currently set at 2.5%. stETH currently can not be borrowed in Aave, thus there is no nominal interest rate on deposit, thus the effective borrow rate of stETH positions in Aave is equal to effective borrow rate of debt. For stETH-ETH position, this is 2.34%, USDC 2.42% and DAI 1.44%. While the ETH borrow position is incomparable, due to different market risk profiles, it is interesting to see that even though DAI is the cheaper option, the USDC debt is approximately 4 times larger.  The USDC or DAI borrow rate is still smaller in Aave compared to MCD, but since the more costly option - USDC is dominant, this shows that the stability fee is also not the most important factor for why these positions prefer Aave over MCD. wstETH-C; Higher LR, Lower SF option There is some potential here, basically this product would need to offer a reasonable CR buffer compared to current stETH-USDC Aave positions and lower stability fee, which is 2.42%. For example 180% LR vault would allow the average stETH-stablecoin position to still maintain a 65% buffer (26.5% price drop), compared to current 110% (45.5% price drop) which might be interesting for them assuming SF would be low enough to compensate for the additional risk (the positions would still have higher liquidation price in MCD compared to Aave). Nevertheless, it is highly questionable that this would trigger a migration, as there are other possible factors of why one protocol is preferred over another which we didn\u2019t consider here. For example, the ability to borrow debt in multiple stablecoins at once. The current addressable market we could potentially take from Aave with the mentioned product is ~$80M. aETH as collateral Currently the ETH-A stability fee is 2.25%, while effective borrow rate on Aave ETH-USDC position with 200% CR is 1.36%. We could introduce aETH-A with 2.25% SF, which would effectively become 1.21% (due to positive interest accrued on collateral), assuming 200% CR, which is lower than at Aave. We must understand other possible applications of introducing aETH collateral in MCD. For example, current ETH collateral could shift into aETH, which would lower the ETH borrow rate in Aave and further increase the stETH-ETH positions. We must be very careful when we are introducing risks related to other protocols into Maker, especially lending/debt protocols. Each protocol has specific risks, when they are mixed together, we lose the ability to offer diversification benefits of using multiple protocols. For example, borrowers might decide to borrow from multiple protocols at once in order to diversify smart contracts or some other non-economic risk; LR and effective SF are just one part of the product. It is possible that introducing aETH as collateral would have a neutral or even negative effect on our competitiveness and debt market share in the new market equilibrium, while it is certain that we are increasing the risk in the protocol which could have a negative impact on current clients. Otherwise, we are already exposed to Aave and all the underlying assets and services they utilize, such as Chainlink oracle price feed via D3M. aETH would further increase this exposure and potentially canabinalize the DC of D3M. Furtheron, about 70% of all borrowed ETH in Aave is collateralized by stETH. By introducing aETH collateral we also increase our exposure towards Lido. Overall, my opinion is that benefits of aETH do not outweigh the introduced risks and complexities of protocol overlapping and added systemic risk. ",

If the argument against adding wstETH-B is that in the current market there seems to not be a big ask for low liquidation ratio vaults for stETH, perhaps this is a market that isn\u2019t yet catered, that might nevertheless warrant the effort. Depending on the response, I\u2019d propose to poll either just wstETH with higher liquidation ratio, or polling also the lower liquidation ratio vault type at the same time. ",

                    "content": "I can only comment on the technical side. For wstETH it should be fairly low cost and quick to spin up a new ilk, since the technical assessment, adapter and oracles have already been implemented for wstETH-A, and would only add marginal maintenance costs as it would utilize existing oracles. All it requires really is to deploy existing off the shelf contracts and develop an onboarding spell. So the investment on the technical side would be low, and we would be able to execute quickly. To onboard aETH it would require the development of a new token adapter, due to the fact that the token contains rebasing logic (its token supply changes corresponding to accrued yield instead of token value). This would be more time consuming and costly to onboard, so for that work to make sense, it should be a net profitable investment for Maker. However the post above suggests it might only increase the systemic risk, with little to no added revenue. ",

Other protocols and centralized services will probably be able to offer higher leverage and better UX, for example perpetual swaps, futures. Newer and more risk tolerant protocols will outcompete us, as they have nothing to lose and will offer even higher and cheaper leverage with liquidity mining schemes on top of it. Maker was always risk averse and likely current dai holders and vault owners value this tendency. The \u201cfinal product\u201d of Maker is the dai holder. With decreasing dai collateralization, we might also lower trust in dai itself and hinder the \u201cfinal product\u201d.  Otherwise, with small DC the vault would likely be viable, but we would need to charge less than the risk premium to remain competitive. I would still recommend against going into low LR direction.
