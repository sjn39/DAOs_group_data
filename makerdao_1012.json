We have created the only decentralized stablecoin to date that has provably survived a vicious bear market. When push comes to shove, just about any player would opt to hold DAI over anything else through a true bear. I know it takes time to do things right. We can\u2019t rush launches on L2 and elsewhere to keep up with every other protocol that takes shortcuts\u2026 but every day we delay that deployment gives other players room to fill the void that was waiting for us. We may have the superior product, but if it\u2019s not available, the demand is filled by others. I\u2019m not sure what the timeline still looks like on those rollouts, but hopefully sooner than later. There is a massive L1 priced-out crowd that is just waiting on us.  I also think we have one of the most promising frameworks for integrating RWA in ways that leave other protocols years behind us. While I can\u2019t claim to fully understand all the nuances of how everything will operate in practice, I\u2019m very optimistic about 6S and what\u2019s been under construction for several years now. I would like to see something material produced from RWF though too for all of our investment in that direction.  I understand that 2018 PTSD is real\u2026 but it\u2019s incredibly disappointing to see everyone just bailing and giving up at a market cycle bottom. Whether any of you want to believe me or not, this is the most massive bear trap in crypto history. Our strongest hands\u2026 who held through BT, one of our most trying times\u2026 are just capitulating at every opportunity\u2026 into zero liquidity\u2026 as if everything that we\u2019ve built and worked on has no promise.  I will say though, and I understand this point has been debated heavily and a decision was made\u2026 we\u2019re going for \u201cAggressive Growth.\u201d It\u2019s a valid model\u2026 but is it the model that many of our longest holders and supporters signed up for? Maybe the burn was not efficient. Maybe it could have been optimized, maybe it could have been reduced, phased out, or something\u2026 but it was the revenue distribution model we had. We took it away at a market cycle bottom, and replaced it with\u2026 nothing concrete\u2026 a promise to develop something later. As an investor\u2026 I, and I\u2019m sure many others who were happy with what was in place before feel rugged in a sense. I\u2019m told \u201cthe burn doesn\u2019t work\u201d\u2026 that it had no effect on price. I don\u2019t believe it was meant to have a very visible effect at all times. An infinitesimal burn over time would have returned value over the course of years. We all have long time horizons. But maybe it didn\u2019t work at visibly raising the price and returning value\u2026 it DID work for retaining holders. During liquidity crunches, I, and I\u2019m sure many others, became accustomed to seeing MKR perform, or at least maintain price while everything else nuked. It\u2019s the last asset that goes on the chopping block. Now? Market nukes? We nuke harder\u2026 no burn? No reason to hold. This time, maybe it\u2019s MKR that goes to bail out a bad trade.  We can\u2019t retain investors indefinitely without a solid revenue distribution model. I\u2019m not saying we should or shouldn\u2019t restart the burn, but It\u2019s hard to keep up with all the visions. Maybe one will work and will be better\u2026 but leaving everyone in this purgatory does none of us any good. ",

                    "content": "    AstronautThis:  It\u2019s not just MKR - quite a few tokens have the same issue. It\u2019s just the market doing market things. See for example tokens like UNI, SNX and so many more.    image1316\u00d7887 167 KB  \u201cThe whole market is down, not just us!\u201d I have no hate for SNX UNI AAVE and other DeFi 1.0 projects, but afaik they are all structured fundamentally differently from MKR. I\u2019m speaking quite broadly here\u2026 They may all be built well, and have proven to generate consistent revenue for their protocols. But, many/all of them offer token emissions, either as direct incentives, or as a share of revenue. That creates constant sell pressure. Also, while I have nothing but the highest respect for Stani and AAVE, after the rebrand from ETHLend, many holders are still deeply deeply in profit. I do believe for all that AAVE does, it\u2019s actually quite under priced,  but the sell pressure is undeniable. Given the uncertainty of macro conditions, it\u2019s not unreasonable to lock in profits if they exist. Here at MKR, very few of us are in meaningful profit after seven years. If you bought anywhere in 2021 or at the 2017 highs, you are down. If you accumulated the 2018-2020 bear, you are sitting on about 3-4x\u2026 in this space? Especially given the time that\u2019s elapsed\u2026 you didn\u2019t make anything. If you\u2019re selling here, you\u2019re not selling to lock in profits. You\u2019re selling because of fear. Fear of further downside, fear of the \u201cMarco\u201d Boogeyman, fear that our DAO can\u2019t its sh*t together. Fear of reliving 2018 PTSD. These are emotional decisions imo. In the moment, it\u2019s very difficult to not let emotions get the best of you and impact your decision making. No one is immune. \u2014- If you step back and look at what Maker really is\u2026 it\u2019s not some DEX or other generic lending protocol. Maker and DAI are the bedrock of DeFi. It\u2019s cliche\u2026 but, we are the pioneers of discovering how a DAO works in practice, not just on paper. There is no instruction manual for this, and the rest of the space always looks up to us with the highest respect, seeking ways to learn from us in setting up their own DAOs. Is what we\u2019re doing right now the most efficient? No, probably not. It may very well be that corporate hierarchical structures work better\u2026maybe not. What\u2019s important is that we do not just abandon our convictions because times got a little difficult. As much as we argue and quibble on forums and polls\u2026 DAI carries on, maintaining its peg and full solvency. It\u2019s our flagship product, and the whole world is ever grateful to us. This realization came to me on my latest trip to Rio. In LatAm, they don\u2019t just see DAI as a novel fad. They need it, to preserve their wealth, and the fruits of their labor, in societies w/ capital controls, rarely solvent banks, and a rapidly inflating currency\u2026 DAI is a necessity, not a luxury. \u2014- No hate on AAVE or Uni\u2026 but these products not as unique as MKR. There are dozens of DEX\u2019s each with their own pro\u2019s and con\u2019s\u2026 and there are dozens of variations of secondary lending markets like AAVE. Those pose no real existential threat to anyone. MakerDAO? Let\u2019s be careful with capitulating on what we\u201dve worked so hard to build and accumulate for so many years. ",

Sadly the effect of the price we\u2019re seeing now is to be expected since we started to put the credibility of the burn mechanic in play. Allow me to illustrate with the following graph:  MKR ETH burn1323\u00d7622 46.4 KB  It is no wonder that currently MKR is falling similarly to other DeFi coins. That is because at the moment MKR lacks the value proposition it used to have. To an outside investor considering buying MKR he not only has to consider the risk that the protocol will deliver on the promises of growth but also if those promises are ever going to benefit MKR holders rather than other contributors of the protocol. People that used to be passionate about MKR has left us. I personally know people who has lost interest in the protocol and divested their funds from Maker. Anecdotal but indicative. We currently acknowledge the difficulty of getting MKR holders to participate in governance and thus we can conclude that MKR holders in general is not obtaining the token for its utility in governance. I have been an advocate for the burn since I became a delegate. Look into any of the debates on this issue or any vote and you will see where I stand. Killing investor confidence is detrimental to the valuation of any endeavor. It doesn\u2019t help our case that at the same time expenses has increased and we as a community keep voting in favor of initiatives that is very easy to interpret from the outside as insiders rewarding themselves with protocol funds. Our surplus buffer currently sits at 70M which is quite a bit over the 54M Risk claims is necessary at our current collateral levels. I know many wants this to be much bigger, but that is implicitly saying we as a protocol knows better than those that have invested in us how to invest. The vast majority of MKR holders do not work directly for Maker or the CUs and has limited visibility into the work they are producing. They are however watching our numbers and those keep pointing in the wrong direction. Promising riches in the future for investment now requires trust, and I think we\u2019ve done too little to consider the MKR holders trust and interests in the choices we have taken and are now facing the consequences of said choices. We are also in the unfortunate position that it is a lot harder to regain trust than it is to lose it in the first place. Hopefully we can implement changes that will restore confidence and once again make us an attractive token to invest in. ",

I\u2019m fully aware that, to date, burning has been rather inefficient and could\u2026 should be improved upon. Burning was largely symbolic, at least in its current form. Still, it was the promise of a revenue distribution model that many investors, myself included, had based their investment thesis on for MKR. They held fMKR for years patiently while watching other protocols in the space explode in price around them. IMO, because we have sound fundamentals, a passionate, hardworking team,  an awesome community, and a revenue model. Regardless of its actual performance on affecting the MKR price, removing the burn at that exact time, IMO, was as symbolic as the burn itself. II believe many of our supporters, who would have never sold otherwise, were disappointed with the shift in narrative and took the opportunity to leave. Given how thin the liquidity for MKR is, to begin with\u2026 an exodus into an illiquid market would not look pretty\u2026 (and it didn\u2019t! ) Anyway, those are just my opinions. I\u2019d like to believe that the holders that  did remain are not looking to sell any further. They are with us for the long haul.  ",

The direct effect on MKR price from burning would naturally be small as the amounts burned relative to the market cap is small. As such, measuring burning on an off as a discrete event isn\u2019t likely to produce a strong correlation. Though when there is large pullbacks the effect can be quite noticeable as we saw in January. What we instead need to examine is the effect on sentiment. The belief and trust that the value proposition will hold and lead to increased pay-off in the future. Anyone that invests in a start up doesn\u2019t think, or at least should be comfortable with the idea, that payoff isn\u2019t immediate. However, an investor has a reasonable expectation to be paid down the line. Any messing around with the burn mechanic that doesn\u2019t replace it with another value proposition harms that trust. Any discussion of rising the SB (which delays burning) hurts that trust. Any temporary suspensions of the burn mechanic that turns out to be permanent hurts that trust badly. It\u2019s a cumulative effect. To an outsider it doesn\u2019t matter if we have every intention of turning on the burn, because an outsider will have to trust that the community actually will. It also becomes an open question on \u201cwhen\u201d will we actually turn the burn on (or introduce an alternative value proposition). Measuring this sentiment is far more nebulous than tracking a binary burn on/off metric. It needs to consider the wider discussions within the protocol and on other places. ",

However, an investor has a reasonable expectation to be paid down the line.   I am very interested in merging the burn into a broader discussion about capital allocation and how to meet investor expectations for value realization.

Any allocation to returning capital now vs later carries an opportunity cost orders of magnitude greater than just actually the cost of burning.  2048\u00d71163 233 KB  Burning any amount of capital in this stage of sector development would be akin to Amazon starting dividends and buybacks somewhere between 1995 and 1999.

Amazon is an amazing company in their own right, but did benefit from positive winds of online user growth and behavior changes towards e-commerce (you can argue amazon helped accelerate these positive winds with their great products of course!). My point just being that the broad growth of the crypto economy/DeFi might be the principal long term revenue driver for a key DeFi infrastructure piece such as Maker. As long as there is relevant continued market share growth of Maker (and enough cash to pay the bills etc), the long term story of DeFi growth should get you the gross revenue growth desired. Obviously, as with Amazon, it would be wonderful if great Maker products or MetaDAOs could help accelerate this broad market growth. ",

But did their revenue shrink did they start selling less books and items during their growth period for a while?   Amazon took the tortoise  route. Bezos decided early-on that a slow and steady pace to profitability would ultimately win the race. The same slow and steady rabbit vs. tortoise approach has declared DAI as the clear winner in the decentralized stablecoin realm. ",
