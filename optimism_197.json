Tooling. Project description (please explain how your project works): The idea is to build an open source non-custodial wallet for Optimism on iOS - owned by the Optimism community. This creates an easy to use, secure alternative to any commercial wallet. As a basis for development we\u2019re going to use the eazy app (see TestFlight link down below) which is an app I developed that just got released as alpha version. This has the advantage of not having to reinvent the wheel for everything. There will be a few necessary changes to account for the Optimism network though. With new technologies it\u2019s unrealistic to create exact deadlines but the here is an outline of what could be the roadmap: 1st Milestone (the foundation)  Creating/importing a wallet Sending/Receiving Eth Sending/Receiving ERC-20 tokens Gas Management Biometric authentication  First Alpha Release (could be end of October/beginning of November) Further features/milestones depend on third parties\u2019 schedules and the amount of work to integrate.  Direct swapping of tokens in-app (via 0x API References - 0x Documentation) WalletConnect v2 (currently in RC) to connect with any supported dapp (walletconnect.com) On-ramp via credit card or Apple Pay (might not be available until end of the year, as confirmed with wyre)  Note that the dates/months mentioned depend on the start of the project. For now it was assumed to start around the end of August. You might say: Why iOS only? A lot of apps are written in ReactNative for cross-platform distribution - why not use that? Because the mentioned eazy app which will be used as basis is already written in Swift (the native programming language for iOS apps). In my opinion using the native language of any operating system has several advantages which are better security, less dependencies (also improves security) and better support for the individual platform. The only disadvantage being the missing cross platform support. In most cases it\u2019s not as good as most frameworks like to promote though. The often quoted advantage being faster when using cross-platform development I can say from experience turns out to not be true. It\u2019s mostly the same or sometimes even slower because of figuring individual details for the operating system - as the shared code will never be at 100%. Also, just developing one platform first won\u2019t waste too many resources in case it turns out that people won\u2019t want to use an Optimism app. Project links: n/a (Additional) team member info Just a lil bit on my background. I\u2019ve been working in app development for 10+ years. Besides development, I\u2019m also experienced in managing projects and teams. I have worked with various clients from startups to enterprises (janndriessen.com). Beginning of 2021, I started deep diving into blockchains and crypto from a technical point of view by reading lots of books, doing tutorials and joining DAOs. Early on I had the idea that crypto needs to go mobile. Already in an ETHGlobal hackathon last year, I presented such an idea. Furthermore, I just released the alpha version of eazy - an app aiming to make crypto usage easy. I\u2019m a core contributor (in part-time) at Index Coop (indexcoop.com) - where I work on the web app as a Frontend engineer - and a member of Developer DAO. Additional team members will be chosen as needed. I can access a great pool of talented and experienced developers/designers as needed. Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:   testflight.apple.com    Join the eazy - now on Avalanche beta Available on iOS         app.indexcoop.com    Index App | Buy & Sell Our Tokens Use the Index Coop Trading App to buy and sell our sector, leveraged and yield generating tokens      https://claim.developerdao.com Other non web3 projects could be presented on request. Relevant usage metrics: n/a Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Any wallet that supports Optimism. Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes. Optimism native?: Yes. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: End of 2022 / Beginning of 2023. Ecosystem Value Proposition: The future is mobile. Nowadays already mobile usage on the internet is at least 50% if not higher of total users. \u201cAcross the globe, web-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets have evolved into essential tools for communication, information, and entertainment alike.\u201d [2] So inevitably this will come for crypto as well. Optimism solves the scalability issues that were present in the Ethereum ecosystem. A wallet can solve the usability issues that still persist today.   What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Building an open source non-custodial wallet for Optimism on iOS - owned by the Optimism community - would guarantee that there is always an easy to use and secure option for any Optimism user. The project can be stirred into directions detached from interests of company owned wallets focusing on a high quality, fast, secure experience. It can also help to onboard new users to Optimism.   Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Having Optimism in your pocket at the palm of your hands, will make it more accessible to users. A wallet is the interface to the world of Optimism. It will strengthen the brand and trust by daily usage - in a convenient way. Additionally, it could serve as a foundation for further apps on Optimism, just as Uniswap and many other projects helped the crypto space flourish by open-sourcing their apps and code.   Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. Number of OP tokens requested: 88,392 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No. Proposal for token distribution: The tokens will be used solely for the development of the app as it will be easy for Optimism to self-promote/market the app. They could be sold if it serves as a salary to the individual but don\u2019t have to. The additional designers and developers don\u2019t necessarily have to be one person. So this will be the budget for incentivizing people to help work on the project - as for most it will be a side project.     Role USD / month     1st Developer (me) 8,500   2nd Developer 4,000   Designer 4,000    Total 6 * $8,500 + 6 * $4,000 * + 6 * $4,000 = $99,000 At the time of writing this proposal, with a current OP token price of ~$1.12, this equals 88,392 OP.  Remarks  The above proposal is limited to building the foundation of the Optimism iOS wallet Further support, bug fixes, and upgrades are not included but we\u2019ll be happy to contribute further (e.g. based on new proposals) We reserve the right to request more funds if the OP prices go too low and no longer meets the budget requirements   Resources [1] Mobile Web Traffic Stats and Facts in 2022, 20+ Important Mobile Web Traffic Statistics (for 2022) [2] Mobile internet usage worldwide - statistics & facts, Mobile Internet - Statistics & Facts | Statista [3] Mobile vs Desktop Internet Usage, Mobile Vs.

                    "content": "Hi there, First and foremost - great proposal. I think it\u2019s an excellent idea overall and certainly something that the OP community deserves to have and to show to other people too. After reading your proposal, I have a few points that I would like to raise to yourself and the community reading this. I myself am head of mobile engineering at Pillar, and we\u2019ve had a wallet app in both the App Store and Play Store since 2018\u2026 and I can certainly say that we\u2019ve learned some very hard, harsh lessons along the way - from Apple, Google, our community, the law and the ever-changing face of cryptocurrency. I\u2019ve noted some points in detail below. You\u2019re going to need to support both Android and iOS I know, I know. What you wrote above regarding why you should just go iOS only are, on the surface, the same reasons many others would give for supporting just iOS (or Android only for that matter). Any app that has big aspirations like what you\u2019re proposing should, in my opinion, look beyond the idea of just developing for one platform. It\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019re going to need to eventually develop the Android app - and when that time comes, it\u2019s going to be a massive mountain to climb and the mental strain it would cause yourself and developers will make it a grind to even start. I\u2019ve been through this myself personally quite a few times. I would never recommend it. Having to maintain two codebases is a costly use of resources - and that\u2019s just trying to maintain feature parity. Secondly\u2026 Choosing a side sends the wrong message about this app and Optimism This is a big one. The psychology behind \u201cchoosing a side\u201d and the message this projects to the community and others outside of the community will definitely have unintended, lasting side effects. Even though your technical intentions may be innocent and mean well, it will never be seen this way. Today, choosing between iOS and Android is now a deeply personal and emotional choice. You\u2019ll never stop hearing about how you left out a large portion of the market - especially on social media where these sentiments will live forever. The project would be trolled for choosing to live inside the walled garden of Apple\u2019s corporate machine instead of choosing an open source operating system. It will simply be taken personally. This does lasting damage to not just the brand but the good work you would be doing for the project and Optimism. Unless you\u2019ve got an incredible social media and customer support team, expect to never hear the end of it. This pressure will eventually make it through. Consider Flutter or React Native I\u2019ve been through your journey. I started with native on both sides. Then started looking for cross platform solutions. They were all terrible - web based frameworks running in a webview with some bindings here and there. Some better solutions came along which did some native component rendering via transpiling of more popular languages. Fast forward to today and so many frameworks have come and gone. In my view there are only two options:   React Native: de facto standard for iOS and Android - but comes chained to Javascript. This is a problem because Javascript\u2019s loose programming language has brought with it a lack of code hygiene and standards which plague the language and everything built with it to this day. Typescript and Flow help but it\u2019s a hard mindset to change. Uses Node.js as a development environment which can be painful when dealing with large projects with many dependencies (we live in fear of this). A large community and plentiful component ecosystem make this the defacto standard even with the problems.   Flutter: a true viable option. Exports to iOS, Android, web, Windows and macOS. Uses Dart programming language which is strongly typed from the start and maintained by Google with a custom rendering engine (see the demo which can toggle rendering of components between iOS or Material instantly). Everything is a widget, and famously known for being able to \u201ccontrol every pixel\u201d targeting 60fps. The only downside is the package ecosystem isn\u2019t as big as React Native, but the development experience is clean, fast and far, far, far less complicated than React Native. I have recently built a test wallet in Flutter and it is blazing fast.   The app will only ever be as good as the developers coding it This one is obvious, but despite everything I\u2019ve said above, your app will only ever be as good as your developers. The speed and quality of development and this app will come from the knowledge of developers and the team as a whole. I\u2019ve managed many teams, constructed so many pipelines, worked with so many developers who have built React Native apps that feel native. On the other side of that coin - i\u2019ve also worked with Swift / Objective-C developers that have built native apps that feel like the whole thing was running in a webview. Your point about the benefits of using the native language instead of a cross platform framework may be unfounded because no matter what you develop on any gated operating system, you need to use their operating system APIs which are protected by an underlying security model. The OS has the final say in what you can and cannot do, whether you\u2019re building a native app, a website, a Flutter app on iOS or a React Native app on Android. You can\u2019t just walk into your phone\u2019s HSM modules, for example (Titan for Google and Secure Enclave for Apple). I know it sounds like I\u2019ve absolutely ripped this proposal apart, but please don\u2019t see it like that. I\u2019m simply trying to stop you from making the same mistakes I have seen from personal experience and from running a wallet, with around 1000 daily active users, that has been through some hard times as the face of cryptocurrency has changed. I\u2019ve seen and experienced how emotionally driven app users can get, especially when their cryptocurrency is involved. I\u2019ve seen how our (and other popular wallets) social media teams struggle to defend themselves from the hoard. Our customer service teams regularly receive a battering and that is demoralizing to me, let alone the customer service team members. I would love nothing more than an Optimism wallet app to hit the stores - and it\u2019s for this reason alone I\u2019m writing this response. The Optimism community is a strong one and a much loved project. However this proceeds, please think of the long term. Include everyone, not just some. Kio ",
