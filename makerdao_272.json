Specification  Motivation S\u00e9bastien Derivaux has done a great job at creating and bootstrapping the Real World Finance Core Unit over the past year, assembling a team of professionals to work in one of the first ever Maker Core Units, and achieving early success with the onboarding of the New Silver Vault, which is the world\u2019s first Real-World Asset DeFi collateral. Now that we enter a new phase where what\u2019s already been built needs to be scaled up and further decentralized, I am proposing we offboard S\u00e9bastien as the Facilitator and replace him with an Acting Facilitator (MIP following shortly) that can further decentralize the RWA process and prepare it to safely scale into the billions. In my private conversations with S\u00e9bastien he explained that his objective with the RWF Core Unit all along was to bootstrap it to get it to a solid spot, and then pass on the reins so that he can focus on other things in the DAO that are more suitable for his interests and skillset. I know that\u2014should the community agree with this MIP and the subsequent Facilitator onboarding MIP\u2014 there is already at least one opportunity available for S\u00e9bastien in the decentralized workforce, and wherever he goes he will bring his reputation and trust with him, in particular the trust and track record of having built up one of the first ever Core Units from scratch and then orderly transitioned its power in a decentralized fashion. Being able to successfully execute such an orderly transition will be a critical stamp of approval of the entire Core Unit framework, and I would like to personally thank S\u00e9bastien for his professionalism and dedication to MakerDAO and the Core Units.  Core Unit ID RWF-001 ",

                    "content": "Tomorrow ain\u2019t promise to no one. I was informed than an effective controlling interest of MakerDAO will vote for this MIP. In the interest of MakerDAO, and assuming the situation remains the same, I will transition the day to day work of facilitation and mandated actor powers/responsibilities to my probable successor promptly. Maybe deconnecting a bit with MakerDAO could be needed (having visited the forum over 365 consecutive days!). My RWF journey started more than a year ago with RWA triggered by a @equivrel signal request. All without any idea on how to do it. I am grateful to have been joined by @williamr and @philinje. We were the first Core Unit application (another thing I had no idea how to do being the first). Another thing I\u2019m proud of is to have issued monthly reporting since January (maybe the first?) to promote transparency (list of issues at the end of each). On the RWA side, @philinje was instrumental to onboard New Silver. To date, this is the only significant RWA vault, with more than 10M. My whole gratitude to @prankstr25 for his perseverance. FortunaFi (@_nick)  is only getting started and with Pipe under final due diligence at RWF, unlock that and he will most likely scale insanely fast. I expect the others (6S, ConsolFreight, HTC, AEA) to follow as well in time and scale RWA exponentially. @williamr, after working a lot on the first batch, is close to unveiling quite a number of risk assessments!! RWA did also bring a lot of legal work. Another thing I had no idea nor interest to do but had to be done. I will always be thankful to @christiancdpetersen that was quite patient and our counsels Ogier, Shearman & Sterling and Latham & Watkins. They all changed my view of the legal profession. The memo on comparison of legal structures will inform the Foundation vs Trust debate for years to come  . While not complete yet, the RWA Foundation and its siblings will be key components in the legal web of MakerDAO and probably DAOs. Can\u2019t wait for community members to issue a MIP58 DAO Resolution asking the directors to host a Maker party in George Town (but please don\u2019t do that). When @jameskmccall is not analyzing farmlands, he is innovating on legal DAOs. With the recent addition of @teej and @Eumenes  , I can only imagine what is to come for RWA. The level of discussion in our weekly meetings is insanely productive and allowed to formalize a new RWA strategy. @williamr  will be able to start with a full team and I have no doubt that they will achieve. While not finished (just the communication is missing really), I\u2019m still bullish on the RWA Committee. I lost count of the version we are at, but this is important work. The last meeting was pure productivity. This is due to @flipflopflapdelegate  and @prose11 putting a lot of effort into it so RWF could avoid interfering.  Shoutout to @planet_x for pissing me  every week saying \u201cthis will not scale\u201d, then asking \u201cwen ETF?\u201d, this enabled progress on the ETF front. Thanks, @omahalawyer for being constructive yet exigent, @ultraschuppi for stability, @PaperImperium to keep everyone in check and @Porter_Smith to accept to bring A16Z to the table lately. This is decentralization of RWA at work. Obviously, the future of RWA is on-chain and Centrifuge (@spin , Martin , @_LS, Colin, Jeannice, Jeroen, \u2026 ) started to work with MakerDAO way long before me. Can\u2019t wait to see what SG-Forge (@SylvFromSG-Forge  ), REINNO, Untangled have in the chest. We need more of those innovative spirits. The financial analysis & planning part was less on the spotlight, but nothing to be shy of with the dashboard, monthly reports, the financials statements, the budget, the valuation model. @Aes will continue to push MakerDAO FP&A to the next level. The main SQL query is now 534 lines of code, have fun maintaining it until DIN CU can take care of it  Dear to my heart was the research part (PhD for life). Crypto-banking 101, a comprehensive stablecoin liquidity analaysis and a proposal to fix the par value of stablecoin which led to a signal request to set PSM fees to 0%. This is already making decentralized stablecoins think of using DAI as an anchor point. I will focus on important theoretical finance work that is long overdue until the end of this MIP. I worked with values like scientific governance, decentralization and transparency in high esteem. DAO is still an early concept and what is played at MakerDAO is an awesome social experiment where every member of the community plays a part. You are all shaping the future. Every time you act, you decide the culture and values of MakerDAO. I hope those values will continue to resonate with MakerDAO. Thanks to everyone for this incredible journey you offered me and I wish much success for the RWF and MakerDAO as a whole. ",

Facilitator is leaving voluntarily  This happened a few times with people that were working in the Foundation. We don\u2019t vote on these, because the person involved has already made the decision to leave (and you can\u2019t force someone to stay via vote.) The expectation here is that the author is the facilitator in question (or a member of GovAlpha doing it after they\u2019ve left.)  Facilitator is not leaving voluntarily  This hasn\u2019t happened so far. This requires a vote. The expectation here is that the author is not the facilitator in question. There is some expectation that some evidence or reasoning is provided to explain why it is desirable to remove the facilitator in question.   This particular proposal blurs these lines somewhat, hence the community\u2019s questions. So far it has not been clear given what has been posted on this thread whether this is voluntary or not. In order to proceed correctly, we need some clarity from the parties involved. Edit This will be voted on (assuming it is formally submitted) based on @SebVentures comments above. ",

                    "content": "Hello MakerDao. I\u2019m Ashleigh, I used to work very closely with Rune, Greg, Equivrel, and many of the parties involved in the current debate. I was one of the earliest non technical employees of Makerdao and was responsible for overseeing the adoption of single collateral Dai. I am re-entering the chat because I see an alarming pattern emerging. To explain the nature of the alarm, you\u2019ll need some context. In the early days of Maker, the idea was that we could create an alternative system that was governed by different rules than the financial system we all grew up in: more decentralized, more free, more malleable, more honest. We all believed in this vision. Rune was the spearhead, but he had a lot of help. His ideas were put into code by some of the most brilliant minds building in the smart contract space at the time, namely Dapphub. The understanding was that it was a flat hierarchy\u2013that we were out to build something that wouldn\u2019t be controlled by any one entity, that would be stateless. The project had kind of a renegade culture. In 2018, something changed. Rune began to feel that he needed to take control of the project. A little more backstory: This wasn\u2019t unfamiliar to anyone involved in the project at this point. In the previous couple of years, there had been lots of ups and downs. At one point in 2016-2017 , Rune actually disappeared from the project for 6+ months with no word. When he came back, he came back with a \u201cvision\u201d, demanding more MKR as payment for his role in rejoining the project he had started. I won\u2019t go into the details of that particular situation now because they aren\u2019t relevant here, but suffice to say, a pattern has emerged. In 2018, Rune began to feel that the weight of regulation was weighing on MakerDao heavily and he began to fear massive retribution from sovereign global governments. As such, he began to make some changes. He hired expensive lawyers and got the Dao to agree to put the Dev Fund into a Cayman foundation. This was for our protection, he said. He set up a dummy board made up of OG Maker devs and contributors (plus a few more recent hires of his own) and we moved the funds to the entity. His aim was to create a Holding Company which would be centralized and run all of Maker\u2019s development interests and side businesses. His goal was to start earning revenue via these side businesses. He was never very clear on how the dev funds would be spent or how reporting would work to MKR holders. He made a big speech where he said that you could either take the red pill and be against him, or take the blue pill and go with the flow of progress. Several of us protested, but things moved ahead. A few months later, several people at Maker (myself and several of the board members and dapphub) realized the extent of what had happened and sought a compromise. We had a group chat that was jokingly titled \u201cPurple Pill\u201d, our goal being to create a compromise between Rune\u2019s red pill and his blue pill. Our thinking was that the current state of MakerDao wasn\u2019t what we had signed up for, but in a DAO there should be room for different ways of approaching a problem. We proposed that Rune keep on with his Holding Company, but that a certain piece of the Dev Fund be carved out that would be controlled by governance and be able to fund different teams who wanted to work on Maker but who weren\u2019t a part of  the Holding Company. We finished our presentation on Tuesday or Wednesday in mid march 2019. I scheduled a meeting with Rune for the following Monday, and his assistant sent me a calendar item. Thursday, someone in the planning chat for this meeting told him the nature of the chat, and by Friday half of the board (who were all long term, deeply caring, deeply invested individuals in this project) had been fired. Rune had created a board wherein he had unilateral firing control over all of the board, unbeknownst to the people who sat on that board. Weird, right? A few weeks later, I was also fired. There was massive turmoil at the project at this point and everyone was left feeling pretty discouraged. In the years since, Rune has taken a step back. In that time, a new MakerDao bureaucracy has emerged. Rich and Amy Jung helped shepherd MakerDao into the future, moving the Dev Fund under the control of governance (to the immense satisfaction of the \u201cpurple-pillers\u201d). Most of the foundation has moved on. Some people have even told me how they selflessly worked without pay for months as the project transitioned from a company with entities that could issue paychecks to a foundation controlled by governance. I was so proud when I saw that MakerDao had finally reached the final form we imagined for it. Now, everything is back to square 1. Rune is back to his old tricks. In this case he is trying to fire someone (via governance, which is so machiavellian that I would need an entire new post to comment fully), who has, by all accounts, done a great job. Multiple sources who have been deeply involved in Maker governance over the last few years have said that Seb is doing a great job. Rune has also said in various conversations which have been relayed to me that he wants Seb gone for any of the following reasons (of course edited depending who he is talking to): 1) Rune doesn\u2019t trust Seb 2) Seb is not proficient in risk assessment 3) Seb does not care about \u201cclean assets\u201d vs. other types of Real World Assets (RWA). I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the company owned by Greg and Joe which I believe Rune is an investor in. They have previously tried to insist on middle man payments to their entity in exchange for being listed as a RWA on makerdao, but I will relegate this to a side note now***(below). Rune has delegated 47,000 MKR to various parties, all of whom he has a close relationship with and who are, presumably, taking orders. I deduce that he has a close relationship with them because he literally told me about some of these people when we had a friendly catch up chat to clear the air a couple weeks ago and he mentioned several of the delegates by name (e.g. planetx) . Rune has been away for a long period, and in that time he has decided that we are at war again. This time, the battle is partially about regulators and partially about the future of the planet. Rune thinks the two things are related. He thinks we are in a climate crisis (no argument there), but he also thinks that the future of crypto is somehow dependent on our being a part of the fight for the climate, and if we can do that, we will somehow be in the good graces of governments and regulators the world over. I actually think Rune is right in many respects. Crypto has the potential to fund global, regional and local climate initiatives at a scale that could never be accomplished by the traditional financial industry. Its investors are risk takers, free thinkers, anti-establishment weirdos who have the potential to save the world. If we can live up to his vision and take this mission under our mantle, it would be a beautiful thing to behold and also be a singular victory both for the planet and for those of us who want the planet to be governed by non-state financial regimes. That said, his approach is, as usual, one of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Rune has the benefit of coming back to a much more nimble MakerDao. Given that he is the founder, he would have a lot of natural support behind him. He could have come in with his Clean proposal and created a whole new governance segment which creates new teams who are experts in the type of green energy funding he is proposing, that have experience pricing the type of risk he is assuring everyone should be the cornerstone of Maker collateral, thereby adding something new to the future of the protocol, and allowing what has been going well to flourish. Instead his strategy has been to go to war. I think in his mind that means he MUST take control of the protocol again. At this point I am not even debating the merits of who should or shouldn\u2019t be in control. What I am debating, and strongly censuring, is the idea that one man should be in control of such a protocol. Rune was running a travel program for danish people to come to asia and learn languages before he got into crypto and came up with the idea for makerdao. He had the energy to direct people, and Nikolai, another early founder who is rarely spoken about these days, had a lot of the economic ideas. They were lucky enough to meet some developers who made their vision a reality. And we, as a community, are also lucky. Because Dai is great. But as we should all know from looking at the dollar, the euro, or the venezuela bolivar, sovereign money is only as good as the people who rule it. Dai is in danger of becoming defacto sovereign money. Not sovereign in the sense of the state, a worse kind of sovereignty: the sovereignty of a dictator. The problem is that Rune is making a mockery of everything that has been accomplished by token governance over the last 24 months. Great strides have been made, and a fairly competent bureaucracy has been established. We need to abide by these norms in order to continue the future of the protocol. A clear leader won\u2019t always be available, and the ability of the many to govern such a specific function has actually been fantastic to witness and something that all other governable protocols have learned from. At this point, there are two questions we should be asking ourselves: 1) How do we make sure that we are doing what\u2019s best for the Maker protocol and not just blindly following what Rune wants? And 2) How do we build systems that are more resilient to these types of things in the future?  will take some time. 1) only requires that everyone reads up, and votes accordingly.  Some other questions everyone should be asking themselves:   Is Rune qualified to control this protocol? Does he have a background in pricing risk on volatile real world assets, clean or otherwise? (answer: no)   Why does he prefer to work with Will instead of Seb?   Is there anyone who is benefiting financially from his proposed changes?   My proposal:   Keep the bureaucracy that the foundation has created as is. It isn\u2019t perfect, but in this case the process of reaching a governance of the majority is more important than the question of whether the system is perfect, which is a luxury we will not continue to enjoy as DAI scales. Right now we can afford to make governance mistakes. We should make them until we hone in on the right way to do this.   Request that Rune create a separate campaign for his goals. They can be separate and still just as effective. But his taking control in this manner right now is undermining token governance not just for his own protocol, but for all token governance protocols. It is hard to get people involved in governance. What motive do they have to put their time into it if they know that the distant founder will just come in at some point and obviate the need for all of their prior work by redirecting all resources to his own priorities?   ***This is a side note, but it is interesting, Rune has long been in partnership with Greg Diprisco and Joe Quintillian of Distributed Capital. They were both part of a tradfi trading shop that made some money and invested heavily in crypto in the early days. They approached makerdao as a VC, but ended up taking control of several parts of the operations of the company despite having little to no experience running or supporting an innovative technology company. Greg gave himself the title of \u201cHead of Business Development\u201d and proceeded to hire people to develop business on his behalf, despite never having closed a significant deal on his own. Joe never gave himself such lofty titles, preferring to stay in the background. That said, he managed to siphon significant funds from the Maker Dev fund to build Oasis, which he and Greg both own equity in despite the fact that Rune explicitly promised everyone at the project that there would be no equity given out in various entities at the time of Holding Company creation. I would like to note here that they are currently building an ATS which is partially borne out of the creation of maker Developers but for which MKR holders are in no way the beneficial owners. I believe this company was also intended to be a \u201crisk assessor\u201d (read: middle man) for various real world asset platforms that wanted to onboard into the maker ecosystem. Interestingly, from what I have heard, Greg and Joe were perfectly happy with the state of progress as it related to Real World Assets (RWA) being brought onto the platform until they realized they would not be able to charge a middleman fee. It seems they have now begun to wage war, behind closed doors of course, against any such programs which are not amenable to their management fee. This is conjecture based off of things I have heard and seen, so obviously DYOR. ",

                    "content": "Uhh\u2026 wow\u2026 Great times\u2026 -_- Okay, so I guess the best way to respond to this to first \u201cdisclose my interests\u201d. Let me be clear, the only way I benefit from this project is that I hold a large amount of MKR. I am not getting paid anything, my only motivation is to try to benefit MKR holders, of which I am one. I am also considering an investment in a project that could qualify as an \u201carranger\u201d under the arranger framework I proposed, and obviously, should the arranger framework be adopted and should the investment go through, then in that specific case I would have a conflict of interest and should not participate in governance decisions related to that arranger without it being very clear that I have a specific incentive and potential bias (in general I have no desire to be involved in any kind of day to day governance decisions about specific RWA pipelines or deals, however). I am considering that investment because I think the company is extremely qualified to source great quality collateral for Maker, and I want to help it get off the ground. Ultimately my MKR holdings are so significant that the main benefit I would get from this would come through the positive impact to Maker, rather than whatever small investment I might end up doing. Of course I would also refrain from doing this if it\u2019s deemed unacceptable to the community to have MKR holders invest in arrangers, but on the contrary I would imagine that many MKR holders would like the opportunity themselves to make investments in the many different arrangers that already exist, and would emerge, if the framework - or a variant of it - is adopted I believe the best approach is to track who have invested in them so that we can ensure that there is broad representation and not specific segments of the community that benefit disproportionately. In practice this could be done by giving worse risk parameters to arrangers that have owner structures that are similar to other existing arrangers, which is natural since it creates less diversification and potentially more risk. Regardless, this has nothing to do with the decision to propose the offboarding of Seb, as Ashleigh herself mentioned there\u2019s no reason why Seb being a faciliator should prevent other structures from emerging, so if this was some plot so that I could earn a bit of money from doing a small investment in an arranger, it\u2019s completely illogical that my next move would then be to try to offboard Seb. And one other thing to make clear, practically all of the MKR I own was from a seed investment of 29000 ETH that funded the project in its first year. I have not made a particularly impressive return on that investment in ETH terms, while I have taken on a crazy amount of financial, legal and personal risk, and worked full time almost 6 years and then also been haunted by this kind of over the top drama and conspiracy theories. At this point, I\u2019m done with spending all my energy on Maker while being shit on when I have other projects to work on and I would much rather spend time with my kids. But the reality is, Maker governance is not doing so great, there are barely any active MKR holders at all and the Core Units basically have free rein. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve had to step in and be active again, because as it stands right now I would not be comfortable just leaving and holding on to my MKR - there is far too much uncertainty. I only have the ability to act through the existing defined rules of governance. It\u2019s not like I have some sort of special privilege. In this case I\u2019m simply making a governance proposal which is something that\u2019s available for anyone to do. It\u2019s not like I can just push anything through, just look at the Sagittarius Engine - it was rejected by the community and isn\u2019t happening, I\u2019m now trying to design something better that hopefully will be more interesting for the community (completely for free, just like everything else I\u2019m doing). At this point I owe this project nothing and I have every right to just sell my MKR and leave, but I choose to try to turn things around and make MKR an asset that I am comfortable holding without having to lose sleep over how things are developing. I am willing to stay involved for another year to try to put in place the clean money vision and the decentralized workforce framework (I briefly explained it on a recent governance call), and then beyond that I am going to pull out and stop being active in \u201cdeep governance\u201d other than passively delegating and potentially using my public platform to promote the project and the important role it can play in mitigating the climate catastrophe. But if something as simple as offboarding a facilitator has to devolve into absurd drama, then I am just gonna gtfo. There\u2019s no reason why I should have to deal with this kind of madness. And to be clear, I already stated the entirety of my interests in the beginning of this post. Hopefully this is already obvious but all the claims and accusations Ashleigh made are lies or heavily distorted facts, and obviously the entire narrative is extremely biased and one sided. It\u2019s funny how Ashleigh is accusing me of \u201cgoing to war\u201d, and then explodes with a tornado of libel because I dared to make a governance proposal. Alright, so why do I believe we should offboard Seb? Before I get into my reasons I\u2019ll provide some context for why I approached this the way I did. Before posting this proposal, I had a private conversation with Seb, and in that conversation he made it clear to me that his objective had always been to leave the RWA core unit and do something else that better suits his skills. I think that is a really admirable and for that reason I decided to try to not get into the details of why I thought we should remove him, to minimize the likelihood that the ensuing drama would impact his reputation and ability to get a job elsewhere in the ecosystem. At this point I have no choice though, as this is itself becoming a conspiracy theory so in an effort to try to not cause brain damage to the DAO I\u2019ll have to share the facts that make me believe that Seb is not a good fit to be a facilitator of the RWA CU. Honestly I\u2019m pretty sad about this, I wish there was a way to avoid facilitator politics ending up with this kind of personal stuff that then becomes public record. If we aren\u2019t able to be professional about this we will fail because nobody in their right mind would want to be a facilitator. First of all, Seb does not have the necessary level of experience doing financial transactions compared to someone like Will who is actually an experienced professional. This is a problem for counterparties because they expect to be dealing with a professional. This alone should really be enough to replace a Facilitator. The main reason why I want Seb to leave as Facilitator is because I believe he has engaged in what I call private entanglement by doing things such as having personally signed contracts with collateral counterparties that give him special legal rights and proposing legal structures to the DAO from his platform as Facilitator where he personally controls the relationship with the lawyers. I won\u2019t go into more details of this as I really hope we can still avoid this going full court of public opinion, but there\u2019s been enough of this that I think the only option is for Seb to leave. This pattern of behaviour is, in my opinion, extremely dangerous in a DAO, as it builds up personal leverage over time. My impression is that Seb simply doesn\u2019t see it that way and doesn\u2019t consider this kind of personal leverage a big problem. Since he intended to step down anyway it may be true in his specific case. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is an incredibly bad precedent to set. It\u2019s simple from the perspective of an MKR holder, if a Facilitator gets enough personal leverage through private entanglement you lose the ability to fire them because they can retaliate in unpredictable ways, and they may even gain the ability to extort the DAO for ever increasing budgets. The whole point of a DAO completely disappears if the base layer of control is by private individuals using personal leverage. I also believe he should not have supported the centrifuge deals that have gotten through, as their legal structure is extremely risky. New Silver made sense, as it was the first ever RWA deal, and whatever debt we incurred that has to be paid by restructuring it later is justifiable. But then following up with the other deals without fixing their structures I think is was a big mistake that is hard to explain. My impression is that Seb simply has a different attitude towards risk that what I, and I assume other MKR holders, expects from a facilitator. The facilitator should be the one slowing things down and looking out for the worst case scenarios, and then other actors in the ecosystem should be the ones pushing to take risks. None of this means that I think Seb is bad for the Maker community or couldn\u2019t play an important role elsewhere, in fact I love how he engages in governance and on this forum as a person, I think he is one of the most dynamic characters in the whole community that is able to provide useful input on many subjects. I just think he is not a good fit specifically for the Facilitator role. ",

Greg has been a phenomenal leader for the BD team, and everyone who worked with him can attest to this except for Ashleigh of course. Greg has participated in almost all of the largest deals everyone in the Maker and Dai community has been able to benefit from. DM me if you want a list  He helped us with all the resources we needed to make Dai the succes it is today. All the integrations and major deals have been a direct outcome of how he handled the team. Leading one of the most succesful BD and growth teams in the industry. To come in with slander like this is just pathetic, and I have no idea what motivation Ashleigh has to do so. Everyone who was part of the team back then knows that it is all just lies. ",

I have no interest in engaging further. If you don\u2019t believe me, so be it.  I was one of the earliest non technical employees of Makerdao and was responsible for overseeing the adoption of single collateral Dai.  No you weren\u2019t. I hired you after well after other non-technical roles (including mine, obviously) had been onboarded.  We all believed in this vision.  Other people believed in his vision, you weren\u2019t there.  We had a group chat that was jokingly titled \u201cPurple Pill\u201d  This just really doesn\u2019t need to be talked about ever again.  I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the company owned by Greg and Joe which I believe Rune is an investor in.  Rune is not an investor in RWA Company LLC nor any other business in which I am an investor/owner, nor is his investment in any of these businesses being contemplated.  They have previously tried to insist on middle man payments to their entity in exchange for being listed as a RWA on makerdao, but I will relegate this to a side note now***(below).  Our services and business model (which may have to change given the changes being proposed to the RWF vertical in Maker) are laid out pretty clearly on our website. Is there a solution to onboarding RWA that doesn\u2019t have operating expenses?  Greg gave himself the title of \u201cHead of Business Development\u201d and proceeded to hire people to develop business on his behalf, despite never having closed a significant deal on his own.  Matt (the former COO) invented the title, if I recall. I was hired to do a job and I think the results were pretty good looking back on it. We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on what one would constitute as \u201csignificant.\u201d  I believe this company was also intended to be a \u201crisk assessor\u201d (read: middle man) for various real world asset platforms that wanted to onboard into the maker ecosystem.  Nope.  Interestingly, from what I have heard, Greg and Joe were perfectly happy with the state of progress as it related to Real World Assets (RWA) being brought onto the platform until they realized they would not be able to charge a middleman fee.  You have got to be kidding me. Some exhibits of my public discontent with the way things have been run, in no particular order\u2026  [P1-DROP] MIP6 Application: Peoples Company DROP: US Agricultural Real Estate - #24 by g_dip Real-World Assets - Report - 2021-05 - #12 by g_dip [Signal Request] Raise SF On RWA When Issuers Unilaterally Change Terms - #24 by g_dip A Framework for Real-World Assets - #15 by g_dip Some comments on the state of the DAO Real-World Finance Core Unit Report - 2021-06 - #13 by g_dip   It seems they have now begun to wage war, behind closed doors of course, against any such programs which are not amenable to their management fee.  This is really just absurd. We were as surprised as everyone else by the recent proposed changes to the RWA process, we might have to pivot our entire business model to remain competitive. I suppose I could have started slinging mud in the forums about stuff I\u2019m still pissed off about from 2019, but the changes seem to be going in a positive direction and at the end of the day we want what\u2019s best for MakerDAO.  This is conjecture based off of things I have heard and seen, so obviously DYOR.  Conjecture + lies + posting in public = slander. Not to mention this has absolutely nothing to do with the subject of your post, and I have nothing to do with whatever is going on right now. This is clearly an attempt to get back at me for some fictitious slight you believe happened years ago. I literally have not spoken to you once since you left the Foundation and have never interfered with your success thereafter, let\u2019s just move on? Also\u2026  This is the first time ashleigh_schap has posted \u2014 let\u2019s welcome them to our community!  Welcome! ",

I don\u2019t know if this is relevant, but for the community who may not know the people mentioned in the previous post, I feel it\u2019s important to talk with facts and avoid judging based on what we hear or read. Greg was not just Head of Business Development, he was and still is someone who is constantly helping Maker to growth, in each of its stages. He helped us (me and the others that were part of the BD team) to structure the most complex deals, and, at the same time, he was thinking about how to scale with RWA. @ashleigh_schap , you probably wrote that post based on your experience, which I find surprising, because Greg developed the SAI-DAI growth strategy from scratch, he also planned on how to increase Dai demand without the dependency of the DeFi farming, alternatives on how to stabilize the peg, and explain to the community why that was relevant, during black Thursday -!!!- he was pointing the direction on how the BD team through the network we have, could help the protocol in those hard times\u2026 Regarding Rune\u2019s direction, I\u2019m happy to see someone proposing one direction! Now it\u2019s time for the community to vote and decide if that\u2019s what we want. I invite you to help us to improve Maker. Writing rumors doesn\u2019t help.

                    "content": "Leaving aside the drama, I\u2019d like to address Rune\u2019s main points about Seb\u2019s role as a facilitator, which is after all the main point of this post. Having worked with Seb and Will from the early days of what became the RWF, I can offer my opinion of Seb\u2019s competency in his role. Yes, he is perhaps a little unconventional, in the sense that he combines a very traditional and professional demeanor with a certain degree of gumption, which is very necessary in order to create a new model of finance. I believe the RWA initiative could not have succeeded without him. His perception of risk is keen and astute, encompassing both minute details and the big picture, and he has an amazing instinct for balancing different kinds of risk. His unique blend of skills and awareness have been essential in making the progress we have made. And more specifically, the critique of personal entanglement is, in my opinion, misguided. Seb took on personal risk in order to make progress when there was no alternative. In order to hire a law firm, after spending a year first asking the Foundation for legal support and then asking how the DAO can get legal counsel, he searched tirelessly for the best legal counsel he could find and made an enormous effort to get competent lawyers to help - the issue being there was no legal entity that could engage legal counsel on behalf of the DAO. He therefore had to engage law firms via his own company. This is related to the point that Seb allowed the second phase of Centrifuge deals to proceed. After New Silver waited for a year to be onboarded, the next group of asset originators had waited nearly that long in some cases and while Seb tenaciously figured out a way to engage legal counsel, Centrifuge agreed to upgrade their legal structure which ultimately depended on having legal counsel representing the DAO if only in a \u201cvirtual\u201d way. To mitigate the risk of having no legal recourse with Centrifuge assets, he insisted the asset originators have co-investors alongside Maker and took a tiny investment position himself, once again in order to protect Maker\u2019s interests. The point of this investment was to be treated as any other investors of the asset originator, in terms of being notified of any changes in terms, and more importantly, allowing Maker to benefit from the legal recourse taken by those investors in the worst case. There was simply no other way to enforce Maker\u2019s position in the real world, and Seb had the foresight to see a way to mitigate that risk. Therefore, it seems quite unjustified and unfair that he would be criticized for doing things that somehow are being construed as personal actions, when in fact he steered the best possible course for Maker while getting real world assets launched. This does not even account for the fact that he and Christian have made a huge effort to research and identify the best possible real world structure for Maker to conduct the activities of the RWF core unit, including the ability to engage legal counsel in a more direct way. This structure was ready to be launched, and now this interpretation of his actions, which sounds much like criticisms coming from others who were not so keenly aware of the early course of events, has caused a highly competent leader and facilitator to leave the ship. Tragic and unfair, and a true loss for Maker. I had no relationship with Seb before I joined his team. But I will defend him and his actions to the end. ",

Rune created the project, assembled a team and has been as conscious about governance as possible at least publicly. Further, Rune\u2019s concern about the environment is REAL and this may be a big factor in institutional adoption of crypto as we say Tesla defer payment acceptance of Bitcoin citing environmental reasons, it is obvious other institutions might cite similar concerns and Rune\u2019s approach is pragmatic as it is early (many big projects are ignoring this issue, but MKR is at least talking about it). From working in crypto projects myself, I know that the transition from after a presale and gathering ETH to being able to make bank account payments to team members, pay marketing people etc, creating a corporation is very common, but you make it sound so alien and scary, it makes me doubt your own involvement in the nitty gritty if projects (isn\u2019t one of your own projects, Liquity protocol a few billions in market cap? ). Unfortunately Ashleigh, I am doubting your intentions of this post as malicious and remember it is very easy to throw stone at a glass house but very difficult to build it back.

Neither did you engage in any kind of constructive discussion at the time or proposed solutions (meaning not just laying out your grand vision). Neither publicly nor privately. You might have plenty of reasons not to be involved earlier. It is also your right to come here and try to undo what the other MKR holders have done without caring about the reasons it was done. But maybe you should have a discussion with Maker Governance. Again, a discussion is something both ways. To be precise, I said I wanted to stop doing RWA. RWF is not RWA. From my last budget:  It should be expected that new CUs will emerge from the RWF CU on RWA and finance topics.  I called for other people to do RWA CUs many times. Sounds like no one wanted to do it. I can only understand, I would not do it again (was a great experience still). The game is rigged, but you cannot lose if you do not play. It should have been easier with time (more institutional deals) but you are increasing the difficulty by influencing risk assessment (feel free to answer my comments). Anyway, thanks for giving me the opportunity to move on. PS: Just to highlight that @williamr is not taking the interim role of living target, I misinterpreted based on @rune onboarding text.

I barely know Rune and I don\u2019t have a close relationship with him   I know very little about the specific issue with Seb but wanted to comment regarding delegation. In my view, this kind of relationship is supposed to happen and is a good thing. Large delegators have a right to ask their delegates to vote a certain way and delegates should indeed take that into account. Delegation makes it easier to vote but with or without it, the larger MKR holders have power to swing decisions their way. I\u2019m all for delegates having their own thoughts but if it conflicts with their delegator\u2019s wishes, the delegator is simply going to undelegate and vote directly. ",

Most of us (me included) are not qualified to debate what RWA structure is best for the DAO (my understanding is that there are at least two competing visions as to how to implement the legal structuring around RWAs so that it is safe for the DAO). Similarly I do not expect most MKR voters to fully appreciate the intricate details of different Rollup architectures and the technical risks associated with them. Many of you would love PE to enable DAI minting on sidechains such as Polygon. We are opposing this because we strongly feel that this is risky and insecure, whereas minting DAI on Rollups (both Optimistic and ZK) is not only possible, but recommended for future scaling. But if MKR holders feel otherwise, I would take it as a vote of non-confidence for my work and my research, and I will then have no choice but to step down. At the end of the day we all work for the DAO. Peace. ",

It\u2019s a plutocracy.  If any contributor wants to work for a democracy, there are several Nation-States hiring.    @Rune is a big MKR holder. Lots of skin in the game. How this is news to anyone is beyond me. Any contributor should \u201crespect and fear\u201d any MKR holder. They\u2019re the ones with skin in the game. A working process that removes a person (or a component) should not be viewed as a bad thing.  I like @SebVentures on a personal note and think he\u2019s done a lot of things for Maker (he could still contribute, in my opinion) more importantly: we should expect MKR holders to have a system or process to change things.   Anyone can propose a Maker Improvement Proposal.   Feedback in a DAO  Giving feedback in a DAO is extremely hard.  There is no anonymity (some people create burners/socket-puppets) There is a disconnect (at least some) between the forum and the on-chain polls There is a lot of noise and \u201cdrama\u201d People tend to listen more to positive feedback than negative feedback   The process proposed by @SebVentures received at least some feedback  Loudest voices (that I remember) were @g_dip and @PaperImperium  I\u2019m not sure if the feedback was dismissed, but I don\u2019t remember it being well-received I might be wrong about that last point, but my point is that there was at least \u201csome conversation\u201d     Feedback in general  I\u2019ve seen over and over again Core Units / to-be Core Units minimizing the feedback received and being surprised with particular outcomes of the MKR holders. Usually, instead of taking the feedback, the comments are flagged as bullying/flaming/disrespectful. Advice to anyone in any DAO: when the immune system kicks in, listen (this is not that easy because of the noise). Contributors / Core Units should be proactive in getting alignment from the Delegates / MKR holders / Governance (talk to your Facilitator if this is not happening).   RWA / RWF and SES  Following @bartek\u2019s suit, I\u2019m not well-versed in RWA to pass judgement or contribute directly. However, we believe that RWA is crutial for Maker\u2019s 100x  I tried kick-starting a A Framework for Real-World Assets without much traction  @SES-Core-Unit funded SES Project Real-World Sandbox by @luca_pro (in progress) We\u2019re analyzing the possibility of incubating RWF\u2019s Core Units We\u2019re analyzing the possibility of incubating a RWF Incubator Core Unit    ",

                    "content": "Ignoring the commentary so far, I\u2019d like to comment on a few things that made this situation worse than it needed to be, with the hope that we can avoid them in the future. Multiple people now have messaged me because they\u2019re concerned about how this played out, community members, core unit members, core unit facilitators, etc. I have also spoken to both @Rune and @SebVentures separately.   The proposal was too ambiguous, and written in a way that was certain to invite questions. People expect voluntary offboarding to be written by the individual in question. Rune\u2019s proposal blurs too many lines and doesn\u2019t fit into peoples expectations of this process.  It references speaking to Seb in a positive way, but does not claim that this was voluntary (because it wasn\u2019t.) It thanks Seb for his professionalism and references an orderly transition implying the inverse correlation (rocking the boat means Seb is unprofessional.) The reference to private conversations also creates this ambiguity and unease.    The proposal was posted at the same time as the proposal onboarding Will Remor (also posted by Rune.)  This further impacts ambiguity above. This makes it look way more like the author has arranged to have the individual replaced (which is accurate.) The fact that this other proposal was not posted by Will Remor further aggravates this issue, as once again, it does not meet peoples expectations for onboarding facilitators.    SebVentures initial response was also kind of ambiguous, this futher added to the confusion, though I do appreciate that Seb could have reacted much, much worse in this situation.  It again muddied the waters between voluntary/involuntary as Seb (understandably) reacted as if this was a done deal and essentially \u2018made his goodbyes.\u2019 It also signals that he is nontheless unhappy with the situation.    Other random point\u2026  Posting this on Saturday was mildly annoying. There is no reason it couldn\u2019t have waited until Monday when people were around to react. It\u2019s a minor point, but it means that for many people it\u2019s something that happened while they weren\u2019t around.    To conclude, this is basically the worst of both worlds (transparent and behind-closed-doors) because it\u2019s clear that behind-closed-doors things went on due to the nature of the proposals and the manner of their being made public, but none of the reasoning was made transparent, leaving everyone confused and concerned. I appreciate Rune and SebVentures attempts to avoid airing dirty laundry, but seriously, it is possible to communicate reasons-to-offboard without it being hugely dramatic or controversial, especially when combined with appreciation for all of the work done so far. I think that if the reasons from Rune\u2019s second post had been present in the initial proposal in addition to the positive sentiment, much of the ambiguity and drama could have been avoided. People would have been able to react to the proposal itself, rather than reacting to the ambiguity.     juan:  Any contributor should \u201crespect and fear\u201d any MKR holder. They\u2019re the ones with skin in the game.   This also badly needs addressing, but I will do so in another thread to avoid this one going further off-topic. ",

I had a very limited role in RWA to review the People\u2019s Company proposal and mitigate risk with the proposal backed by income from farmlands.  The proposal was signalled as one the DAO wanted to move forward with, and I always thought Seb brought competence, fairness and flexibility with how to structure the \u201cask\u201d and the risk review.  I brought critique to the early proposal, and in a DAO way of doing things, he asked me to help join to mitigate risk. The allegations of \u201cpersonal entanglement\u201d to me seem grossly unfair and can very easily be reflected back on the newer \u201cArranger\u201d proposal as well.  There seems to have been alot of team building, and arranging behind the scenes to explore this seachange shift. Why would Seb\u2019s company perhaps have to sign up to have legal counsel?  Well, the DAO doesn\u2019t have (currently) a legal body from which it can obtain privity of contract and engage an attorney, clear conflicts, etc. It is a completely unfair critique to use this to levy allegations of personal entanglement (whatever that means) and that the RWA proposals aren\u2019t legally structured in a manner to the liking of the DAO.  The Foundation on the other hand does(or did) have legal status to engage counsel.  Why didn\u2019t it research these legal engineering models and publish the results on behalf of the DAO? This is the exact relationship that it would appear that the ENS DAO will contemplate.  To have the Foundation provide support to the DAO.  FDPmVeaXsAEGas61125\u00d71746 200 KB  Much of this is before my time, so I am sure I am missing critical information of the purpose of the Foundation, but the critique seems empty when levied at the few people actually trying to carry out the \u201cwill\u201d of the DAO that was done through the governance process. I guess that brings the question of whether token weighted governance works?  I don\u2019t know, but I do know to have a DAO even sorta work it requires the constituents to participate, to have open and transparent communication, and be able to debate and resolve conflict (hopefully mostly in the open). There appear to be competing visions for MakerDAO which I will probably grossly mischaracterize.  1). Become a regulated entity and back dai with mostly sovereign and high quality debt.  This is what I think (apologies if not) Paper might want. 2) The current RWA strategy which appear split between the Rune and Seb camps.  Rune\u2019s the Arranger model (which parts I sorta like) and Seb\u2019s idea is to get some stuff done, work out kinks, and move up the food chain to S&P rated debt and build some teams around certain asset classes.  For example tenant financing (New Silver). 3). Stop! and only do RWA to the extent that they are \u201ctokens\u201d with deep liquidity and can have onchain oracles and be able to be \u201cliquidated\u201d in a block as is done with most other tokens. It would seem to me that such a profound and deep rewriting of the current strategy of the DAO should probably go up for a more robust governance process where it can be duly debated and to the extent necessary also staffed.  ESG investing itself is fraught with risk, regulatory risk, construction risk, technological obsolescence risk and hiding in New Zealand doesn\u2019t really seem to be derisking strategy.  Hope this discussion can result in a stronger and more capable DAO. ",

                    "content": "Hey everyone! Wall of text incoming Clearly there\u2019s a lot of drama and it would be great if we could avoid it. But the reality is that we can\u2019t, because what\u2019s basically happening is for the first time the DAO is starting to grapple with the fact that we are a business, and it\u2019s not always fun and games.Sometimes there is disagreement.  Sometimes people have to be fired. Overall I\u2019m actually quite happy with how the conversation is going. We are learning something that will eventually become our second nature - how to handle conflict and then just go back to doing stuff. In a normal business, you deal with these things by controlling it through hierarchy. Nobody has to hear the details when someone gets fired, the boss can just make the call, and there is just a CEO at the top who is accountable for the results of the entire business, so they will delegate to ensure the hierarchy is properly firing people when its necessary. In MakerDAO there is no boss and nobody to make the call, and everyone is invited to be a part of every decision. Anyone and everyone can attempt to fire someone, and it will always just be an attempt. Disagremeent turning into drama is a natural byproduct of such conditions and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always had some of the spiciest drama in all of crypto since the dawn of time. In hindsight it was overly optimistic of me to hope that I could have gone through with this without having to get into the details and basically force us to open up this whole dimension of governance. It was a unique situation where we had an individual with a lot of political momentum who had built up significant private entanglement before the community was even aware of the concept, and in an environment where there basically exists no organized representation of MKR holders. I believe the best option was to just deal with it before it had a chance to grow into something even more explosive. I think a key takeaway is that we are naive to expect Maker governance will run drama and politics free. We\u2019ll have to just learn the handle it. I know that today - since it is the first time we experience it - what\u2019s happening seems shocking to many people. This is the painful reality of being both a community of friends and a business that is governed by capital. Facilitator offboardings will happen. We need to simply get used to it, and accept and learn to deal with the drama that occurs when there\u2019s conflict about facilitator positions (and soon other stuff, such as contentious collateral related decisions). MKR holders absolutely must have the ability to vote out Facilitators, and anyone should have the right to propose it, just like they can propose anything else with the MIP framework.  @rune you need to understand that a d\u00e9mocracy is way less efficient than a dictatorship. If it was true that S\u00e9bastien has done a bad job, eventually this would have come up, but in a very diff\u00e9rent (and probably more respectful) way.  If Seb simply continued growing his private entanglement with no opposition there\u2019s very little chance it would be possible for the maker governance we\u2019re used to today (with basically no active MKR holders) to fire him. We would be entirely reliant on him passing on the reins voluntarily \u200band being honest enough to not abuse the power to extract budgets etc. Whether his replacement would do the same is even more difficult to predict. I know it seems like it might be in your best interest as a mandated actor to advocate for making the facilitator offboarding process as inaccessible as possible and not be something that we deliberately seek out (which is how I\u2019m interpreting your point about waiting for it to \u201ceventually come up\u201d). But the reality is that this would backfire badly in the long term. Once you put in place generalized barriers to replace facilitators (whether it is social expectations or anything else) we begin going down the path of the Iron Law of Bureaucracy The Iron Law of Bureaucracy where it becomes possible for a group of Mandated Actors to operate explicitly against the interests of MKR holders to their own benefit (chiefly by trying to expand the barriers against governance actions that could harm them). I believe instead everyone will be much better off if we leave the process for offboarding facilitators open and accessible, and instead focus on ensuring that all facilitators have the confidence of MKR holders and know they have the votes to back it up. As a Facilitator, you shouldn\u2019t be grasping at straws and fighting with shadows. You should have an easy time to get direct access to the delegates and MKR holders that have opinions about your area of focus, and it should be a clear and smooth two-way street of dialogue that ensures that as a Facilitator you always know two very important things: 1) Do I have the MKR votes ready to back me up if someone tries to offboard me? and 2) If I don\u2019t have the votes, what can I do to get the votes? If there\u2019s enough clarity about these things then being a Facilitator shouldn\u2019t be a particularly hard or unpredictable job. If you are competent, honest, can follow rules and operate in a political environment then over time you should simply just build up more and more trust that naturally makes you stronger in the role. So now we are starting to get into the topic of the Decentralized Workforce, which is a framework I\u2019m proposing that\u2019s meant to deal with exactly this. The point is to make the information flows and political dynamic as explicit possible, and to try to map out all possible interactions and outcomes so that whenever you have particular types of disagreement or other types of governance dynamics, the community should generally know and be prepared for how it will play out. Central to this framework is the concept of Voter Committees, which is meant to be a place where actively voting MKR holders with no other interest in the system than holding MKR (\u201cMKR Mafia\u201d) can directly interact with delegates, as well as facilitators and other political actors in the decentralized workforce. Any problems or concerns that should arise about a particular Facilitator, will always come up first and foremost in the Voter Committee, so as a Facilitator you don\u2019t have to be worried about people complaining about you out of sight in hidden conversations. You know exactly where any potential complaining would happen and can meet it head on, and most likely instead of becoming a standoff and a governance disagreement or even drama, it instead becomes an opportunity for compromise and shared learning and evolution. One last thing I want to put here is a lecture titled \" Why our generals were more successful in World War II than in Korea, Vietnam or Iraq/Afghanistan\" which is about how a change in the political approach towards replacing generals in the US Army explains how they went from dominating in WW2 to then failing in Vietnam, Abu Ghraib etc The TL;DR is that if you often replace people in high positions, it becomes normalized and stops being a politically sensitive issue. Instead of being a career ender, it just becomes a normal part of how you organize things. This enables a high level of flexibility and adaptability and prevents you from getting stuck in a dysfunctional patterns. On the other hand, if you are not normalizing replacing people, then it becomes a stigmatizing career ender and as a result it barely gets used at all because the stigma means it involves huge amount of drama and political struggle. And then you have conditions where people everyone knows are unfit to do an important job, still get to keep it to the detriment of everyone else.      I believe that this dynamic can also occur with facilitators in Maker, and it is vital that we choose the path of normalizing facilitator replacements and simply make sure that being an ex-facilitator is a good thing, not a stain on your CV, and that we then replace or attempt to replace Facilitators any time there\u2019s a good reason to do so - while of course also simultaneously adopting frameworks that make it crystal clear to Facilitators what kind of actions they can take to consolidate their MKR voter support, and proactively prevent the occurrence of \u201cgood reasons to remove them\u201d. One very last, final note I want to make is just clarity on my MKR voting patterns. I have not done any voting personally for several years, and right now I am delegating across most of the delegates, but not actively voting myself and also not actively influencing the delegates. Of the delegates I\u2019ve delegated to, I\u2019ve mostly spoken to PaperImperium and Planet_x in the past. Planet_x I no longer delegate anything to, and I delegate a relatively small amount to Paperimperium. I\u2019ve had probably one conversation with Elpro, and no real interaction with any of the other delegates. I don\u2019t intend to strong arm this process, the delegates will vote as they want - ultimately it would be completely pointless for me try to force something like this on the community, as I have zero interest in setting myself up to perpetually fight alone against other MKR governance whales. Now I think we just have to sit back and let the process do its thing. ",

Notwithstanding the power that investor yields, we usually resist that active investor jumping in and chopping the heads off of first-level management and replace them.  Such a move, as I believe would here, sets the company back substantially on knowledge and wisdom gained, not to mention sends a demoralizing message of powerlessness to other stakeholders.  A solution many times worked out is that that investor is given a dedicated board seat so that they are always in the room where it happens and can directly influence macro direction of the company and influence first-level management to a great degree. What I pose is, is there a possible compromise in the line of @SebVentures continues to do his job and you instead propose installation of some person that he is required to consult or work with, or in part oversees him?

                    "content": "Thanks for your post and good points. It is a good analogy to how it works in companies, and what best practices for a traditional company is. But I would argue that Maker shouldn\u2019t seek to emulate how a company is organized when it comes to the highest level of decision making. In particular I think it is fatal if we allow MKR holders to simply be passive shareholders that delegate all responsibility to a hierarchical management that in practice holds the power and are then kept in check through promises, legal structure and legal threats. The reason why activist shareholders shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cmicromanage\u201d which manager should leave is because in a traditional hierarchical organization there\u2019s a CEO whose job it is to run an aligned team. At worst, shareholders would replace the board, who\u2019d then replace the CEO. In a DAO, there are no such roles. The closest we might get are meta-governance core units that may recommend offboarding a particular facilitator based on some collected data measured against best practices and benchmarks, but this can\u2019t be compared to a CEO at all, because meta-governance core units would only have the ability to recommend such action to MKR holders, not actually take the action themselves (and this has a profound impact on the political dynamics of such a situation). And I think it really should be obvious that if we go down the path of having a CEO and a traditional org structure, it will not take long before we find ourselves as a centralized entity that will get crushed by banking regulation, and have no possibility of defending against it because it has lost the capability to operate in a decentralized manner. I think a much better analogy is to compare the highest level of Maker Governance to political systems rather than corporate systems. In that case, a MIP to replace a facilitator coming from an MKR holder is like attempting to recall a senator - except in Maker there are no term limits so it is a much more fundamental process that has to function well, or the DAO will not be able to remain decentralized over time. There\u2019s some critical context for all of this that we first discovered way back in 2015: A DAO is extremely vulnerable to corruption, significantly more than a government or a company, because of its decentralization which inherently means you can\u2019t assume you can trust people, and there is no strong central point that can fight back and crack down on corruption. The solution is to have a \u201cdecentralized immune response\u201d where the DAO has to be able to mobilize a grassroots response to potential issues anywhere in a bureaucracy or governance systems that emerge. There also needs to be as many support functions as possible in place, such as meta-governance core units - but they can also run into issues, so in the end the backbone of a DAO must just be an active and strong decentralized community of token holders that have the means to coordinate to control the DAO whenever there is broad agreement that it is necessary to make changes. There\u2019s also a nuance of this that can be a bit difficult for me to describe - but basically it is not just whether MKR holders can technically take action to change things, it is also whether they are conditioned to actively even consider whether they should do so. The second part is actually just as important as the first, if not even more so. From this perspective I believe that MKR holders removing a facilitator that has been involved in private entanglement (which itself touches on the issue of the power balance between MKR holders and the bureaucracy) is really a routine, basic function. It\u2019s something that we need to prove will happen in all cases, because if you can\u2019t count on that happening, you would expect the DAO to naturally be pushed towards centralizing itself over time. I also really disagree that we should keep Seb but then begin to micromanage him. I just have the completely opposite viewpoint - if someone has reached a point where you need to micromanage them, you are better off replacing them. Going down the path of micromanagement is not a sensible compromise, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Iammeoh shared the quote from the generals lecture that goes \u201cswift relief is the price of autonomy\u201d. Either we support Seb and give him autonomy to operate the way he believes is best, or we simply replace him and encourage him to go somewhere else in the ecosystem where he can act with autonomy and fully leverage his skills and passion. If we try to micromanage him to do things that go against his own nature, we are setting ourselves up for failure because if micromanagement by MKR holders becomes a thing then we will destroy efficiency in the Core Units and create a true bureaucratic nightmare.

Actually, there was plenty of ways to avoid politics and the mud fight: engage on those topics when they were discussed, vote against those proposals, provide alternatives (like another RWA CU), ask questions. The evidence (or lack of evidence) is in this forum and on-chain. I suggested the @LongForWisdom propositions to @rune but he is in no mood for compromise it seems. Let me add some quotes from the June drama. The thread has quite an entertainment value. You have a sock puppet coming from nowhere ( @Engineer ), @Joseph_Quintilian  of @ashleigh_schap story having some serious RWA insights as he did on the RWA Foundations (I know none of those folks). This is only one example of the \u201cheated\u201d and \u201cscientific governance\u201d discussions over the months. MKR voted the following RWAs vote. But yeah, I guess I have too much political power.    Real-World Assets - Report - 2021-05   My job is to present the information I find to the MKR holders and facilitate RWA, not decide. If some of that information is wrong anyone can correct that as well. If you think I\u2019ve missed something you can raise the point. And any opinion from the community adds a data point for MKR holders to use (or not). I think this thread shows that the community can be quite vocal and have strong opinions.   I never voted in place of MKR holders.    Real-World Assets - Report - 2021-05   There is this fancy trend to fire me lately. For those that are entertaining this idea for weeks, please do or don\u2019t. I\u2019m here to do work, not politics. The work is already hard, the rest is just exhausting.   Which is why I\u2019m not happy when they do nothing and 4 months later they come back and the work of the team is defined as \u201cprivate entanglement\u201d by someone having some serious \u201cprivate entanglement\u201d. You can\u2019t build serious things if the people behind you are constantly changing their views. \u2013 @rune maybe you can spend some time answering questions we have on your Arranger Model. ",

Many may misinterpret drama as disorder and inefficiency, but in a DAO you should expect lots and lots of drama and you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of it. In many ways, the cost of drama, the energy it captures, is a cost of decentralization. The caveat to this is when vote participation is staggered. If you are MIA for many discussions and then pop up later as things have been implemented, it is creating a lot of inefficiency and a mirage of decentralization because you are actually just staggering between two centralized eras, much like a two-party system.

What I can comment is, as someone working directly with @SebVentures through our MIP6 process, that Seb is a highly competent facilitator who protects the interest of the DAO. Instead of saying he is ex this or that Seb lets the quality of his work speak for themselves. He has the ability to deal with complex RWAs issues from first principles.

As a facilitator, it is my job to make decisions for the benefit of MakerDAO even when I don\u2019t know what is best. I will not lie, it is not an easy pill to swallow. Therefore, I\u2019m resigning from my role as the facilitator of the RWF CU. The resignation will take effect one day after voting on the ratification polls concludes (Jan 25th), if any at all.

Wanted to pop in from the Governance side here and make sure everyone is on the same page. If you are resigning with an effective date of right after ratification polls end, then there is no need to hold a vote on the offboarding. It effectively removes the need for an interim facilitator to be appointed if @williamr 's facilitator onboarding is approved. So just so the community is perfectly clear on the message here @SebVentures, does this serve as your official resignation (effective Jan 25th) regardless of the votes taking place in the January cycle?
