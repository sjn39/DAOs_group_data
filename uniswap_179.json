I like the idea of using the badges from Trustswap as an example to verify certain projects/coins as legit. We still allow any project to come onto the platform however, we should do something at least with the uniswap List and perhaps show a way how to get verified Uni badges and other badges to elevate trust. Of course, they can verify all they want and we can supply some tools to help. We have the power lets do something about it and try to show everyone the first step, instead of just reacting. ",

We should try to avoid a situation where a bunch of people post on the Uniswap forum to shill their project tokens - this would be a huge distraction and waste of energy, and would likely increase rather than reduce scam attempts.
