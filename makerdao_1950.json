Monetalis advertises itself on its LinkedIn page as a \u201cGreen Growth DeFi Wholesale lender\u201d and on its webpage the first thing you see in prominent text is \u201cFinancing growth of the Green Economy via green growth whole-sale lending to non-bank lenders.\u201d I don\u2019t think this focus on \u201cgreen growth\u201d aligns well with a stablecoin project, and I would much prefer that we park our cash in \u201cvanilla\u201d investments without any particular \u201cagenda\u201d other than making money with minimal risk. Just yesterday I noticed this Wall Street Journal editorial discussing some of the pitfalls associated with the green energy transition. I personally strongly support efforts to transition to more sustainable way of living, but these issues are complex and I don\u2019t think we want to entangle our DAO in this or at least not be overweight in this. In addition, these two proposals go slightly farther out on the risk curve than the Coinbase USDC proposal. I don\u2019t think we want to get into anything speculative and when you have things like \u201cSocial housing projects across UK and Europe\u201d in the list of collateral types, that strikes me as speculative.

                    "content": "Dear @amlevin Welcome to the Maker Community. It is always a pleasure to see new active members! Now, firstly, I have to apologise that we haven\u2019t updated our linkedin profile for some time (too much work!), because we do actually do a lot more than what we have in that profile:   We have (almost) deployed MIP65. That simply entails deploying DAI 500M into BlackRock short-term US Treasury ETF products via an appropriate legal and governance structure.   We are doing our best to support the start of the Viridian cluster and provide what help we can with moving the Endgame and Protector MetaDAO concept forward.   \u2026and then, yes, we would love to find a way for Maker to use its funding capacity to combat climate change - without sacrificing returns and/or risk. You correctly identify MIP88 and MIP89 as being stepping stones for moving forward with that vision. You may also notice that the Viridian cluster has a Climate Change angle as well. I am very glad to hear that you personally support efforts to transition to a more sustainable way of living. We do too! As I understand your concerns, they are around (and please forgive me for paraphrasing a bit) a) is this Green Economy something that should even be within a stablecoins vision? And b) isn\u2019t this type of financing too complex and risky for Maker? On a) I think the Maker community has chosen, after a lengthy debate over a presented general Clean Money vision, to not have Clean Money/Green Economy as an overarching general theme or mission for Maker, but to allow for the various MetaDAO to find their own way on this subject. We remain in the camp where we believe focusing on Climate Change financing is good business/right thing to do/builds right profile/etc, and so we associate with the Viridian cluster where this is part of its core theme. You can read a bit more about this in the viridian cluster announcement. As you can imagine, we would hope MIP88 and MIP89 would ultimately be adopted by this cluster - should this cluster ultimately be adopted by a MetaDAO. They would fit. You can see more about this also more generally in Purpose 2.0 You can rest assured that these type of assets would never become the largest asset classes under a MetaDAO or Maker - for reasons of liquidity and risk in private credit opportunities vs simple public instruments such as US Treasuries - and the needs of DAI currency stability support. Maker has a rather strong focus on ALM (as it should!). On b) I don\u2019t think you will find these opportunities to be more complex or risky than any non-climate change focused private credit opportunity. Particularly not when you work with strong, experienced and credible players on it. They provide substantive comfort around achievability. Arrow (MIP89) and Redwood (MIP88) are top tier players in their relevant markets. You may ask why do we bother with private credit opportunities at all? Well because we want to provide Maker with even stronger yield opportunities than available in public markets and allow Maker to actually directly affect markets (i.e. combat climate change for instance). Greater yield allows Maker to fund new opportunities, bring benefits to the MKR holders and maybe even effectuate an attractive DSR and increase DAI demand. All in all, mixing plain vanilla public market fixed income instruments with private credit in an appropriate way (as determined by an appropriate ALM strategy) brings many benefits to Maker and allows it to compete effectively. Btw: social housing is actually not a risky or particularly speculative real estate class. The stock of this housing type is deeply depleted in the countries we focus on - there is a real need for these developments. I hope that adds some context to, and maybe even alleviates some of, your concerns. Thank you for engaging! ",
