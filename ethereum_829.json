This working group is not unlike the testing working group in existence within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, where members are attempting to define standards and tests for various enterprise client implementations on the Ethereum network. Simiarly, discussions here will include but are not limited to pre/post fork testing, testnets, identifying key metrics within Ethereum 1.x, conformance tests, and testing standards. Immediate actions would be to kick off with a call to define scope of the working group and the main contributors. Currently we have about 5 people with relevant testing interest that want to take on this initiative but this working group is open to anyone that wants to contribute either via research, development, or review.
