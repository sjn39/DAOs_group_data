Vault changes1211\u00d7897 156 KB   ETH-C and WBTC-C continue to rally in deposits, almost completely offsetting ETH-A and WBTC-A reductions.    ETH-C vault protection looks like a peace symbol; may the markets follow that sentiment. Capital at risk is only 2.3 million.    Debt outstanding looking exponential on WBTC-C vaults over the past five months.    Total debt is almost 100 million, and the average debt at 47 K  Since DAI outstanding has been somewhat flat, it is worth zooming out to look at the ecosystem more. Compound recently reduced its COMP rewards last month. Their community had a nail-biting vote to remove them completely this last week. Here is a convenient thread from one of their Delegates that covers the meta of voting power and the recent proposal (No. 100):  twitter.com    0x7751 @0x7751  This was such an interesting vote because it was super meta. At its core, it was a vote about how the protocol should distribute voting power. Most of the No votes would probably also argue that it was about managing user acquisition costs and incentives.   9:07 PM - 23 Apr 2022           1             Compound Dash says less leverage1250\u00d7903 126 KB   The compound monitor dashboard indicates recursive positions have stayed through the tumultuous vote.
