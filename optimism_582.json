This approach will facilitate seamless user onboarding from the main Optimism chain to the deployed chains. We have spent considerable time designing the domain model, with the primary objective of optimizing benefits for the Optimism community. As a forward-thinking initiative, our project is designed to be dynamic and responsive to evolving needs over time. Our plan involved creating an ENS fork, which evolved into an interoperable domain name service and, finally, a subscription-based public good service. These transitions are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of our domain service and ensure that the Optimism community continues to reap its benefits. Given the recent announcement by Optimism regarding the OP Stack, we perceive it as a golden opportunity for our project. Our team has identified a distinctive feature of the OP Stack, which allows for the deployment of a domain system across OP stack-based chains in a permissionless manner, thereby enabling seamless interconnectivity among all chains. Users can obtain their .op domains at no cost until 2025, along with the availability of optional supporter plans. Holders of .op domains can claim their .base and other domain names natively for each OP stack deployed chain without incurring additional fees. Chain operators may deploy opti.domains on their respective chains without requiring any permission, allowing for a wide range of customization options.  image1405\u00d71480 290 KB   Domain whitelisting As we offer free minting for our .op domains, we must prevent bots from minting and frontrunning the best domain names. Therefore, we have proposed a solution to this problem. Participation in at least one of our campaigns is required to acquire a domain name. Additionally, we will leverage the current ENS domain holder database. To register a name in .op domains, one must be the rightful owner of the corresponding ENS domain at the time of the snapshot. However, not all ENS holders have the right to mint their domain names, as some domains are reserved for special purposes, such as speculation or company branding. Non-ENS holders can only register domain names not registered on ENS at the time of registration.  Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Optimism recently unveiled the OP stack, and our product perfectly aligns with that technology. To ensure the success of the OP stack, it requires shared infrastructure across chains. Opti.domains is a critical infrastructure that enables the instant deployment of a web3 domain name with a bridge system to enable seamless movement of users across OP stack chains. Compared to ENS, which has an existing user base of over 2.5 million domains minted, we can rapidly implement new innovations, such as bridges, without worrying about an existing user base. This agility allows us to move quickly toward our goal of building a cross-chain domain name system. Based on this advantage, we\u2019re in a good position to build a cross-chain domain name system. Additionally, we\u2019re committed to being sustainable by sharing 80% of our revenue after 2025 to support developers in creating public goods that benefit both the Optimism ecosystem and Opti.domains holders. Additionally, we value contribution over hype. We believe that this is a source of sustainable growth that drive the project to its goal.  Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Upon reaching the community participation phase, our project will engage new builders from the community, starting with university students, to develop supporting components. These individuals are typically new builders, and incentivizing them with attractive rewards will motivate them to create more public goods in the Optimism ecosystem.  Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Indeed, our subscription model, which resembles that of Netflix, is specifically designed to motivate developers to strive for excellence to earn a larger share of the quarterly subscription fee distribution.  Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Indeed, our project is specifically designed to enhance the dedication of developers to public goods. Typically, these developers receive a substantial one-time payment, making it difficult to remain committed to their development projects. However, in the final phase, we adopt a Netflix subscription model to compensate developers on a quarterly basis. This approach ensures that developers are more likely to remain dedicated to their work and prioritize quality without worrying about the business aspects of their projects.

Distribute 80% of revenue starting from 2025.       Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): As we have not commenced any marketing yet, we currently do not have any current traction to report. The value of a domain name itself is negligible, as anyone can fork ENS and launch it. The execution is what gives it value, much like NFTs. Our first campaign, an Ideathon, is designed to benefit both our project and the Optimism ecosystems in the long term. Apetimism, Bored Town, and Zonic OG NFT holders are the initial group invited to participate in the campaign. The response from these NFT communities has been positive, with the community and founders supporting this campaign. We will then collect these ideas and submit them to GitHub - ethereum-optimism/optimism-project-ideas: Ideas for projects to build on Optimism  image1053\u00d71643 203 KB  (Zonic NFT Marketplace Community)  image1052\u00d71094 102 KB  (Apetimism NFT Community)  image1035\u00d7366 40 KB  (Bored town NFT Community) The campaign will be conducted in several phases, with the ultimate target being to reach 2000 high-quality users by the end of April.  Who are your competitors?: Our direct competitors in the market are Opnames.org (ONS), OPNS, and Punk Domains. However, we also see the potential for partnership with other parties offering similar solutions, such as ENS, Space ID, and ARB ID.  What differentiates you from your competitors?: When considering the skill sets of our competitors, it is noteworthy that many of them tend to be led by business-oriented individuals with a strong emphasis on marketing. In contrast, our team at Opti.domains is spearheaded by a development expert who possesses a unique and unparalleled skill set in the realm of cross-chain technology. Furthermore, it has come to our attention that our competitors are not currently prioritizing permissionless deployment on OP stack chains, which we believe to be a crucial area of focus for both our and the Optimism ecosystem as a whole. In essence, If marketing prowess is a top priority, ONS (Opnames.org) is your choice. However, if you prioritize innovation and cutting-edge technological solutions, then Opti.domains is a clear choice.  Business Positioning (2)1080\u00d71080 74.4 KB   Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain:  Our domain name service is fully composable with any project operating on the Optimism and OP Stack, facilitating the use of domain names instead of wallet addresses. Our offering is particularly well-suited to multi-chain dashboard applications, providing a means to aggregate data from both Optimism and OP Stack deployed chains. Upon completion of our project development, we anticipate that our solution can play a pivotal role in supporting Optimism governance grants. Specifically, we plan to share 80% of the revenue generated from domain name sales after 2025 towards supporting relevant projects. Our domain name service is also ideally positioned for marketing collaboration with any NFT projects on Optimism and OP stack.   Team  Who are your founders?: Chomtana Chanjaraswichai Github: Chomtana (Chomtana) \u00b7 GitHub Discord: Chom#1652  What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: I have significant experience in cross-chain development and, last year, successfully developed a cross-chain domain prototype utilizing Axelar technology.  Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): Currently, I am working independently on this project. However, I have devised a plan to collaborate with NFT communities to facilitate marketing efforts, as well as partner with universities to enable student involvement in development.  Is this your first Web3 project?: No  If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): I have built many web3 projects. Let\u2019s share the notable ones.

Unfortunately, the project is currently paused due to the bear market in the NFT marketplace, where the cost is surpassing revenue. However, if the Opti.domains project proves to be successful. We may resume the project and potentially rebrand it as a transport layer for bridging any asset that can be wrapped with an NFT.  I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post 2: [Yes/No]:** Yes  Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: No  Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 50000 OP  How do you justify the size of the grant?  Salary and cost reimbursement: 20k OP, given 12 months = approximately 1600 OP/month, which is fair for such an advanced development and managing hackathon to use it for the long-term benefit Marketing budget: 10k OP, given 12 months = approximately 800 OP/month. Necessary for bootstraping the initial marketing campaigns. If not, then decentralized work and developer hackathons are not gonna happen. Decentralized work: 10k OP. I will break down tasks and analyze their dependencies. Given an average of 200 OP per task, we can have 50 tasks which are enough for bootstrapping the profile feature with a medium-sized group of university students. Hackathon reward: 10k OP. Hackathon is designed especially for developers to learn and develop creative mini public goods with rewards from multiple parties. We plan to reward 2000 OP per hackathon for 5 hackathons.

However, decentralized work and hackathon are depend on it. We have devised a solution to address this challenge through the use of NFTs. Eligible participants in our decentralized work and new-gen hackathon campaigns will receive NFTs, and we will offer buyback opportunities for these NFTs on our partnered marketplace.  What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: Our plan involves enabling NFT holders to claim their corresponding OP tokens. The remaining OP token will act as reimbursement for my cash paid and my salary in the development. We plan to use remaining OP token for long-term self delegation to participate in the optimism governance. However, this approach is not the sole focus of our strategy.  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. 31 April 2023  Discord members and Twitter followers: 2000 Partners: 3 Unique testnet participants: 1000 Source of truth: Discord, Twitter, Etherscan  31 July 2023  Discord members and Twitter followers: 10000 Partners: 10 Partner with Optimism, Axelar Unique domain holders on mainnet: 3000 Source of truth: Discord, Twitter, Etherscan  30 September 2023  Discord members and Twitter followers: 30000 Partners: 20 Partner with Optimism, Axelar, Coinbase Wallet Unique domain holders on mainnet: 10000 Decentralized work developers: 5 Source of truth: Discord, Twitter, Etherscan  31 January 2024  Discord members and Twitter followers: 100000 Partners: 30 Partner with Optimism, Axelar, ENS, Coinbase Wallet Unique domain holders on mainnet: 50000 Decentralized work developers: 50 Source of truth: Discord, Twitter, Etherscan  Developer Hackathon  Coordinated by Chom, Work with partners Organize once in Q4 2023 Developers participated: 20 Source of truth: Media   Please define critical milestones for this project.

This approach will provide us with ample time and resources to concentrate on other high-priority tasks, such as cross-chain smart contract development.  Optimism Relationship  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Yes, we solve two major problems for the Optimism ecosystems  We provide domain name infrastructure for the OP stack ecosystems that enable each deployed chain to rapidly onboard users from the Optimism chain to their chain. We incentivize new builders to contribute to the Optimism and OP stack ecosystems by providing an ongoing and sustainable reward system. This approach ensures that the ecosystem continues to grow and thrive over time.   How does your proposal offer a value proposition for solving the above problem?: While it is possible for other companies to develop similar domain name infrastructure, they may not be able to share 80% of their revenue with the community as we do. This is primarily due to the high expenses incurred by such companies. The revenue distribution is crucial for promoting the growth of the Optimism ecosystem and ensuring the sustainability of our project.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Undoubtedly, having interoperable domain name infrastructure for the OP stack ecosystems is critical for the Optimism ecosystem. With a domain name infrastructure, each chain in the OP stack can leverage it as a source of KYC or DID, which holds records of activities across chains. Additionally, we offer an 80% revenue-sharing model to accelerate the growth of the Optimism ecosystem. This approach incentivizes new developers to build on the Optimism chain and contributes to the overall growth of the ecosystem.  How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: I am committed to building crucial infrastructures such as cross-chain domain infrastructure, as well as infrastructure to support ENS from all chains through ethers and MetaMask wallet. Additionally, I will facilitate decentralized work and developer hackathons to create other necessary supporting components, ensuring the scalability and sustainability of the project. That\u2019s why we dedicate 80% of the revenue to the community.  Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes  Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

I have thought about this concern multiple times. In conclusion, until 2025, you must be whitelisted to mint the domain. To get whitelisted, you must participate in at least one campaign and hold an ENS domain to mint the same name as your .eth name but in .op. However, not all ENS domains can get whitelisted for the following reason.  If we whitelist any ENS holders permissionlessly, we will have difficulty organizing marketing campaigns with our partners because we can\u2019t give significant benefits (Whitelist slot) to their community. Company names should be forfeited. Given an example, the one holding scb10x.eth may not be SCB 10X. If we give a whitelist to that guys, we will have difficulty partnering with SCB 10X. Names that aren\u2019t set as the primary name for a long time must be checked manually to ensure they are not used for speculation. Not only company and non-primary names, but we also need to reserve some rare names that are usually used for speculation, including 4.1 Names shorter than four characters 4.2 Names with repeating digits such as 888.op 4.3 Names that are traded with high volumes  The criteria for the company name aren\u2019t final yet. Here\u2019s an example of how we classify these.  We will pass names to Chat GPT to have them classify whether it is a company name.   image1375\u00d71422 45.8 KB   We will check whether that name matches a Twitter username. In case it matches, we will ask for Twitter login verification first.  This whitelist system is not yet developed in testnet 1, so in testnet 1, you can mint any name, but it won\u2019t have any effect on the mainnet. Moreover, the testnet is subject to hard reset at any time. After 2025, we plan to go permissionless. So, if you mint after 2025, you must do it FCFS basis. ",

The main difference is that I believe each chain\u2019s resolver should hold different data specialized to that chain independently. Let\u2019s give an example  image1241\u00d71031 125 KB  axlUSDC address is different on each chain. With an independent resolver on each chain, one just simply points the domain to the correct axlUSDC address on each chain. Another use case, Starb*** chain may keep their membership information in their chain. Independent resolvers let Starb*** chain operator design their specialized resolver on their chain without worrying about any compatibility problems. To query data on L2 or L3 (such as Base or Starb*** chain deployed with Op Stack if any) one doesn\u2019t need to query a smart contract in L1 to get StorageHandledByL2 revert message to query smart contract in L2 / L3. Because the resolver in L3 is independent of L2, one can query data from the resolver in L3 directly. If there is an important thing that must be done on the main Optimism chain, one can ask for the data from L3 chain and wait for the transport layer (Optimism bridge) to pass the data back and call necessary function without needing to use offchain gateway. Hope we don\u2019t need to wait 7 days anymore in the future. I don\u2019t feel sure that I understand your L2 design correctly, as I mostly see that you are focusing on offchain things.     matoken.eth:  Are you developing on your own?
