I am also a developer myself, if necessary, I am willing to participate in it!\n2. the official website to increase the multilingual version, the official multiple product pages, including many learning materials and documents can support multilingual, convenient for friends in different regions to participate and learn.\n\nThe above is my first proposal as a newcomer, welcome to correct any deficiencies (English is automatically translated from Deepl. (Cry with laughter)\n\nFor the multilingual proposal, especially important is the Chinese users, which is a very large team, never lack of excellent developers, investors, evangelists, and a large number of high-quality Internet groups willing to actively participate in governance.\n\n\n\n\u4e2d\u6587\u539f\u6587\uff1a\n\n\u5404\u4f4d\u793e\u533a\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u662fgitcoin\u7684\u65b0\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u793e\u533a\u6240\u6784\u60f3\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7279\u522b\u8ff7\u4eba\uff0c\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u65b0\u5927\u9646\u3002\n\u540c\u6837\uff0c\u4e00\u5b9a\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u65b0\u670b\u53cb\u548c\u6211\u4e00\u6837\u4e5f\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u8fdb\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u793e\u533a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e86\uff0c\u8ba9\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u52a0\u5165\u8fdb\u6765\uff0c\u8ba9\u793e\u533a\u66f4\u52a0\u7684DAO\u3002\n\n\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\n1. \u5b98\u65b9\u8bba\u575b\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5165\u53e3\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u9009\u62e9\u8fdb\u5165\u5404\u81ea\u8bed\u8a00\u76ee\u5f55\u53c2\u4e0e\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76ee\u5f55\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u672c\u8eab\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u6211\u975e\u5e38\u613f\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fdb\u6765\n2. \u5b98\u65b9\u7f51\u7ad9\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5b98\u65b9\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u9875\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bb8\u591a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u6587\u6863\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u65b9\u4fbf\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5c31\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u6211\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u6b22\u8fce\u6307\u6b63\uff08\u82f1\u6587\u4eceDeepl\u81ea\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u800c\u6765 (\u7b11\u54ed)\uff09\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e2d\u6587\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u961f\u4f0d\uff0c\u4ece\u6765\u4e0d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u3001\u5e03\u9053\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u613f\u610f\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002",
