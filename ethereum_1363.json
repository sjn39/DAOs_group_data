I thought I'd write up an explainer. Spec...       is a trusted source of information? Then it\u2019s written there  IMG_20210620_011356720\u00d71600 224 KB  So what prevent the auctioneer from resell it again? ( make a new token  pointing to the same file?)  He used the example of a receipt, if a marchant signed 2 receipts for the same item u could press charges against him, what about NFT?  -I mean other than tampering or making a slight change, does the \u201ccreate\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d functions check if the hash already exists, ie have been minted before? or they just verify it? (A marchant could sign & seal 2 manual receipts to be only discovered in court, but a computerized system wouldn\u2019t print a 2nd receipt from the beginning) In one sentence How does NFTs prevent double spending?or they just don\u2019t?
