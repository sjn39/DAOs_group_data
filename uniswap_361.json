Marketing Here I mean prolonged, effective campaigns targeted at everyone remotely interested in crypto. again, more people on Uniswap benefits us all. consider this, allocating a fraction of the protocol switch to a marketing pool can get us massive campaign budgets, considering the protocol fee at current rates would net 250k a day. with a portion of that we could gain some serious traction not just within the crypto space, but far beyond it too. Education Last but not least, We need to build on an easy to use repository of information to educate users of all trades and budgets. the DeFi space is still very new and very scary to many people. How do liquidity pools work? are my funds safe? what even are gas fees and why should I pay them if binance is free? up to the bigger questions of how to work with and write your own smart contracts and farm responsibly. working on tools like these will again have a positive effect on attracting new users, filling the pools, stabilising pegs and increasing rewards for all. How do we fund this? theres a few things that come to mind, but in my eyes the most obvious one would be to allocate a portion of the protocol fee to each of these goals. note, this does not have to be ridiculous amounts of money. there is no point in reserving millions a month to keep influencers happy or to build coca cola style marketing campaigns. there\u2019s plenty of serious firms out there that can do us a proper quote and deliver a good job without needing a gold plated lambo in return. but costing these goals in will have a very positive impact on the future of uni and should therefore be a top priority.

The topics listed all would fall under a marketing budget and all are very intelligent moves to make.  You can not rely on word of mouth. In fact NEVER rely on word of mouth. All it takes is one very loud mouth with no brain attached to cause horrible harm. Worse yet, a very loud mouth WITH a brain and the intent to create a vampire scheme like the sushi swap situation. Your idea of hiring content creators such as crypto youtubers is also an excellent idea. I have not sat down and created a marketing outline or really thought about the possible chess moves of opposition we may encounter but I do know, on my list of things to do, I would have top youtubers listed as routes of education & promotion.

I know people are whispering about dividends, yet this is not yet set in stone and might not be the best way to spend the fees. on top of that, the entire treasury is made up of UNI. everything we do will somehow involve either distributing ownership or selling uni for something else.  This is already the biggest DEX in DeFi.  Great, now we have to keep it that way. when I started trading, bittrex was still relevant, binance was just a pipedream and kucoin was all the rage. things change, the public opinion sways and we\u2019d better be at the helm of the narrative to stay ahead.

If this were the case, everyone would be using linux and we\u2019d elect people into seats of power who genuinely care about us  Lets say you have two pencils, both made to equally great quality standards. now company A says \u201cI make the better pencil\u201d and company B spends the rest of their existence trying to prove company A wrong. still, everyone now knows company A as the better pencil. ok that may be a random analogy. but lets look at the recent airdrop of UNI. don\u2019t be mistaken, this was brilliant marketing. this one simple move has blasted the daily volume out of the stratosphere and everyone is talking about uni. you even have people using a DEX for the first time now, whereas a month ago UNI was losing members to happy meals. What I am saying is that you should not underestimate the power of marketing and exposure. using a fraction of our funds for this purpose can have major dramatic effects on our daily volume and keep us in the lead of the DeFi race. we have the product, lets not be afraid to tell people about it!

I believe if uni starts spending some money for marketing it will allow their token price to increase in the long run. Don\u2019t forget the total cap of UNI is already set. This should not be increased, instead there should be a minor allocation from each field fed into the marketing scheme. As you said UNI is the biggest dex in DeFi. But it still isn\u2019t the biggest exchange. I believe with the knowledge flowing arround of a project like UNI, people will reduce their usage of centralized exchanges, further promoting Satoshi\u2019s vision of bitcoin and the crypto market. To be completely honnest, I see no harm in this proposal. At least not for the next couple of years as I mentioned. Furthermore, the bounty program should only work for NEW users brought into uniswap. NOT users that have already invited others. Think about it, even AMAZON, the biggest online business in the world has their own marketing scheme. They have affiliates.amazon.com which is their affiliate system, and they pay for ads on Google for their visibility. Why do you think that is? Best regards!

But when you hear how much a movie costs it is marketing. Those old enough to remember back when Jurassic park was released.  Do you remember what they said?  \" This is the most EXPENSIVE movie ever made!!!\"   think about that for a minute.   You had a couple of mediocre actors, Laura Dern, and Sam Neil in one Location with a bunch of plastic Dinosaurs.  Most Expensive movie?? NO.  Titanic?  MOST EXPENSIVE MOVIE EVER MADE!!   again.  NO.  Expensive YES\u2026 but what they tell you is all marketing.  ANYTHING you release to the public is Marketing. I can\u2019t go completely into this topic as I will end up going down a rabbit hole that is deeper than I have the time to take everyone on the guided tour.  Just realize all Movies have a formula. From how they are written to how they are released. SCREENPLAY Take the script or Story as an example. To be considered FEATURE LENGTH, a screenplay must be a minimum of 83 pages with the goal being a 120 page standard. 1 page is 1 minute of screen time. Movie theaters hate the long \u201cBraveheart\u201d 3 hour movies. We love them. So we have seen a shift from a the standard 120 min feature to a 90 minute feature.  Why? because the goal is not the movie it is to sell as much candy and popcorn as possible. The primary income of a movie theater is food sales. The only time they really make any money off of a movie is if it runs past the two or three week standard. It is more complicated with specific percentages  but to simply state things you can get more people in the seats in one day with a 90 minute feature than a 210 minute kevin Costner film. More people in seats = More candy and popcorn. So those wanting to sell a screenplay, Write a 90 minute one location story. I can explain why if you really want to know. Yes, I did teach a college course on screenwriting. Story Even the Stories have formulas. You see them all the time. Your brain is attracted to them. This specific formula is what is known as the Great Story but you may not know why you think it\u2019s great.  Some say it\u2019s the actors\u2026 some say its the action, or comedy, or great special FX. well, George Lucas once said \u201cA special Effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.\u201d A special effect is a tool just like most actors\u2026(you can take that anyway you like\") It\u2019s the story  but it is HOW the story is given to your brain. As soon as you read this you will now watch every movie differently\u2026 and go \" holy crap that marketing guy on uniswap was right\" THE FORMULA  xxxx LIFE SPOILER xxxx Lets do a standard 120page movie.  A few people have written books on this and each has their own take on it just like each movie is slightly different.  The thing to do is imagine the movie is a blanket that you have to hang on a clothesline. Obviously you would have one close pin at the beginning and one at the end. The close pins are things that take place in the movie.  if you only used two\u2026 your blanket would sag in the middle so to keep it up or \u201cINTERESTING\u201d you need plot points. Pages 1-3 the opening of your movie. Meet your Main character, you have the setting, the time, and the MOOD\u2026 is it a comedy?  you\u2019ll know within the first minute. PAGEs 4-10 (minutes 4-10) your main character has a goal. the goal will be stated or. maybe even started. or a problem will arise. Your character may get some kind of information that doesn\u2019t make sense. Or is told something he doesn\u2019t believe and just blows off  you\u2019ll meet other characters and you will be introduced to possible opposition. But something happens where your character will commit to a goal. this is where you are telling our audience what you are going to deliver to them. \u201cwe are going to grandma\u2019s house\u201d Page 30 I am only going this far. because I want you to watch or think about movies. Next time you are watching a movie\u2026 get out your watch.  Depending on the length of the film the close pin may be a little sooner or a little later.  but trust me it is there.  What is IT? It is your page 30 event. Your Big Reveal\u2026 your Action. or special event that catches everyone by surprise. in a movie Something happens to keep your character from getting to their goal. What happens to make Luke Skywalker decide to go off with Obi-Wan? Of course there are deeper things tied into these scenes. Mainly Character growth and eventually you see the character change or grow. At the end of the movie something will happen where your character will think all is lost. No hope. But then something happens that reminds him of that piece of information at the beginning. The character uses that information to overcome the obstacles and get to his goal but also deliver to the audience what was promised on page 3. HOLD UP!!!  WTF does this have to do with MARKETING and EDUCATION and EXPOSURE. If you sit down and think about it you will realize\u2026 EVERYTHING\u2026 it can DIRECTLY parallel what we want to do. Page 1. What is our Mood.  Who are we.  Our image. Our theme.  Do we have any comedy? Page 3. What is our theme, what are trying to do? What is our Message? and What is it we ultimately want to accomplish? What do we want to deliver to our customer? Page 30 what happens to keep us from our goal? What makes us Change?  What happens to Show that we can overcome? What do we commit to? ",

In movies it is to keep things interesting and the audience on the edge of their seats. apply the same arc and you can a very interesting and exciting ride with a marketing campaign. Q: hey\u2026 you just said you can choose anything\u2026 isn\u2019t that lying? A: well, yes.  and No.  In film industry, \u201cit is the most expensive movie ever made!!\u201d is definitely a lie. BUT, it is all about where you measure from. Q: That STILL does not sound like the truth. A: What is the definition of truth? don\u2019t bother looking i\u2019ll just tell you.  TRUTH is Fidelity to the original or standard. Q: Wha?? A: what is the standard of measurement?  are you taking what the dollar was worth in 1941 or 2020 ?  So as Obi-Wan told Luke\u2026 It is a simple point of view. NOW\u2026 I did something in this message that is a marketing trick\u2026 used all the time.  Can you tell me What I did? ",
