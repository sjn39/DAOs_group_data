We\u2019ve hosted KTS in a bomb shelter, in Kyiv, Ukraine. interesting facts about Kyiv Tech Summit:  even during wartime, 500+ builders joined us, and we had 46 project submissions. considerable amount of projects are still active and shipping.  Vitalik traveled for the first-time ever to Ukraine, to support people of Ukraine and meet the builders in a bomb shelter. what a legend. we\u2019ve hosted fantastic panel on Public Goods ft.

Player distribution: 22% - United States; 37% - Asia (esp. Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China); 41% - Europe (esp.

During OP month, we\u2019ve launched OP native / partner clubhouses only. We\u2019ve been experimenting for a year+ and soon we\u2019ll be launching new maps, and will continue to onboard new players into Optimism.  Community feedback We take community feedback seriously and since the beginning been mindful about asking for voluntarily feedback via \u2018AW\u2013OP Month: Game Feedback\u2019, featured in-game. We\u2019ve received 23.3k form replies, and after some quality filtering - identified 2042 responses with the 1-5 rating explanation, as well as over 1000+ mid/high quality replies (i\u2019ve personally read all of them). 1209 users (59,2%) rated 5/5  the overall experience with the quests, video/voice call, and world itself; 541 (26.5%) voted 4/5; 211 (10,3%) voted 3/5; 55 (2,7%) voted 2/5; and only 26 (1,3%) voted 1/5 - out of 2042 responses.  General Community Feedback  \u201cPretty interesting, allowing players to explore the map while completing quests.\u201d \u201cThe concept is very unique and clear\u201d \u201dI love the gamified education for introducing OP to the world.\u201d \u201ci am excited! interface, user experience, fast interaction, music! i love it\u201d \u201dgreat game for user to learning how to enter the web3 world, especially OP eco\u201d \u201cI love the graphic setting you have chosen, in pixel art !!! Of course, other projects that use more advanced graphics and features could be more appealing to the mass but if well structured, the project\u2019s quest and social network structure could give you an edge\u201d \u201cit\u2019s good  because we discover the DEFI applications really simply and fast\u201d  \u201dIt runs in a browser, and the operation proceeds smoothly. I don\u2019t like to download any software to my PC, so it is helpful that it runs in a browser.\u201d \u201dI like how y\u2019all have voice chat options almost everywhere because most platforms missing this key feature.\u201d \u201dI like your idea very much. This brings back memories of Perfect world, Warcraft, Lineage 2\u201d \u201dExcellent picture quality, high playability, interesting dialogue design\u201d  Of course, there was also user feedback about in-game bugs(we\u2019ve fixed), improvement ideas, and more! We\u2019ve particularly appreciated feedback from users that voted game experience less than 5 and explained their logic. Some examples include:  \u201dDifficult to follow at first because there is no map on where to go. But overall the quest are exciting and fun\u201d \u201cso many buildings and roads, complicated, but the drawing is good, and a new way interacting with dapps.\u201d \u201cI hope it can be made into an RPG type\u201d \u201dMaybe try adding other languages like Chinese?\u201d \u201cIf you have a choice of avatar, that\u2019s the best\u201d  \u201dgood idea of a game ,however i think you need to upgrade the graphics to be more interesting in gaming community to play it .\u201d  This is critical feedback, and it truly means the world - it helps us improve Atlantis World, and serve our mission of onboarding users into web3. Obviously, we\u2019re still early - we\u2019ve just shipped v1 of our public alpha, and will continue to experiment, iterate and improve AW - be it gameplay, web3 onboarding, UX/UI, art, quests, social features, protocol integrations, and more! As for \u2018other languages\u2019, \u2018RPG\u2019, \u2018easy to follow maps\u2019, \u2018upgrade the graphics\u2019, \u2018character customisability\u2019, etc - it\u2019s on the roadmap, so let our actions speak for themselves.
