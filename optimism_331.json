                    "content": "Hey Everyone! Great discussion today. Here is the recording of the call: November 8 2022 community call 8.mp4 - Google Drive. Notes from the call:  Lots of new governance posts dropped! Best place to find them is here: Guide to Season 3: Course Correcting  We will be distributing committee funds using a hybrid approach, 1/2 distributed equally and 1/2 in proportion to the # of proposals reviewed. In response to Messari asking about the appropriate place for the proposal, look at the new posts & we may have some kind of \u201cservice provider\u201d proposal type in the future. Lots of discussion happening already in this thread but we discussed improvements on committees, participation, and effectiveness of grants Idea: have a delegate sponsor a proposal Proposers getting feedback from multiple committees was confusing Idea: Maybe have a single bigger committee Idea: Don\u2019t limit the # of committees, accept all who pass. Committees did seem help out delegates as far as effort to vote goes. Idea: send survey to proposers to see how the process was for them. Idea: have scaling vote threshold for amount of OP requested. For example, 4mil OP grants should have more buyin than 100k grants General consensus that we would love having the committee recommendations directly in the snapshot description for voting.  If I missed anything let me know and I\u2019ll add it! -Michael  ",
