Many prominent efforts have emerged as alternatives to \u201cgrants from whales\u201d: Moloch DAO, MetaCartel DAO, all of the options that Gitcoin offers, and the innovations of Vitalik Buterin / Zo\u00eb Hitzig / Glen Weyl. It might be helpful to  to have an open tool set for funding based on the ideas of \u201cLiberal Radicalism\u201d (CLR), perhaps this would lead to wider adoption and new things build on top of the approach. But I wonder: isn\u2019t it too early to standardize? Shouldn\u2019t it be roughly tested more with the community first with efforts like Gitcoin CLR Matching? Update: in a comment Vitalik points out that for quadratic funding standards, work is needed right now in identity systems. Please respond here if you are interested, and reach out to those in the community already discussing CLR and identity. This includes Kevin Owocki, Alex Masmej, Mark Beylin. If a Ring forms, I will create a category here in the Forum to encourage discussions. Also, for more deep diving and explorations, check out Vitalik\u2019s latest ball of lightning: Quadratic Payments: A Primer ",

Gitcoin in particular does all of their CLR logic off-chain (which I think makes a lot of sense for their purposes given speed to market, their current architecture, etc.), so I wonder if the standard would make sense as an EIP unless more of it is onchain? There could be non-EIP standards though, of course. Gitcoin will be presenting at the next Chicago Ethereum Meetup in part about quadratic voting / CLR, and we may have our members do a mini CLR to decide how to prioritize which dapp pilots we want to run at upcoming meetups with a small matching pool. I\u2019ll note that whenever a standard emerges, different architectures would make sense for small numbers of M contributors and N recipients than for large numbers. For instance, if the numbers are small enough, the approved M and N addresses could live directly in a contract so that the distribution at the end could happen via a contract function call. ",

Users can generally create multiple accounts using different pseudonyms (or address in the case of crypto-networks) to receive rewards multiple times, bias votes, write multiple fake reviews, etc. We introduce Proof of Humanity, a system combining social verification with video submission in order to create a Sybil proof list of humans.  According to the  Kleros Development Update: April 2020, smart contracts have been developed for the Proof of Humanity project. ",
