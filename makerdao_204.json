The content of the post should not in any way be relied upon as legal, business, investment, financial or tax advice. Dear Community, this post kicks off a thread to collaborate in a SES-backed project we named Real-World Sandbox. It will be a 5-week intense project that we hope will give everybody the occasion to contribute and shape what Maker\u2019s role can be within the monetary and lending stack. My role will be that of merely facilitate and formalise outputs, in addition to contribute based on my experience and ideas. You can read the document and see the full recording here: drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sHuqfiktRl0paAAUub9TK_yoWsFfhzst  The Challenge Maker\u2019s expansion to encompass use cases that aren\u2019t native of the blockchain, like real-world financing, is vital for DAI\u2019s sustainable development but has brought forward a new set of challenges. Those challenges have sparked wider questions about what Maker\u2019s role within the wider monetary and lending stack is \u2013 as demonstrated by SG\u2019s recent MIP-6 and by @rune\u2019s call to action in proposing Maker as an engine for a sustainable development. What we call the lending stack is a complex ecosystem of different actors, with a set of often adversarial incentives and little visibility compared to the world of smart contracts. For this reason, decentralisation and removal of single points of failure becomes even more crucial. Defining Maker\u2019s ideal position within the stack is a difficult, and iterative, task, that should include the wide Community \u2013 although facilitated by dedicated Core Units. A similar stylised representation doesn\u2019t apply only to real-world financing, but to the wider lending eco-system. In this space, attracting people with relevant TradFi experience is key for a successful development.   The Proposed Approach The SES CU and the project team believe that a few activities could be instrumental for removing the barriers between decentralised capital and the workforce in the context of real-world financing:   Develop a common vision of the lending stack and of Maker\u2019s role within it, in accordance with the DAO\u2019s long-term view of its role within the world  Formalise a detailed manifesto of this vision \u2013 such a manifesto (subject to governance approvals) will influence how internal (Community, MKR holders, CUs, etc.) and external (potential partners) engage with Maker on the topic of real-world financing  Define, as a consequence of such manifesto, a clear roadmap to incubate, alongside the existing RWF CU, other agile groups (potentially CUs) dedicated to reducing and monitoring risks for the preservation of the DAI  Keep incentivising a culture of continuous decentralisation and development, in accordance with SES\u2019s core ambitions   So, What Now? The next week will be focused on activity (1), i.e. trying to understand and formalise a common vision of what is the TradiFi-DeFi monetary and lending stack, and where is Maker currently playing within it. We invite all interested parties, both internal and external, to contribute to the thread below. For those who, for several legitimate reasons, want to communicate with me directly, you can do it at [email\u00a0protected]. Let\u2019s now make the world a better place. ",

                    "content": " Week 1: Develop a Common Vision of the Lending Stack Topics:    The lending stack     The key differences between TradFi and DeFi     Maker\u2019s best position within the lending stack    1. The Lending Stack As we have discussed over the last days, what we call the lending stack (or actually the lending and monetary stack) is a complicated beast and trying to understand it is of paramount importance before arguing and formalising where Maker could fit. For the benefit of the community, I will try offer here a high-level view of the way I see it \u2013 a longer version of it can be found in a post called Full-Stack Central Banking. Lending means providing a tangible resource in exchange for a promise to share value. When virtuous, the value generated is dependant in some way on the lending being there in the first place. That is why the function of lending and that of monetary creation are deeply interconnected. Money has the core function of incentivising the allocation of capital and labour to fruitful uses. Sovereign issuers of money, being the FED, the ECB, and Maker, do mint the currency but cannot do everything on their own to spot the best end-users of that currency. That is why they use conduits of some kind. In the TradFi old world those conduits are commercial banks that do print money for eligible borrowers. That bank money is almost similar to that printed by the central bank - thanks to preferential agreements, but not an exact copy. If a bank goes under savers will lose some portion of their deposits, and the same cannot happen for banknotes. A portion of the lending that is created, the top quality bit \u2013 so-called eligible collateral, can get re-financed directly by the sovereign issuers at negligible rates. The rest stays on the bank\u2019s balance sheets, or gets distributed out to investors that have a different risk/ return appetite.  image1456\u00d71030 118 KB  2. The Key Differences Between TradFi and DeFi A similar portrait can be done of the DAI sovereign monetary system. I call it sovereign because it is managed and sustained by MakerDAO\u2019s communal efforts. It is the trust in such efforts that back the DAI, in the same way that trust on the US economy \u2013 as well as on the virtuous link between the FED and the US economy, backs the USD. For as much as we, in DeFi, criticise the FED policies, the fact that the DAI is pegged to it is an implicit testament of the permanence of such trust. In Maker\u2019s case, MakerDAO is the sovereign issuer, conduits are Vaults, and ultimate borrowers the users of those vaults. MakerDAO, like the FED, writes the rules at which ultimate borrowers can access those discount windows. Like the FED, there is some form of over-collateralisation; the monetary expansion happens somewhere else along the lending stack. There is another point of contact: MakerDAO, like the FED, should have the stability of the currency as its core value. The FED has a wider mandate that incorporates other stuff, but I would put that aside for a the time being. Real-World Financing (or RWF) applications sit somewhere in between, but are not again dissimilar in principle. It is therefore very important, in my view, to converge on a vision of what type of lender will Maker be in the real-world financing stack. 3. Maker\u2019s Best Position Within the Lending Stack In my opinion, Maker\u2019s position shouldn\u2019t be (too) dissimilar from that of central banks in the USD or Euro sovereign systems. With a mandate of sustainable growth rather than profit maximisation, Maker should act as the ultimate lender against the highest collateral quality, leaving the rest of the value chain to allocate other portions of the risk spectrum. Sustainable growth still requires evangelisation and education on our side, but I believe that the job of the RWF CU, projects like the Real-World Sandbox, and interactions with counterparties like SocGen, are instrumental to all this. We, as a community, shouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of being able to mint currency at an almost negligible cost. This is a testament of the trust of the wider DeFi ecosystem for Maker\u2019s governance principles and the quality of the collaterals onboarded. Such trust should not in any way be compromised. With such negligible cost of minting new DAI, it is my belief that we should focus more on expanding the collateral footprint rather than in onboarding collateral that yields higher returns \u2013 but carries significant higher risk. There are several instances of this type of collateral, and SocGen\u2019s MIP6 is a great example \u2013 you can read my detailed views here. I will explore other similar types of collateral in the next days and weeks. There is one, remaining, important element that I would like to stress: such collateral, as it happens for SocGen\u2019s OFH tokens, doesn\u2019t always appear in its ultimate form in nature, but is instead the result of careful sourcing, structuring, and packaging. As in the OFH case, most of this careful work has been de facto outsourced to the issuer and its partners, and the token itself is the result of immense work in the background \u2013 such work has been done in order to obtain the privilege to access MakerDAO\u2019s sovereign ecosystem. For all these reasons, acting as a super-senior, programmatic, lender of the highest quality collateral in passive partnership with sophisticated and motivated intermediaries could be consistent with Maker\u2019s core mandate of protecting the DAI, as well as with the principles of economic sustainability, decentralisation and dynamism at the base of the project.

                    "content": " Why Extra Security Matters We have been advocating for ultra-seniority, ultra-standardisation, ultra-institutionalisation of the real-world collateral types and counterparties Maker could engage with in RWF. Everything has a cost, and the cost of the extra-prudence in RWF comes in the form of missed volumes. Still, it is my belief that, when considering Maker\u2019s core ambition of preserving DAI, those costs are more than justified. This is because lending is a very difficult activity, made of often adversarial incentives that are difficult to balance even for the most experienced and resourceful experts out there. The story of Greensill, that I report below, is one worth sharing as a reminder.  The Collapse of Greensill Capital Greensill Capital was a financial intermediary based in the UK and Australia, focusing on the provision of supply chain financing and other services. The firm was founded in 2011 by Lex Greensill and had diversified its activities beyond supply chain financing into conventional banking \u2013 through a German regulated banking subsidiary, and fund management \u2013 via a partnership with Credit Suisse and others. In 2018 General Atlantic, an American private equity firm, invested USD 250m in Greensill. In 2019 it was Softbank\u2019s turn, with USD 800m. In 2020, the firm started pursuing additional investments, aiming at raising further USD 500-600m and subsequently complete an IPO. Contextually, KPMG, Deloitte, and BDO, decided to become the firm\u2019s auditor, preparing its public profile for the next steps to come. It would be difficult to come up with a more regulated entity than Greensill. Greensill was a major player in the market of supply chain financing, where a lender advances payments to a major buyer\u2019s suppliers for a fee. This is not something new, as banks have been engaged in these activities since medieval times. Greensill story, however, would turn differently. Greensill crisis began when the Sydney unit of insurance giant Tokio Marine decided not to extend policies covering the loans the company had made, and fired the manager who had a key role in signing off those policies. Around the same time, the German regulator BaFin started a probe into his fast-growing bank. BaFin was concerned that too many of the assets of Greensill Bank were tied to the same source: Gupta. The investigation found numerous irregularities. When the company lost a legal fight to get Tokio Marine extending insurance the credit quality got questioned, valuations became tougher, and Credit Suisse froze the Greensill-linked funds. GAM followed. On March 3, the German financial regulator shut Greensill Bank to save money for depositors and creditors. The story, that costed investors several billions, had many controversies: involving Softbank - both equity investor in Greensill and early backer of the funds managed by Credit Suisse and linked to Greensill itself, GFG Alliance \u2013 a company linked to steel magnate Gupta against which Greensill had USD 5b exposure, David Cameron \u2013 the former UK Prime Minister had a prominent role of advisor in Greensill and had lobbied extensively to have the company included as one of the partners to issue COVID-related extraordinary financing.  The Moral of the Story It wasn\u2019t enough for several counterparties reviewing Greensill\u2019s activities to avoid this to happen, including rating agencies, accounting firms, seasoned investors, renown regulators. Lending is a difficult beast to tame, and as soon as the appetite for yield (and volume) dominate decision making things can turn sour. The further away we go from regulation, size, standardisation, we go into the credit risk spectrum, the more amplified those risks are. We should keep this in mind ",

I don\u2019t recall right now but it was either SB or CS who was an investor but at the same time majority of the funds went their way (some subsidiaries were having financed their supply chain needs)\u2026 Nonetheless, I agree that the riskier the asset classes/types the more complex system in place we need to risk manage it\u2026 But another lesson worth keeping in mind is that the financial world is driven by bonuses and so even if things are coming from a major bank and are rated triple A then it might not necessarily mean it\u2019s a real, secure, senior product but could be a bunch of garbage stamped as AAA\u2026 It wasn\u2019t that long ago, right? For me the whole discussion you initiated is first and foremost about the strategic role, sort of vision for Maker, and a few key questions arise:   Is Maker a Super-Bank (Fed-like) or more a typical Bank (and then is it more consumer or business or corporations-facing)? Maybe we should think more in a DeFi than TradFi way and figure out our own sweet spot? What could that be?   What\u2019s the long-term vision? Is it to be a profitable financial institution or more a source of good (vide Rune\u2019s Clean Money initiative)? Maybe it should be both, profitable and a \u201cdo-gooder\u201d?   After some heavy, strategic direction discussion, then some questions should follow:  What\u2019s the priority \u2013 increasing scale, maximizing profits, value of MKR, stability\u2026? What are the best products for both our strategy and the priorities? How can we scale them sustainably (own resources, intermediaries, etc.)? How do we put in place best risk management practices so that we realize the vision, strategy and priorities? What resources do we need (internal, external) so that we keep the defined Sharpe ratio in place?  That\u2019s how I see it. First some bigger stones need to be taken out of the way, and then smaller and smaller. Hope my few cents are anyhow helpful  Cheers and best of luck with the process! G ",

                    "content": "Thanks for your message @Tru_Greg, You make all relevant points. The intention of my post about Greensill story was to prove the complexity of credit markets, even when \u2018standardised\u2019 and \u2018regulated\u2019, and the exposure to profit taking of the several intermediaries involved. It is, as often happens, more than a pure story of greed - it is a story of lack of controls, flawed policies, and imperfect risk management. Anybody with a solid risk management would have spotted (as they did) inconsistencies in the Greensill story. I also posted it to stimulate attention of the broader public around topics that are not always exciting. Regarding your other strategic points, I believe those are extremely relevant and tie with the post recently published by @Porter_Smith from a16z. I can express only my personal opinions, and not that of the community, and I am trying to condense those in the report I am putting together. First of all, I think that Maker is a sovereign issuer of currency, in this way closer to a central bank than a commercial bank, but it is, let\u2019s say, a central bank with limited independence - and a strong peg with another hard currency, the USD. The reasons behind are many, but I could highlight what I think are the two pain ones: (1) lack of a wide and uncorrelated collateral base, (2) inability to make of the currency a credible source of revenues - those revenues are taxes and repatriations on USD and might be some other form in DeFi. Still, I believe that as it happens for other central banks, Maker\u2019s focus should be in expanding its currency footprint and preserving its stability. I talk in monetary terms of course, and not about a broader mission. This, obviously has an impact on what type of profitability ambitions the community could have. Given the significant operating leverage that Maker has (i.e. its ability to mint currency at very limited costs), the community could generate healthy profits without taking significant credit risk in the form of high interest rates. Again, as we said before, the higher the interest rates the higher the known and unknown risks. @rune\u2019s call to action on fighting the climate catastrophe is an important beacon that could act as a pillar of DAI as a sovereign currency, in the same way some constitutional principles should drive the behaviour of sovereign economies. A question of process, then, emerges, with Maker being committed to the concepts of decentralisation and distribution of powers and responsibilities. This too should drive the constitution of a framework. I believe that we have a lot of work ahead of us, but it is nothing short of exciting. I hope this symposium will help stimulating the conversations. Regards, Luca ",

We hope you guys could participate. For those of you whose love the details, obviously, my DMs are open on [email\u00a0protected] or on our Discord server. Key Topics:  The differences between central banking, commercial banking, and investment banking What are the institutional requirements for credit How this could translate into credit eligibility criteria  More Detail: It is our belief that Maker should resemble much more a central bank than a commercial or investment bank. Thanks to its negligible cost of capital (i.e. of minting DAI) the Community has all the levers to act in accordance with its core principle: protect a sustainable development of the DAI footprint. This means that erring on the side of caution has merit. In practice, being more similar to a central bank means underwriting few, safe, types of underlying credit (e.g. short-term corporate credit, certain pockets of consumer credit, bank credit) with probability of the default <1% and a safe, institutionalised, and often regulated, structure. The same level of prudence should be applied when we select the counterparties we work with. All this, obviously, although extremely scalable in the long term, will have costs in terms of slow growth in the short term, while the ecosystem outside gets aligned along Maker\u2019s principles and way of working. Although the Real-World Finance CU led by @SebVentures has been progressing in a slightly different way by bootstrapping growth into the space, we believe that by parallelising different approaches we could improve the long-term growth potential and foster decentralisation and innovation. But, most importantly, do you agree with those principles? Do you think Maker should actually have a different mandate? Or risk appetite? We would love to hear from you. If so, why? Details on the presentation will come soon, stay tuned! And have a good Lisbon/ weekend everyone. Luca ",

The effort of this initiative has become even more relevant following @rune\u2019s comments on his vision of an \u2018Arranger Model\u2019. Although not fully overlapping with the detailed implementation that the Real-World Sandbox project has in mind, the two projects share the same ambitions and core principles, and are for this reason fully synergic. We hope to be able to incubate within our work the views of the most relevant and engaged stakeholders. During this week\u2019s Governand & Risk Meeting (which will be held on Thursday as usual, we will quickly present again the project to a wide audience and offer a brief update on the status of things. We will be happy to organise another, more detailed, call following this one to go through the details of the report. We hope that as many as possible will join and interact. As usual, I thank @Juan, @wouter, and the rest of the SES team for the support. Luca ",

                    "content": "I do agree with the principle that Maker should resemble more of a central bank than an investment bank.  That makes sense given the super low cost of capital we benefit from. That said, being an investment bank can have a lot of impact.  For me, the really interesting opportunity lies somewhere at the intersection of managing risk, but also using the low cost of capital to help fund projects that have a positive impact on the world but may be hard to fund in the traditional markets.  There is no shortage of \u2018green financing\u2019 in TradFi atm.  What there\u2019s a shortage of is financing for high impact projects that cost more to develop than low impact projects. An example: a friend of mine is developing a retirement community in the UK atm.  He wants it to be net zero, but to do so will cost an extra \u00a35m (of his total \u00a340m development costs).  The extra cost of developing to carbon neutral are going to hammer his returns, and the bank won\u2019t lend him anything additional because they don\u2019t see the value in developing to a net zero spec.  Where Maker could step in would be to offer slightly lower interest rates than the traditional banks (not increasing the gearing levels to put Maker more at risk, just offering lower rates), on the condition that the spread between what he would get in TradFi and what Maker will lend at is spent entirely on developing to a net zero spec. That way everyone wins: Maker funds a low risk project (senior debt with conservative gearing levels), the developer gets to build the scheme to net zero while still maintaining his profit margin, and a great project gets funded in a sustainable way that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. This is a granular example and I\u2019m not suggesting funding lots of small projects is sustainable, but it\u2019s an illustration of where we could use our low cost of capital to have a positive impact in the market while also managing risk.  If we\u2019re just going to fund solar farms then probably these can get funded in the TradFi market anyway, so we have to ask ourselves if we\u2019re really adding that much value and taking full advantage of our low cost of capital?!

At the bottom of it, even central banks have an \u2018industrial agenda\u2019 and are ready to step in and support (with the help of treasury) certain industries that are perceived strategic or beneficial for the community. I don\u2019t see why maker should be any different. As soon as the Clean Money strategy will be completed, and in the case it will be approved, I\u2019m looking forward for somebody with the delegated power in the community to draft the industrial guidelines of such strategy. Those guidelines could be incorporated into Maker\u2019s risk appetite and credit risk framework. I\u2019ll make an example. Let\u2019s assume that Maker will decide to allocate Xm DA\u00cd to an industry labelled Clean Money, and that a Clean Money core unit would have the power to stamp a project as worth of such name. The Clean Money bucket might have less stringent eligibility criteria than standard credit (lower expected return, different geographic mix, etc), but still comply with Maker\u2019s risk appetite through other credit enhancement mechanisms. I strongly believe that the DAO should be courageous in trying to give a fruitful direction to the money minted. All this, however, needs to remain controlled by a tight framework, otherwise the whole initiative will be ruled by exceptions and be exposed to key men failures rather than being embedded in a clear process. I\u2019m curious to hear your views but I\u2019m planning to incorporate this principle in the report. Best, Luca ",

                    "content": "Hi @justin1066 Firstly I like your friends thinking: building for Net Zero is clearly the future. The problem, as he has encountered, is pricing this \u2018future proofing\u2019 into the lending terms - it simply isn\u2019t there yet in the general credit world at all. If you take a look at the MIP6 for Monetalis , that my colleagues and I released you will see how we are trying to solve this problem: for green assets (which a non-zero building would be - without of course knowing the specifics of your friends idea), we want to provide advantaged terms (i.e. interest etc) compared to the general market, but there has to be a underlying economic logic for doing so. The reason is that when your lending business start engaging in a \u2018trading profit for purpose\u2019 business path, it starts to get very tricky to manage, tricky to grow substantially, work with partners and external capital etc. - when the borders between charity and profit-seeking business starts to blur, it gets very very hard to manage. One usually needs to get the company to a \u2018profit with purpose\u2019 state - achieving both without compromising either. Luckily though, there are quite a lot of research on value creation from a good number of green assets that allows us to start creating advantaged conditions. Have a look at this summary picture for real estate as an example:  846\u00d7795 177 KB  In practice right now, at Monetalis, we are working on a few simple factors to see if how we can create some advantages there - and have sufficient research to back up these up - and so meet the profit with purpose condition. a) Interest: as interest is/should be related to risk, we should be able to lower it, as we find \u201cgreen buildings\u201d to have lower risk in resale, compliance (and sometimes construction) and future regulatory burden. But how much is indeed the question we are working hard to establish. b) LTV. There is some research to suggest that green buildings are undervalued (and traditional buildings overvalued) based upon coming/expected regulation and burdens from government (as green economy externality effects gets appropriately captured in these). If this indeed is the case - and our credit underwriting be based upon this higher value - then LTV on a current market basis could be higher for a Net Zero property. At the very least, the lower risk logic above should allow for green buildings to be a the top end of the range for our LTV requirements. c) Given above logic on this type of building being a lower risk asset, we should also be able to provide a package of longer payback and/or interest payment holidays etc\u2026 Again setting these are not that easy. At Monetalis we will have working models for this over this year. We are pretty confident about getting to good results on a) and c) - b) is a bit more difficult. Should the Maker community be in favour of our application, then hopefully we should be able to help borrowers such as your friend via our lending partners over 2022. This is a bit \u2018frontier finance\u2019 and so we have to walk a bit carefully out this road, but certainly the world must move in this direction in my personal view. I hope this sheds a bit of light on at least \u2018one strain of practical thought\u2019 for how to solve the problem your friend is encountering. Best of luck to your friend with his project of course! ",

More and more people have been reaching out to offer their views and show support for what we have been trying to build, and I thank you all for this. I thought useful to try to summarise what those next steps would be here on the thread:  I am working on a first draft of a document that will try to describe WHAT we want to engage in when it comes to real-world financing, and HOW we want to do it - this first draft of the report will be ready in the next two weeks and will be shared here on the thread and on other channels The community shouldn\u2019t expect the report to be a long, boring, and prescriptive document on how to do things, but rather a manifesto detailing a framework, a set of high level principles, that could drive what we do when we engage with real-world counterparts; I like to make a comparison with the legal system: the report will not be a comprehensive civil code but rather the constitution in a common law system - as it happens for common law, it will be the precedents (i.e. the MIP6s that will be approved or rejected), to act as detailed guidance on how things should be done  Following the publication of the first draft, we will organise a call to present the project and give the opportunity to all interested parties to provide feedback Such presentation will open a consultation phase, during which we will try to improve what we have done Following the completion of such consultation phase, it is my hope that what we have been working on will see the light and be implemented through governance and organisational changes within the Community  I am aware we are shaping what might be the future of business financing for decades to come, and I am truly excited to be part of this avant-garde of thinkers and practitioners. I am thankful for this every day. Bests, Luca ",

I apologise to those I spoke to who haven\u2019t been included in such group at this stage, there will be many occasions to contribute. Next steps. I am aiming at receiving feedback on the report by the end of the week, and at incorporating such feedback over the weekend.

We will publish the report on this thread by next week, an open a consultation phase (maybe kicking it off with a presentation). Such consultation phase will last a TBD number of weeks, depending on the intensity of the debate. Regards, Luca ",

I really like the way you\u2019re framing the discussion, starting with an outline of the lending stack and defining the higher-level conceptual objective is excellent - I\u2019m looking forward to reading the manifesto when it\u2019s shared with the wider community. I\u2019ll save my questions and comments for when the document is ready, but I\u2019m curious to see how much of the approach will involve non-physical asset related solutions. From what I can keep up with, much of the real-world financing discussion centers around physical assets. If Maker is to act more like a central bank, then a lot of the concepts pre-Breton Woods would be useful. Particularly concepts around the lender of last resort, foreign exchange reserves, and an international settlement asset would seem very relevant for a \u201ccentral bank of the future\u201d. Looking forward to seeing this further. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @luca_pro for the \u2018RWA Manifesto\u2019 that sets out an unifying vision and practical strategies that MakerDao could adopt to scale RWA collaterals safely and quickly. What I particularly like about the manifesto is that it is more like a common law rather than a civil code. Having lived under both systems (U.K. and Vietnam) I believe that \u2018common law\u2019, albeit not always seems efficient, would be most appropriate given the early stage of the RWA strategy. The principles of decentralisation and equanimity of counterparties before MakerDao reinforce our confidence and hope that by partnering with Maker we could change the world together. At this point, I would like to have a few observations:   the \u2018arranger model\u2019: hopefully we can see it being fleshed about a bit more, perhaps not necessarily in the document, but as more and more arranger \u2018case law\u2019 appear. For example, when referring to \u2018skin in the game\u2019 the report said the arranger might not necessarily need to provide an extreme high level of risk capital\u2019 - What is \u2018extremely high\u2019? as a proportion of total credit enhancement in a particular structure?   how to reconcile the focus on short term corporate debts (eg invoice financing) and \u2018bank\u2019 loans, among others, and not on \u2018long term\u2019 corporate debts with the \u2018a case for Clean Money\u2019 where collaterals such as corporate green bonds (use-of-proceed green bonds are often long term corporate debts) are onboarded? Green financing is at a stage where longer term financing eg construction loans, are needed to bring the green assets into being.   Issuer countries listed have strong rules of law but how do we deal with a cross border situation, which is eligible, where underlying collaterals were originated in a third country but, for some reasons such as currency control, tax, or local banking regulation, are unable to be sold to the issuer SPV located in the likes of US, Canada, U.K, EEA, Japan? It is quite typical in trade finance, for example, that the exporter invoices are originated in a country, say, in Asia to a buyer, say, in Europe and it is not always possible or efficient to transfer the assets to the Issuer SPV in an \u2018accepted\u2019 jurisdiction such as Luxembourg.   Blockchain is mentioned only once in the context of RWA collaterals not being native to it. Whilst I agree that we can learn/replicate TraFi, particularly on proven legal structures that offer strong protection, isn\u2019t the opportunity here is also to innovate beyond Trafi with the power of blockchain? starting with on-chain tracking of collaterals and covenants?   Perhaps some of the above were discussed on the call this afternoon which I couldn\u2019t attend. Hope this provide some points for discussion as we are going through the very onboarding process at the moment. (Made some edits on second reading of the report) ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your message @quntangled. Too bad you couldn\u2019t join the presentation, SES will post a recording of the session soon I believe so you will have the chance to go through what has been discussed. Thank you also for the support to the core principles of our initiative, I believe this is the right spirit to enact change. Let me try to respond to your points.     quntangled:  the \u2018arranger model\u2019   @rune post on the arranger model was a powerful call to action to the community, that in some ways brings back concepts that have existed in the world of real-world credit already. What we mean when we referred to a model open to arrangers in the report, was that our credit framework is agnostic to the existence of arrangers. In our mind, arrangers are facilitators, intermediaries, that leverage their knowledge of Maker to facilitate business willing to access. They are, in their purest form, for a lack of a better term, consultants to the counterparty. In their role as consultant, they might not be required to put sizeable capital at risk. This doesn\u2019t mean that capital at risk shouldn\u2019t be put in, it simply means that such capital might come from other counterparts, i.e. the ones that are truly involved in stacking the loan structure. In the case of arrangers that are not purely consultants but a hybrid form, the situation would be different. Again, our framework wants to be agnostic vis-a-vis structures and counterparts, at the end of the day that junior capital at risk must be there, and those who do origination and retain the management of such risk should remain heavily exposed not only to the upside, but also to the downside.     quntangled:  What is \u2018extremely high\u2019? as a proportion of total credit enhancement in a particular structure?   The appropriate skin in the game will depend on the structure and on the underlying collateral. As a rule of thumb, in the market out there it might vary between 5% (minimum securitisation residual requirement) and 20%+ (for novel or riskier exposures). Maker exposure should be senior to that and, when the conditions require it, senior to a mezzanine tranche that would be provided by creditors with higher return requirements.     quntangled:  how to reconcile the focus on short term corporate debts (eg invoice financing) and \u2018bank\u2019 loans, among others, and not on \u2018long term\u2019 corporate debts with the \u2018a case for Clean Money\u2019 where collaterals such as corporate green bonds (use-of-proceed green bonds are often long term corporate debts) are onboarded?   This is a great question. In the report, we mentioned the credit types that are the most appropriate for Maker\u2019s set up. That doesn\u2019t mean that those types should be exclusive. What this means, is that other types of credit would have certain structuring and risk mitigation requirements that allow them to be digestible by Maker. Also, what it means is that those characteristics should be taken into consideration when a portfolio approach emerges, i.e. when Maker would put together its risk appetite for what % goes into revolving credit, what % goes into long-term green bonds, etc. Another thing to note, and something that I should actually clarify in the next version, is that the report refers only to credit risk and not to anything else. A portfolio approach should be considered also to handle liquidity and ALM (asset-liability management) risk.     quntangled:  Issuer countries listed have strong rules of law but how do we deal with a cross border situation, which is eligible, where underlying collaterals were originated in a third country but, for some reasons such as currency control, tax, or local banking regulation, are unable to be sold to the issuer SPV located in the likes of US, Canada, U.K, EEA, Japan?   This is a legal point that I am not the best person to answer to. But a crucial point to assess.     quntangled:  Blockchain is mentioned only once in the context of RWA collaterals not being native to it. Whilst I agree that we can learn/replicate TraFi, particularly on proven legal structures that offer strong protection, isn\u2019t the opportunity here is also to innovate beyond Trafi with the power of blockchain? starting with on-chain tracking of collaterals and covenants?   Great point, and something we have discussed in the call (towards the end). I personally believe that in the long term every aspect of the credit flow will migrate into the blockchain, and can\u2019t wait to see this happen. But it will be us who will need to drive the migration, and a strong mental model is crucial in setting the right direction. I hope I answered your questions, looking forward to more comments. ",

                    "content": "MakerDAO as a central bank I understand that the author wants to place MakerDAO in line with central bank in term of behavior. One thing is to have a meme of decentral bank of DeFi the other is to have a serious discussion on this. Central banks enjoy a monopoly and are not driven by profit. Even when the bank of England was for-profit, shareholders weren\u2019t well treated. Is that what we want for MakerDAO?  Indeed, it cannot be wondered at that the Bank proprietors do not quite like their position. Theirs is the oldest bank in the City, but their profits do not increase, while those of other banks most rapidly increase. In 1844, the dividend on the stock of the Bank of England was 7 per cent, and the price of the stock itself 212; the dividend now is 9 per cent, and the price of the stock 232. But in the same time the shares of the London and Westminster Bank, in spite of an addition of 100 per cent to the capital, have risen from 27 to 66, and the dividend from 6 per cent to 20 per cent. That the Bank proprietors should not like to see other companies getting richer than their company is only natural. Bagehot, Walter. Lombard Street : a description of the money market  It is also unclear how much of a monopoly DAI enjoys. Sure, it is currently the main decentralized stablecoin but it would be hubris to think it will last forever. This hypothesis is not backed by research in the report but is used as an important assumption. Maybe the report should explore more in detail why MakerDAO should be seen as a central bank and the implication that. Risk appetite of MakerDAO Unrelated to consider MakerDAO like a central bank is the risk appetite. And it could be in line with central bank (which are banks after all). @luca_pro suggests mimicking the ECB risk appetite. First, the logical conclusion is to keep RWA small for the time being. If the aim is to generate a few basis points, maybe doing nothing is even better. Luca asks for less than 1% of PD (probability of default). Assuming loss given default (LGD) is not 100% and market are somewhat efficient, it will give you a few basis points over the risk free-rate. Notice as well that the ECB will accept some collaterals but will add a haircut (a CR). You can see that for Asset-Backed Securities (what we are dealing with mainly), you need to be at A- or above and still end up with a 24% haircut (CR 130%). This 24% of capital should come from somewhere. The short term ETF proposal was already riskier. There is no discussion about the cost structure. Going super safe and getting 0.05-0.20% interest rate could lead to a certain loss after factoring in the structural costs. In our current pipeline, no one besides SocGen is even rated (Tinka might get a rating on a similar ABS issuance tho). So if the community wants to go that road, we can start by putting the pen down and clearing the whole RWA pipeline. How do we create a new pipeline for such a risk appetite? It is my view that this proposal of risk appetite is not great from a business perspective (not earning anything).  Moreover, the report doesn\u2019t provide any indication on how to source such collaterals and who the borrowers might be. I worry that the Arrangers will be seen as \u201cbanks\u201d and that the haircut will be lost in the discussion (more precisely to match the reality). We will go from super-senior central-bank-like type of risk to junk dressed as a super senior. Junk is super easy to catch, it\u2019s anything that gives you more than 2% currently (it is not bad by itself, Coinbase is rated junk). Super senior (in the understanding of being central bank-like) is below 0.25%. On the structure I think the hierarchy between RWF Compliance and the RWF Portfolio CU is unusual. Shouldn\u2019t it be on the side? The fact that RWF Portfolio CUs are incubated in the Compliance CU is discouraging for diversity. Diversity of RWF CUs is needed to provide a diversity of opinions to the MKR holders to make an informed decision. It is not decentralized if one CU is a gate. I wonder if we shouldn\u2019t define RWF Portfolio CUs as credit rating agencies and require many sets of eyes for big DC. You can easily be compliant to a framework but underwriting garbage. To the extent that the credit policy is to lend only against high-quality collaterals, I\u2019m not sure we need such CUs at all (or not too much). We already have credit rating agencies. My belief is that MakerDAO should be lean and limit governance. Not to create a wide bureaucracy. It is not possible for RWA currently, but shouldn\u2019t we move toward a governance minimized RWA structure instead of a crawling bureaucracy? Your stated risk appetite (central bank-like) is quite supportive of a low headcount anyway. If we want to underwrite exotic issuances (i.e. anything not rated investment-grade and coming from a flagship financial institution), we should have a discussion on why we would want to do it? Is it because we have a better acquisition channel? Better cost structure? Smarter than the rest? We did it so far as there was no alternative, due to the MIP6 mental model and because we had to start somewhere. We should probably challenge those assumptions. Regarding the RWA Legal CU, I\u2019m fully aligned. \u201cHow\u201d is the only question. \u2013 Regarding your last comment on the Arrangers     luca_pro:  In their role as consultant, they might not be required to put sizeable capital at risk. This doesn\u2019t mean that capital at risk shouldn\u2019t be put in, it simply means that such capital might come from other counterparts   From @rune post:  Specifically Arrangers have the autonomy to onboard deals based on Boxes that represent a pre-approval for a particular Elibility Criteria, and that each have unique terms.  The Arranger is the seller to Maker (with autonomy to sell and an economic incentive to sell) and it is sound practice to ask for 5% risk retention from the seller. I understand it is not possible with most Arrangers of the lineup. Should we breach this rule to match with the reality? Maybe. But we should be clear on what we are doing. We can\u2019t say we are ultra-safe like central banks then using arrangers (all startups) not putting 5% skin in the game and originating non-rated assets. I think the report should tell MakerDAO community how to reconcile those two extremes (or help choose between). ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your detailed email @SebVentures, The importance of your experience in structured credit for Maker in the last months cannot be understated. I will try to answer your questions based on my perspective after 15 years in the business but I am happy for other members of the community to chip in. I also believe those points valuable and I\u2019d love to have an open debate at some point in the future in a call format as well.     SebVentures:  I understand that the author wants to place MakerDAO in line with central bank in term of behavior. One thing is to have a meme of decentral bank of DeFi the other is to have a serious discussion on this.   Thank you for reaffirming the spirit of this conversation. Far from being literal, the report intended to show a direction of travel that, as we said, resemble more that of a central bank rather than an investment bank. There are several similarities that Maker enjoys with central banking, but I really don\u2019t want to spam the community with the rants of a monetary economist more than what I do already! The report was not intended to be an educational piece on monetary policy and central banking but I can affirm clearly that I strongly believe that an expansionary footprint of the DAI is conducive of the sustainability of the DAI as relevant stablecoin in the ecosystem. And that an institutionalisation of the real-world asset framework is a great facilitator of such expansionary footprint. This is, obviously, my personal view based on my experience, and I accept and respect other people\u2019s opinions. There is one important thing, however, that I would like to state. With no delegation of power away from MKR token holders, I believe that those same token holders are the best placed to protect their own interests when approving or rejecting an application, also based on the qualified opinions provided by the CUs. For what I can say, I confirm my view that this direction of travel is compatible with the maximisation of value and the fulfilment of the mission of Maker. I have been happy to see that many, within the community, who own significant interest as token holders, have shared the same view.     SebVentures:  First, the logical conclusion is to keep RWA small for the time being. If the aim is to generate a few basis points, maybe doing nothing is even better. Luca asks for less than 1% of PD (probability of default). Assuming loss given default (LGD) is not 100% and market are somewhat efficient, it will give you a few basis points over the risk free-rate.   On the contrary, I strongly believe that an institutionalisation of the approach, and a revision of the risk appetite, will massively expand the initiative from what it is today. As you can see from the first page of the report, such report was endorsed by few large originators that already interact with maker (@mrabino1 from 6s, @Jason and the rest of the END-labs team, @martin and @roollie and the rest of the Centrifuge team). I have also had the pleasure to receive several calls expressing interests in participating to the initiative from former business connections. Among those interested parties, that I cannot share at this stage but that I would direct to the appropriate Maker onboarding units, there are 2 sovereign funds, 3 investment banks, 3 alternative originators operating in the invoice financing space, 2 large credit funds. All ready to provide credit quality that is way within those parameters. Such institutions would not be ready to approach without a structured organisation that \u201cspeaks the same jargon\u201d. That is why I am so enthusiastic to unite forces and collaborate to speed up the initiative. For what concerns the return on capital, I believe there is a bit of confusion here. The private credit market is not the public credit market. There are several very high level credits out there that are not enjoying the size and the access to public credit through bonds or other structures. Although the implicit cost of credit at the originator level is very small, those counterparties still pay few % points above swap rate because they need to fund the whole structure. To put it in simple terms, although the cost of liquidity for a bank is 0% nowadays, its cost of equity is 10-12%, and that means that such cost of equity needs to be compensated by the spread charged to customers ultimately over the cost of financing. It is such cost of financing that constitute the hurdle for Maker. When I was board observer of an ECB bank, we could solidly generate 3-4% from IG private credit originated through platforms. I believe that within Maker, with lighter regulation but post Covid, we could do the same at 0.5-1%. I understand that many of those concepts could be intimidating, and that is why I believe part of the job of the CUs should be educating and discussing all those concepts within the Community. I know that @williamr has a keen interest in giving back through education, and I am so happy to join him even if it\u2019s hard work.     SebVentures:  I think the hierarchy between RWF Compliance and the RWF Portfolio CU is unusual. Shouldn\u2019t it be on the side?   I believe there is a bit of confusion but in good faith about this. Although the Portfolio CU would be functionally dependent from the Compliance CU, their hierarchical dependency is both towards MKR token holders. This is the same that happens in traditional banking for Audit Units. Although an Audit unit is functionally under the CEO (typically) or COO, its hierarchical dependency is towards the Supervisory Board. The employer is the CEO, but the people Audit reports to its the Supervisory Board. That is why Audit always has a seat on the Supervisory Board. The same happens with Compliance, and the same would happen for the Compliance CU. All units will be dependent from governance and effectively parallelised. I apologise if this wasn\u2019t clear in the report, and thanks a lot for flagging it. I will amend the next version.     SebVentures:  My belief is that MakerDAO should be lean and limit governance.   This is the point where I am afraid I have to disagree with you. I strongly believe that the current set up of the RWF CU is non-institutional, as it concentrates too many responsibilities and lacks transparency. I also believe that, for this reasons, high quality institutional lenders would not approach. I was one of them, and I wouldn\u2019t. Adverse selection is real.     SebVentures:  Regarding your last comment on the Arrangers   I am sorry but I don\u2019t understand your comment. I believe that the report is quite clear on this point and fairly aligned with what you, rightly, suggest. I am sure I could have written it better if there is still confusion. We had this conversation during the call and I believe people were satisfied with the explanation, I should have clarified the point further. My apologies. For the interest of the community, I report one passage that is very important from the report. Arrangers through the lenses of credit risk onboarding. This means that arrangers should be, in all shape or form, transparent in credit risk terms. Although they act as an extra layer of safety and efficiency, any collateral onboarding application they bring forward will have to go through the same level of scrutiny. Arrangers are a very powerful resource within Maker\u2019s set-up, and should be compensated accordingly, but without compromising the level of diligence of the RWF Portfolio CUs. As @rune mentioned, his initial post on The Arranger Model was an initial post that would have stimulated the conversation and floated some high-level ideas he thought about in pointing to a new direction for real-world finance. The Sandbox report intends to incorporate and augment this vision, and naturally would have few inconsistencies with what was said before. As you can see from the cover of the report (font was small I know!!!) @rune has endorsed the report. Thank you so much for having spent the time to provide such detailed comments as Facilitator of the RWF CU. I hope that my answers have been satisfactory, but I am looking forward to organise a call as soon as everybody has digested it. I am sure such report is just a first step and these conversations can improve what we are doing massively. Opening the table for a structured conversation has been the reason we started the Sandbox in the first place. ",

The discussion above about re risk profile vs expected rates of return hits upon something that I don\u2019t feel came across in the report yet: what is the value proposition(s) of Maker to the borrower market beyond cheap capital? For the current borrowers and early adopters (mostly start-ups) it was probably something along the lines of \u201ccheap credit line probably with fewer strings attached than I\u2019d get in the tradfi market and it\u2019s kinda cool to do something with DeFi and as we\u2019re a start-up, why not\u201d.  This report makes clear that this is no longer the direction of travel (rightly imo). What borrowers are NOT getting from Maker is:  Easier access to credit (Maker integration still a lot more complicated than getting financing from tradfi institution, even with an intermediary Arranger model) On-chain financing (while the capital comes from DeFi, it\u2019s taken off-chain via the Arranger, so actually the borrower doesn\u2019t benefit from any form of on-chain efficiencies and transparency in their capital flows) Capital with higher risk-appetite (ie funding for projects that are hard to fund in the tradfi market)  So if the Borrower doesn\u2019t receive any of the above, then there needs to be something compelling they do receive.  Atm this is low cost of capital, but is it the intention that this will remain Maker\u2019s only advantage for the foreseeable future?  If so, then any discussion around the risk / reward weighting should be framed on this basis.  Maker will need to keep its cost of capital super low in order to compete with other institutions to get capital out of the door in the current competitive climate, otherwise we won\u2019t attract the quality we want. That means accepting very low returns, which I feel has been implicitly accepted but maybe not explicitly stated yet? What I\u2019d like to see is an analysis of target returns and exactly how / why these will be achieved, bench-marked against what comparable tradfi institutions receive.  Putting some model numbers down as a straw-man might might help the community engage with this topic and work out exactly what returns are / aren\u2019t acceptable. ",

In my mind, these would be the advantages for a borrower of any kind when interacting with MakerDAO:   Attractive cost of capital vis-a-vis the alternatives; often the alternative is not a bank, because a bank has other issues sometimes that make this unviable; the alternative is alternative credit providers that receive their liquidity from credit hedge funds, family offices, and venture capital funding - all with much higher IRRs. Maker could be an incredibly powerful alternative source of capital  Higher quantum; Maker (liquidity and risk) risk appetite will be the bar here, but I believe that the quantum that Maker can deploy is meaningful in the market  Potential to on-ramp into DeFi; I think your point of on-chain financing is super meaningful. It is my view as I stated many times also during the presentation that Maker can be the most powerful institutional ramp into DeFi, and that borrowers won\u2019t need necessarily to bring back liquidity off-chain. This is particularly relevant for banking borrowers that have fungible liquidity coming from several sources. Although we should structure ourselves to allow this to happen, ultimately will be in the hands of the borrowers to choose  Easier access for everyone; although this is still early experimentation days, I think our ambition should be really to provide a smooth avenue to receive funding for international businesses. This might not be evident now, that we are designing and debating, but I hope this will be evident later on. Also, although I believe our core focus should be on developed market (for testing) this might not be the case in the future. In less banked jurisdictions such a non-intermediated channel could be incredibly beneficial.  I think, if potential borrowers agree, that a panel that includes borrowers/ counterparts and Maker CU members could be started to debate those ideas and understand whether there is a point of contact and how to unlock it. The MIP6 processes will go alongside it, but I think we should keep the conversation open as much as possible. Colleagues from 6s, END-labs, Centrifuge, have already provided interest. We could make it a period (biweekly) call open to everyone to chip in and help shaping the future together. A model is a great idea. I will be happy to put numbers in an excel based on my TradFi experience, and start iterating them for the DeFi world. In any case, I think we should all have another call in 2 weeks time, having given time to everyone to digest the report and asked question. It might be a long call (2 or 3 hours) but a precious one for practitioners. What\u2019s your view? Thanks again for having taken the time to reply with such relevant points and good ideas on how to progress. Luca ",

                    "content": "I think the lesson with the Arranger Model that needs to be studied is not Greensill, but the USA S&L banking crisis in the late 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s.  This Arranger model seems particularly susceptible to having the ability to mint dai against assets capturable by MKR token holders and those that are able to build \u201cgovernance\u201d clout through delegation.  This could be further exacerbated by what was referred to as \u201cprivate entanglement\u201d or in my mind just that once the bureaucracy is in place, it is much harder to change. What do I mean?  How would we feel if at Wells Fargo bank a large shareholder was able to exert influence in order to get the bank to make loans on favorable terms, change terms, or otherwise was allowed to source loans into the banking system.  This sounds crazy, but to some degree that is what caused many Savings and Loans failures in the USA when the bankers and shareholders used their influence in the banks to make dodgy loans to their friends, families, etc.  There were alot of good ole\u2019 boy deals in these small S&L banks and really took years and a lot of taxpayer dollars to clean up. With MakerDAO as a central bank mindset we can see how easily it would be to mint dai against sketchy collateral and I still don\u2019t see the necessary independence of any self regulatory bodies that would prevent this from happening.  In fact, I really don\u2019t see any policy reasons that this proposed entity has to not be regulated as a meatspace financial institution.  This is the reason that the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d, despite its flaws, has independence to make decisions and try to accomplish its dual mandate.  Similarly most banks have a separate \u201ccredit\u201d team that is responsible for meeting its risk ratings and loan quality, and then of course these are regulated through a process of bank examiners. To my knowledge Ethereum doesn\u2019t have \u201cbank examiners\u201d or independent bodies that are charged with making sure that the capital and credit quality is there to avoid disaster.  In the case where Ethereum doesn\u2019t self regulate, I fear that regulation will be coming hard and fast.  I do see the call out to form a Legal CU, but I think to the extent that the DAO insists on moving toward originating loans the first hire needs to be someone that has bank examiner experience so that they can clearly delineate the control aspects of a loan underwriting system, from ownership \u201ctoken\u201d, and manage the risk and conflicts of interests.  I do not mean to claim any malice, I just have learned in lending that you need to expect that every place with a \u201ctrust\u201d assumption can go horribly wrong and sometimes the creeping from benevolence to malevolence is almost imperceivable.  The proposed roadmap for MakerDAO and Dai appear to be very tradefi.  To the extent that is where it is going, it only makes sense to adopt the credit underwriting and financial oversight that banks have developed over the past few decades. That is why I think to the extent that there is credit underwriting necessary, it would be much better to just outsource this function to existing short dated bond ETF\u2019s.  These at least come with clear credit ratings, and would likely be similar to what USDC and others are expected to do with their fiat pegged offerings that will likely be subject to \u201cbank\u201d examinations. It is much better to avoid private entanglement if Dai is managed similar to money market or short dated treasury ETF. I am obviously concerned with the direction that the DAO is going and the systemic risk that would be involved if the right to mint Dai falls into the hands of a select few that can use the system to exchange dodgy loans for Dai.

As I stated already in the reply to @SebVentures message, I strongly agree with you that we should enhance internal credit (and compliance) controls when it comes to a real-world function that, for the need of bootstrapping it, has been extremely centralised so far. I have been advising, investing, and participating as board member into regulated banks all my career, and I agree with you that banks do control credit risk very well - on average. Market and counterparty risk, less well, but that\u2019s a different story. Hence, I agree with your points of pushing out as much underwriting activity as possible. A framework with an extra layer of control wants to go exactly in this direction. Such move would be, in my view, supportive of any type of credit underwriting: being it through private or through public vehicles. Ensuring absence of conflict of interests or malicious activities is a tough exercise, but one that is helped by decentralisation and transparency in my opinion. And I truly hope that the Maker community will keep policing the activities effectively. Exactly in this spirit, the origin of my involvement was an audit of a deal that I found, as a community member and former credit professional, unsatisfactory in terms of credit risk mitigating factors and risk-reward. For what concerns public vs. private credit, I believe this should be one of the conversations to have within a framework that we aim as agnostic as possible. Agnostic to credit types or structures. Private credit agreements have their risks, but credit ETFs are not panacea - they have significant liquidity mismatch issues and aren\u2019t used by institutional investors at scale - those investors prefer securitised exposures or CLO-like exposures. Those same exposures I hope will be on the table when discussing about pipeline. In addition, I struggle to see the advantage in investing in money market instruments rather than in USDC which is a tokenised money market instrument itself. Growing the balance sheet through minting against short duration IG credit or money market ETFs would not be too dissimilar from expanding the dependency on USDC we have been trying to diminish lately. I also agree with your point, which is extremely fascinating, about an absence of a regulator across Ethereum DeFi. We all hope that the system will self-regulate, but we are not there yet in any way. That is the reason we hope that real-world finance activities could piggyback reputable regulators out there: i.e. investing through regulated structures, leverage trust frameworks, collaborate with regulated entities where risk is already vetted/ rated. As a last point, again on the Arranger Model, I would suggest the community to move beyond Rune\u2019s initial definitions, as we mentioned several times. I share with you the concerns over systemic and protocol specific risks, and I hope that the activities of the DAO will go in the direction of mitigating those through constructive dialogue and cautious controls. I am eager to hear more from you on this, and I hope we can put those points into an agenda for the next 2-3 hours call. Luca ",

Its essential that Maker develop a process that ensures high quality investments and can scale rapidly. I fully agree that promoting DAI stability is a key priority for both Maker and RWF. With this in mind Maker should hold high quality/low risk assets that are relatively liquid.    I hope we have a broad consensus here! The Arranger will be a key key role, requiring a diverse skill set.  I think it will be similar to the investment banker role in many ways but differ in that their only(?) client will be Maker.  And the Arranger will need to be much better aligned with Maker than traditional investment bankers!  Properly structuring the Maker-Arranger relationship will be essential! The Arranger role will evolve over time as Luca notes but here is my view on their function:  Have deep expertise in the origination, underwriting, structuring and management of credit investments in asset classes where they work with Maker. Be a high integrity, public interaction point between Maker and the real world Ability to build relationships/source assets from good originators Ensure that well aligned Originators generate quality assets which meet Maker\u2019s eligibility criteria.  This also includes requiring Originators to provide necessary asset reps and warranties and buyout/replace any assets that are later discovered to not meet these standards Ensure the investment assets are serviced by strong Servicers that are motivated to provide quality servicing that efficiently monetizes the assets.  Also ensuring a strong backup Servicer is in place when needed Structure the overall investment so that it provides Maker with an Investment Grade risk and return in accordance with Maker\u2019s standards. This requires not only adequate credit support but also key risk mitigants such as payment priorities, performance covenants, triggers, events of default and remedies, eligibility criteria, portfolio concentration limits, key legal opinions and other legal and tax issues Obtain sufficient capital to provide required subordination for Maker\u2019s investment, when needed Oversee key transaction parties in investment including Originators, Servicers, Trustees Assemble and oversee other required 3rd party servicer providers for the investment such as accountants, trustees, collateral agents\u2026 Oversee all investment reporting Managing investment issues on behalf of Maker as they arise, including credit issues Provide timely interaction with RWF and Maker  ",

                    "content": "Here are some other comments: When I see the Arranger eligible collateral concept, it makes me think of asset backed warehouses which are usually provided by banks to asset originators.  The basic idea is that the bank agrees to provide ongoing finance for newly originated assets as long as they fit the credit box, so to speak.  These will include key items such as (A) eligibility requirements for each asset originated, (B) portfolio concentration limits for the overall asset pool, (C) reps/warranties for each asset originated, (D) minimum equity/subordination level for each asset, (E) performance requirements for the overall asset pool, (F) Servicing standards for the overall portfolio\u2026 Revolving securitizations are similar as well. I suggest it is better to refer to Maker\u2019s credit standard as being Investment Grade (IG) as opposed to an investment have less then 1% chance of defaulting over one year.  Its notoriously difficult to measure an actual default proability for a given investment, but there are existing credit standards to be say a BBB bond.  And these are roughly equivalent.  So we can be roughly accurate as opposed to exactly wrong. I take some comfort in commercial bank loan portfolios being examined by regulators but do not view this as a panacea.  In the US I believe that the best credit risk institutions are credit investing shops such as PIMCO, Fortress\u2026  These are not regulated institutions such as banks but tend to be well managed and are run by top notch credit investors.   I think they are the best credit shops because their owners/portfolio managers are top tier credit investors and are relatively well aligned with their own fund investors.  They also tend to earn more $$$ than commercial bankers so they can attract top tier talent.  So I dont think regulation is the holy grail for Maker I suggest that potential Arrangers look at existing traditional credit standards for the types of assets they want to originate and see what an IG deal in that asset class requires.  I expect that RWF/Maker will review the comparable traditional finance investments as a starting point.  Also note that an IG deal is not only the required credit support levels, its also the broader deal structure with the types of items I mentioned in the last post.  The rating agencies provide decent pre-sale/sale reports on new rated bond issues that cover many of these key issues.  BUT note I am presenting my view and not a Maker consensus view! ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your message @Eumenes, and happy you are sharing the vision the report wants to communicate. You are touching several relevant points I would like to comment on.     Eumenes:  With this in mind Maker should hold high quality/low risk assets that are relatively liquid.   Liquidity I agree is crucial here, and for more than one reason. The report focuses on the effects on credit quality of asset duration, i.e. the fact that assets with lower duration/ higher churn are easier to manage and have less duration risk, but this is only part of the equation. I think that a scaling RWF exposure can significantly change the liquidity profile of Maker\u2019s (asset side) of the balance sheet, with impacts on the PSM especially. With the use cases financed by Maker expanding, Asset Liability Management (ALM) will be more and more important up to the point where maybe a specific CU will need to be dedicated to this. We are far away from that currently, but we have learned to see the world evolving faster than we think! The same discussion should happen if and when Maker decides to deploy the proprietary liquidity (raised through the PSM) in both on-chain and off-chain investments.     Eumenes:  The Arranger role will evolve over time as Luca notes but here is my view on their function:   I truly cannot add on this, as I am aware the RWF is dedicating a lot of time and effort in drafting a comprehensive checklist to assess arrangers. The arranger role itself will evolve and the DD effort will have to follow such development I think.     Eumenes:  I suggest it is better to refer to Maker\u2019s credit standard as being Investment Grade (IG) as opposed to an investment have less then 1%   I agree with you, and I received already a lot of comments about it. I am proposing to change the reference in the eligibility criteria to \u201cinvestment grade like\u201d type of risk rather than focusing on specific PDs. In addition, I have been thinking about it a lot, and I think that it is the Expected Loss, rather than the Probability of Default, that should be of paramount importance for Maker. With good lenders/ servicers out there able to restructure defaulting positions or to monetise first lien collaterals, Maker might find itself not in the position to do anything even if the PD is somehow higher than 1%. It is the ultimate loss that is more relevant for Maker rather than payment skipping. I will try to be more detailed in the next version of the report, but thanks for your valuable input here.     Eumenes:  I take some comfort in commercial bank loan portfolios being examined by regulators but do not view this as a panacea.   Agree. Banking regulation is a comfort point but not sufficient or necessary. In a past life I have been analyst of a 2b private credit evergreen HF and I see what you are saying here, and fully agree with you. Ultimately, we are looking for quality, seniority, credibility, and regulatory vetting of some sort. I believe that the DAO will have to be flexible and transparent in assessing each risk. In the long run, things will homogenise for sure, but again we are years away. Also, all the aspects below are not panacea I agree, otherwise it would be enough to create an algo buying public credit instruments without even looking at what\u2019s inside and clip the yield.     Eumenes:  I expect that RWF/Maker will review the comparable traditional finance investments as a starting point   I agree in full. We shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of standing on the shoulders of giants, and improve the mechanism rather than burning everything down. I hear that your views are yours and yours only, I guess I should put a disclaimer on all my posts but that disclaimer is implicit: I am just an enthusiastic Maker community member trying to help create a vision that contribute to a more efficient, ultimately more equal, world.

                    "content": "I greatly appreciate the diligence, effort, and thoughtfulness that @luca_pro spent researching and writing this report. To my knowledge, this is the first blueprint for a comprehensive credit risk framework within web3.0 that holistically incorporates off-chain assets\u2014no small feat! Luca\u2019s two-pronged approach (identifying the types of credit Maker should underwrite and analyzing how Maker should be structured to facilitate that credit) is especially helpful in framing this discussion. There are compelling reasons for Maker to serve as a super senior lender in the financing stack, which implies an ongoing focus on accepting defined types of structured credit in a regulated manner. I fully support the report\u2019s recommendations on these fronts. In the spirit of brevity, I also want to highlight some of the key operational considerations that may require further detail prior to moving the proposal forward for voting. (1) Additional Core Units At the heart of this report is the recommendation to add a Real-World Finance (RWF) Compliance Core Unit, RWF Portfolio \u201cSub-Units\u201d with specialized expertise in risk underwriting for designated verticals, and an RWF Legal Support Core Unit. Each is necessary to facilitate the structures and processes required to scale real-world assets. An additional benefit of this design entails the creation of checks and balances between those responsible for onboarding collateral and those focused on assessing risk based on approved underwriting criteria. As others have pointed out, there are a myriad of historical reasons why banks use this structure today: different verticals within an organization can have disparate incentives driving their behavior. For the same reason, it makes a lot of sense for Maker to adopt this organizational set-up too. While this report is understandably only the initial step towards creating these core units, several procedural questions remain to be ironed out prior to a vote. These questions include:  Who should lead these new units? How do they integrate with the existing Real World Finance Core Unit? What is the relationship between the Real World Finance Portfolio Sub-Units and the RWF Core Unit? Are the RWF Portfolio Sub-Units considered \u201cdepartments\u201d of the main RWF Core Unit, or separate entities, or another specified relationship (i.e., RWF becomes an incubator that spins off RWF Portfolio Sub-Units)? Will loan applications initially flow through the RWF Core Unit before distribution to the RWF Portfolio Sub-Units, or will they go directly to the appropriate RWF Portfolio Sub-Unit? What is the scope of the RWF Portfolio Sub-Units\u2019 responsibilities (i.e., do they maintain responsibility for monitoring the credit worthiness of new collateral for revolving borrowers on an existing line of credit)? As we scale, how do we ensure the Compliance Core Unit does not bottleneck the process? How do we adequately publicize these changes to both MKR holders and potential partner institutions, with an emphasis on the advisory nature of these Core Units (i.e., while MKR holders hopefully account for the advisory approval given by RWF and Compliance when voting, they retain the power to disagree)? How do these changes impact existing borrowers? Should they be grandfathered in, or will they have to meet these new requirements or risk losing their access to credit? How can this organizational structure be implemented and operations conducted in a manner that does not increase regulatory risk to the Maker protocol pursuant to applicable securities laws, including the Howey test and the Reves test?  (2) Intermediaries The second major piece I wanted to highlight involves the importance of intermediaries in originating, structuring, and presenting loans to Maker. @Eumenes wrote two excellent responses analyzing the critical role these intermediaries will play if this framework is implemented, along with many of the important considerations to evaluate for intermediaries in this model. In my view, the single most important factor here (aside from the core question of why the borrower needs money and what they plan to do with it) is ensuring incentive alignment through the entire lending stack, from the original borrower to the most senior lender. Intermediaries must have a requisite amount of skin in the game for any deal they bring to Maker. This prevents the \u201chot potato\u201d effect, where it may be in an intermediary\u2019s interest to originate deals just for the fees, because they can then pass the buck to the next person in line without regard for the long-term consequences of the deal. Among the many problems this scenario presents, the most notable is Maker\u2019s positioning in the Conga Line\u2014the next, and last, person to be left holding the hot potato. As a result, Maker has to be conservative, judicious, and sufficiently insulated in its dealings with intermediaries. One potential solution could involve requiring intermediaries to stake a predetermined percentage of MKR tokens in an individual \u201cborrower pool\u201d based on the size of the deal. For example, if someone wants a $10M loan, then perhaps they must stake $1M of MKR tokens in addition to meeting other collateral requirements. This idea is at the seed stage, but I think there could be possibilities of using the MKR token in novel ways to require borrowers and intermediaries to put additional skin (5-20% of equity capital) in the game. Overall, the securitization framework between intermediaries and Maker needs to be airtight. This will require a good deal of transparency from potential intermediaries, the public nature of which may be different from a typical lending agreement. Borrowers will likely request some flexibility from Maker on this front, but ultimately Maker must ensure the viability and integrity of potential those seeking to borrow, and the market value and liquidity of the collateral they post. (3) Clean Money Initiatives The last consideration involves the integration of Clean Money Initiatives for this framework. If the community decides to move forward on this front, perhaps we could create a dedicated pool of credit (Climate Credit Fund) with a hard cap (i.e., $50M to start) for climate-focused lending on an experimental basis with specific underwriting standards designed for climate-based projects. Maker would also need to strictly define the types of climate-based projects that would be acceptable. For simplicity, only very clear-cut clean energy proposals with broad-based community support should have the capacity to access the fund initially. Projects that meet these criteria would not be absolved from the overall underwriting process, but subject to targeted lending standards. These lending standards would then be quantified by Maker pricing in the external costs arising from the nature of the project. For instance, if a borrower sought to construct a building to a LEED-certified Gold Standard, Maker\u2019s evaluation metrics could account for the additional value in such a project (and thus the increased cost) in ways that a traditional bank might not. Putting the intricacies of real estate financing aside, there should be quantifiable ways to lend to climate-focused projects using expanded underwriting criteria that account for the long-term social and economic benefits of investing in this sector, the potential for increased value of climate-based investments\u2014especially as costs that are currently externalized become internalized (imagine if a price gets put on carbon in major international markets\u2014investment calculations would rapidly change), and the climate financing market share Maker could take as part of this push. The primary way to balance these risks would be to start small with the aforementioned hard cap. The community could then set verifiable benchmarks and check the Climate Credit Fund against them at set intervals. If those benchmarks are met, we can linearly increase the size of the fund. If not, we need to iterate and fix the process. We\u2019re excited to see this process continue and look forward to continuing to work with the community as these recommendations progress towards concrete proposals! ",
