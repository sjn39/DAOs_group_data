                    "content": "SocGenForge OFH token was on-boarded last week as RWA008-A. Due to the key holders on SocGen side being unavailable during the spell creation and validation process last week, they could not provide proof of ownership of the wallet that would become the operator of the deal. For that reason, @Protocol-Engineering and @collateral-core-unit have made sure the spell had not granted one of the required permissions so the on-boarding could proceed as scheduled. Earlier this week a SocGen representative replied on their original MIP6 application thread with the signature of a message that has been agreed upon between SocGen and @collateral-core-unit. The signature has been verified by @collateral-core-unit and @Protocol-Engineering members and it is sufficient to prove that SocGen actually controls the wallet. This week\u2019s spell needs to grant the final permission to SocGen\u2019s wallet. Using the following parameters:   RWA008_A_OPERATOR: 0x03f1A14A5b31e2f1751b6db368451dFCEA5A0439   RWA008_A_OUTPUT_CONDUIT: 0x21CF5Ad1311788D762f9035829f81B9f54610F0C   The missing permission can be granted like: interface Hopeable {     function hope(address) external; }  //...  address constant RWA008_A_OPERATOR = 0x03f1A14A5b31e2f1751b6db368451dFCEA5A0439; address constant RWA008_A_OUTPUT_CONDUIT = 0x21CF5Ad1311788D762f9035829f81B9f54610F0C;  // ...  Hopeable(RWA008_A_OUTPUT_CONDUIT).hope(RWA008_A_OPERATOR);  This will allow SocGen\u2019s wallet to pick the destination address for Dai that will be drawn from the associated vault. ",
