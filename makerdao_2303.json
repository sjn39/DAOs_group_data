                    "content": "[CF-DROP] MIP6 Application: ConsolFreight DROP: Tokenized Freight Shipping Invoices This is a MIP6 Proposal for the addition of ConsolFreight\u2019s tokenized freight invoices to MCD by ConsolFreight supported by Centrifuge. ConsolFreight is originating and administering the asset collateralization using Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake Protocol. This is the continuation of a joint pilot together with the Maker Foundation beginning of April where we tokenized and financed freight invoices. Due to the unique nature of the ConsolFreight collateral we deviate slightly from the MIP6 structure and split this application into two sections, starting with an introduction to the collateral itself and then a description of the technical details and financial mechanisms. Centrifuge provides the Tinlake Protocol\u2013a platform to provide real-world assets to Maker and we expect that multiple assets will follow. This is one of two applications we are posting today and propose for the first iteration of the governance cycle. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? The asset originator, ConsolFreight, is represented by Ernesto Vila (@EAV, [email\u00a0protected], CEO at ConsolFreight) and Alejandro Gutierrez (@AleG, [email\u00a0protected], CSO at ConsolFreight). Centrifuge is providing the technology and framework for bringing real-world assets to MCD. The main contact on Tinlake for the application is Lucas Vogelsang (@spin, [email\u00a0protected]) of Centrifuge as well as Lea Schmitt (@_LS, [email\u00a0protected]). 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token We will start with a brief summary of ConsolFreigt, the Asset Originator, and follow with a more technical description of the Tinlake Protocol, the technology Centrifuge has built and how they interact with Maker later. The asset type we are proposing for inclusion in MCD is slightly different to the majority of collateral applications: the Asset Originators will be using MCD directly as a line of credit to originate new loans against freight invoices (invoice factoring and reverse factoring). This means they will add large amounts of debt likely using up the assigned debt ceiling for the collateral type while paying an attractive stability fee: the yield on the collateral is projected to be around 6%. For comparison, BAT sees less than 500k of Dai minted, less than 0.2% of the BAT market cap. ConsolFreight is a SaaS freight forwarding technology provider that advances working capital finance to freight forwarders\u2019 operations (e.g. air, ocean, rail, road, multi-modal, etc.) and collects from shippers (e.g. supermarkets, hospitals, office supplies, etc.). The founding team combines 50+ years of experience running successful freight forwarding businesses in the U.S., Latin America, and Europe. These assets have the following characteristics:   Asset Details:  Collateral Freight Forwarding Invoices  Average Invoice Size: $5,000  Maturity: 30 & 45 day invoices  Historic Invoice Default Rate: <1%  Advance Rate: 85-95%  Interest Rate charged to Freight Forwarders: 15%  Types of Advances: Factoring & Reverse Factoring  Customer Monthly Sales Volume:  $500,000 - $2,000,000  The following describes an exemplary use case: A distributor in the US placed an order to a US Wholesaler of 10 Million units of 8.4 FL oz of hand sanitizers. The product is manufactured in Mexico to be delivered to their Indiana distribution center, over the course of 12 weeks with a volume of about 15 trailers per week. The wholesaler hired a Freight Forwarder to provide the logistics for the 210 X 53\u2019 Trailers needed to deliver the product and to perform the customs clearance in both Mexico and the US. The contract totals to $1.7M in freight fees. The majority of that is going to subcontracted trucking companies, customs brokers and insurance providers that complete the task. The terms between the Freight Forwarder and the Wholesaler are 30 days net from invoice date, while the payment to the shippers have shorter payment periods. This means the Freight Forwarder will be required to factor the invoices to the US Wholesaler in order to have liquidity to fulfill his obligations with the subcontractors in its supply chain. By doing reverse factoring, the Freight Forwarder is able to discount his invoices, receive early payments and settle all obligations to all service providers, while waiting 30 days for the invoices to the Wholesaler to reach maturity and collect the final payment.  |726.3173452625402x391.528344885291861600\u00d7859 92.8 KB  Overview of Tinlake Smart Contracts Centrifuge is building a full stack of tools to bring real-world assets into DeFi. Assets such as freight invoices, warehouse receipts or even real estate can be tokenized in the form of an NFT. Each NFT represents one unique real-world asset, a loan, with a unique default risk that is priced by an off-chain oracle. Centrifuge Tinlake is a set of smart contracts that handles the bundling of these individual loans and issues an interest bearing ERC20 token against the pool. Pooling these assets allows the Asset Originator to offer a more stable return (and risk) and offers a scalable more easily tradable fungible token to the lenders. Tinlake has two different ERC20 tokens that lenders can buy: TIN and DROP. The TIN token is the junior tranche that takes any first losses and is primarily bought by the Asset Originator and other lenders that seek leveraged exposure to the portfolio. Tinlake is configured to require a minimum amount of investment in the TIN token and for Consolfreight the ratio will be set at 10%. Any losses that occur in a portfolio will first be covered by TIN token holders, that means as a DROP token holder you will only start seeing losses if they surpass 10% of the portfolio value. More information on how the two tranches work can be found here: https://developer.centrifuge.io/tinlake/overview/tranches/ The collateral we propose for inclusion is the DROP token. Tinlake has adapters that allow these end users to deposit DAI for DROP tokens but it also has an adapter that can interact with MCD directly. A Tinlake deployment manages a single vault. When new loans are originated, new DROP is minted and immediately deposited into the vault. Dai is drawn and given to the borrowers.  |624x277.363994743757871027\u00d7456 94.3 KB  The Infrastructure beyond the Tinlake Contracts Bringing real-world assets into DeFi in a secure way requires more than simply minting an ERC20 token and claiming it has some value. One important part is that we move as much information on-chain as possible, hence we start with individual NFTs and make loan data on the entire portfolio available. In addition we have scalable protocol to share cryptographically signed and verifiable data off-chain. This allows the Asset Originator to share their loan information with different service providers such as financial auditors, credit scoring firms and others to provide pricing and risk input on these assets that are then used to calculate the asset value and brought on-chain as an oracle providing real time pricing data for each NFT.  1600\u00d7899 217 KB  Along with the necessary technical infrastructure to bring these assets into DeFi, the Asset Originator sets up a legal structure that provides the necessary support to ensure that anyone that owns a DROP token has a legal claim to the underlying assets. This is done with a legal structure very commonly used in the traditional financial system: The collateral for the individual loans are assigned to a legal entity, the \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d and lenders get an ownership interest in the entire portfolio of this entity (with this entity the assets are in an a bankruptcy remote structure that is not influenced by the Asset Originators).  1600\u00d7680 75 KB  3. Provide a brief history of the project About ConsolFreight ConsolFreight is a technology solutions provider founded in 2016 focusing on helping Freight Forwarders and consolidators to crack the digital gap, improve liquidity and working capital. The founders established the company as the response to the issues that they were experiencing in their own Freight Forwarding companies. ConsolFreight has developed a whole suite of products to help digitisation of Logistics operations; like e-Forwarder\u00ae, e-Hub and e-Connected. ConsolFreight started as a digitization provider and is now able to offer the full suite of FreightTech products at no cost in order to help the thousands of small and medium Freight Forwarders to be competitive at a global scale. ConsolFreight is currently building out a lending product to be added to its platform in order to provide its 600+ users an alternative from market dominating players and platforms. Last year, Consolfreight was introduced to MakerDAO and started to envisage the potential use of crypto currency as a means to provide supply chain financing (freight invoicing and trade finance) to all the parties involved in International Trade (Buyers, Sellers, and Freight Forwarders) fast and at a competitive cost of capital. In April of 2020, ConsolFreight conducted a pilot with MakerDAO and Centrifuge to transform logistics access to liquidity through a DeFi solution. ConsolFreight is often described as the place where FreightTech and FinTech meet. After raising seed funding in 2019; Consolfreight quickly ramped up operations and grew from 3 to 11 people (development, operations, sales and marketing). The company added operations in Barcelona and Dublin on top of Miami where the company was established. About Centrifuge Centrifuge has been working on enabling businesses to borrow money using their assets in DeFi since the project was founded in 2017. It was founded by a team of experienced entrepreneurs who at their previous company, Taulia, built supply chain finance products for over 120 of the Global 2000 companies focusing on financing assets in the global supply chain. Centrifuge has received $8.2M in VC funding from a list of experienced & reputable investors and its core mission is to change the rules of global commerce by bringing fairer financing options to business around the world. With Tinlake we are building the tools to make these assets liquid and truly DeFi native. We have written about our vision for DeFi and how adding real-world assets to MCD can scale DeFi and diversity risk in response to the Black Thursday and what we do to minimize trust as we bring these assets live. Centrifuge and the Maker Foundation have collaborated on helping asset originators prepare for bringing real-world assets into DeFi. Gustav Arentoft (Business Development @ MakerDAO) & Lucas, cofounder of Centrifuge, talked at EthCC on March 6th about another asset originator we are working with, ShuttleOne. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. ConsolFreight\u2019s mainnet deployment is scheduled for May 5th. A previous version went live on mainnet and is deployed under the following addresses:  Tinlake Shelf Contract Tinlake TIN ERC20 NFT registry  Technical documentation about Tinlake can be found here:  Github: https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake  Tinlake Documentation We hosted a community call where we invited a the Maker Community for a detailed walkthrough of the Tinlake smart contracts, Recording: here   5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Centrifuge has conducted several audits of its technology stack.

ConsolFreight\u2019s blog, The Freight Business  ConsolFreight on LinkedIn   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? Centrifuge Tinlake has been in development since early 2018. We did a first technical POC where a pre launch version of MCD on Kovan was used to deposit an ERC20 token that was backed by an NFT in April 2018. Only a few months later we deployed the first version of Tinlake to Ethereum mainnet and worked with five different Asset Originators to facilitate loans in DeFi. In a joint effort with MakerDAO to develop a tool to bring real-world assets into MCD we financed four of those Asset Originators with funds provided by the Maker Foundation totaling a volume of 250,000 SAI. The Asset Originators included a residential bridge loan as well as a mortgage originator, a financing solution provider for music royalties and a logistics platform providing invoice factoring. This allowed us to gain first experience with the setup and iterate on the smart contract and risk architecture. The current version of Tinlake has been audited and tested with two running deployments. ConsolFreight DROP tokens in DeFi:   April 2020:* The setup and smart contracts described herein have been tested prior to this collateral application. Together with the Maker Foundation ConsolFreight financed a single freight invoice (DAI 5,223) on April 1st via the ConsolFreight Tinlake pool. For this, we mocked the MCD system by financing the Tinlake smart contracts through funds provided by the Maker Foundation. Find the link to Etherscan here. For more info click here.   From May 2020 onwards: We plan to deploy a ConsolFreight Tinlake pool with an initial pool size of DAI 250,000 on May 5th with an initial set of lenders. ConsolFreight intends to slowly scale up demand by originating an additional 250k in assets over the first couple of months. The DROP token will generate 10% APY and the TIN token will represent 10% of the total asset pool. ConsolFreight and Centrifuge will equally purchase the TIN tokens to demonstrate their confidence in the asset pool and will be exposed to any initial losses.   Inclusion in MCD: Upon onboarding ConsolFreight intends to open up a Vault to use to grow the loan product it is offering to its shippers. This will generate a consistent and uncorrelated supply of DAI to the Maker system backed by a revolving pool of invoices. ConsolFreight estimates that it has an additional demand of capital of around $5M.   8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? ConsolFreight has incorporated ConsolFreight Pilot LLC, a Delaware (USA) limited liability company (the special purpose vehicle, \u201cSPV\u201d). This SPV has been formed to finance ConsolFreight\u2019s assets. This SPV structure creates a bankruptcy-remote entity whereby owners, debt holders or interested parties of this newly created SPV are left unaffected by the parent\u2019s financial, operational and/or legal health. We are collaborating with OpenLaw to open-source these contracts in order to make it accessible to other Asset Originators and use their infrastructure to allow public review of the signed contracts by anyone. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The SPV enters into a subscription agreement with lenders who are receiving DROP from the SPV in turn for providing DAI. The DROP token can be redeemed against the cash flows of the underlying collateral directly from the SPV by any DROP holder. This is ensured by the Tinlake smart contracts and the primary way for interacting with these tokens. 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. We do not have any materials we can provide at this time. 11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Determining the correct price of a real-world asset behaves differently from pricing Ethereum native collateral tokens. In order to adequately price a freight invoice several factors must be considered (please read our fundamentals of pricing real-world assets for additional information). Tinlake requires not just an accurate price of the overall pool but details on a loan by loan basis. As these form the basis as well for the DROP token, we will start outlining the pricing for those first: In approving clients and determining a risk score, ConsolFreight utilizes a strict process and prudent thresholds with respect to:  Length of business ownership Historical accounts receivable performance Full background checks along with financial and operational identity Customary checks for fraud, liens, incorporation documents, licenses and more  The risk score calculated from these inputs is used to determine advance and interest rates. The Tinlake contracts then use these per NFT values to control how much money borrowers can withdraw. To determine the value of the entire portfolio (simplified the sum of the market value of all loan NFTs) is usually by doing a net-asset-value (NAV) calculation across the portfolio. Centrifuge is implementing the NAV model in smart contracts that can calculate this information based on individual pricing information in real time based on the NFT price information. MCD can use the pricing models that Tinlake provides to assess the collateral value of the DROP token. Centrifuge will be providing more material on the oracles in the coming weeks as we work with the oracle domain team. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. The way this collateral type is used varies from how standard vaults are opened: DROP tokens have a stable USD price and any small fluctuations in the loan portfolio performance should be covered by the insurance provided by the TIN tranche. This means that under normal operation, the Asset Originator would not see their Vault get liquidated. A liquidation would only occur if a large amount of defaults occur across the portfolio that the risk model did not calculate. In case the Vault gets liquidated, the Tinlake contracts enforce a rebalancing of the pool to bring it back to its required collateralization ratio and will not allow issuing any new loans. Instead the Tinlake contracts are from this point on taking all of the cash flows generated by the borrowers and disbursing these to DROP token holders. Trade finance assets are usually short term assets and the instance of ConsolFreight the entire pool can be liquidated in <55 days (45 day term invoices + a grace period for late payments). Overall this means keeper liquidations will be a much less common occurrence that only happen when the risk model worked out for a given collateral type did not perform. In the debt finance world there are companies that specialize in buying distressed loan portfolios that can be onboarded as keepers for MCD that would be ideal candidates for buying any DROP that MCD wants to liquidate before the underlying portfolio is liquidated.

Despite this fact, logistics are part of the first respondents to the crisis by transporting essential material, from medical supply & equipment (as the case of the hand sanitizers shipment we are using for the pilot) to the food supply industry that will be one of the first ones to be reactivated due to the low levels of food supply at distribution centers. In a short period time, the shock of the COVID-19 has affected every single industry, and logistics is considered an essential element to maintaining a healthy lockdown as well as the start up of the economy. One way we have managed to minimize risk is moving most of the transactions to a prepaid basis, therefore the need of reverse factoring at the moment. Additionally, Freight Forwarders protect the collection of their services through the document of title exchange (Bill of Lading) that is often issued by them. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the kind words! Let me try to answer your two questions:     andytudhope:  My first question here has to do with the state of freight in the current global climate. I am by no means an expert, but from what little I do know, it\u2019s not a happy time to be in this particular industry. Has this affected your risk calculations? How do you adjust for unexpected global events like Covid that literally wipe the bottom out the market?   The freight industry (pretty much like any other industry) has taken a big hit definitely. But I think we can all be very happy that it wasn\u2019t completely obliterated: in this situation where personal travel has been severely restricted, cargo still needs to move as freely as possible (otherwise our supermarkets would get shockingly empty. One important thing though is that financing invoices that have already been spent is a much less risky proposition than say venture capital or growth funding where the company borrowing money is planning on using the company\u2019s growing revenue to repay. Invoice financing is on revenue that has happened already. There is of course a risk that the borrower goes bankrupt before paying back the debt. The maturity periods of these loans are generally less than 120 days. This means that the risk model you are building needs to evaluate the risk of default within the next 120 days not over a period of years which helps.     andytudhope:  But TIN only insures this up to 10%, right? Could one consider that 10% buffer something like the LR of a crypto-asset? I appreciate that real world assets are not generally as volatile as crypto, but is 10% really enough to cover the possibilities of liquidations in the current climate? Seems like there wouldn\u2019t be many parties willing to play keeper here, and that the assumption that it would be largely unnecessary is one that needs to be looked at very closely.   The TIN ratio is there to insure losses up to that percentage, you are right. The ratio chosen needs to be enough for the DROP investors to feel comfortable with the residual risk (a loss that is >10%). We\u2019ve put 10% as a proposal. I think it\u2019s a good starting point and something that I believe the risk team definitely should have a say. Let me give you an example though: ConsolFreight is going live with a 270k DAI pool with 10% coming from TIN investors. The borrowers are 4 different freight forwarders that have each contracts with dozens of companies. The average invoice size is ~5000$ so you are looking at more than 50 invoices. With this distribution a single invoice being a complete default would not lead anywhere close to the than 10% threshold. Not even a single buyer would  trigger losses that surpass 10% of losses. So with only 10% in TIN we can already cover for a lot of the typical default scenarios and mitigate the risk of a buyer going bankrupt. There are still risks that can cause more losses: the collapse of an entire industry, a political system, systemic fraud, etc. As long as you ensure that: Default risk < (stability fee - savings rate) Adding a collateral type will still be a net positive for the MKR holders and statistically should be profitable collateral type.

                    "content": "In traditional debt funds the NAV Model and valuation of the portfolio is agreed upon by the lenders and the fund manager and specified in the legal contract and this is the prevalent way that people price these assets today. This model is based on different data sources mostly focused on the individual credit risk and asset value of the loans in the portfolio. The best bet would be to base the price of DROP on similar calculations. There are two ways we can bring the price of DROP on chain:   We can have an oracle provide a price for DROP directly: that oracle could determine the price based on the value of the underlying collateral and look at that information off chain. This means oracle providers have to agree on how price the individual loans and calculate the price of DROP off chain and push it on chain.   However irregardless of the need for a price oracle for DROP, Tinlake needs an NFT price oracle to determine the amount of money to advance to the borrowers. And the same information is the basis on which DROP tokens can be priced on chain when lenders supply DAI to the Tinlake contracts the NAV model used to determine how many new DROP to mint and when DROP is redeemed the NAV calculation is used to determine how much DAI to return. To provide this information for the Tinlake contracts we are working on setting up oracles that can provide the individual credit risk, asset value and provenance data (was the asset correctly assigned to the SPV and do the lenders have a recourse on the collateral). This is then fed into an on-chain implementation of the NAV model giving everyone a maximum amount of transparency on chain and a NAV model that can\u2019t be tampered with.   We are open to going with either model and want to work on that with the oracles team when the onboarding process begins. There are a lot of parameters to set when determining pricing of these assets and we expect to be working with the Maker community on determining what these models should look like and will take the Risk team\u2019s recommendations into account when deploying it. We are working on a series of posts that explains how we are building these models that we started writing together with experts in the traditional finance world. The first post can be found here and we\u2019ll post the follow up soon. As for the question whether a token can be used to represent an interest in a company (a security), we have been working together with the asset originators to ensure they do. There are several security tokens frameworks and deployments (e.g. Harbor, RealT) that solve the problem of ensuring a legal recourse on an ERC20 token. This is an area where hopefully a legal memo can be procured by the Maker community specifically around these assets in MCD. ",

The issue you mention is also less relevant for us because a lot of it is cross border transactions and not US domestic.

                    "content": "Hi All, Much thanks for submitting this application. From my vantage point, and as I have previously stated (re: Decentraland/MANA), it seems to me that some projects have left information out of their applications that the DAO needs to understand before we onboard collateral. In particular, I\u2019ve noticed a lack of legal and regulatory info and analysis. Here, for instance, why are no materials provided and a question goes unanswered when asked about the legal or regulatory positioning of ConsolFreight DROP (look at question nos. 10 and 11). Anyway, I realize that this is the first time for all of us to go through this MIP, so I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and classify it as an oversight. Happens to everybody. That said, in the interest of time, I had some thoughts on matters relevant to Consulfreight and other similar \u201coff-chain\u201d asset projects that MKR holders should consider. Can @aleG or @spin please lend a hand when you have the chance? Several application excerpts caught my eye. I tried to highlight the specific parts that were the most noteworthy:  \u201cThe asset type we are proposing for inclusion in MCD is slightly different to the majority of collateral applications: the Asset Originators will be using MCD directly as a line of credit to originate new loans against freight invoices (invoice factoring and reverse factoring).\u201d   \u201cIn April of 2020, ConsolFreight conducted a pilot with MakerDAO and Centrifuge to transform logistics access to liquidity through a Defi Solution.\u201d   \u201cAlong with the necessary technical infrastructure to bring these assets into DeFi, the Asset Originator sets up a legal structure that provides the necessary support to ensure that anyone that owns a DROP token has a legal claim to the underlying assets. This is done with a legal structure very commonly used in the traditional financial system: The collateral for the individual loans are assigned to a legal entity, the \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d and lenders get an ownership interest in the entire portfolio of this entity (with this entity the assets are in an a bankruptcy remote structure that is not influenced by the Asset Originators).\u201d   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? Centrifuge Tinlake has been in development since early 2018. We did a first technical POC where a pre launch version of MCD on Kovan was used to deposit an ERC20 token that was backed by an NFT in April 2018. Only a few months later we deployed the first version of Tinlake to Ethereum mainnet and worked with five different Asset Originators to facilitate loans in DeFi. In a joint effort with MakerDAO to develop a tool to bring real-world assets into MCD we financed four of those Asset Originators with funds provided by the Maker Foundation totaling a volume of 250,000 SAI. The Asset Originators included a residential bridge loan as well as a mortgage originator, a financing solution provider for music royalties and a logistics platform providing invoice factoring. This allowed us to gain first experience with the setup and iterate on the smart contract and risk architecture. The current version of Tinlake has been audited and tested with two running deployments.   8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? ConsolFreight has incorporated ConsolFreight Pilot LLC, a Delaware (USA) limited liability company (the special purpose vehicle, \u201cSPV\u201d). This SPV has been formed to finance ConsolFreight\u2019s assets. This SPV structure creates a bankruptcy-remote entity whereby owners, debt holders or interested parties of this newly created SPV are left unaffected by the parent\u2019s financial, operational and/or legal health. We are collaborating with OpenLaw to open-source these contracts in order to make it accessible to other Asset Originators and use their infrastructure to allow public review of the signed contracts by anyone.   13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. The way this collateral type is used varies from how standard vaults are opened: DROP tokens have a stable USD price and any small fluctuations in the loan portfolio performance should be covered by the insurance provided by the TIN tranche. This means that under normal operation, the Asset Originator would not see their Vault get liquidated. A liquidation would only occur if a large amount of defaults occur across the portfolio that the risk model did not calculate. In case the Vault gets liquidated, the Tinlake contracts enforce a rebalancing of the pool to bring it back to its required collateralization ratio and will not allow issuing any new loans. Instead the Tinlake contracts are from this point on taking all of the cash flows generated by the borrowers and disbursing these to DROP token holders. Trade finance assets are usually short term assets and the instance of ConsolFreight the entire pool can be liquidated in <55 days (45 day term invoices + a grace period for late payments). Overall this means keeper liquidations will be a much less common occurrence that only happen when the risk model worked out for a given collateral type did not perform. In the debt finance world there are companies that specialize in buying distressed loan portfolios that can be onboarded as keepers for MCD that would be ideal candidates for buying any DROP that MCD wants to liquidate before the underlying portfolio is liquidated.  First of all, the above description of the DROP mechanics describes what most people around the world would understand as a debt security, or rather a transferable instrument representing a legal claim against the future disbursements of an entity\u2019s proceeds in satisfaction of a debt. The security status of DROP is further raised by the uncertain cash flows into the SPV, following Vault liquidation, from the originator and Tinlake \u201crebalancing\u201d. @AleG\u2019s comment above acknowledges that this process is a \u201csecuritization.\u201d  This presents a whole host of issues for MKR holders \u2013 not least of which are the implications of forced transfers pursuant to government action. Have ConsolFreight or Centrifuge undertaken any securities law analysis of DROP and/or obtained legal counsel regarding its status, including a legal memo reflecting such analysis that can be shared with MKR holders? @AleG\u2019s comment above references a \u201clegal process\u201d in relation to \u201csecuritization\u201d but there is no detail provided in the application or the comment. What is that legal process composed of? Has ConsolFreight or Centrifuge retained legal counsel to advise on, conduct, design this legal process? Did OpenLaw provide you with this legal advice? Next, while not fully explained or stated, it appears that potential DROP buyers (addressed below) purchase DROP exclusively through the MCD liquidation/auction process. I have only a lay understanding of this, but most jurisdictions generally require a regulated intermediary to conduct sales of securities. Certainly, in the US, one has to generally sell securities through an SEC-registered broker-dealer. MakerDAO is not such a regulated entity and, as far as I can tell, there is no provision for a broker-dealer in your plan to administer auctions. Has ConsolFreight or Centrifuge analyzed this issue? If so, what do the applicants propose as a solution to this? Is there some reason this is immaterial? What is it? Were the pilots you all conducted with the Maker Foundation, MakerDAO or both? Please note that the Foundation and the DAO are separate concerns. Also, it\u2019s stated that Centrifuge and MakerDAO \u201cdevelop a tool to bring real-world assets into MCD\u201d \u2013 aside from Centrifuge\u2019s public blog posts and the answer to the above question, what did the Maker Foundation or MakerDAO do to develop Tinlake, if anything? If the pilots were directly funded by the Foundation (and not a Vault) and that was seemingly the Foundation\u2019s only role in the Pilot, were you still able to test DROP deposits, auctions and DROP holder redemptions (on Kovan at least)? Who owns the SPV? Is it a Consolfreight or Centrifuge controlled parent? Please name the directors, members, shareholders and management of the SPV\u2019s parent. Will you disclose the names of each ultimate beneficial owner of the SPV\u2019s parent? Should we expect anyone who holds in an interest in the SPV to provide their identity in case of redemption? In other words, should a liquidation occur, and I win several DROP auctions with my keeper, will I be expected to identify myself in order to redeem my DROP for the underlying off-chain collateral (cash if you all are successful in selling the actual invoices)? If the SPV cannot liquidate its assets to pay DROP holders, what\u2019s next? What happens if the SPV fails to hold the underlying collateral and is unable to redeem DROPs for the collateral or cash? What then? Who can keepers (or MKR holders, for that matter) pursue? What is the relationship with OpenLaw? Are they providing legal counsel (as noted above, OpenLaw is not generally in the business of providing legal advice)? Or are they simply a technology provider? How does the structure ensure that the SPV is bankruptcy remote? And remote to whose bankruptcy \u2013 the originator\u2019s? Tinlake\u2019s? Its own? Do the SPVs have guarantors? Typically, with SPVs, although they are bankruptcy remote (if structured correctly), companies will establish a guarantor to ensure payment to creditors. Has Consolfreight and/or Centrifuge considered such a structure? Will Consolfreight (or Centrifuge) guarantee redemptions or is it publicly going to disavow liability? Will Consolfreight (or Centrifuge) provide legal insurance surrounding the SPV for its guarantees? Do Consolfreight and Centrifuge envision other potential keepers for the Tinlake program aside from typical purchasers of distressed debt, i.e. hedge funds? Regardless, what happens if other entities do act as keepers? This suggests there may be some whitelisting/blacklisting for DROP keepers; is that so? Are there ideal characteristics of a DROP keeper? What are they and why? Is that because it is implicitly understood that DROP would be a security and thus necessitate certain types of purchasers to avoid violation of the securities\u2019 laws? Please indicate whether ConsolFreight or Centrifuge have interacted with any regulatory agency regarding TinLake and/or DROP? If so, please state (a) the regulatory agency; (b) when those interactions occurred; and \u00a9 the conclusion of those discussions. The Tinlake organizational graphic and application response to question 9 suggest that both an operating memorandum and loan agreement will be executed by the Lender, presumably MakerDAO. Please correct me if I am wrong.   Where does exchange for the asset occur? The SPV enters into a subscription agreement with lenders who are receiving DROP from the SPV in turn for providing DAI. The DROP token can be redeemed against the cash flows of the underlying collateral directly from the SPV by any DROP holder. This is ensured by the Tinlake smart contracts and the primary way for interacting with these tokens.   The graphic from question 9 is a bit confusing, so can we run through a few things: the lender is MakerDAO; the SPV is the entity Consolfreight (or somebody) creates; the Asset Originator is Consolfreight; and the final borrower is the company that creates the invoices, right? Where does the SPV\u2019s parent sit? With this graph it looks like Centrifuge is the parent. That can\u2019t be right, can it? How are you going to have a loan agreement and an operating memorandum with MakerDAO \u2013 who can sign on behalf of \u201cMakerDAO\u201d? How can it be enforced by or against MakerDAO? Have you guys thought about these questions \u2013 they seem basic. And if there is no contract between the Lender \u2013 MakerDAO \u2013 and the other entities, how does your proposed arrangement work? How dependent is the structure on off-chain legal agreements? Back to the SPV, how will the system you describe ensure the preservation of SPV assets, and thereby value to DROP holders, i.e., by contract, bylaws, etc.? Why have none of these issues been addressed in your application? I get the technological focus but Consolfreight and Centrifuge are trying to move MakerDAO into the regulated waters. If you want us to do that, we need details. Otherwise, we\u2019re sailing blind into a potential squall (the lack of color on the SPV-Parent relationship is confusing enough without exploring the potential unregistered and non-brokered securities auctions and the concomitant issues). There is likely more to unpack here and certainly responses to the above will generate more questions. I hope these questions start to bring out data points and information that MKR holders require in order to thoroughly and thoughtfully assess ConsolFreight DROP\u2019s inclusion as collateral in MakerDAO. As I noticed some push back to my tone in the Decentraland/MANA application, so I would like to clarify that these questions are not meant to attack or temper the excitement of incorporating off-chain assets. Rather, I hope to elicit fulsome responses so we, the DAO, can better conduct the due diligence to ensure the Protocol\u2019s success and perseverance into the future. ",

                    "content": "@Tosh9.0 Thanks for your remarks and detailed questions. I will go into a bit more detail below about some specific points you\u2019ve brought up but I wanted to explain why we decided to leave the legal aspect of these tokens blank: The asset originators set up a legal entity and have sold their first DROP token to investors in a legally compliant way. I will elaborate a bit on this in the answers below. We have been working on a legal framework that we believe to be compliant with regulations and that can be made compatible how MakerDAO works. However neither the team behind Centrifuge or the asset originators themselves can write a legal memo on how these assets work within MCD: There\u2019s the issue of conflict of interest, the decision of what scope that we simply can\u2019t decide for the DAO. We believe that this should be part of the work the \u201clegal domain team\u201d does. I would also say that the MIP6 proposal was never intended to be a complete documentation pertaining everything necessary to know about the collateral. A lot of these questions will of course be addressed in the future as the domain teams work on the various topics and the executive vote is prepared.  The security status of DROP is further raised by the uncertain cash flows into the SPV, \u2026  The sale of DROP token to the first investors that ConsolFreight was made in a way compliant with US securities law. These tokens should be considered a security. This means that DROP tokens were only sold to accredited US investors or non-US persons/entities.  Next, while not fully explained or stated, it appears that potential DROP buyers (addressed below) purchase DROP exclusively through the MCD liquidation/auction process. I have only a lay understanding of this, but most jurisdictions generally require a regulated intermediary to conduct sales of securities. Certainly, in the US, one has to generally sell securities through an SEC-registered broker-dealer. MakerDAO is not such a regulated entity and, as far as I can tell, there is no provision for a broker-dealer in your plan to administer auctions. Has ConsolFreight or Centrifuge analyzed this issue? If so, what do the applicants propose as a solution to this? Is there some reason this is immaterial? What is it?  Keepers will likely have to go through the same process as regular investors that buy DROP from the issuer (the SPV).  Were the pilots you all conducted with the Maker Foundation, MakerDAO or both? Please note that the Foundation and the DAO are separate concerns. Also, it\u2019s stated that Centrifuge and MakerDAO \u201cdevelop a tool to bring real-world assets into MCD\u201d \u2013 aside from Centrifuge\u2019s public blog posts and the answer to the above question, what did the Maker Foundation or MakerDAO do to develop Tinlake, if anything?  To clarify: The Maker Foundation contributed no code to any of these deployments. But the asset originators that we work with have been working with the Business Development Team at maker alongside with us to develop the non-technical aspects.  If the pilots were directly funded by the Foundation (and not a Vault) and that was seemingly the Foundation\u2019s only role in the Pilot, were you still able to test DROP deposits, auctions and DROP holder redemptions (on Kovan at least)?  As mentioned above, the countparty was not an MCD vault but the Maker Foundation. The work we did was to help the asset originators to define a way to create their tokens, add collateral and prepare for the collateral onboarding process. On the technical side, we have integrated Tinlake into MCD over a year ago before MCD was live but have since focused on other parts and will need to revisit a lot of this.  Who owns the SPV? Is it a Consolfreight or Centrifuge controlled parent? Please name the directors, members, shareholders and management of the SPV\u2019s parent. Will you disclose the names of each ultimate beneficial owner of the SPV\u2019s parent?  Centrifuge does not have any ownership interest in the SPV (ConsolFreight Pilot LLC). I will let ConsolFreight share more on the structure.  Should we expect anyone who holds in an interest in the SPV to provide their identity in case of redemption? In other words, should a liquidation occur, and I win several DROP auctions with my keeper, will I be expected to identify myself in order to redeem my DROP for the underlying off-chain collateral (cash if you all are successful in selling the actual invoices)? If the SPV cannot liquidate its assets to pay DROP holders, what\u2019s next?  Under normal operation the Tinlake contracts will redeem your DROP for DAI. If the SPV were to fail to repay the DAI to the Tinlake contrats and the legal recourse would have to be taken, this can\u2019t be done anonymously but instead you would have to use the legal system where revealing your identity is usually required.  What happens if the SPV fails to hold the underlying collateral and is unable to redeem DROPs for the collateral or cash? What then? Who can keepers (or MKR holders, for that matter) pursue?  Are you describing what would happen in a default scenario? That would be the risk every DROP holder takes.  What is the relationship with OpenLaw? Are they providing legal counsel (as noted above, OpenLaw is not generally in the business of providing legal advice)? Or are they simply a technology provider?  OpenLaw has interesting technology to closely tie events on chain with legal contracts. They can for example attest that the borrower signed the appropriate agreement with the SPV on chain. We believe OpenLaw would be an interesting partner to help MakerDAO to ensure the right agreements are in place.  How does the structure ensure that the SPV is bankruptcy remote? And remote to whose bankruptcy \u2013 the originator\u2019s? Tinlake\u2019s? Its own?  The bankruptcy remoteness you usually want in this scenario is shielding the assets from any other claims. The SPV is a legal entity that has no contractual obligations besides the loans it issues to borrowers and the DROP & TIN tokens. If ConsolFreight\u2019s operating company would be the counterparty to these loans then any claims such as salaries of the team, potential legal liabilities etc. could suddenly compete with the DROP & TIN holders claims.  Do Consolfreight and Centrifuge envision other potential keepers for the Tinlake program aside from typical purchasers of distressed debt, i.e. hedge funds? Regardless, what happens if other entities do act as keepers? This suggests there may be some whitelisting/blacklisting for DROP keepers; is that so?  Keepers will likely have to be whitelisted with the SPV to participate in auctions.  Are there ideal characteristics of a DROP keeper? What are they and why? Is that because it is implicitly understood that DROP would be a security and thus necessitate certain types of purchasers to avoid violation of the securities\u2019 laws?  Yes, this is the assumption under which we operate on. To buy DROP token you need to be KYCed by the issuer and comply with local applicable law (which in the case of both our first two asset originators ConsolFreight and Paperchain is Delaware). Our current assumption is the following: DROP is considered a security but only if held by a legal entity. A DAO or smart contract is not a legal entity and therefore as long as theser tokens are held in a Vault controlled by the SPV, the SPV is not actually issuing a security. Only when the Vault goes into liquidation and keepers want to bid on it will the SPV issue the security to the highest bidder. Therefore while keepers need to get KYCed, not every single DAI holder or entity interacting with MCD has to. This is the basis that we propose for MakerDAO to pursue and investigate.  Where does the SPV\u2019s parent sit? With this graph it looks like Centrifuge is the parent. That can\u2019t be right, can it?  ConsolFreight LLC in Florida owns the ConsolFreight Pilot LLC.  Back to the SPV, how will the system you describe ensure the preservation of SPV assets, and thereby value to DROP holders, i.e., by contract, bylaws, etc.?  Yes, that is the operating agreement that is signed by the SPV and the asset originator (ConsolFreight).  Why have none of these issues been addressed in your application? I get the technological focus but Consolfreight and Centrifuge are trying to move MakerDAO into the regulated waters. If you want us to do that, we need details. Otherwise, we\u2019re sailing blind into a potential squall (the lack of color on the SPV-Parent relationship is confusing enough without exploring the potential unregistered and non-brokered securities auctions and the concomitant issues).  I don\u2019t think this was at all our intention. We have a few hundred pages of legal documents that we will be making public but just posting those alone will hardly allow an individual MKR holder to decide how to vote. All of these questions and many more should be addressed before finally onboarding the asset as collateral to MCD. That process will certainly take time and will need the involvement of experts (lawyers). The results will likely be legal opinions that have to be procured by MakerDAO that summarize the risks and mechanics of how these assets can be onboarded. ",

                    "content": "Full disclosure. I worked with Centrifuge on its invoice valuation blogpost.  For background, I was the head of consumer lending pricing at HSBC US and home equity pricing at Wells Fargo. Subsequent to this, I was a valuation senior manager at KPMG US, and now run the NYC valuation practice for CBIZ Valuation Group, part of the 7th largest accounting firm in the U.S.  My partner and I, Ryan Medlin, have been following Dharma and Maker since the original whitepapers were floating around. We think of price as being the present value of an expected future benefit stream.  In the context of debt, the interest is that benefit stream. The borrowers\u2019 ability and willingness to pay set the expectation. If there is a default, the likelihood of recovery sets that portion of the value.  Lastly, we want to know over what time frame does this all occur? Armed with those data points, and an understanding of how the market prices similar risks, an accurate value can be concluded. Error in valuation is typical measured in variance to a mean (average) result.  Variance is uncertainty.  Uncertainty can be driven by a lack of understanding counter-party risk, the enforce-ability of the agreement underlying the transaction, and the models/assumptions used to arrive at a value.  The greater the gap between the lender and party ultimately responsible for providing the benefit stream, the greater the system\u2019s inherent uncertainty. Higher uncertainty, lower participation, lower value proposition to the ecosystem and higher opportunity for sophisticated outside parties to game the system. So an ongoing goal upstream for the Maker community could be encouraging Centrifuge\u2019s ability to reduce uncertainty, to maximize value and avoid borrowers gaming DeFI over mis-priced risk.  Transparent remittance data, counter party performance in real time and other dashboards to improve predictability and reduce risk. Would love to see creativity here. Another objective, just throwing it out there, may be to figure out how you increase the sophistication of Maker lenders through education/transparency, or how do you reduce the need for that sophistication by using trusted 3rd parties/dashboards/etc.? -howard ",

                    "content": "Two weeks ago but some of this is just now hitting social media and i wanted to contribute to the conversation any way that i can. I have been involved with cryptocurrencies since 2015 and i\u2019m very optimistic about the potential of blockchain  technology. That being said, i\u2019m also Manager of Operations for a Motor Carrier/Logistics company specializing in the transportation of high value, critical pharmaceutical freight as well as Food and other consumer essential product that requires temperature control. I will leave out my real name or the name of my company for obvious reasons but i will provide some background info : I have been in Logistics for 15 years now. I have worked with Dry Freight, Rail , Containers,  Flat bed, Oversize & Overdimensional, Sprinter vans and Reefer. There is virtually no commodity that i haven\u2019t played a part in. From wood, paper ,plastic, to medicine, jet engines and high contrast MRI solutions. I have worked with small shippers and customers all the way up to customers like  Amazon, Wal-Mart , Costco - a number of Life Science/Pharmaceutical companies and even government contracts be it mail or supplies for correctional facilities and airforce bases around the country. Not only do i facilitate the contracts between my carrier company and the Customer or other  Broker/ 3PLs ,   i have extensive knowledge about the accounting/invoicing aspect both when working with a factoring company and doing our own invoicing. I see massive potential with blockchain when it comes to immutable data pertaining to the integrity of the product. For example :  undeniable proof that the freight was continuously kept at - 10 F Usually if the product is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations, the shipper will place temp recorder(s) along with the freight. These are not always 100% reliable as they run on batteries and believe it or not, they die a lot more often than you would think. The other option is requesting a temperature download. This is a scenario where the carrier is requested to have their reefer unit plugged into a computer via USB to  and the software pulls data from the units memory. This is also not 100% reliable , simply because i can receive this report from a ThermoKing and just edit the data with something as simple DocHub, or Photoshop. (not that i would   ) Blockchain could help in this sense because it would reduce very costly and time consuming claims disputes. That is of course,  if the insurance companies providing coverage could see themselves benefiting from \" TRUTH \" and new Tech that could one day put them out of business. Big IF in my humble opinion. As far as this being introduced into any payment systems , i have to say that It will be nearly impossible to implement. At least not in the foreseeable future. As an advocate of blockchain and its infinite potential , i simply have to be realistic and say that adoption still has such a long way to go. With transportation/supply chain  being such a HUGE industry it is still embarrassingly, one of the most unregulated in this country. My reasons for having this opinion are many and i have already put up a wall of text so if people are interested - I am willing to answer any questions Thank you and keep up the good work ! ",

Yes - the supply chain environment has by many people been put forward as a prime example of a segment that could benefit from the use of blockchains. A few years ago however I did some research into the matter and found that the sensor-sender-battery combinations available were simply not up to it. The combined power requirement resulted in battery sizes that were unpractical. The Internet-of-Things aspect will simply have to wait until better technology is available. It is interesting you have familiarity with factoring of invoices since that is at the heart of the ConsolFreight DROP application. Would you mind telling us a bit about what has happened in the freight invoice factoring business since the Corona virus outbreak?

                    "content": "My company doesn\u2019t use a factoring company anymore, hasn\u2019t for years but i am still very familiar with how they operate and how a company operates when it factors their invoices. We simply invoice the customer / broker directly. Factoring companies charge an average of %2 So if a company brings in 100M yearly gross revenue, its not a small figure  to pay. Especially considering that you can hire 10 accountants and pay them each 6 figures  and still not be at even 30% of what you would pay to the factoring company. We only have maybe 5 people in accounting and apart from the head of the department they earn maybe 40k annually. We do however, still use various factoring  companies and their web service for insight into DTP (Days to Pay) so we can notice trends and make decisions who to work with. Some of the biggest names in the industry right now have dropped in rating. Generally a factoring company gives credit ratings  A , B, C , D , F They have 2 additional ratings N ( non rated = No invoice history - these are usually newer companies that have yet to establish themselves ) and I ( I rated companies either have disputes with the factoring company OR have completely failed to pay and get marked as ineligible ) Motor Carrier companies as a rule of thumb will only book freight with brokers that have rating C and above. This means that will pay out in less than 45 days (which is the cutoff for C rating ) That being said , i\u2019ll answer your question about what has happened since the Covid outbreak. It has been in one word, terrible. Terrible for everyone. The freight volume has dropped significantly. Shippers and customers at large are taking the opportunity to gauge the market heavily. Shipping Rates have dropped up to 50% on average for dry and refrigerated freight while Flatbed i can only assume came to a near complete halt as demand for building and construction materials also plummeted. A big factor was also that international supply chain was  simply hammered. One of our biggest customers was bringing in medical supply product from Italy. We would pick it up at ORD and continue ground to various facilities in the Midwest. Heres how our order list looked like the past several months : December  - 58 shipments January -  22 February - 25 March -  13 April - 13 May - 6 And this is only ONE of more than a dozen customers that rely on their product arriving from Europe or Asia (primarily India in the pharmaceutical industry) The pandemic has serious impact. Beyond any low market ive seen in my career. Carriers  struggle not to lose their drivers who are a scarcity as it is  and also their office personnel. Many trucks were simply put on the sidelines because they were operating at barely break even cost and it wasn\u2019t financially worth it to keep them on the insurance policy. Many owner operators have done the same, returning the equipment they lease from our company, asking to be removed from the companies insurance and opting to go home and take unemployment benefits. Office employees got a 20% cut on their salary. (in my company) Brokerage suffered as well. If not more. Some of the bigger companies we are partnered with , were reporting in April - going from 6,000 loads per week to less than 100. I\u2019m using very round up hypothetical examples here but if they have 500 booking agents employed , they would now need only 10 to ensure all customer freight is covered and all this with MINIMAL margins. Essential employees continued to work , albeit from home while a large  amount of logistics coordinators and brokers without accounts under their own management were furloughed of simply let go. Track & Trace - massively outsourced to India, Pakistan etc\u2026 If they are asset based , they were putting worthwhile freight on their own trucks while either coming out of pocket to double broker & cover the surplus, or breaking their contracts. A lot of latter seemed to be happening in addition to customers breaking contracts as well as they were flooded by  many young and upcoming companies that were eager to underbid. This just caused an even further downspiral in the market. We see spikes every few weeks but you can tell its because the stores have run out of food. Omaha, KS, SD become hot zones for maybe 5 days and then overnight - the Load/Truck ratio goes under 1   ( more trucks than loads ) In all my years in this business , i have never seen Chicago be at a 0.1   L/T ratio. That means that there is 1 load\u2026 for every 10 trucks in the area. The job will simply go to the lowest bidder. Things have improved since and the market is seeing a comeback as states are reopening now but the damage it has done , has put literally 10s of thousands of companies out of business. Has my answer helped ? ",

I guess what I am really looking for is some form of analysis of whether or not the TIN/DROP token split will protect DROP in case of market disruptions such as the Corona virus event.     Peter_Jones:  That means that there is 1 load\u2026 for every 10 trucks in the area.   Correct me if I am wrong, but from your insights it appears to me that TIN holders in a generic freight company will be wiped out, with DROP tokens possibly taking a 80% haircut. To me at least it seems we must either build buffers to compensate, or both the price evaluation and the sale of DROP tokens from Vaults must be somehow be automated. If ConsolFreight DROP had been introduced before March it could have resulted in a double Black Thursday event for Maker. ",

You equal an empty load = non-payment which is not correct. If you are not able to fill a truck you will not have an invoice you can factor because there is no shipment that you can invoice for. So if only one out of ten trucks is full that means you will only have invoices for 10% of the volume. That doesn\u2019t mean a factoring company still advance 100% of your volume. Let me make an example, we assume that all invoices are net 30 that means they will be repaid the month after: Mar: Invoiced: 100k, Factored: 100k April: Invoiced: 10k, Factored: 10k, Buyer Paid: 100k, Loan Repaid: 100k May: Invoiced: 10k, Factored: 10k, Buyer Paid: 10k, Loan Repaid: 10k It is important to note that the 100k payment by the buyer in April is not money that the shipper has any legal claim to, When they factor the invoice they give up any claim on these revenues. So the risks to look at when evaluating invoices are:  Risk of default by the customer before the invoice is repaid Risk of fraud: the shipper could try falsify their invoices in April to keep getting 100k (or more) Risk of supplier/shipper default: if the payments are not directly redirected from buyer to factorer with a lockbox account then there is a risk that the supplier doesn\u2019t forward the payment or goes bankrupt within that period. The best way to avoid this is to setup a lockbox bank account that buyers pay into.  The reason why we create a portfolio of assets is that you get diversity to remove the cluster risk for any of the above scenarios to happen. By having many buyers and shippers you avoid having one bad asset wipe out the entire junior tranche. So the thing to watch out for is to make sure that across the portfolio these default stay below 10% to keep the senior safe. Just to compare how much 10% is, on Black Thursday and the weeks following thereafter, even though the unemployment rates definitely did see a jump on that order of magnitude, the amount of bankruptcies in the US definitely climbed nowhere near as high.

To wipe out an entire well-balanced portfolio this is what would have to happen. Looking at Black Thursday that wasn\u2019t the case either. Because these loans are relatively short term (~60 day avg) the credit risk of companies can be continuously re-evaluated and you would simply stop adding loans of risky borrowers (for example the travel industry during the covid19 lockdown). These are not long term loans that a pool would always be stuck with. If the economy doesn\u2019t recover of course one of these pools could degrade in performance and go bust over the period of a few months but at least looking at the crash we had on Black Thursday would unlikely cause an immediate loss. Does this make sense? ",

That being said, the DAT Analytics are not the most reliable when it comes to a situation like Covid. Reason being, brokerage will have less freight to cover so initially , you will have a surplus of employees all competing to book the same load. So instead of a small team of 3,4 people trying to cover their freight, a larger group in company is given a chance to find the lowest prices so the number of postings can go up. Working from home, they will post one load 8,9 times with different extensions. Doesn\u2019t mean there is 9 loads. I based my ratios on actually looking at how many companies are posting their trucks and how many real loads are posted by brokers within a 150 miles - 200 mile radius. ",

                    "content": "Maybe I\u2019m not fully understanding but i think you might be looking at this too logically. I did mention this is a very unregulated industry  I\u2019ll give you a few examples very broad examples all bunched into one mess that is logistics  : Facility makes  product X  in IOWA. Wal-mart wants to buy it. They put in orders. Lets say some of these orders need to go to Buffalo, NY They don\u2019t have enough of their own trucks so they call JB Hunt. (They are a mega carrier have thousands of trucks and trailers AND\u2026 a brokerage as well ) They pay JB Hunt for X amount of shipments within a certain timeframe. Jb Hunt takes the contract. They send some trucks but fail to position enough of them or they just don\u2019t want to ( not profitable at the moment ) They are getting $2500 per shipment so they contact XPO and offer them 30 shipments for $2000 a piece. XPO covers what they can with XPO trucks \u2026 and then what they can\u2019t goes on the spot market. ( All of this is called Double brokering freight. Some customers allow it, most don\u2019t. ) Now\u2026 Dispatcher from company ABC Trucking is looking at DAT Loadboard , sees this load IA- NY and makes a call. He books the load with Broker from XPO Logistics. They only pay ABC trucking $1800 Carrier picks it up\u2026 he thinks its just not enough to take it all the way out there. So he takes the container trailer off , and pays $800 to ship it to Buffalo via RAIL. He\u2019s left with $1000 that uses to pay $150 to the driver who picked up and brought to the railyard \u2026 and another 150 to the driver waiting in Buffalo to pick it up from the railyard and take it to the Wal-Mart. None of this is legal. So just try to wrap your head around that, this is all of course once the product is already here, if its not produced here, you cannot even imagine the shenanigans when you add AIR & SEA. As far as the invoicing goes\u2026 Trucking company submits paperwork to factoring company only because they want to get paid faster. They dont want to wait for those 30, 45 days to pass. They want the money NOW so they can pay for fuel, tolls , drivers etc\u2026 If the broker (at the time) has  a good credit rating, factoring company  pays  the carrier. If that broker goes out of business next month\u2026 the factoring company will turn around and take that money back from the carrier by witholding pay from other invoices  in what they call a \" Reserve \" This is usually how it works. Although it might look much simpler on the surface where you have a seller and a buyer,  the flow of goods, services and  money is a lot more complicated. Sometimes the shipper is simply a storage facility. They get paid just to store the product and collect loading/unloading fees.  This was one of the issues we were having in the midst of the pandemic, stores were not ordering as much product , the cold storages were getting overloaded with product. We would pick up loads and find out on the day of delivery that they cannot give us an appointment for 5 days. At any rate\u2026 i can\u2019t imagine even a 1% fluctuation in price not having massive implications for all parties involved. If crypto was involved without any built in stability that Fiat has and you had contracts that were losing value overnight by 2,3 or up to 10% you would just see massive cancellations all over the place. It would potentially lead to even more shenanigans than already exists IMO because its never so cut & dry. Sorry for another big rant. ",

                    "content": "@Peter_Jones thank you for all your comments, I can tell you are very vested in the US trucking industry, but logistics goes farther away that the US and uses other transportation methods such as Air and Ocean. In reference to the IoT, is an industry that has evolved tremendously, specially in the last two years. Today we find devices that the battery last for several months at the time. But the use of IoTs shouldn\u2019t affect the the repayment of an invoice as not every load is required to use IoTs. You are absolutely right that COVID had shocked all industries as the world came to stop at a rate we have never seen before, where some industries have suffer immensely and others have grown as well. In both cases affecting supply chains and service providers. As examples of growth, we seen the Air Cargo space surge over 300% in some cases, as all governments and private companies rushed to procure PPE from China, this also affected the trucking companies that had 4-5 hours of waiting time at airport terminals to pick up these loads, and I can also tell you that drives increased their waiting time rate in cases to 100% of the normal rate. As China Air space got tighter, companies starting to procure PPE material in places like Mexico that moved incredible amounts of loads over the road to the US, and in those corridors the rates went up 15% to 25%. During lock down many companies in the US received  their PPP government bailouts to support 2.5 months of payroll, so even volumes where down for most companies so did their overheads, and now that the economy is opening again, volumes as increasing very rapidly as the demand to fulfill empty distribution centers is very high. The port of Rotterdam, as an example, is moving almost the same volumes as pre COVID. But the decrease of volume shouldn\u2019t affect more than the volume of invoices factored, the decrease of volume will have impact in liquidity, probably promoting the use of factoring solutions to help companies coupe with the current demand for services as business re-opens.

Small problem with that\u2026 At the airlines, the area inside the building  where drivers check in on the computers and wait to be let in through the fence is generally very small. Due to COVID, the social distancing rules,  they no longer allow you to check in at  until a loading dock (door) becomes available. And the broker, customer wont pay you anything until you have checked in. These past few weeks as the freight picks up and amazon trucks cause congestion at ORD , our drivers  would sometimes have to wait 4,5 hours just to get a door. And then it would take another 4,5 hours to get them loaded. In our case, detention rates haven\u2019t increased. If anything we\u2019re keeping out mouths shut because people are being extremely competitive right now and we don\u2019t want to cause noise and risk losing the freight because we\u2019re charging them too much on the accessorials.
