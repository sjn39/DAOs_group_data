Then, I swapped all of my USDC for $OP on Optimism for a larger voting power. However, the problem is that the utilization of $OP is a little bit low, I wonder if there is any platform can only stake my $OP for a basic APY? Yep, I know that AAVE supports that but the APY in AAVE is too low\u2026 In Binance, there is about 5%-35%APY by staking $OP, is there any platform? ",
