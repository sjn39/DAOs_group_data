This means large vaults in this configuration would be immune to liquidation, which could be disruptive to the health of the protocol and the keeper ecosystem. For this reason, we suggest adjusting the lump for ETH-A to 100 ETH. The resulting change will reduce lot sizes from 500 ETH to 100 ETH and result in smaller auction sizes.

The overflow happens in this line: https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/master/src/cat.sol#L136 which makes art * rate * chop can not be higher than the max uint256. Taking out chop (1.13 RAY) makes the debt to be auctioned (art * rate) can not be higher than: 102,470.8754\u2026 DAI. So a vault with for example 500 ETH or less and 102,471 DAI debt couldn\u2019t be liquidated now if the price of ETH would drop (this is the only effect of this issue). This gets mitigated by reducing the lump as each auction will also split the total debt. The problem raises now as with a higher ETH price it is more normal to have higher debt with less ETH collateral locked. ",

Just so I\u2019m understanding, this prevents liquidations of the vaults with more than 102k Dai per lot, but it will not put the system in a broken state, correct? As soon as the executive passes the liquidations will turn on again? Is there plans to update the contract code to address this more robustly? 102k Dai per lot is not a super high number. I\u2019m also curious as to why something like this isn\u2019t picked up with formal verification. Integer overflow seems like a common class of error to run into, especially since the system is designed to operate over many orders of magnitude of growth. ",
