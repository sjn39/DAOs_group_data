To be clear, this would mean disregarding the monetary policy polls entirely for the week in question and running them next week as usual. I would suggest that this is a positive step which will increase the speed and uptake of the emergency fix, without the risk of divided opinions due to monetary policy issues.     In the case that an executive vote includes emergency technical changes, we should include monetary policy changes in that executive (as per usual). In the case that an executive vote includes emergency technical changes, we should not include monetary policy changes in that weeks executive (instead skipping monetary policy changes for that week). We should skip monetary policy changes for this week due to this specific emergency only.

But I also thought the idea of making \u2018quick changes\u2019 to anything was the reason for the current vote to up the gsm to 24hrs. The following questions come to mind:  Is the current situation an emergency or simply exposure to threat? Does Maker need to act more quickly than usual to address the situation? Does Maker want to put a hold on monetary changes to do these other actions? How fast does Maker expect \u2018who\u2019 or \u2018whom\u2019 to act \u2018how\u2019, \u2018when\u2019 generally.?  I consider these all distinct questions at this point and as an newcomer still diging into details of the system I\u2019m going to Abstain as not feeling knowledgeable on the subject and defer to those with more expertise and experience here.

Telegraphing intention to attack \u201cfor the lulz\u201d is the first necessary step towards an actual undercover attack.\u201d (This was in reference to a twitter poll that felix posted illustrating that some twitter users were discussing the attack vector) In general, it seemed that the answer was \u201cYes\u201d. As far as I\u2019m concerned they are the experts, personally I think the attack is still unlikely, but I don\u2019t have a great insight into the likelihood of technical problems so I\u2019m willing to follow their lead.
