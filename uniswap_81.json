I\u2019ve read this article and some questions came to my mind:  Why do we say that with Uniswap V2, part of the liquidity provides is never put to use. The article states:   In Uniswap v2, liquidity is distributed evenly along an x*y=k price curve, with assets reserved for all prices between 0 and infinity. For most pools, a majority of this liquidity is never put to use. I don\u2019t understand it because when I put some liquidity, this liquidity is \u201cmixed\u201d with the whole liquidity pool. So I don\u2019t understand why the liquidity I provided would be less used than other. I missed something but find understand what.   I don\u2019t understand the Capital efficiency comparison between V2 and V3 The article describes the following example:  image1200\u00d7607 86.9 KB   I understand the conclusion: with less capital, we are able to earn the same. But I don\u2019t understand the diagram. How is the APR calculated? Can someone get a little bit into the details of how you got the figures on this diagram?  Thank you so much for your explanation!
