Hot off the press is one of the most exciting announcements of the Endgame Plan, the clustering of Ecosystem Actors coming together from different walks of life, and different Core Unit teams and forming as Ecosystem Actors. The recent announcement of the Spark Protocol and Phoenix Labs has brought a widespread interest among the DeFi community. We can\u2019t remember this much excitement since perhaps the release of Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD). The team known as Phoenix Labs (wholly owned by MakerDAO) has announced its first solution, the Spark Protocol, which aims to enhance MakeDAO\u2019s features by creating a liquidity market for scalable crypto assets with variable and fixed rates. Spark Protocol\u2019s first product is Spark Lend, a lending market that integrates Maker\u2019s D3M and the PSM. We really enjoyed talking with the Phoenix Labs team and we hope you take time out of your day to inform yourself on MakerDAO\u2019s newest innovative approach.
