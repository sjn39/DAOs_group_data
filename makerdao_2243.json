                    "content": "Now that the Maker Constitution and the Scope Frameworks are about to be formally submitted, I will be focusing for a while on describing some of the major long term features that are a part of the Endgame concepts (but, like with everything else, still need to be iterated on). The first is the Sagittarius Engine The Sagittarius Engine (SE) is an MKR voter incentive and governance lockup mechanism, and it is the first Endgame Product that would be built and available in a relatively stort amount of time. The two main voter incentives that the SE provides are the ability to farm Dai yield (and later also SubDAO tokens), and the ability to generate Dai with the locked up MKR as collateral (with conservative risk parameters). The goal of the Sagittarius Engine is to incentivize MKR holders to lock up their MKR for the long term, by providing them acctractive rewards for doing so, while also requiring them to participate in Governance. Users who are locked in and incur a cost for leaving the SE again, as opposed to staying, will be much more inclined to actually participate in Maker Governance and try to fix issues they see, rather than just leave and sell their tokens. As a result, the more locked up MKR holders there are, on average the intelligence of Maker Governance would increase as the amount of motivated and properly aligned MKR holders would increase.  Governance lockup exit fee To use the SE and take advantage of its voter incentives, MKR holders have to lock up their MKR behind a 15% exit fee, and delegate their MKR to a valid delegate contract (Doesn\u2019t have to be a Constitutional Delegate, can also be a Permissionless Delegate). When the user withdraws their MKR again, 15% of their principal is burned, benefitting all of the MKR holders who did not use the Sagittarius Engine. As a result, the best way to use it is to stay locked up for as long as possible - in most cases at least several years. The fact that you can use your locked MKR to generate Dai helps alleviate some of the downside of having your MKR locked up. Once locked up in the SE, the users will be well positioned to participate in Constitutional Voter Committees as a means of making sure that their assets are safe and to prevent Maker Governance from deteriorating now that they are locked up and gain very attractive benefits for staying in the system.  Easy Governance Frontend When using the SE and locking up MKR, the \u201cofficial\u201d way to access the smart contract is to use a system called the Easy Governance Frontend(EGF). The EGF is a standardized, regulated way of displaying the Maker delegates, that shows the Constitutional Delegates by default, and also shows the largest and most popular Constitutional Voter Committees by default. Since the SE requires the MKR holder to delegate their MKR, they have to pick a delegate using the EGF before they can lock up their MKR and gain the voter incentives. The constitution regulates who is shown by default so that voters who simply vote at random only to gain the voter incentives will be strengthening the existing governance equilibrium. In this process, they also need to choose a Governance Strategy, based on the Constitutional Voter Committees, to simplify and gamify the governance experience and maximize the likelihood that Maker Governance can extract some intelligence from the user, rather than just have them make their choice at random. MKR holders can also delegate to Permissionless Delegates by searching for their address in the EGF interface. This ensures that even if a very equilibrium is in place, as long as MKR holders are able to understand this and react there are no incentives that prevent them from completely overturning the status quo. Once the MKR holder has chosen a delegate to delegate to, they can choose how to access the Voter Incentives.  Token farming The first voter incentive that the SE user must choose in the EGF is which token to farm. The first version of the SE will only support farming Dai, but once the SubDAO launches then their tokens will also be available to farm by SE users. The current parameters for the Dai Farming is that it will be 25% of all protocol surplus that goes to SE Dai farmers. Example calculation: If the MKR market cap is 1 billion, the protocol surplus is 100 million per year, and 25% of all MKR holders are locked into the Sagittarius Engine, then the locked MKR users would be earning a Dai yield of 10% on their locked MKR. This example scenario would also result in 3.75% of the total MKR supply becoming locked in for burning up front. Later on, SubDAO token farming will also be added once the SubDAO launch. 25% of all SubDAO token farming will go to SE users. SE users can only choose a single token to farm, so as users switch away from Dai farming and into SubDAO token farmin, the Dai yield would also increase.  Dai generation from MKR Because a key characteristic of the Sagittarius Engine is that it locks up users behind an exit fee in order to give them a greater incentive to properly participate in Maker Governance, the ability to access some of the liquidity of the underlying MKR is a very valuable feature that makes it much less risky to lock in to the Sagittarius Engine. This means that SE users don\u2019t have to worry about misjudging their financial situation or their liquidity needs, if they suddenly find themselves in a situation where they would have normally just sold some of their tokens. With the SE, instead they can just generate Dai while still receiving the Dai farming rewards with all of their MKR, and without having to pay the exit fee. There is of course risk associated with using MKR as collateral - just like there is with any other collateral type in the Maker protocol. The key mitigating factor is to set very strong risk parameters that prevent dangerous situations from occuring. Because the risk parameters themselves are normally set by MKR holders, and in particular SE users who are active in governance, it is important that the risk parameters of the SE are codified directly in the Maker Constitution, to prevent the slippery slope edge case where MKR holders give themselves increasingly dangerous risk parameters. The risk parameters will have to be carefully chosen based on thoughtful risk analysis by experts working under the Decentralized Collateral Scope, and should be iterated on over the entire course of the Pregame, so that when the SubDAOs are about to launch the community can make a final well thought through decision. Here are some example risk parameters that I think can act as a good starting point in balancing risk mitigation with usefulness and voter incentive effect. Stability Fee: Equal to DSR if the total SE debt is below the SE Soft Debt Ceiling, and increases exponentially, with the SF doubling every 20% that the Soft Debt Ceiling is exceeded Debt Ceiling: There\u2019s no upper limit on the debt ceiling, but it is algorithmically adjusted through a defensive debt ceiling IAM that ensures that debt cannot grow too fast (to mitigate edge case attacks). Soft Debt Ceiling: The SDC is the parameter that in practice limits the use of the SE, since it determines when the SF becomes high enough to push away users of the system. The SDC is set as the 100% * the Surplus Buffer + 66% * the value of crypto assets such as ETH and staked ETH owned by the protocol + 40% of the value of all Elixir owned both by Maker Core and SubDAOs (Elixir are multi-market and multi-chain baskets of MKR/DAI liquidity pool tokens, but during the pregame it is just the UNIV2 MKR/DAI pool) Example: So in a situation where the Surplus Buffer is at 50 million, the protocol owns 30 million DAI worth of ETH and Staked ETH, the Maker Smart Burn Engine owns 100 million DAI worth of Elixir, and there are 6 SubDAOs that each own 10 million DAI worth of Elixir, then the total SDC is as follows: 100% * 50 million + 66% * 30 million + 40% * 100 million + 40% * 6 * 10 million = 134 million DAI If the DSR is at 3%, then that means if there are less than 134 million DAI borrowed from the SE, then the SE SF is at 3%. If there is 160 million borrowed from the SE, then the SE SF is at 6%, and if there is 187 million borrowed from the SE, the SE SF is at 12%. After a few doublings, a hard limit is going to be reached where SE users will start paying back their debt to avoid paying the very high Stability Fee. Liquidation Ratio: The regular vault Liquidation Ratio is 200%. The moment an SE vault hits 200% or less collateralization, it is liquidated in entirety as a TWAP (dss-kiln) on the Elixir orderbooks. Soft Liquidation Ratio: SLR is 300%. Soft liquidation means that when an SE vault goes below the SLR, they are \u201cmarked for soft liquidation\u201d by a keeper that is earning an incentive to mark such vaults. If the SE user doens\u2019t recollateralize their SE vault and remove the \u201cmark\u201d within 7 days, it is liquidated. This will generally keep the collateralization ratio of SE vaults very high, while still giving users a long grace period if there is a sudden drop in the MKR price. An SE Vault cannot be opened with a collateralization that is lower than the SLR. Sticky Oracle: The MKR oracle for the SE Vaults is special and designed to be lower risk than normal oracles, by having \u201csticky\u201d upwards price movement. It works by operating both on a real price (measured from Elixir), and a Sticky Price. The Sticky Price is what is actually used for calculating the LR and SLR for SE Vaults. Whenever the real price is below the Sticky Price, the Sticky Price instantly adjusts down to be equal to the real price. But when the real price is above the Sticky Price, the Sticky Price adjusts upwards at a throttled rate of at most 5% per month. This means that even if there is a massive bubble where the MKR price increases 10x, the amount of Dai that can be generated from existing SE vaults will not increase more than 5% per month. These parameters should be fine tuned to be optimized for historical crypto bubbles, to ensure that the SE vaults as much as possible ignore the \u201cbubble part\u201d of the price curve, and only moves smoothly from one long term price level to the next. All of these parameters described above are example parameters, and they do not apply to the Sagittarius Engine version that will be deployed in the short run in the pregame, as there are several features it would not have implemented yet. But hopefully it gives a sense of a starting point from where the Sagittarius Engine, and in particular the ability to generate Dai with MKR, can be seen as a purely positive voter incentive mechanism that can easily be worth it the significant benefits it provides, while being derisked through well tuned parameters.  Conclusion In conclusion, the Sagittarius Engine is a voter incentive mechanism that makes it very attractive to lock up your MKR for the long term, and as a result acts as a key bridge for moving MKR holders from being inactive in governance, to becoming active at the periphery of governance through a derisked, simplified and gamified delegation UX and potentially even moving deeper into the layers of governance by participating in CVCs. It also benefits passive MKR holders as they get to frontload a large amount of MKR burn, and have access to lots of liquidity while knowing that there are other MKR holders who are deeply incentivized to actually look after the system and the interests of all MKR holders.

Not just MKR as collateral but another concern can rise from MKR lock users trying to for example, reduce or even eliminate the exit fee. Or get reimbursed in the future. I think we will definitely see such discussions on the likely argument that lowering such attracts more MKR users to stake. Or in reverse, the same change can be used to pressure other MKR stakers to exit so those who remain can have more power. So it just shows the importance of multiple scopes needing to adhere to constitution. ",
