                    "content": "Greetings from SES Today our core unit shares diagrams created from each core unit\u2019s MIP40, and have gathered them in a collection we\u2019re calling the MIP Map. This tool gives an easy overview of the different budget structures existing in the current and upcoming Core Units at the DAO. The map is accessible to anyone. The intended purpose is to create an interactive tool to explore all budgets structures used in the DAO. Anyone who is interested about CU budgets will find it easier to compare, contrast, and explore transactions by engaging with this tool. The long term goal is to produce these diagrams automatically based on the contents of the budget MIPs. This version was created manually as a first step. The MIP Map can be accessed at this link:   miro.com    MIP Budget Map A map of diagrams showcasing Core Units budget structure       What does the diagram show?   You can see: Important MIP Dates Payment flow from the DAO to the Core Unit itself Accounting & audit structure MultiSig addresses and its owners Amount of Dai flowing Clickable links that direct to the sources of the presented information  Reasonings behind this map To increase the transparency and accessibility of budgets, this tool gathes a multitude of links from all relevant websites, and presents them in a consistent manner for exploration. Being able to quickly get an overview of these budget structures is helpful to anyone, new or experienced with Maker.  The overall path forward for budget transparency is:  Document the models that are being used today by the various core units. Synthesize the common elements that are reused throughout these different configurations. Identify best practices and recommendations for core units to improve transparency and accountability. Work with governance for standardization of the situation on the ground. Automate the entire process so that the reporting as well as the audit checks easily scale up to more core units.  As a starting point to this process, the MIP Map will serve as a living document that is updated each governance cycle.  Next steps As always, we welcome the community\u2019s feedback, thoughts, and improvement suggestions on the tool and next steps. Continue with the synthesis of common elements and best practices as outlined in the previous paragraph. @SES-Core-Unit ",

I mean, I\u2019m not opposed to it\u2026I just didn\u2019t specify the limit and want to make sure the diagram is accurate. Maybe you got this from the earlier MIP40 proposal?
