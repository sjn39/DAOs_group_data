                    "content": " Improving and Professionalising How Maker Deals With Real-World (and Structured) Finance MakerDAO has the potential to become the central pillar of the DeFi monetary ecosystem, by onboarding tens of billions of complex assets that have so-called \u201creal\u201d use cases - beyond trading. The Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) wants to support this vision by helping the wider ecosystem mature, and by professionalising internal checks and balances within MakerDAO.  Bootstrapping RWF was Instrumental from 0 to 20m DAI, but the Approach Needs to Evolve to Scale LOVE is following in the footsteps paved by the original RWF Core Unit. The team\u2019s bootstrapping efforts grew Maker\u2019s footprint to 20m DAI minted. LOVE believes the lessons learned from this initial effort require solving certain challenges:   Credit quality. A DAO is not the most efficient construct to actively manage credit exposures \u2013 especially when things don\u2019t go as planned. For this reason, providing financing to higher-risk / higher-return (but work-intensive) borrowers might not be the most prudent way forward for Maker, exposing it to moral hazard and default risk.  Scalability. As minter of DAI, MakerDAO\u2019s competitive advantage resides in having deep liquidity and extremely competitive cost of capital. Thanks to this, Maker could be best positioned to become the super senior lender of lower-risk / lower-return borrowers. Those borrowers are more difficult to attract (being highly institutionalised and often regulated) but offer a more attractive scalability avenue for Maker, at much lower risk levels.  Structuring. Most (if not all) structures bootstrapped so far don\u2019t provide sufficient (or any) protection to Maker as a lender, all those structures need to be revised if Maker wants to scale its RWF efforts in a prudent way. Hurdles are immense as this has never been done before.  Risk management. A multi-layered construct without a single point of failure must be developed within the DAO, in order to avoid information asymmetry, sub-optimal behaviours, and opaque execution.   We Think the Time Has Come to Move to 100b DAI. How? LOVE believes the challenges above will soon turn into assets for the DAO. A year ago, a regulated bank would have never talked with Maker. Today, a regulated bank, a large fund, a big company, as well as an innovative fintech player are all ready to work with Maker to solve complex problems, together.   Ensure coordination. The DAO should embrace a sustainable and decentralized operational framework to onboard new complex collateral assets, a framework made of appropriate checks and balances, full information transparency, and a replication of roles to avoid the emergence of powerful gatekeepers.  Improve connectivity. Maker\u2019s products could become the leading ramps into DeFi for institutional capital. In order to do this, we should structure ourselves with the required professionalism to engage with the highest-quality borrowers.  Move to scale. By working closely with institutional, often regulated, deep pools of collateral, Maker will have the ability to scale faster without the need to develop everything in house \u2013 this is the so-called \u201carranger model.\u201d  Protect protocol resilience. Assets should be onboarded without exposing the protocol to bad credit losses or destructive events; such robustness should be guaranteed via the implementation of proven yet innovative credit risk management frameworks, as well as via vetted technological and legal structures.  Continue educating. Community-wide initiatives should be continuously promoted, in order to foster a culture of financial sophistication and open collaboration within the DAO \u2013 less forum arguing, more educated discussions   More Than a Core Unit Will Be Involved   Real-World Finance CU (RWF) under the current facilitator @williamr  Develop and maintain clear criteria and methodologies to assess collateral applications Engage in due diligence with counterparties and provide a credit opinion to assist MKR tokenholders decision-making Act as the first line of defence for risk management within the DAO Monitor asset pools performance post onboarding    RWA Legal & Transaction Services (LTS) with @christiancdpetersen as proposed facilitator  Develop, maintain and refine resilient protocol/real world off-ramps Transaction lifecycle diligence & management Legal research and consultation Support governance process Educate and communicate with other CUs and external counterparties    Collateral Engineering Services CU (CES) under the current facilitator @monkey.irish  Provide pre-MIP technical advisory services for project candidates Conduct technical assessments and opinions during the collateral onboarding process Responsible for the architecture, design, and implementation of technical solutions Assist with Collateral Management and Operations to ensure healthy collateral    Lending Oversight CU (LOVE) with @luca_pro as proposed facilitator  Develop a high-level framework to approach complex collateral types Set all internal control frameworks and codes of conduct Act as an extra line of defence within the DAO Educate and communicate with other CUs and external counterparties    In addition, @williamr will help setting-up a lending incubator dedicated to scale, accelerate, and further decentralise all activities related to structured financing. The incubator, as well as LTS and LOVE, are currently part of SES\u2019 incubation program. All existing and prospective facilitators have been heavily involved in setting and scaling the activities related to onboarding and managing so-called off-chain collateral, and are well known by the community.  What\u2019s Next? The revamped Real-World / Structured Finance area of expertise is working based on a plan that encompasses four different phases: (1) Seed, (2) Bootstrap, (3) Establish, (4) Further Decentralise. A lot has been achieved over the last 7 weeks, but much more has yet to come.  1346\u00d7686 202 KB  LOVE & RWF have recently introduced weekly office hours - we expect anyone interested to know with a bit more depth what the teams have been working on to connect and share their views.

                    "content": "@luca_pro Pleased to see the LOVE CU becoming a more \u201cofficial\u201d initiative at MakerDAO. From our first collaboration on the exercise of the sandbox, which outlined a set of  principles for real-world financing at MakerDAO, to this date I can attest how much LOVE has already contributed to the Community. It is already supporting the professionalisation of the activity of real-world financing by providing an independent second set of eyes and a 2nd layer of defence to the due diligence done by RWF. To a large extent, many of the activities outlined in this post are already a reality, even before the CU being officially setup. I can only assume this is a sign of commitment. Oversight is a key building block on the path to decentralising and scaling the activity of operational CUs dealing with RWAs: commercial/risk and legal. It allows re-alignment around consistent processes and risk controls which are critical for sustainability, whilst creating another check & balance in the system of operational CUs. When used positively, professionally and in a non-adversarial way, while keeping its independence, Oversight can be a very powerful tool for operational CUs. Those CUs that approach their relationship with Oversight with an open mind and as an opportunity to continuously improve and enhance their internal processes, I am certain will gain valuable insights in their interaction with LOVE. Looking forward to continuing the collaboration in the spirit of improvement. From one civil servant of the DAO to another, Will ",
