It is clear that when the PoW chain is about to die, some people will remove the difficulty bomb and continue mining.   The question is only how many people will do it. It is a  pretty unique situation, and it is hard to even call it a fork, since the original thing will be killed.  It is something that never happened in the history of blockchain before. Since the PoW chain is pretty much guaranteed to survive in some shape or form (it takes one miner to keep it alive), it makes sense to discuss how it will operate. Here are some questions to discuss about the future of the PoW chain:   How should it be governed? Should it be some kind of a DAO?   Should it switch to ProgPoW or use the current PoW algorithm?   Should it keep all the current accounts or zeroize some of them (like the ETH1 premine)?   How should it pay for development?   What should the monetary policy be?   ",

You could try stealing the Ravencoin model of having different groups electing a representative using different methods. i.e: use block extradata to elects a miner rep, use transaction extradata to elect a user representative. Devs are represented by being the ones who choose what gets implemented.   Switch to progpow, a PoW chain should aim for decentralization to play towards our strengths.   Zeroize the staking smart contract and Ether premine   Impose a x% transaction fee and x% block fee. Allow the miners and user representatives to distribute the collected fees. There should be an even split in budgetary power between the two groups. Allow the representatives to allocate funding to the different EIPs. In the short-term, create a development fund equal to the amount of Ethereum zeroed from the premine and staking contracts and allow n% to be allocated per month on development.   The monetary policy should aim for a constant annual inflation rate of 2% (I\u2019m open to ideas about how much the inflation rate should be. We want something that is comparable to other major currencies since we want to be a currency.)   How do we achieve 2% annual inflation? We make the network faster. Perform research on how quickly a large block can be propagated. Have the target time per block decrease at a rate of 2% Since state growth is going to increase we need to reward node operators since they will need to upgrade their hardware just like miners. I lean towards having a %share of transaction fees get distributed to node operators since that should grow at the same rate as state complexity. I\u2019d also like to see block rewards get set to 5 in order to attract new miners since there will be an immediate dip in profitability since we\u2019ll be the other coin. I\u2019m not sure how we should do all this, but that\u2019s for smarter people than me. ",

As for security, I don\u2019t really see how PoW is more efficient at providing security, especially in light of the constant threat of a new ASIC design appearing and causing rapid centralization.  We already have ProgPoW waiting in the wings. If we are going to be gutting the difficulty bomb, then we might as well switch algorithms. The reason why ProgPoW reduces the threat of ASICs is that any ProgPoW ASIC will at most be 1.2x times more effective than a GPU. This raises the risk over GPUs since they are now at risk of being invalidated by any future algorithm swap and hold no additional resale value. It becomes a much riskier proposition at that point.  so it had better provide at least 10X the security compared to PoS, per dollar spent.  I\u2019d argue that it does accomplish this. It is much easier to buy 101% of the currently staked Eth than it is to purchase enough GPUs and ASICs to double the current hashrate. There are only so many computer chips being produced at a time, and existing hardware is unlikely to be sold so long as it is profitable to mine with them, which means that a malicious attacker would need to perform a logistics miracle. In contrast, a malicious party in Proof of Stake simply funnels Eth from exchanges to anonymous wallets over time and pays for cloud hosting of their nodes. By all metrics, the current Ethereum difficulty should be 12k terahash based on profitability, but it is still only a quarter of that because of how slow GPU production is. ",

Could a POW chain compete successfully against POS?  We have one POW chain that defi and others use successfully for their projects and then we are proposing a POS chain to replace it. There is going to be a big question as to if those who are using the existing POW chain successfully should switch, especially if the POW ramps ups its competitiveness by offering incentives that the POS chain does not. You could have price competition where the POS and POW chains both compete to the bottom. I see a lot of technical discussions but few discussions of the business case for stakeholders to adopt POS. Why switch to something that is unknown when your current provider works and is loyalty offering discounts to stay. As for developers, you have mining pools who have shown that they can come together who have teams of programmers and multi-million dollar budgets. These pools are going to become increasingly centralized as hashrate focuses on a few pools much like Bitcoin. I assume some of the core devs may also wish to stay and work to improve the POW chain. 2.0 POS may technically be better, but the business case for POW may be stronger. At the very least POW poses a credible threat to POS plans. This reminds  me of that movie \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car\u201d. Just because a product is good doesn\u2019t mean that it will survive. ",

Removing difficulty bomb is a trivial task. But adopting statelessness, regenesis and other techniques including client optimisations addressing the growing size of the chain data would not be that trivial and would require corresponding qualifications. Moreover, some of the optimisations after the merge will probably use properties of PoS consensus (speculating here) and won\u2019t be suitable for the PoW; like the weak subjectivity nature of PoS. All of this makes me think that even though there will be an alternative chain it would require a decent amount of value put into it to make the above happen and let this chain survive in the long term.
