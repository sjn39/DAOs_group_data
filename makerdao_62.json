                    "content": "Burn baby, burn is usually music to my ears when MKR is sent to the Flapper. But in the workplace it is defined as a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. Wikipedia describes its as \u201cfeelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one\u2019s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one\u2019s job; and reduced professional efficacy.\u201d I have heard people described burnout similar to hitting a wall (not sure if y\u2019all have ever rode a bike/played backyard American football\u2014and crashed into a wall\u2013not fun  ). But instead of falling to the ground in need of relief, or taking a rest\u2014you scale the wall and keep going. And it doesn\u2019t happen because we are falling behind on our work requirements (to-do-list), or because we are lacking abilities, or because our personal life\u2019s are interfering with work, aka the quest for a fully decentralized financial ecosystem. From what I read, burnout can occur when everything in our lives feels unstable and we convince ourselves that working all the time is what will fix it. It\u2019s what happens when you feel catastrophe could be around any corner and that there are no social safety nets to catch you. You pretty much short-circuit.  However, because we are so passionate about MakerDAO/DAI, Ethereum, DeFi, etc., we keep going. And through it all we fail to recognize it. I wrote this on a morning when I woke-up thinking about the rumored burnout suffered by the Devs at Covered/Ruler protocol and this article \" The Secret to Happiness at Work \" This forum post wants us to take care of one another and ask that you continue our \u201cesprit de corps\u201d \u2014 lets keep that common spirit that we share existing in our community/Core Units\u2014let\u2019s inspire enthusiasm, devotion, loyalty, camaraderie, engagement, and strong regard for the welfare of the CU teams and the community. What are some of the strategies we can implement to reduce burnout? How can we decrease and mitigate stress? How can we emphasize that quality is a journey and not a destination? Can we keep our CUs and community members engaged, fulfilled, and as resilient individuals who are connected and supported by a network of similarly engaged colleagues with a shared purpose? In my opinion, these are all questions and hurdles that we must tackle in-order to help establish our \u201cesprit de corps\u201d mission for MakerDAO. So, I ask that you love yourself and others\u2014take care by paying attention to your diet and get out there and disconnect via some type of physical activity. Meditation? I can\u2019t grasp it \u2014 but if you can, I heard it helps  \u2013 Let me know how you think we can keep ourselves from the dreaded \u201cburnout\u201d syndrome. \"Never let the failure myth stop you from building something great that changes the future\" -Unknown Special shutout to @aburban90 who is trying to spread love the Core Unit way.

                    "content": "Definitely an important topic. I think one often-overlooked way to tackle burnout is proper decentralization/redundancy. In my personal experience, burnout is aggravated by feeling that everything is on your shoulders, or that you are stuck trying to preform tasks that you aren\u2019t mentally up for. Having other people that can preform your duties allows for proper mental health breaks and a shared burden. I think we really have a chance to culturally prevent burnout simply by building a proper decentralized network that allows contributions to take the time off they need and know that they are not solely responsible for tasks. By sharing knowledge and responsibility we can create a functional machine with plenty of back up parts to swap in where needed. Also a huge advocate for meditation. Taking time to experience the joy of existence is both relaxing and empowering. There is joy in breath, and greater fulfillment in using that breath for something that matters, with people that care about you  I think maintaining the welcoming and engaging atmosphere of Maker is paramount to this as well.
