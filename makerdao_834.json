Addressing Maker\u2019s criticisms of having weak toekneonmics, stkMKR attempts to fix the project\u2019s challenges by introducing incentives to governance participation, while also increasing governance security and resiliency to credit losses. The proposal borrows economic mechanisms from other successful ecosystems, utilizing inspiration from Cosmos governance and stkAAVE & xSUSHI tokenomics. The three primary components focused on in this approach are:  stkMKR Token Surplus Action Changes Governance System Changes  Time will be reserved for a community Q&A at the end of the presentation.

Thank you for joining episode #8 of Focus On. I am Retro, a contributor with the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU. I am joined by Juan, co-hosting today\u2019s session where @monet-supply joins us. We will discuss Staking & Tokenomics Revision as proposed by Monet. The initiative is being branded as stkMaker. We will discuss the stkMKR token, changes to the surplus auction, and changes in the governance system. There will be a Q&A at the end. Please feel free to submit any questions to the chat. For other episodes of FO, please check the forum.   Discussion  Monet-Supply 00:47  Figure 1: Deposit and delegation1612\u00d7847 110 KB   Figure 2: Surplus utilization1192\u00d71054 119 KB   Figure 3: Redemption process1615\u00d7838 114 KB   Questions 11:42 - Juan: What is the benefit of making the tokens non-transferable? 13:36 - Payton Rose: How do we weigh the costs(namely dev labor) with the benefits to this design? What are some metrics or things we can expect to see that would indicate that this model is working towards better governance? 17:48 - Frank Cruz: Have you analyzed the yield percentage stkMKR token owners can generate? If so, how competitive will it be versus other staking protocols? Do you believe having an attractive yield will be key in expanding MKR ownership? 20:02 - Juan: Can you comment on making MKR inflationary? 22:58 - Juan: Could the ESM new system mean that we are less reactive or have less agility or speed when reacting to any emergency? 25:36 - Juan: Do you have any comments on the other version of new tokenomics for MKR proposed in the forum by Porter Smith from a16z? 27:23 - Juan: Do you have any timeline of the next steps for your proposal, or are you posting it to see feedback and improve on that? What is the plan? 28:36 - Juan: What is the best way of reaching out and engaging with you?  Closing Comment  Juan  Outro 29:24  Please, go to the forums, check the proposal, and post it there if you have any feedback. Monet, as always, it was very nice having you. We will see you around.
