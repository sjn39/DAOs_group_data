                    "content": " MIP39c2-SP17: adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 17 Author(s): @sorenpeter Contributors: @juanjuan Tags: dai-foundation, core-unit, daif-001, mandate Status: Formal Submission (FS) Date Applied: 2021-07-07 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Sentence Summary MIP39c2-SP17 adds Core Unit DAIF-001: Dai Foundation.  Paragraph Summary This proposal is for the DAIF Core Unit to be the vehicle that enables the practical implementation of the critical services that Dai Foundation provides to MakerDAO. The Core unit will request the necessary budget from MakerDAO Governance to sustain its operations and adequately mitigate the related legal risks to its essential role. The services of Dai Foundation are to provide safe haven and protect Maker IP including the DAI and MAKER trademarks (for example, what if somebody launches a DAI token on another chain?), set terms for use of Maker Assets that enables Maker Governance to appoint managers of those assets and to react to edge cases like for example a malicious fork according to principles that will be developed in close collaboration with the Maker community.  Specification  Motivation Planning for the best case scenario for MakerDAO requires establishing measures to protect Maker\u2019s intangible assets and prepare to mitigate problems in worst case scenarios.  What if somebody launches a coin on some other blockchain and calls it Dai? What if somebody uses the software developed for the Maker Protocol for purposes that go against the principles of MakerDAO? What if there is a governance attack and the attackers get control over the Maker and Dai trademarks?  The independent legal entity Dai Foundation has been created to safeguard what cannot be decentralized in Maker DAO, such as ownership of trademarks, domains, software copyrights, etc., which is connected to a real-world centralized governance body. Dai Foundation cannot seek profits and is only mandated to serve its specific purpose: to safeguard the Maker Assets. The Dai Foundation will make these assets available for use by the community to support the sustainability and growth of the Maker Protocol with as few barriers as possible. The Dai Foundation Core Unit is proposed to be the vehicle that enables the practical implementation of these critical goals.  Core Unit ID DAIF-001  Core Unit Name DAI Foundation Core Unit  Core Unit Mandate The Dai Foundation Core Unit is responsible for:  Facilitating the dialogue between the Dai Foundation and the Community regarding intellectual property safeguarding, intellectual property usage, and related activities - this includes discussing with the community edge cases around various attacks on the protocol and its foundational principles, and formulation of principles for how to approach various forks and other situations where Dai Foundation need to act. Such principles and approaches will be put forward for Maker Governance approval. Request the necessary budget from Maker DAO Governance to sustain its operations and adequately mitigate the related legal risks to its essential role Implementation of processes for safeguarding of new intellectual property that is added to the Protocol at Dai Foundation. Implementation of processes for making the intellectual property that Dai Foundation owns available for use by the broader Maker community for the good of the protocol with as few barriers as possible. Providing transparency around how the Dai Foundation operates and which assets the Dai Foundation owns. In collaboration with Maker Governance, create transparency around how the usage rights of the Maker Assets are allocated.  The Dai Foundation Core Unit will carry these responsibilities following the principles defined in its Trust Deed.  Community Involvement  The Dai Foundation Core Unit will create transparency into the activities of the Dai Foundation and engage in dialogue with the Community about how to safeguard Maker\u2019s intellectual property while also making it available for use with as few barriers as possible. The Dai Foundation Core Unit proposes a process by which Maker Governance decides who utilizes any of the assets that the Dai Foundation holds, as long as the users assume responsibility for the use of those assets, and the Dai Foundation remains the legal owner of said assets. As part of the ratification of the Dai Foundation Core Unit, the Dai Foundation offers Maker Governance the appointment of two members to join the Dai Foundation board. This will enable insight into all activities and make sure the views of Maker Governance are appropriately taken into account.   Planned near-term activities  Creating a process together with Maker Governance for making intellectual property held by the Dai Foundation available for use by the Community - See the proposal for discussion here. Finding owners for the assets from the Maker Foundation that the Dai Foundation has accepted for temporary care-taking. Creating a process with Maker Governance for giving copyright/intellectual property ownership to the Dai Foundation for assets added to the protocol (e.g. the copyright for the code contained in a new smart contract). Creating a process with Maker Governance for appointing community board members. Defining a backlog for missing processes (e.g. how a Contributor or a Core Unit can transfer an asset to the Dai Foundation)   Connection with the Dai Foundation The Core Unit\u2019s Facilitator will be an official member of the Dai Foundation. Additional members from the Dai Foundation may participate in activities required to fulfill the Core Unit\u2019s mandate and third parties that the Dai Foundation may subcontract.

                    "content": "I want to raise a couple of issues around this proposal:  The first has to do with the way this proposal\u2019s been brought to governance  When the Core Unit model was introduced in CommDev, we were told the Maker Foundation would remain neutral so as to give the community an even playing field to make their own proposals about how the DAO should be run and avoid the appearance of favoritism toward groups associated with the Foundation. If this proposal was to be made in a neutral manner, the Maker Foundation should have disclosed what resources the Dai Foundation is proposing to take legal ownership of so the community could assess the Dai Foundation\u2019s plans and propose alternative solutions. Instead, the Dai Foundation has made its plans and treated the governance process as an afterthought. I understand there needs to be a legal entity in order to hold IP and initiate enforcement actions against those who violate the terms of use of IP; my concern is that the community hasn\u2019t been given an opportunity to consider alternatives to this proposal.  The second issue has to do with this proposal\u2019s implications for Core Units  Please correct me if I\u2019m misunderstanding the proposal but passing this proposal would put Core Units in a position where the Dai Foundation could, without the consent of the DAO, decide a CU was in violation of the trademark agreement OR that the work of a CU should belong with MakerDAO\u2019s IP and threaten to initiate enforcement actions against them for non-compliance. Again, I understand there needs to be a legally-recognized entity in place to protect IP but there\u2019s a significant difference between that entity being accountable to itself and accountable to the DAO. If the DAO can find a way to hold real-world assets and initiate enforcement actions to liquidate loans that have gone bad, surely it can find a legal structure that allows the DAO to protect its IP and manage its social and web properties in a way that provides accountability to the DAO rather than a private team of individuals. I\u2019m not sure what the appropriate course of action is with regard to governance but I think the community should be given a opportunity to discuss what the possibilities are and how it wants its IP to be managed on neutral grounds. With regard to the second concern, I\u2019d like to see language explicitly stating that the Dai Foundation will act in an advisory rather than authoritative role and will not initiate demand IP from Core Units or initiate enforcement actions without the consent of the DAO. P.S. The link to the proposal about \u201cCreating a process together with Maker Governance for making intellectual property held by the Dai Foundation available for use by the Community\u201d isn\u2019t working for me.

The link to the proposal about \u201cCreating a process together with Maker Governance for making intellectual property held by the Dai Foundation available for use by the Community\u201d isn\u2019t working for me.       DAO Asset Allocation Process - Draft Proposal Ideas       Please keep in mind that this is an early and incomplete draft that is likely to be changed significantly based on the feedback received. It's published today simply to give an idea of the direction we're thinking in and act as a starting point for discussion. The Dai Foundation intends to leave as many decisions as possible to the Maker community to decide, i.e., as long as this is compatible with the Foundation's mandate.    DAO Asset Allocation Process - Draft Managing centralized assets in a\u2026         seth:  The first has to do with the way this proposal\u2019s been brought to governance   I\u2019m not sure when or at what point you would think it would be better. The Dai Foundation has been bootstrapped by the Maker Foundation and it\u2019s now being transitioned to the DAO. MKR holders could choose to defund it or to propose another Core Unit to do something similar.     seth:  If this proposal was to be made in a neutral manner, the Maker Foundation should have disclosed what resources the Dai Foundation is proposing to take legal ownership of so the community could assess the Dai Foundation\u2019s plans and propose alternative solutions. Instead, the Dai Foundation has made its plans and treated the governance process as an afterthought.   This is similar to the PE or Oracles Core Units, no? Bootstrapped by the Maker Foundation, handed to the DAO. PE and Oracles also made their plans (and I\u2019m glad they did) and proposed a Core Unit to the DAO to get funding.     seth:  my concern is that the community hasn\u2019t been given an opportunity to consider alternatives to this proposal.   Same as above. Plus, the Dai Foundation was announced a considerable time ago, and I haven\u2019t seen anyone going crazy to propose alternatives (or raise any concerns).     seth:  Please correct me if I\u2019m misunderstanding the proposal but passing this proposal would put Core Units in a position where the Dai Foundation could, without the consent of the DAO, decide a CU was in violation of the trademark agreement OR that the work of a CU should belong with MakerDAO\u2019s IP and threaten to initiate enforcement actions against them for non-compliance.   Probably @sorenpeter can give a better answer, but why would Dai Foundation go rogue and risk losing their funding? To lose money over a trial? And get a bad reputation? I don\u2019t see the incentives\u2019 alignment in your scenario. On the other hand, why a Core Unit (representing Maker and the DAO) would violate the IP? Also, I personally (I\u2019m not sure if this has been discussed) that the world any Core Unit does for the DAO should belong to the DAO. If there\u2019s a Foundation to protect that, even better, no?     seth:  provides accountability to the DAO   Who is the DAO? What happens when there are several opinions about what the Dai Foundation should do? Or even about what the DAO should do? How do you propose solving for that? PS, pending approval, the Dai Foundation has offered two seats on the board. Probably choosing two representatives will be hard already.  I think you should see the Dai Foundation as an entity that will protect your IP from the \u201couter world\u201d, instead of shaping the DAO through legal lawsuits (which sounds like the worst possible way of shaping a DAO\u2019s vision).

No, that\u2019s the point that @seth is making. That is, I think, the core thing of point 1. Point 2. is related to the post I made a month ago. The DAI Foundation is not at the service of the DAO but here to control the DAO. From the Trust Deed:  The Foundation must also ensure that the MakerDAO system [\u2026] act in accordance with the fundamental principles enshrined in the preamble of the Trust Deed.  Maybe there were reasons to structure it that way, would be happy to know as we are working on a Cayman Foundation that will take orders from the DAO (and could probably defend MakerDAO IP). Nevertheless, while this structure introduces a risk for MakerDAO, we don\u2019t have a choice anyway and the risk is not huge.     juan:  Who is the DAO?

I echo some of the points @juan made above\u2013but remember if the Community is not happy with the performance of the DAI Foundation, they can always push them out, Cut funding, or even worse\u2013Fork the protocol. Or, you can even make a case of disbanding the entire Maker Community. So, all in all there are ways thru a decentralized community that things can be contain with checks and balances, IMO.

SebVentures:  we don\u2019t have a choice anyway   MKR holders can choose not to fund the Dai Foundation (at the risk of being unprotected). This is akin to a critical Core Unit transitioning from the Foundation to the DAO. SES is working on scaling the DAO and bringing more Core Units to protect the moats of Maker. This topic definitely falls into that mandate. ",

Let me just make it clear that Dai Foundation never had and do not expect to have any authority over what shall happen with new IP a CU produces. This is a concern between Maker Governance and the CU. As a community member it would make sense for me that IP created by funds from the Maker Protocol in general are made available as a public good to be used for the growth of the protocol. Dai Foundation can help in that regard for example as we see with the PECU assigning the copyright of their open source code to Dai Foundation, but Dai Foundation has no means of forcing this. This is for Governance to demand/CU\u2019s to offer.     seth:  rather than a private team of individuals.   It is all in the eye of the beholder, but I don\u2019t think calling Dai Foundation \u201ca private team of individuals\u201d is a very precise definition. The Dai Foundation itself is a non-profit foundation created under Danish law. It is under the purview of the Danish authorities to assure it only acts according to the mandate in its Trust Deed (as linked to in the proposal above). The board is obligated to act in that framework and cannot just choose to deviate from it at its liking. @seth I also  want to thank you for bringing up these questions for discussion. I do hope reading the draft asset allocation process helps, and look forward to your comments once you have read that. ",

I totally understand a word like \u201censure\u201d in the premable rubs the wrong way. It never was the meaning of the founder that Dai Foundation should act as an outside controller of the Maker Protocol, but purely to be a holder of what Maker IP that cannot be decentralized.

When Core Units were announced. Perhaps I\u2019m mistaken but I was given the impression that neutrality is/was part of the goal in implementing the Core Unit model. The underlying question here is: is the Core Unit model about creating a way for individuals from the Foundation to transition to the community or about creating a neutral basis upon which anyone, whether from the Foundation or the community, can make a proposal? If it\u2019s the latter, then staying neutral means that the Foundation should have made efforts to let the community know what it\u2019s been doing and what resources are available for CUs to take responsibility for. Instead, the Foundation has largely remained silent apart from the announcements about the transition to CUs and the CU proposals we\u2019ve seen so far, which gives teams coming from the Foundation a considerable advantage over teams from the community when it comes to making proposals about how resources that have been managed by the Foundation thus far should be managed. The Content team would have at least considered proposing an alternative had we been given the necessary information to do so but any time we\u2019ve inquired about the properties, we\u2019ve simply been told to wait for the Foundation to figure out what it wants to do.     juan:  MKR holders can choose not to fund the Dai Foundation (at the risk of being unprotected).   This is the core of the issue: Saying MakerDAO\u2019s IP \u201ccan\u2019t be decentralized\u201d makes sense in the context of the technical and legal limitations on managing IP but in a larger context, decentralization is about power and a team that\u2019s committed to decentralization would work to ensure the DAO isn\u2019t put into a position where they have to choose between their IP being protected and it being in limbo. This conversation should be facilitated in a way that encourages transparency and the exploration of alternatives and that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening with this proposal.     juan:  why would Dai Foundation go rogue and risk losing their funding? To lose money over a trial? And get a bad reputation?   Your guess is as good as mine but given the option, I prefer to work with CUs that \u201ccan\u2019t be evil\u201d over those who promise they \u201cwon\u2019t be evil.\u201d     juan:  the DAO doesn\u2019t have any legal recourse.   This is the core of the other issue. If the DAO decides it wants a different team to manage the IP, is the Dai Foundation going to work with that team to give them what they need? If we sign off on this now, the Dai Foundation has the legal right to do whatever it wants. I\u2019d also like to see a better answer to @LongForWisdom\u2019s concern about what happens in the event of a governance attack than \u201cwe\u2019ll choose the best fork.\u201d From a legal standpoint, we should assume that the Dai Foundation is permitted to do anything it is not expressly forbidden to do.     sorenpeter:  that mandate is very specific and limited   The mandate makes reference to generalized \u201cprinciples\u201d the Foundation promises to support and gives the Dai Foundation broad powers regarding the management of the IP. In what way is the mandate \u201cspecific and limited?\u201d On page 5, it states: \u201cThe board of trustees is responsible for administering the intellectual property rights and trademarks assigned to the Foundation, see article 4, paragraph (b) of the Trust Deed, for the purpose of the long-term, positive development of the MakerDAO system at the board of trustee\u2019s discretion.\" If there\u2019s language I\u2019m missing that makes the Dai Foundation accountable to MakerDAO governance, please point it out.
