                    "content": "Apologies in advance for the long post!  TL;DR  I propose we have fixed deadlines for when we stop considering EIPs for specific upgrades. I think we should try and agree on the \u201clarge items\u201d for each of the coming network upgrades, even if subject to change, so that we can have better visibility over the general roadmap. I share some thoughts about the \u201cbest practices\u201d we\u2019ve seen groups pushing larger initiatives for Ethereum take.   On ACD117, we had a discussion about how to improve network upgrade planning and longer-term roadmapping for Ethereum. A few core issues were highlighted:  A lot of things need to be done on Ethereum in the next 18-36 months; Our current process tends to bias towards smaller changes, but a lot of the most important work we need to do is larger (e.g. The Merge, State Expiry, etc.); For client teams, working on network upgrades means putting maintenance of the client aside for a while; For EIP champions, not knowing when upgrades will happen causes a lot of uncertainty and pressure to get an EIP included in the next upgrade.  There were also a few things that most people seemed in agreement about:  Client teams can likely handle 2 upgrades per year, but not more; There is value in having things scheduled farther out in the future and when things try to get added in the current upgrade, it causes a lot of stress and delays; In many cases, testing is the biggest bottleneck, rather than client implementations.  Finally, there was some conversation about how upgrade coordination would work post-Merge. For simplicity, this is out of scope for this document.  Process Proposal If we target ~2 upgrades per year, it means each will happen at a roughly 6 month interval. It is also worth noting that towards the end of an upgrade (e.g. after the testnet releases are set), there is typically some bandwidth to start considering things for the next upgrade. Let\u2019s use T for the time at which an upgrade gets activated on mainnet.  T-6 months: \u201cConsidered For Inclusion\u201d Closed Roughly six months before an upgrade is scheduled to go onto mainnet, nothing can be \u201cConsidered for Inclusion\u201d for it anymore. Any \u201cnew idea\u201d since then automatically gets CFI\u2019d for at least the next upgrade.  T-5 months: Client Integration Testnets start Roughly five months before the upgrade goes live on mainnet, devnets should be started with all CFI\u2019d EIPs for this upgrade. At this point, EIP champions should be actively contributing to test coverage for their EIP. Insufficient testing can be used as a blocker for an EIP to go from Client Integration Testnets to being formally included in the network upgrade.  T-3 months: Testnet Activation Blocks Chosen + Client Released Roughly three months before the upgrade goes live on mainnet, a final list of EIPs for the upgrade has been agreed upon and implemented in all clients, along with a testnet activation block, with the goal of choosing a mainnet block after successful testnet upgrades.  T-2 months: Testnet Activation The upgrade goes live across the major public testnets.  T-1 months: Mainnet Activation Block Chosen + Client Released Roughly one month before the upgrade goes live on mainnet, a block is chosen and clients are released with activation scheduled for this block.  Tentative Upgrade Schedule One comment raised on ACD117 was that we should \u201copen\u201d upgrades earlier in order to provide better visibility to EIP champions. Here is an initial proposal:  November/December 2021: Shanghai  Needed because of difficulty bomb pushback in EIP-3554 \u201cCFI open\u201d: ??? T-6 \u201cCFI closed\u201d mark: June 1  Special case because this process is new. Worth talking with client teams about EIPs already proposed to gauge interest and impact on Merge work.     2021Q4/2022Q1: The Merge  List of changes available here. Unlikely to include anything else given the large scope.   2022Q2/Q3: Cancun  \u201cCFI open\u201d: now - T-6. T-6 \u201cCFI closed\u201d mark: shortly after mainnet-compatible Merge releases by clients are out. Large initiatives to consider: Beacon Chain ETH Withdrawals, State Expirty \u201cStepping Stones\u201d (Verkle Tries, Address Space Extension) EIPs to consider: EIPs excluded from Shanghai  Note: first post-Merge upgrade, will need to be coordinated with the Consensus layer because of withdrawals.  2022Q4/Q1: Prague  CFI open: shortly after mainnet-compatible Merge releases by clients are out. T-6 \u201cCFI closed\u201d mark: when Cancun mainnet-compatible client releases are out. Large initatives to consider: State Expiry   Getting \u201cLarge Initatives\u201d to Mainnet Changes which affect multiple components of the Ethereum network tend to require a larger, more structured effort to make progress, gain community acceptance, and eventually get deployed to mainnet. These can be thought of as working groups. Typically, these working groups end up doing/producing the following, usually over 6-18 months:  A specification of the change (EIP, or a set of EIPs); Prototypes of the change across >1 client implementation; Hosting calls between implementers and/or the community to discuss the change and progress made; Reaching out to relevant parts of the community to gather feedback, address objections, document support for the proposal; \u201cAudit\u201d the change, either with a formal audit or at least a thorough analysis of the impacts of the change on clients, users, infrastructure, etc.;  There currently is no official \u201cplaybook\u201d for how to sucessfully project-manage these initiatives, but two that can be used as reference are the recent Fee Market Changes and the work around The Merge. There is likely little value in overly formalizing how working groups should operate, but having examples (and potentially retrospectives on their success/failure) can be useful for future contributors.

IMO what we did for London, to wait and make sure the testnet deployment went smoothly, was the right approach. The reason for this is that the things which have the highest likelihood of breaking are the \u201clarge initiatives\u201d, and they are also the ones we would be most likely to delay the fork for. For example, if we had found an issue with EIP-1559 on the testnets, it probably would have been worth delaying London by 1 month to fix it. OTOH, if we find an issue in a \u201csmall EIP\u201d, then maybe it\u2019s not worth delaying the fork. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in some cases, removing an EIP can be more work than fixing a bug, because we need to test for non-inclusion, to not end up with consensus issues like we saw on OE in Berlin.

I think this is where we disagree.  If we had very regular hardforks, I would rather delay EIP-1559 for 6 months to the next hardfork and keep on the reliable schedule than slip the schedule by a month to get EIP-1559 included 5 months earlier.  For a smaller venture (e.g., brand new blockchain, startup company, etc.) I would argue the opposite, but for something the size and scope of Ethereum with the number of involved stakeholders I think that reliable schedule is more important than timeliness of specific features.

But if it is, it seems to me that it\u2019s not clearly communicated) Maybe this schedule could be a first step towards better differentiating each testnet. For example, one of them could have the fork scheduled for (T - 1 week). This would be the most stable of the testnets. This would also mean that there\u2019d be two weeks per year where a reliable testnet doesn\u2019t exist, but that seems like a decent compromise. (This is just a first idea.

If so, I think this is a hard dillema. There are three things we are usually working for when forking testnets:  \u201cTesting all code paths\u201d, i.e. making sure the changes are entirely tested. For this, we typically use Ropsten because it is PoW, like mainnet. Cross-client consensus issues, i.e. making sure all clients agree to each other. Here, again, Ropsten or Goerli can work (but not Rinkeby/Kovan, given that only Geth/OE are validators). Replicating mainnet activity. This is probably the most important part, but also the one we want to do last because we may be able to catch issues with (1) + (2) before. Historically, we\u2019ve used Goerli for this.  So, on one hand, the more time we have on testnets, especially those with lots of applications deployed, the higher the chance we catch bugs (i.e. like the Ropsten one from yesterday, which came a few weeks after the fork). OTOH, this means the testnets aren\u2019t \u201cstaging environments\u201d for application developers. Another thing that\u2019s worth noting is that we need ~1 month to properly choose a mainnet block, get it implemented in client, and sharing those client versions with the community, and there is a desire from core devs to pick a mainnet block after seeing testnets fork successfully.

Since Rinkeby/Kovan aren\u2019t that good as a testing ground for the protocol-level stuff, they would be better used as an app-level staging ground. I understand though that there\u2019s an inherent conflict here: the core devs would get better data if more contracts are deployed and used, but app devs will prefer more stability. I still think is worth it to fork them at different blocks based on that \u201cintended usage\u201d. As a data point for this: when the testnets were forked, some features of Hardhat stopped working until we released the version with support for London. In the meantime, users moved to other testnets instead (I don\u2019t remember right now which one was the last one to be forked). If all of them would\u2019ve been forked at the same time, or at a very close point in time but two months before mainnet, where it\u2019s probable that tooling isn\u2019t ready yet, there would\u2019ve not been a workaround.

Since Rinkeby/Kovan aren\u2019t that good as a testing ground for the protocol-level stuff, they would be better used as an app-level staging ground.   Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair. For Berlin + London, Kovan has actually forked after mainnet. It is being deprecated, but it may be worth considering doing so for Rinkeby.

There are a few different things to decide on this front:  City Name vs. Two-Words for Ice Age The first point was whether we should stick to our city name terminology or use a two-word name for the December upgrade, which will have to update the Ice Age (assuming The Merge is not ready), and may contain additional EIPs. @axic shared some thoughts on Github about this:  On the topic of naming: there was a time we used two-word names, and then somehow we ended up on the city-name track (starting with Byzantium). In this city-name era, the only two-word update is Muir Glacier, which is both a non-feature update and somewhat a \u201cunplanned update\u201d.   I am slightly leaning towards keeping the city names for every feature update (including the merge), as long as there is a single feature apart from the difficulty bomb. And keeping everything else with a different name.   In case there will be only a difficulty bomb change, I suggest we look for another retreating glacier perhaps in so far unrepresented regions, such as Africa or Oceania: Arrow Glacier or Tasman Glacier sounds like an interesting one.  The counter argument is that following the devcon names provides more predictability for people looking at the \u201cEthereum roadmap\u201d (e.g. we know Shanghai is in December, and it is followed by Cancun, etc.). If you have a preference, please share it here.

I\u2019d like to continue the theme of physical locations, but do so with a different kind of physical locations. I\u2019m thinking star names. Then, we can move onto galaxies for Eth3.  IMHO it was a wise and poetic proposal.  I suppose that after the merge, we may have protocol upgrades that:  Only change the execution layer. Only change the consensus layer. Change both execution and consensus layer software.  We can start to think about how to merge the two organisms for these cases in community communication.  The Merge  IMHO since this release is likely to only include the merge-related features, \u201cThe Merge\u201d seems okay to be a special case as it has been recognized broadly.

I suspect it will be more likely that both sides (consensus + execution) get updated at the same time (for simplicity, amount of changes we can do in a year, etc.) so the star names can just represent these updates. If people are happy with this, then we can probably have either Shanghai/Arrow Glacier, then The Merge, and then \u201cB-Star\u201d, which would be the first post-merge upgrade (e.g. with cleanups/enabling withdrawals/activating some EIPs if Shanghai doesn\u2019t happen, etc.).

Execution changes feel \u2018concrete\u2019 as cities do. People have connections to cities, and the message of \u201ccities around the world\u201d as a theme is a vehicle for propagation of (early Ethereum) values.  ",
