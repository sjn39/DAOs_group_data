As you point out, this proposal is just the Tyranny of the Majority \u201cthis would require massive coordination among people running clients to succeed, essentially like any other kind of 51% attack.\u201d I can misunderstand too. But I see forking as the solution to immutable history if you disagree with the history. Furthermore, I think this fundamentally misunderstands the point of cryptocurrency. A major appeal, for me, is the push vs pull type of transaction. This breaks that. Because now the network has a pull transaction that can take money from anyone - just like banking. Then I don\u2019t technically own my coins. The people who can vote to take them do. I don\u2019t think I support this on any grounds but I can be educated if I am completely missing the point. ",

It is just a recommendation on how people can formalize their requests for a hard fork when it pertains to recovery of lost (not stolen) funds.     tenthirtyone:  now the network has a pull transaction that can take money from anyone - just like banking   Note: The ERP process is pretty clear on never being used to take money away from one owner and assigning it to another.  It is designed/worded such that it can only take money that is inaccessible by anyone and assign it to the person that should have access to it.  This happens in situations where people typo an address, or end up with funds stuck in a smart contract due to a bug.  The ERP process is expressly not for something like TheDAO recovery where funds were taken from one party and given to another.     postables:  pretty clear  what eveetone thinks   Just because a handful of people brigaded a GitHub issue doesn\u2019t mean that everyone believes a thing.  There are something like 36,000 Ethereum nodes in operation, and likely some number of orders of magnitude more Ethereum users.  I guarantee you that we haven\u2019t heard from the vast majority of economic participants on the issue.  This is one of the many problems with any kind of voting or \u201cmajority rule\u201d system of governance.  Those who make the most noise are not necessarily the same set of people who should be listened to (sometimes the sets overlap, sometimes they don\u2019t).     bwheeler96:  The blockchain is not designed to have a history that can be rewritten   Note: While possibly just a technicality, this process does not propose rewriting history.  It proposes changing the rules of how history is written in the future.  All hard forks are just \u201cchanging the rules by which future history is written\u201d, this one is proposing formalizing a process by which certain classes of rule changes can be discussed and easily implemented rather than handling this whole class as a series of unrelated changes.     jamesray1:  would set a precedent that may encourage people to be less cautious about thoroughly auditing their code. It discourages due diligence on the part of investors, and investing in teams and using products that do not have open source code.   Unfortunately, no matter how much care and due diligence you put into writing software, it will (almost) always have bugs.  OpenSSL Heartbleed is a great recent example of something that has gone through probably the most stringent of security audits over two decades and still had a critical security flaw in it.  As long as humans are the ones writing software, there will be bugs.  We certainly want to encourage people to write good software and do their due diligence, but at the same time I think it is unreasonable to assert that anyone who authors software with a bug deserves to be severely punished (on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars). Personally, I think even with a streamlined ERP process, the cost of recovery is still very high, along with forced capital lockup time while you wait for the next hard fork.  IMO, this is \u201cpunishment enough\u201d to encourage people to write good code, while still allowing for fixing of honest mistakes. Also, keep in mind that the ERP process cannot be used to recover funds that are in possession of anyone.  This means that TheDAO hack, fraud, theft, etc. cannot be rolled back with this process.  Thus, there is still significant incentive to write good code since the bug you ultimately run into may not be a \u201clost funds\u201d bug but instead a \u201cstolen funds\u201d bug which this process will not help you with.

Who is going to bear the cost of the extra hours invested by core developers into recovering lost funds? We should have layer 2 markets for decentralized insurance.

It proposes changing the rules of how history is written in the future.  A hard fork to recover funds is exactly rewriting history. It seems parity likes to use the term \u201cstate transition\u201d where during a hardfork the state of the blockchain is modified by the hardfork. That is what funds recovery almost necessarily implies. So\u2026 If a bug is caused by an EVM issue, and the funds are recoverable by the EVM issue, then sure lets hardfork to patch the issue, and then the affected parties can make recoveries. If a bug is not caused by an EVM issue, or simply patching the EVM will not enable users to access lost funds, there should not be a hard fork to recover the issue.  Unfortunately, no matter how much care and due diligence you put into writing software, it will (almost) always have bugs.  The EVM is a special case. Programs are generally so simple that writing bug free code is in fact expected. IF DEVELOPERS EXPECT TO RELEASE BUGS, THEY CAN CREATE THEIR OWN UPGRADE SCHEMA THEMSELVES. Arguing hardforks for fund recovery are OK because developers will inevitably release bugs is essentially saying that everyone who develops on Ethereum and everyone who uses all those applications needs to trust the core dev team to keep their funds safe, when they should be relying solely on open source smart contracts. Hard forks for the sake of funds recovery could be the death of Ethereum. ",

                    "content": "We\u2019ve represented most of the high-level ideas from the old thread here very well. Though I easily miss things. I welcome any correction and the extra value it would bring to the thread. First, thank you @MicahZoltu for addressing each point. It\u2019s going to be crucial that all voices are heard for us to solve this problem. Second, thanks to @jpitts  for giving us a place for civil discourse. I\u2019m hearing things in your feedback (@MicahZoltu ). I could use your help checking my understanding. You expressed a market need quite well that many of us tend to miss. There are users who wish to take part in this wonderful experiment. But they are discouraged by the high price of failure. We should show compassion to these customers. The responsibility of being your own bank is brutal. Each of us likely still remembers the fears of our own early transactions still to this day. As we grow up together in this technology the time for vanguards will pass. We will need a way to onboard these users or we give other projects an advantage. However, we cannot deny that there are also users who value immutability. Therefore non-recoverability of funds is of higher value to them than the actual recovery of their funds. We have to respect and show compassion to these customers as well. I propose we look to the features and innovations of this new technology to solve this problem. Let\u2019s move forward together with new ideas. Finally, we must bulwark against the slippery slope. Introducing a moral justification for lost fund recovery could lead to a moral justification for other appeals for on-chain authority. Something we must avoid. My short-sightedness did prevent me from seeing the value here. And I am ready to agree. There is something we can do. EIP-867\u2019s original proposal was:   Standards that will need to be met by any follow-on ERP in order to be considered for approval.   Recommendations for a common format for ERPs to use to specify a set of corrective actions that can be interpreted by clients.   Guidelines for client teams to implement code that can read, interpret, and apply the corrective actions at a specific block.  The set of possible corrective actions is intentionally limited to minimize risk associated with any ERP.   I propose a new beginning and solicit the review of peers here, and elsewhere\u2026 Requirements:  The Ethereum Recovery Proposal respects the fundamental features of cryptocurrency - property rights, immutable history and the resulting digital scarcity. The Ethereum Recovery Proposal will provide a \u2018Sandbox Environment\u2019 for projects wishing to explore the Ethereum production network with their project. The Ethereum Recovery Proposal recognizes the customers right to informed consent before making their financial and technological decision.  Implementation   Going forward, projects wishing to engage in the Ethereum Recovery Proposal will include an boolean identifier on their smart contracts isEIP867 = true   Each EIP867 contract that receives user funds will lock them via smart contract. The contract will implement the following features    Create a new Token - Recovery Eth (Reth) 1:1 with user Eth  It will implement the following functions  abort - Contract Owner function. Return user funds and selfdestruct project contracts convert - DAO vote by Reth holders to convert the project from Reth to Eth. \u201cGo Live\u201d functionality provided to users escape - Reth holder function. Return user funds, destroy user Reth.  All contract operations will use the Reth token. Each project may implement its own degree of fiat within its Reth environment. The market may decide on the price of each project\u2019s Reth. Each project\u2019s Reth price is protected by the 1:1 backing of Eth. Merchants may accept Reth at a 1:1 Eth value as they may instantly convert back to Eth upon receipt of the token. The customer has the comfort of experimenting without the fear of crooked developers, zero day exploits or unknown bugs that may affect the project. The Ethereum Network does not have to change a thing. It provides these features out of the box already. This change is entirely reliant on developers putting aside their own hubris and/or customers demanding it of project developers. The cost of these additional features is amortized to each project. The \u2018inevitability of mistakes\u2019 problem mentioned by @MicahZoltu is now properly mitigated to the developer rather than subsidized by the entire network. I think this is a reasonable start. Apologies for the wall of text. I welcome feedback to this proposal whose spirit is to preserve the entire underlying technology that originally brought us to the project while showing compassion to new users. Edit: To clarify. My message is If Fiat is to exist here it will do so under our umbrella of voluntary property rights. As our system is so superior that it is permissive even to those systems which disagree with it. They may freely operate so long as they do so peacefully. Fundamentally, our property rights cannot exist under their system. Even if we operate peacefully. That is why I see this as the only possible compromise - As I acknowledge I can be wrong. ",

Also, contracts that want to interact with other contracts (like a multisig wallet) can\u2019t really implement this as a layer 2 solution.  The Parity bug, for example, would have still been a problem even if they implemented a layer 2 solution. Similarly, most of the recovery proposals that have been discussed couldn\u2019t have been avoided with layer 2 solutions.  For example, many of them are just people accidentally entering an address with a typo, or forgetting to include a destination in their send, or using an Ethereum API incorrectly.  Many of these people aren\u2019t interacting with contracts at all, they are interacting directly with the blockchain. Re: Slippery slope.  One of the reasons I like the ERP process is because it puts well defined boundaries on what is \u201cacceptable\u201d.  The alternative is to handle each case as a one-off which is more susceptible to slippery slopes (though I\u2019m still not convinced it is really that slippery).  You bring up some useful terminology in your comment @tenthirtyone, which is the difference between \u201cproperty rights\u201d and \u201cimmutability\u201d.  The ERP process is an attempt to enforce property rights, while people who argue for immutability are really arguing against property rights. I\u2019m curious, those of you arguing against property rights, why is it that you don\u2019t like the idea of property rights?  What is it about immutability that makes you value it over property rights? ",

It is designed/worded such that it can only take money that is inaccessible by anyone and assign it to the person that should have access to it.  This happens in situations where people typo an address, or end up with funds stuck in a smart contract due to a bug.  The ERP process is expressly not for something like TheDAO recovery where funds were taken from one party and given to another.   This is not my interpretation.

If there exists a private key known by someone (or possibly known by someone) that has access to the assets in question, then it is possible to handle the recovery via the standard protocol (e.g., via an ETH transfer transaction). @phiferd, there may be value in making this a bit more plain/obvious/clear.

I\u2019m certainly open to rewording if there\u2019s a better way to phrase it.     sfultong:  What does \u201cdirectly\u201d affected mean?   For directly affected, let\u2019s start with a simple example. A -> B*, where A is a regular account and B* is a off-by-one typo of address B, which is also a regular account (i.e. not a contract). In this case, there are clearly two \u201cdirectly affected\u201d parties: A and B. The owner of address C doesn\u2019t have any provable involvement in the transaction. If we agree that private property exists on the blockchain (I don\u2019t think everyone here does), then A and B are the only two people that really have anything to say about what the \u201cright\u201d solution is. The ERP process (explicitly) only applies in cases where A and B agree on the solution.     sfultong:  If anyone claims that they are directly affected by an ERP, and they object to that ERP, does it mean the ERP should automatically be rejected?   No. In the example above, C cannot just arbitrarily claim to be affected.     sfultong:  What if a directly affected party is in jail? In that case they will be unlikely to challenge any ERP.   If B is in jail and A claims that funds in B* should be sent to A, then the agreement requirement cannot be met. In that case, a B would likely challenge. However, if A agrees that the funds in B* should go to B, then B\u2019s permission probably isn\u2019t required (after all, A can send funds to B anytime he wants without B\u2019s permission). Can it be more complicated?  Of course. However, the ERP process was not meant to handle all cases.  Rather than saying \u201chere are 50 scenarios we can\u2019t solve\u201d we tried to carve out a boundary around cases that we can solve. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @MicahZoltu, I want to address your points and possibly clear up any misunderstandings you have regarding property rights. Layer 2 is just as susceptible as Layer 1. Yes, I never disagreed here. The bonus is that your project may now implement whatever degree of fiat that it needs. Which is the spirit of the ERP - To what degree will Ethereum users allow for Fiat in their network? It should be sandboxed as far away from the chain as possible. Preferably left to the legacy banking system As Fiat would represent a backwards incompatible and breaking feature for the current user base the only compromise is for projects wishing to include Fiat-as-a-Feature (FaaF) to do so moving forward, in their own projects. Not as a network solution to a problem specific to a single project. I love your point about multisig and interacting with other contracts. I will update the ERP spec - Projects that implement the Ethereum Recovery Proposal should only interact with other Projects that implement the Ethereum Recovery Proposal. Thank you. This will protect other teams from projects that require they test their beta product in production. Now then, let\u2019s talk about property rights\u2026 If you own a bar of gold and throw it in the Marianas Trench, I agree you can make a case that you still own that gold. This would be tantamount to a user miss-typing the receiving address of a transaction. But to me, that\u2019s a valid transaction. Code is Law the same way we will not rewrite the laws of physics to reclaim the bar of gold. The argument for an ERP that changes the fundamentals of the protocols binding Ethereum together is frustrating because it relies on sliding the goal post - The Slippery Slope. Its already happening right now. Code is Law so you pose \u201cLet\u2019s move where the line is for the Code.\u201d While that is clever, it shows a belligerent misunderstanding of the environment and its users. Even the definitions of property rights are subject in this upside down argument. For if we were to apply your airy and nebulous standard to current users the network would break. I could just as easily claim every tx ever sent by me was a mistake and force this very human process to decide who owns what funds - no different from a banking system. The user was the only person able to send those funds down a black hole. They did. Part of the responsibility of owning property is that you can make mistakes. It is a fundamental failure of property rights to grant one group some exclusive privilege. In this case, the ability to reverse their transaction. Furthermore, there are many more perfectly legitimate use cases where a user would burn a coin - sending to address(0) for instance. Since your proposal relies on a human fiat process to determine if funds were sent incorrectly the only option you have is a layer 2 solution. As this entire proposal is nothing more than a single project (Parity) masquerading their required change as a required change to the core fundamentals that govern the Ethereum network is ultimately elitist favoritism toward a tiny group I think we should put an end to the masquerade and call this exactly what it is: The Parity team has shown they are incapable of production code without putting their user funds at risk. To date, they have put more effort into changing the Ethereum network to suit their project than toward building a beneficial product that is a boon to the ecosystem. Maybe Ethereum just isn\u2019t the blockchain for the Partiy team? Maybe they should fork and start a chain that provides the FaaF they need? Let\u2019s not forget, the entire premise is the most recent Parity debacle is assuming the user \u2018accidentally\u2019 triggered the selfDestruct. The Developers left that feature in the code. The developers are responsible. Regardless, I would be willing to go on record (although it is not true) claiming to be the person who called selfDestruct and I would claim that title saying I did it intentionally. That would defeat the entire foundation of the original EIP. At least, for Parity users. ",

You can call my views extreme, but I genuinely believe that over the long term \u201cprotecting people from shooting themselves in the foot\u201d will lead to institutionalised theft, especially considering there\u2019s no formalised boundary. EIP-999 might not be considered theft, but each time we accept one of these proposals to essentially undo a transaction, we\u2019re taking another step towards a centralised government that gets to choose which transactions are valid and which are not. Each recovery will set another a precedent just like the DAO fork did (if the DAO fork never happened, we wouldn\u2019t even be having this conversation). Long term, if we accept state changes like this Ethereum will slowly evolve towards a corruptible, tyrannical system over the decades to come. These views were expressed in the DAO fork debate in 2016 and they are still valid today. Institutionalised theft exists because a small minority of people hold more power than the rest. Many people are attracted to cryptocurrency because of the absolute property rights, i.e. nobody can interfere with your transactions. The fundamental awesome-ness of Ethereum is that code executes exactly as written and there shouldn\u2019t be exceptions to that for people who are exceptionally negligent. This EIP breaks the core functionality of Ethereum. As harsh as it may sound, un-freezing ether is a form of theft. When balances become frozen, the value attached to those burnt ether are effectively distributed to the whole economy. In the same fashion as when you transfer ether to 0x0000, or when you set fire to $1 trillion. Redistributing value from the current ether holders is a form of inflationary theft in the same sense that quantitative easing and corporate bailouts are hidden thefts. For those that want a quasi-centralised system where transactions can be undone, they should opt-in to a solution on the Ethereum application layer; these decisions shouldn\u2019t be made at the protocol level. It\u2019s clear from the volume of debate in this EIP-867 and EIP-999, the split sentiment on reddit and the results of the EIP-999 coinvote that many people are not interested in a system like this.     MicahZoltu:  For me personally, I have a Shelling Fence  that prevents this from being a slippery slope.  It certainly feels like the disagreement is around whether or not a Shelling Fence exists.   You might have a personal fence, but the greater community doesn\u2019t. I think we need to determine where that fence is now and commit to holding that promise for the future of Ethereum. And I think that if and when we come to a consensus on that, it should only be applied to future state changes (i.e. EIP-999 should fail no matter what). Out of curiosity, where is your fence? ",

What new information has become available since the early days of touting hard immutability as a key benefit of Ethereum? Those promoting immutability at the time surely understood that all programmable systems come with bugs, and that these would in turn cause unanticipated losses or gains. Nothing new. It is clear that hard immutability won\u2019t fly in the real world, but It\u2019s hard to see how Ethereum can now convincingly change what has been so thoroughly beaten into the collective consciousness.

Part of the problem is that people use the word immutability when they really mean something else (something less well defined).  Check out the post by @phiferd over in here, he does a good job of describing reality and you can see that immutability of the blockchain is well defined, but quite constrained.  This definition still holds even if we do a recovery. So I would say the new information is people gaining a better understanding of what immutability really means, and what Ethereum (or any blockchain) really is in terms of guarantees.  Back during TheDAO fork I was one of the people shouting about immutability and slippery slopes, but since then I have spent a lot of time thinking about governance, blockchains, etc. and because of that my stance has changed (though I\u2019m still anti DAO fork to some extent, but for more well defined reasons). I can\u2019t speak to what the people in the early days meant when they said \u201cimmutability\u201d, but as you can see in the link above Ethereum has never been completely immutable (that just doesn\u2019t make sense).     tenthirtyone:  Hard Immutability permits systems of fiat to exist on layers above it. The same is not true for fiat -> immutability. If you require fiat, this project already provides you the ability to write your fiat in public code where others can voluntarily participate - or not. That is the strong argument for the benefit of immutability to all cryptocurrency, not just Ethereum.   I recommend checking out the writeup I linked above (in this comment), and then restate what you mean by \u201cimmutability\u201d.  I suspect what you mean is not that you want immutability, but that you want constraints on the ways under which the rules are allowed to change in the future.  If you truly want immutability of the rules then I would argue that is against the ethos of Ethereum, since it has long been known that Ethereum will continue to develop as a platform with PoS, Sharding, etc. and that all requires rule changes. If what you want are constraints on what rule changes can occur, then I recommend dropping the \u201cimmutability\u201d argument (it isn\u2019t well defined) and instead argue for how you believe the rules should be constrained.  It would also help to argue why you believe that the governance system is incapable of handling this sort of thing in an equitable way.     tjayrush:  At what point does repeated expressions that this is not a good idea followed by defense by a single individual become \u201crough consensus\u201d?   Never.   Just because the loudest people believe A, does not mean A is the majority belief.  I continue to participate in the discussion because people continue to misunderstand the reality of the situation.  If it was just a matter of one group wanting some particular value and another group wanting a different value or the two groups having different predictions on how future humans will behave, then I would have stopped discussing quite a while ago.  However, people keep showing up to the discussion with incorrect mental models of reality and that isn\u2019t helping anyone, especially when they propagate that incorrect mental model to others. Some people have correct mental models of reality and still disagree because goals don\u2019t align or predictions differ.  Discussion between these parties has died down a bit because each side has said their piece and there isn\u2019t anything obvious we can do to resolve the differences other than \u201ctry one and see what happens\u201d or \u201caccept that we have different goals and fork\u201d.

This lead to it taking years for Segwit/Blocksize and along the way there were many forks rather than just one.  I am of the opinion that when your userbase reaches the point where there are two groups with incompatible goals then it is time to fork. The problem, of course, is that in the current environment it isn\u2019t possible to fork without one of the two branches getting an unfair advantage when it comes to user choice.  Which fork gets the ETH ticker symbol, which fork does Vitalik support?  Which fork do Geth and Parity have as the default code in the master branch of their respective GitHub repositories?  Which fork is the default for new Geth/Parity users? This is an unfortunate situation, but one that doesn\u2019t have any obvious/immediate solutions.  At the same time, not allowing the protocol to evolve is bad (IMO), and if you want the protocol to evolve then you must accept that changes to the rules must be made.  This then requires the majority of people participating in a particular fork of Ethereum generally agree on (or are at least not willing to switch forks over) how the governance system for rule changes work.  That all culminates in us being in the situation we are in, and likely forking over the matter (again, I don\u2019t think this is bad, I think this is a healthy solution). ",

                    "content": "Technical consensus is not the same thing as majority belief.  E.g. the majority might be technically wrong, or their objections non-technical.  Over the course of discussions I\u2019ve seen continual improvement of our understanding of this EIP and related EIPs and issues.  I haven\u2019t seen a killer technical objection yet.  I have seen serious philosophical, economic, and political arguments for and against.  These need to be technically informed, and the technology needs to be informed by the rest of the world, so it\u2019s fine that they happen here.  But in the end, the technical soundness of the proposal is what matters, and wherever I come down on the other issues, it still looks sound to me.  If that becomes the consensus, then the place to argue the other issues moves on to whether to adopt particular ERPs. ",

That would involve those with the most expertise and motivation banding together, agreeing to a chairperson whose job it is to seek for and call the consensus, and going for agreement on a penultimate draft.  This being both an early proposal in the process and as controversial as they get the chair will need to be of unquestioned impartiality and technical insight.  And a skilled cat herder.  Other ways of self-organizing the quest welcome. ",
