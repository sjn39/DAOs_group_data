Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Collateral: FIAT Collateralized USDC, GUSD, PAX, BUSD Bundled together as one asset.  More efficient feedback loop for risk teams. Reduce idiosyncratic risk from one entity. Perfect time given that we\u2019re about to head into a heavily volatile market (thus end traders/holders want savings/security, and not leverage). No slippage on redemption would result in additional opportunities & awareness for MakerDAO.  3. Provide a brief history of the project Posting for awareness & show support due to the current market conditions/community discussion. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated.  Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. https://www.etherscan.io  Link to any active communities relating to your project. https://twitter.com/Gemini https://twitter.com/Coinbase https://twitter.com/PaxosStandard https://twitter.com/Binance   7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? PAX - Institutional/Digitized Assets USDC - Institutional/DeFi GUSD - Institutional/Merchant BUSD - Institutional/Exchanges 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? All counterparty\u2019s are deliberately chosen for their jurisdiction, and path for recourse. USA, Licensed Money Services Businesses. Our aim is to ensure security at all times above everything else. As an agnostic platform, we curate any counter-party\u2019s for rate optimization, so long as there\u2019s a clear path for either:  Regulatory recourse - Centralized licensed entities that satisfy all current obligations with state & federal regulators. E.g FinCEN Registration, NMLS, SOC1/SOC2 Audits.  The below is not applicable for this collateral  Cryptographic Recourse - Distributed (often labeled \u201cDecentralized\u201d) teams operating open-source protocols, where digital assets are secured transparently on-chain with verifiable cryptographic rules. Primary consideration always being \u201cDuration Of Immutability\u201d.  *Additional factors such as Insurance coverage, Team Control, Asset Types, Participants are considered but secondary in cryptographic recourse given irreversible transactions. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Functionally it\u2019d be a contract on-chain. Implementation could look many different ways. CHAI (vending machine) or AragonUI (Auto-OTC desk) For demonstration purposes, you can see it here on Aragon. https://mainnet.aragon.org/?#/wyre/0xef687d87afbecc2efeffe93523af827edfbafac0/  image1179\u00d7257 13.5 KB  That\u2019s a demo btw,  Can formalize if people take this application seriously. (Out if scope for this doc) Additionally, we can extend it to be a DSR like opportunity. E.g If assets are stored in custody, and the custodian is offering interest, then that becomes more DSR growth opportunities from the CeFi world, or similar. Stronger DSR means stronger motivations to generate DAI.   10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. https://www.fincen.gov/msb-registrant-search Search Legal Name for:  \u201cWyre, Inc.\u201d & \u201cWyre Payments Inc\u201d \u201cGemini Trust\u201d \u201cCoinbase\u201d \u201cPAXOS\u201d  11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  The entities are licensed and regulated, but the asset itself (GUSD, USDC, etc) are not (afaik).  12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Wyre, Coinbase, Gemini, PAX, Binance. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. We would already intend on doing all of this if needed and can do it automatically. If it\u2019s better for the community for us not too, then we don\u2019t have to of course! Hope this helps move things forward  Thank you! Kind regards, Michael. There\u2019s a deeper dive external doc available if this is of interest   Summary This text will be hidden  ",

My understanding is that a token like FIAT would exist to diversify these risks in a way that approximately approaches a decentralized asset, therefore reducing total custodial risk while retaining a hard usd backed asset. If that is not your idea of the purpose of this pooling of assets, I would like to know what you feel is the value proposition here. ",

Either it\u2019s:  A basket of stablecoins with a fixed weighting to reduce custodial risk A wrapper around stablecoins where users are free to mint FIAT by depositing any valid stablecoin.  1 provides us with a way to recover from a single stablecoin blowing up. 2 may improve UX and liquidity in some areas of DeFi but is extremely risky because it is only as strong as its weakest link. Proposing 2 as collateral for MakerDAO is really really silly ",
