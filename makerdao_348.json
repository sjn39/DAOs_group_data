Next, we have to discuss with Fireblocks how to whitelist the contract (given that they whitelist institutions) and wait for the proposal to be voted.  DAI liquidity on our Multichain strategy Recently we had an alarming situation with various projects that want to integrate DAI on Arbitrum but can\u2019t because of its low liquidity. They have to choose between USDC, USDT or MIM, because they can\u2019t wait for their users to bring DAI liquidity to Arbitrum and pay for the gas fees of that transaction.  image1242\u00d7470 24.7 KB  Currently, Arbitrum is the L2 with the largest market share (40%) and under Maker\u2019s multichain strategy. DAI is on Balancer in a stablecoin pool, but it\u2019s not on SushiSwap, nor in Curve, which represents a problem for the dApps that need deep stablecoin markets. Talking with other Mandated Actors, we suppose the problem was the delay in including DAI on Arbitrum, which we decided for security reasons. Because of it, we think it is best to start thinking about strategies that help us increase DAI liquidity in the Networks that we consider strategic (because we may have this problem again in the future). We are working with other Mandated Actors to find alternative solutions to this problem. Possible solutions are renting DAI liquidity to Market Makers, incentivizing DAI liquidity through rewards, or adding something in the protocol that allows us to deploy DAI liquidity.

Offsite Growth+guests After our experience working with other groups in Lisbon, we want to try a new format of offsite and open it to the community. We will discuss our priorities with the team during our offsite and define a plan to achieve our objectives as a core unit. We would also like to open this discussion and invite others to create the 1T growth vision. The offsite will be from February 7th to the 11th in Mexico. The following week some of us will stay in Mexico for then go to Eth-Denver. We need to know how many of you want to join us to make the reservation and start planing the offsite.

As mentioned in previous updates, this interest comes with a considerable challenge from both sides: For the institutions to learn about decentralized organizations and for DAOs to find a way to close agreements with institutions. Those challenges have been the trigger for new services of companies that can act as a bridge to work with both worlds. In Growth, we are helping those bridge companies to understand the power of Maker vaults and DAI. One example is Nexo, which recently announced its partnership with Fidelity to Offer Products for Institutional Investors. But we also are working with other companies like Valk, a token issuance platform servicing ~ working with 80 institutional clients - which will be integrating Maker vaults in Jan as part of their DeFi access product.

With the appearance of USDT-TRON or BUSD-BSC we had to do something to help our community to keep using DAI. And that\u2019s why we started working with exchanges and wallets in the region on the DAI-multichain and started teaching them about Polygon. With the Maker multichain strategy, we are planning to push our L2 initiative there, making this part of the Maker plan.  Soon.
