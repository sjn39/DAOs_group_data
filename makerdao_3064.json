That\u2019s probably cause\u2019 I\u2019ve read some much stuff here, that I\u2019ve felt very linked to the forum and the DAO. I got very motivated with whole the DAO idea probably late 2019, then I was looking for solutions to monetary storage in my natal country (Cuba) and found about DAI\u2026 read more, found Vaults, voting portal, auctions\u2026 bought my first MKR, earned, loosed\u2026 At this moment I feel very attached to the DAO, having the forum opened in one of my screens all the time. I vote in more of the polls here, in some on-chain, not all TBH (really would like to find more motivation to do it!). I read most of the discussions taking place, and learned a lot in the process! I guess that bringing more people to the DAO is about sharing its goal, improving the interaction with common people (where we\u2019re lacking a little IMHO), and ensuring there are monetary incentives as well. Vault owners are those who probably will want to learn more about MakerDAO (that was my second step after all), and could end as active community memebers. IMO, that\u2019s probably the first entry point for new members, I\u2019d love that we give more importance to that part. What I hope to achieve? Well, to become a member of the DAO in the \u201cstrong sense\u201d. Want to start cooperating with it, helping in what I know to do (building software), help it to achieve that milestone that I share with it: changing the current financial system! Long road ahead, but I definitely believe that MakerDAO has the bases set to be one of the big players in the financial system of tomorrow, one more opened, not centralized, and not obliged to follow rules of some specific governments\u2026 one which follow the shared rules of the mankind, fair, universal and without privileges.

From then I began to try Maker and created a cdp with the help of the MakerDAO Chinese team. I once interviewd with Chao Pan and published an article(https://bihu.com/article/1527270391) at bihu.Besides, I also wrote 3 articles introducing Maker. https://bihu.com/article/1880573473; https://bihu.com/article/1411844031; https://bihu.com/article/1696428346. Although I once chatted at chat.makerdao.com I never use this forum. Forum is a little out-dated for me. But I registered this account at March,2020 because I want to learn more about the black swan(near 0 DAI liquidation event). Then I almost forgot this forum. Recently I chatted with @Jiecut at discord and he shared with me a snapshot which he got serveral hundred DAI from this forum then I want to explore more\u2026   So this time I think what attracts me is the incentives. In summarize, I like Maker and this forum distributes incentives to the active members. If you can do something with interests and then get some rewards, why not? ",
