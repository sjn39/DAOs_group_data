Which is why it broke my heart to learn about Maker\u2019s oracle outage a few months ago.  Alas, it is my duty to ask the tough questions, so I reached out to Seamus, a developer on Maker\u2019s oracle team, to get to the bottom of the story. Maker Header.PNG855\u00d7268 28.6 KB Uncle: I\u2019m just going to get right into it Seamus, WTF happened!? Seamus: Yeah, it was our bad. We missed the rapid growth in the Scuttlebot state size, which led to the oracle outage. But the event really opened our eyes to the over-complexity the system, so we gutted the whole thing and replaced it with something simpler. Uncle: Oh, wow, I didn\u2019t realize Maker replaced the oracles. Seamus: Yeah, managing the light feeds, dark feeds, and VWAPs just got too complicated, so we switched to a multisig and are entering the prices manually. Uncle: Wait, did you say manually? Seamus: Yeah, the DeFi space is pretty comfortable with multsigs right now. I mean, if you knew how much value was secured by multisigs, you would vomit. But Maker has historically been criticized for not adapting to the times, so this is more or less a response to that. Uncle: So how do you use a multisig for the oracles? Seamus: Well, pretty much everyone on the oracle team is a yield-farming degenerate on a razor\u2019s edge of liquidation (shout out to Mariano!), so we\u2019re already plugged into CoinGecko 24/7. Then every hour we coordinate in our group TikTok chat to decide what prices to push. Maker Oracle Flow785\u00d7441 39.6 KB Uncle: And you don\u2019t think that is a security risk? Seamus: Hardly. During the last ETH pullback one of the larger vaults was going to be triggered for liquidation by only $3.50. We were pretty confident ETH was going to rally by the next OSM update, so we rounded up and saved the vault. To me, that\u2019s just good customer service. Uncle: I don\u2019t know. Maker has billions of dollars locked in the protocol. It seems exceptionally irresponsible for prices to be determined by a small group of people in a chat room. Seamus: I mean, that\u2019s pretty much how Chainlink works\u2026 As always, I\u2019ll be following up on this story as it develops. Follow me on Twitter for the latest crypto news @UncleRewards.  Also, I\u2019m trying to pay off my student loans through SourceCred so\u2026 ",
