There are currently two active Signal Requests that commenced prior to ratification of the MIP16 amendment:  Clear Vaults\u2019 Bad Debt in the MakerDAO protocol? The SHCU Requests a moment of your time  We will allow these Signal Requests to finish, consistent with previous occasions when the approved governance processes have changed after a proposal has been made to Governance.
