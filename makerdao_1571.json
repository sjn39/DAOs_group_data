Paragraph Summary The MakerDAO Ambassador program provides non-English speaking communities with resources and educational materials to expand the MakerDAO community. Ambassadors provide two-way translation services, engage their communities with local events, and share content produced in their language with the MakerDAO community.  Motivation This Special Purpose Fund aims to finance the ongoing work and projects of the Ambassador Program.  1727\u00d7390 311 KB   Special Purpose Fund Name Ambassador Program Special Purpose Fund.  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials There is a huge amount of potential for MakerDAO in non-English speaking communities and a lack of educational resources as well as means for these community members to participate.  The Ambassador Program allows for these communities to engage with MakerDAO\u2014bringing us a new wave of community members, developers, talent, and MKR holders. The Ambassador Program has kept the LATAM community updated regarding the progress and achievements of the MakerDAO Protocol through weekly translations of the most critical updates:  Weekly Relay Forum at Glance The Weekly Polls The Monthly Core Unit Updates   Evergreen Material The Ambassadors has also been translating essential parts of the Protocol documentation, including translating and maintaining the Maker Operational Manual in Spanish and the MakerDOCs in Spanish, as well as some relevant MIPs.  Maker Operational Manual The Maker Operational Manual is an ongoing project by GovAlpha. New pages are translated and old ones are subject to revision periodically. Here\u2019s the official announcement of the Maker Operational Manual in Spanish to the community.  1285\u00d7427 49.3 KB   MakerDOCs The MakerDOCs documents have been translated in a titanic quest from the Ambassador Program. With some gaps to fill, 95% of the DOCS has been fully translated and uploaded for the community. You can check the announcement of the MakerDOCs in Spanish in the LATAM part of the Forum.  1439\u00d7625 76.7 KB   Ambassadors Setting Foot on Twitter In addition, the Ambassador Program has been working on positioning the Maker brand for Spanish-speaking audiences through the official account on Twitter in Spanish. It has been publishing content about:  Ongoing or completed debates and votes that have been most relevant to the Protocol. Updates about advances and achievements (such as the Maker Teleport and the Multichain Strategy). Educational content explaining how the DAI stability mechanisms work, how the Oracles work, the Settlements, etc. Maker partnerships with other projects inside and outside the crypto ecosystem and participation in various events and hackathons.

Increased Activity of the LATAM Community The presence of the community in the forum has been noticeable, and more discussions have been presented in Spanish. While participating fully in the forum involves a particular learning curve for new users, several have contributed a lot to the forum.      1040\u00d7748 61.1 KB   1037\u00d7753 61.5 KB       1031\u00d7767 61.9 KB   1053\u00d7751 62.8 KB      2022 So Far\u2026 Since the Ambassador Program started, we have seen a significant increase in the number of LATAM users and topics on the Top SourceCred earner\u2019s list. Currently, the top post of 2022 is a LATAM post. For the following information, the selected interval was: January 1, 2022 to August 9, 2022  \u2014 Source: MakerDAO SourceCred Stats  (2 Latam posts on Top 10 Topics by Cred Generated, including #1)  (3 Latam members on Top 10 Cred Earners)  Meet-ups & Social Gatherings To generate and consolidate communities around Maker, the Program has been participating in different spaces, on- and offline, positioning the DAI name and explaining how Maker works. These participations range from private communities using tools such as Google Meet or Zoom to Public Spaces on Twitter, where any user can listen in, participate, ask questions, and talk about the Protocol\u2014encouraging the debate and discussion around Maker. As of this day, the Ambassador Program has participated in over eight different meet-ups and social gatherings, both on- and offline. It has been possible to attend hackathons in the region and have a presence in offline communities and regional events, making the Protocol known not only through online media but through word of mouth and sharing with members of other communities.

The Ambassadors have been managing and leading a Telegram group, building and developing a robust Spanish-speaking community, and giving them resources to overcome the learning curve preventing them from participating in the Protocol. This work can be seen in the Translations Assignment Sheet where our community members can translate new material the Program cannot cover, due to staffing, in an orderly manner. Noteworthy, in this group, there are multiple discussions about topics related to DAI and Maker, such as news, implementations, use cases, projects involving the Protocol, and discussions about what is happening in the crypto ecosystem, DeFi, and the Maker Forum.  What\u2019s Next for the Ambassador Program? This funding allows the continuation of the work that the Ambassador Program has been developing in terms of community, brand positioning, and presence in the Spanish-speaking market. The Ambassador Program aims to provide new Spanish users with all the Maker content they need, expanding the reach of the Protocol\u2019s current and future products, breaking down the language barrier, and taking the Protocol to new audiences. For this budget cycle, we are expanding the team to add two part-time ambassadors to allow for more translation and original content production.  Above and Beyond In the future, we would like to expand the Ambassador Program to other regions such as Asia and Eastern Europe to provide non-English educational materials and further build and grow the Maker community.

Growth CU - APAC Regional Update - Q2 2022 Growth       Thank you for your comment. And you are right, most of the chinese exchanges I spoke to now know that DAI is widely adopted in Argentina because of the inroad the team in Argentina built years ago. We also spoke to Bybit which expanded to Argentina recently. And the strategic thing to do is to partner up with all these big exchanges expanding into LATAM to push DAI by running some strategic marketing activation and educational campaigns. Feel free to dm me if you have other ideas in mind.     But this is a clear example of a job well done, entering a growing region early is getting ahead, and the ambassador program is a clear example of this, perseverance, discipline and courage. As a Latin American I am forced to change all my benefits from local currency to stable currency, as documented I use DAI as I do there are thousands of people who escape the inflation of their country, but undocumented people use DAI out of simple ignorance, if we were to more people that would change.  cepalstat_chart_16602181065161809\u00d71677 306 KB  The PIB in Latin America is increasing since the constant hyperinflations are transformed into inflation and the average citizen looks for the escape to stronger currencies (when depositing your local currency in banks they remove an exaggerated commission) in addition to the fact that there is not enough circulation of dollars to To support the desire of the majority of citizens, therefore, they resort to stable currencies. If we managed to get these citizens to deposit at least 1,000 DAI, which would be almost 25% of their annual PIB, we would be cleanly increasing the fluid liquidity of DAI, and this would be achieved by making DAI is recognized as USDT did, and the Ambassadors team is the living example that it can be achieved ",

At that time that was important because the crypto community in Latam was mainly BTC and DASH!!! the ethereum ecosystem was minimum and there were only a few exchanges with DAI. But that\u2019s different now  communities have evolved considerably and you can find groups like DeFi Latam! I think the latam ambassadors program has to reflect that evolution, although translations are nice, it\u2019s also important to generate localized content, explaining to people in each country why Dai should matter to them, why an open governance protocol is a game changer, and relevant in countries with high corruption rates. Original and localized content is important and I would completely support it because we could work together and have a huge impact through that. My DMs are open if you want to discuss how we can work together! ",
