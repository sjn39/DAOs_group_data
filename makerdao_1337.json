                    "content": "I\u2019ve been concerned about the amount of DAI generated from USDC since long before becoming a delegate. Now that we\u2019ve reached an ATH of 80% of DAI (and rising) being backed by centralized stable assets, we simply won\u2019t be doing our jobs unless we directly confront the reality of the risks. Circle has the power to blacklist/freeze the USDC in the PSM without notice. This would indefinitely freeze the collateral backing 80% of DAI in existence, causing an existential crisis for the entire DAO. This is an untenable risk. We simply cannot leave the fate of the DAO in the hands of Circle or any other 3rd party. We must do everything that we can to avert existential threats like this. In DeFi and crypto in general, if it can happen we must assume that it will happen. We have no idea what the future will bring, or how regulators will view the stablecoin scene in the near future. If we keep our heads buried in the sand on this and only focus on what is likely then we will simply not be doing our jobs. We need to focus on what is possible and then determine our risk tolerance based on that. This cannot wait. If we do not think adversarially now, then we are simply not doing everything we can to protect MakerDAO. I would like to use this thread to kick-start the following, in this order:   Request that CUs use this as a safe space to offer some realistic modeling & scenarios (PE, legal, any other relevant takes) regarding exactly what would happen if all USDC in the PSM got blacklisted/frozen. Let\u2019s get real. Don\u2019t sugar coat it. Think adversarially. Tell us exactly how this would go, where the unknowns lie, and what state DAI could find itself in as a result.   Ask staunch PSM supporters to justify the risk that the scenarios presented in Step 1 become reality. \u201cThat is so unlikely to happen\u201d is not allowed here. This could happen so we need to justify the decision to even allow it to exist as a possibility. If the bear market shaves even more value off ETH, we could even see 85-90% DAI via PSM. Explain to us why you believe that placing the fate of the DAO in the hands of a highly-regulated 3rd party is worth the incredible risk, and why reducing or eliminating the PSM is an existentially bad idea despite the outlined potential scenarios.   As a DAO, decide whether or not the reasons to keep the PSM in its current state (or at all) are worth the risks & justifications that have been established. Discuss alternatives & trade-offs. Then, finally, allow MKR holders themselves to determine whether the peg stability that has been achieved is worth the identified existential risk presented by USDC\u2019s centralization.   If the DAO is going to continue to exist at the will of Circle/USDC, then we need to justify it. If we can\u2019t justify it, then we need to change it.  I\u2019m hopeful that this exercise will ultimately lead to a drastic reduction or even eventual elimination of the PSM, and I also hope that by doing this thoughtfully, we can recognize which trade-offs are ultimately worth it and which are not. I welcome any & all input on the process I\u2019ve suggested. ",

We are close to having treasuries and a portion of the PSMs will be diversified there very soon.  Just have to be a little patient.  USDC is the most liquid on chain asset that allows MKR to have excess demand for DAI without affecting the dollar peg.  It\u2019s just a representation of demand that can in the future be managed once there are enough avenues to find nonstablecoin collateral for the DAI (such as treasuries).  Again, this is what is worked on every day.  There will always be counterparty risk.  The key is to diversify and manage this risk. But on the topic of circle freezing assets, we do need to recognize that circle would take a huge reputational hit if it were to do this.  If we can trust that circle is fully backed and can repay the usdc is out there, we should be ok.  Of course it\u2019s always a big if to trust anyone, but usdc is at least the most trusted centralized stablecoin and it\u2019s failure to repay its obligation would likely signify a huge market event for all of crypto.  This would certainly affect MKR whether or not MKR was exposed to USDC.  All of crypto is exposed to USDC. ",

That doesn\u2019t seem like the greatest result.  Am I wrong in my analysis? The usdc represents excess demand.  Without an avenue for it to go, excess demand means the price goes above 1.00 which then leads to less demand as you start pressuring holders to sell plus a taking reputational hit to stability. ",

ChrisBlec:  Now that we\u2019ve reached an ATH of 80% of DAI (and rising) being backed by centralized stable assets   Dai generated from collateral is not the same as Dai collateralization. All Dai in circulation are backed by all collateral in the system \u201cat the same time,\u201d no matter which collateral each Dai was minted from, because, for example,  1 Dai minted from PSM-USDC is fully fungible with 1 Dai minted from ETH-A. A great way to understand the difference between these two metrics is: Dai minted from collateral measures the demand of each type of Dai collateralization (source of minted Dai), and Dai collateralization measures the composition of all assets backing all Dai. Edit:  Not 100% accurate, my bad, corrected here  image - 2022-06-29T110619.6151378\u00d7435 83.4 KB  According to daistats.com, PSM-USDC represents 36.9% of all collateral value in the system. If we add PSM-USDP and USDC-A, the number will go to 44.9%.     ChrisBlec:  Circle has the power to blacklist/freeze the USDC in the PSM without notice. This would indefinitely freeze the collateral backing 80% of DAI in existence   If all USDC in the system suddenly goes to zero or is blacklisted, to calculate the amount of potential unbacked Dai we can say that:   Math   There\u2019s 6.7 billion Dai in circulation.   There\u2019s 3.2 billion USDC in PSM-USDC + 227 million in USDC-A = ~3.4 billion USDC   There\u2019s $8.7 billion worth of collateral in the system.   If $3.4 billion worth of collateral (3.4 billion USDC) is removed, the system will lose $3.4 billion of collateral: $8.7 billion - $3.4 billion = $5.3 billion   The result is $5.3 billion backing 6.7 billion Dai (collateralization ratio of ~79%)   Well, this is just simple math, I\u2019m not taking into account other potential risks of deleting the PSM reserves, which would be bad for Dai peg\u2019s strenght.   Not accurate, my bad, corrected here And that\u2019s an important part of why the PSM reserves and their quality are important for Dai to be resilient. The PSM is a permissionless liquidity tool for Dai. During stress situations, just as the last one the crypto market had in May, the $1 Dai peg would be as strong as the ability to redeem 1 Dai for $1. If we do not give this the importance it requires, Dai holders could lose their savings before we find the solution to PSM-USDC PSM-USDC is a good, high-quality collateral that supports the success of Dai. We have other solutions to build this permissionless liquidity, like G-UNI vaults, but PSM is the most successful liquidity tool Maker has ever had. In my opinion, all PSM-USDC being blacklisted is a very unlikely situation and that is an important fact to keep in mind when considering risks. And, well, I am not a financial/risks expert in the mechanism of Maker and Dai, I just wanted to point out my vision with the information that I have. I\u2019m sure Strategic Finance, Real World Finance or Risk team could add more PSM factors with greater importance for the success of Dai and Maker systems. ",

If everyone immediately buys super-cheap DAI and burns it to get their collateral back, and simultaneously zero new DAI is created because who would do that, doesn\u2019t that mean that DAI market liquidity would get totally crushed and the price of DAI would quickly moon?

But still worth considering the potential impacts. (1) would cause significant liquidity issues for DAI - users could no longer immediately redeem DAI for USDC/centralized stablecoins at 1:1 parity. But other exchange venues like Curve and Uniswap would still support DAI liquidity. And the backing of issued DAI is fundamentally still intact, just illiquid - we could assume that users would count locked up USDC at some discounted value based on expected time to resolve the legal issues and risk of (3) eventually happening. (2) would be more disruptive. First, pooled liquidity markets like Compound and Aave would basically get nuked into oblivion as liquidations of USDC/centralized stablecoin debt or collateral would no longer be possible. The majority of DAI liquidity (in PSMs and stablecoin swap pairs) would also become inaccessible, which would cause significant instability. However, DAI collateralization would still be fundamentally intact. Funds held in stablecoin LP vaults would also still be transferable, so Maker could potentially raise interest rates on or liquidate these positions if DAI began to trade below peg to help contract supply. I think this sort of govt action happening on short notice would be completely untenable from a public policy perspective - willfully causing significant collateral damage on US retail investors for no fault of their own. (3) would be a full on rug. To get here we\u2019d have to assume that the rule of law has completely collapsed in the US, and then ammunition and canned food would be the only currency with any real value. For the near future I don\u2019t think it makes much sense to try to optimize protocol design for this risk because potential solutions would kill DAI utility without significantly increasing likelihood of survival. As far as solutions:  Creating trustless wrappers around centralized stablecoin balances held in PSMs could reduce liquidity risks arising under cases including (1) and (2) Finishing development of VOX (target price adjustment module, similar to RAI) would be helpful as a backup plan in case Maker needs to rapidly offboard centralized stablecoins, although recent history of RAI shows this is does not work very well (rates are currently -25% APR and market price remains far above target price) Win the public policy debate around censorship resistance; I think all parts of the political spectrum are gaining increasing appreciation of censorship resistance (eg. the response to Canada trucker protest really concerned me even tho I don\u2019t really align politically with the protesters) and imo our best bet is gain broad public support where targeting DAI in furtherance of government financial control is untenable  So in summary: Yes I believe the risks posed by PSMs and other centralized asset exposures are justified ",

                    "content": "@ChrisBlec: Thank you for bringing up this important issue and taking a first principles approach. As a major user of DAI and involved in DAOs with major DAI exposure the continued focus at Maker on: -Downplaying the risks of taking on real-world assets -Downplaying the risks of having large amounts of USDC backing DAI I\u2019ve been interested in/focused on DAI since reading the Maker DAO white paper. What appealed to me was the fact that Maker was trying to build an asset that would be crypto native and provide a medium of exchange that was largely uncensorable and an alternative asset for crypto natives. What Maker has instead turned into is pretty much an organization that is increasingly centralized and struggling to demonstrate its value proposition versus USDC, which is subject to regulatory capture and has severe centralization concerns. Every time people mention the issues associated with USDC and the blacklist risk, we hear \u201cwell they\u2019d never do that, it would kill their business, etc., etc.\u201d I second your call for an in-depth analysis and discussion about the risks associated with having nearly 50% of DAI backed by USDC, and the impact to the protocol if this were to be blacklisted due to regulators\u2019 discomfort with DAI\u2019s permissionless nature. As a reminder, I called out these risks three years ago in this post. I made the following points:   The Maker system becomes less resilient against attack: Currently, despite the fact that there is no Foundation, every step Maker takes to become tied to real-world assets, not reduce reliance on USDC, it\u2019s easier to attack.   KYC requirements are hugely unpopular in some crypto circles:: A major selling point for DAI is permissionless nature. I don\u2019t see that surviving with the current Maker path.   The final thing I\u2019ll say is this (quoting from my original article): The whole Open Finance ecosystem falls apart if Dai can be seized/blocked from an application because central actors say that the currency is compromised, or they don\u2019t like that CDPs were opened without KYC requirements, etc. I\u2019d love to hear from Maker about what it thinks about this threat, and how it plans to mitigate these risks, and even if it thinks they are not credible (and why).

This really does sound like a best-case scenario, where the market acts rationally and doesn\u2019t panic at all. The odds of that seem very, very slim. If a blacklist/freeze were to happen, it would likely be by order of a regulator, and it would likely be in the news almost immediately. In that case, there\u2019s a solid chance that the USDC will never return and DAI holders would immediately capitulate. I\u2019d like to get more info on how typical irrational markets would play out in this type of situation.

Curious to hear what you consider a viable alternative. From my perspective there isn\u2019t one. Liquity model only works with constant emissions (and a favorable narrative environment where people are willing to buy LQTY token even while the long term value prospect is highly suspect). And even with healthy emissions to support stability pool deposits, significant supply demand imbalance (eg if everyone was fleeing centralized stablecoins to LUSD) would push LUSD price up to $1.10 which would begin to cause losses to stability pool depositors when liquidations happen and system would still become unstable and likely collapse. RAI sorta kinda works with negative interest rates, and Maker could adopt a similar mechanism (VOX module). But RAI is currently devaluing at a rate of 20%+ per year (on top of USD inflation), and is still trading far above target price. ",

                    "content": "First a caveat: I\u2019ve only skimmed this thread, apologies if I\u2019m repeating others. Second a clear explanation of my view of an \u2018ideal\u2019 state in terms of the PSM:  PSM USDC/others makes up 5-10% of total DAI supply. A tested and 24-hour viable method to wind down PSMs in an emergency.  Third, why we need the PSM, and a depressing comment on this:     ChrisBlec:  DAI worked before the PSM existed.   TL;DR, no it didn\u2019t. I\u2019m defining working as:  Providing a stablecoin that stays within 0.5% of its peg, and frankly this is generous, as many have said that this is far too volatile for institutional use of a stablecoin.  Realistically, most users do not care about decentralization primarily when evaluating stablecoins. Order of wants for stablecoins is essentially:  Extremely tight peg stability Trust in long-term safety of the underlying systems and backing. Decentralization  Bluntly, DAI does not work without the PSM because the incentive for stabilization is (in the absence of a PSM) expressed in the price of the DAI token. In order for the incentive to be meaningful, DAI is already not working by the above definition. To those that might dispute the above, we have empirical evidence that the incentive isn\u2019t strong enough within 0.5% from the market price of DAI after Black Thursday.  We had rates at 0%. DAI was trading above peg, I forget the magnitude and I don\u2019t want to go look it up, but at times it was significant, on the order of 1-2 cents semi-regularly.  Again, put bluntly, the incentive provided by deviation in the DAI price is not sufficient to overcome the risk of leverage on volatile collateral in a bear market, or the cost of hedging that volatility. Thus, PSM. Which is an excellent and useful innovation to ensure short-term stability for DAI. The problem develops from the following: Fundamentally, there is not enough demand for credit using decentralized collateral (specifically ETH) to support the DAI supply beyond a certain point. I will grant that theoretically we could take a larger market share from Aave and Compound, but there is still a hard limit to scaling from this approach that is a combination of:  Demand for credit using decentralized collateral from owners of decentralized collateral. The price of decentralized collateral.  This results in what would ideally be a short-term only mechanism in the PSM becoming a long-term mechanism, as we\u2019ve seen for the past few years. However, the above isn\u2019t news to anyone. It has been the driver of all major supply-scaling initiatives within Maker for maybe 2 years, the major two being:  Collateral Onboarding Real World Assets  The idea behind #1 was that other decentralized assets could and would develop which may reach a substantial fraction of ETH\u2019s market-cap, and therefore support lots of demand for credit. In practice this hasn\u2019t happened (and may never happen.) The idea behind #2 was that we know there is sufficient demand for credit in the legacy financial system for existing assets. If we can solve the complicated problem of using said assets as collateral safely, then we can scale DAI. So, with that extremely abbreviated history of why we\u2019re in the place we\u2019re in. We come to the possibility of alternatives. Again, simply put, there are no good alternatives. The closest we could come are probably:  Buying a significant amount of other decentralized fully-collaterallized stablecoins (like all of them.) Specifically LUSD and FEI. This has downsides. Having the protocol take a massive bet on ETH (similar to FEI) and directly mint DAI to purchase ETH and pray that number go up. This also has downsides.  With 100% seriousness, if you can convince me that an alternative exists that can realistically provide credibly decentralized backing for say 500M DAI with less existential risk (as evaluated by a risk expert) than USDC in the PSM, I would love to hear it, and I will help you campaign/persuade others to implement it. Then we just need 7 equally good and safe ideas for decentralized backing to reduce the PSM size to survivable numbers. Absent that the choice is between:  Real World Assets Lots of PSM DAI Making DAI even less competitive when compared to centralized stablecoins.   This was long. Apologies. My views, not GovAlpha\u2019s, etc. ",

Great to see you here. Appreciate it. Not totally sure how to have this convo so let me just jump right in and see what happens.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that the chances of this are small. But the problem is that it\u2019s possible, and governments are unpredictable, as is the stablecoin regulatory situation.

                    "content": "@Joao: Thanks for joining the conversation. If we can try to quantify this concern/question a little bit, that would be great. USDC, which is provably censorable plays an outsized role in DeFi, as you know. Given Circle\u2019s centralized nature, and close coordination with government bodies/regulators, it is apparent to many in DeFi, that having USDC part of an ecosystem with many permisionless parts is not ideal. I\u2019ve heard many (and you) say that the risk of USDC censoring smart contracts is remote, but with governments around the world seeking greater control and visibility into digital assets, and clearly being against \u201cunhosted\u201d wallets and financial activities without intermediaries, how is it possible to define the risk of broad-based censorship as remote? So my questions are:   Can you quantify what \u201cremote\u201d means? Is it a 1% chance, .05%? How would you define it? Remote, does not mean impossible. If the risk of censorship is unknown, then USDC is an existential threat to not only Maker but DeFi as a whole. IMO, convenience or the quest to capture institutional dollars, is not a good reason to abandon the ideals many of us actually believe in in DeFi: creating alternative financial ecosystems that are truly unique and with limited ties to TradFi. (We\u2019ve already seen the terrible consequences of CeFi\u2019s engagement with the crypto ecosystem.)   What legally/procedurally prevents Circle from being compelled to blacklist smart contracts such as Aave, Maker, Curve, etc. which have large amounts of  USDC within them at the behest of a government agency due to, for example, concerns terrorists are using these platforms or they allow sanctioned individuals to transact without scrutiny?   How is USDC\u2019s business model (providing large-scale access to US dollars) in a way that is permisionless and without KYC, congruent with attempts to obtain a banking license, and become more compliant with existing regulations/policies and recommendations related to this issue.   How does the ideal of decentralized finance, which fosters the free flow of financial assets globally without restriction align with allowing highly centralized organizations such as Circle (and its asset USDC) to have such a large influence on DeFi, given the centralization and censorship concerns associated with USDC?   Finally, and I\u2019m curious as to your take on this, what is the benefit of utilizing assets such as DAI, FRAX, etc. that are largely backed by USDC (or products, such as liquidity pools containing USDC, in the case of FRAX), versus simply using USDC? Aren\u2019t these products largely redundant given their large-scale reliance on USDC?   This is the crux of the conversation regarding Maker\u2019s continued reliance on USDC to maintain its peg. Why do we need a complex entity such as Maker when DAI is so reliant on USDC to maintain stability and is considering real-world assets (and even advocating for CBDCs)? One of DAI\u2019s key value propositions is that it is supposed to be censorship resistant and have the ability to be relatively sheltered from regulatory/government capture. If DAI does not have these features (given reliance on censorable USDC, seizable real-world assets and potentially CBDCs) many wonder why they should not just use USDC. From this perspective, the original product (USDC) is much better than a complicated, headless knock-off (DAI). Thanks for joining the conversation. ",

(We\u2019ve already seen the terrible consequences of CeFi\u2019s engagement with the crypto ecosystem.)   I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a model to quantify this risk. I do not agree that USDC as an existential threat to DeFi as whole though, quite the contrary. USDC has enabled DeFi to grow and reach its potential and we have all the intention to see that continuing to be the case.     davoice321:  What legally/procedurally prevents Circle from being compelled to blacklist smart contracts such as Aave, Maker, Curve, etc. which have large amounts of USDC within them at the behest of a government agency due to, for example, concerns terrorists are using these platforms or they allow sanctioned individuals to transact without scrutiny?   First on principles. There are two primary drivers for access denial (the more \u201ccorrect\u201d term for blacklisting): complying with OFAC sanctions and abiding to court orders. Sanctions compliance is driven by observing the blockchain addresses added to OFAC lists (these are public). These addresses are usually associated with individual or commercial entities, not with an entire financial institution. In other words, it\u2019s very unlikely to target an entire financial institution. If OFAC was ever to add some DeFi protocol address to a sanctions list, this wouldn\u2019t be so much of a USDC-related problem, this would be an existential problem for that protocol in terms of how it touches any other regulated exchanges, wallets, on-ramps, etc. kinds of products. I don\u2019t like to speculate, but that seems highly unlikely to me. On the court order side of things, that is a very high procedural bar and one where there\u2019s an ability to object just as part of any legal process. I would call particular attention to this piece of the Centre Access Denial policy:  To the extent an order requires access denial of an address with commingled funds of a platform (or similar) and Centre reasonably determines that such access denial presents a threat to USDC, Centre reserves all rights to object to the order in the course of its participation in the proceeding.  The reason that was added to the policy is precisely because wrongly utilizing the access denial mechanism towards a commingled structure like a DeFi protocol or a centralized exchange represents a threat to the very existence of USDC. As you can imagine, we aren\u2019t interested in destroying USDC\u2019s reputation and future potential ourselves. We have the right to object these situations where it\u2019s appropriate.     davoice321:  How is USDC\u2019s business model (providing large-scale access to US dollars) in a way that is permisionless and without KYC, congruent with attempts to obtain a banking license, and become more compliant with existing regulations/policies and recommendations related to this issue.   I do not see the incongruence you seem to suggest here. Circle already is compliant with existing regulations in this space, and we already partner with the best US domiciled banks for a product like USDC. The amount of diligence required in this space wouldn\u2019t allow these entities to work with us if they weren\u2019t comfortable with the existing construct. I will not speculate on how regulations could sway in the future - I honestly think nobody can.     davoice321:  How does the ideal of decentralized finance, which fosters the free flow of financial assets globally without restriction align with allowing highly centralized organizations such as Circle (and its asset USDC) to have such a large influence on DeFi, given the centralization and censorship concerns associated with USDC?   Our mission is very much aligned with the ideals of decentralized finance. We also believe in things like consumer protection, fighting financial crime, maintaining a safe environment for all ecosystem participants. I would like to believe those things are not in opposition. We strongly believe there is a role for an asset like USDC - with a sound reserve model, trusted and regulated construct, and highly liquid profile, to benefit decentralized finance. As I said previously, the growth of DeFi on Ethereum and other ecosystems has proven for that to be the case. But the ecosystem needs to define for itself what other constructs have to be in place. We\u2019ve always collaborated well with Maker and other participants who ambition to build a more decentralized model. We don\u2019t see those as in opposition necessarily.     davoice321:  Finally, and I\u2019m curious as to your take on this, what is the benefit of utilizing assets such as DAI, FRAX, etc. that are largely backed by USDC (or products, such as liquidity pools containing USDC, in the case of FRAX), versus simply using USDC? Aren\u2019t these products largely redundant given their large-scale reliance on USDC?   I don\u2019t believe they are redundant products. Assets like DAI, FRAX, etc. can typically innovate at a much faster pace when compared to USDC. They can iterate on UX and experiment with more flexibility. Sometimes I think about them as the \u201cfintech\u201d equivalent of tradfi. USDC can play a role in their growth and sustainability, and if they prove their concepts they should not have to depend on something like USDC. As always - and I\u2019m sure as many in the ecosystem can attest to, we maintain an open mind and are happy to collaborate in a trusted manner with projects that are truly valuable like the ones mentioned here. Thanks for having me. ",

Regarding this: Can you explain the objection process a bit more? For example, if USDC was mandated by court order to blacklist, say a Curve smart contract address, what specifically would the objection process enable Centre to do? For example, by requesting a stay of the court order or injunctive relief? Even if Centre objects to a court order to blacklist or sanction an address with co-mingled funds, that does not mean that Centre wouldn\u2019t be forced to comply at some point in the future, which again adds a significant cloud of uncertainty to any long-term reliance on USDC as an asset in DeFi. Would you agree that Centre is not in a position of great strength versus sovereigns\u2019 legal power?  What legal remedies would Centre have at its disposal if a court order to block a smart contract came through? Also, do you agree that the very need to rely on traditional legal structures to protect USDC\u2019s ability to engage in permissionless finance is in itself a significant risk to DeFi overall? Many of us in DeFi, distrust these structures (which have been proven to favor entrenched powers, and anti-democratic impulses/regimes) implicitly and having to rely on them to protect protocols and the continued functioning of DeFi (given USDC\u2019s entrenched role in the ecosystem) represents, in itself, and existential risk to DeFi?

This issue ultimately will be up to maker voters to decide, as to whether to continue to cozy up to the same system that brought us the great financial crisis or double down on the proven social and economic good that has been unleashed by maker, and the quest to build a new decentralized system that allows people to opt out from the madness I don\u2019t expect you as a representative of Centre and the centralizing force that is usdc, to agree with this thinking, but i hope maker voters are paying attention.

For whatever it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m really really new to Maker\u2026 I\u2019ve been aware of the project for years, but never took the opportunity to dive-in and really see what\u2019s going on \u2018under the hood\u2019 so to speak\u2026 Anyway, this is my first day \u2018peeking behind the curtain\u2019, and I\u2019ve literally spent roughly 10 of the last 12 hours reading through these forums and trying to get a sense of whatever the hell is going on around here\u2026 From the outside, there\u2019s not much to know about Maker/DAI\u2026 It\u2019s all a bit of a black-box, and there\u2019s not a lot of discussion about it, or how it works, going on outside of here\u2026 Not that I\u2019ve seen, anyway\u2026 But the one thing everyone \u201cknows\u201d about it is that DAI is the decentralized stablecoin, backed by code and a trusted trustless system of decentralized, grass-roots governance\u2026 Now I wander in and find\u2026 Honestly, kind of a mess, governance-wise, of what looks to me like in-fighting and opposing/dissenting opinions without a lot of codified and agreed-upon structure in place to herd all the cats to one logical common-ground\u2026 And also I\u2019m not sure what the whole \u201cparty system\u201d is that I\u2019ve read so much about today, but it already sounds less grass-roots than I\u2019m entirely comfortable with\u2026 and I could easily be wrong about any/all of that \u2013 I\u2019m still learning and wrapping my head around it all \u2013 but I do not think I\u2019m wrong about this: In this comment from @LongForWisdom you said that one of the options is to \u201c[make] DAI even less competitive when compared to centralized stablecoins\u201d In my mind, DAI\u2019s only competitive advantage is its wholly decentralized, trustless nature, and the more DAI that\u2019s backed by centralized assets of any kind, the more it becomes just those assets but with extra steps\u2026 And I know you also said that \u201cRealistically, most users do not care about decentralization primarily when evaluating stablecoins\u201d but, and I\u2019m going to be a little not-nice here\u2026 Most crypto users do not care about anything other than what amount of [insert their local fiat currency here] their portfolio is worth at any given moment\u2026 Because, to paraphrase Phillip Fisher, \u2018the crypto market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing\u2019\u2026 Now, in this comment from @ChrisBlec he says \u201cour mandate is to keep the peg as tight as we can while also keeping DAI censorship-resistant and incorruptible\u201d and I think I agree\u2026 To me, Maker and DAI ought to be the choice of the informed and discerning\u2026 Not those who chase insanely high yields with zero regard for the risks they\u2019re taking (I\u2019m looking at you, everyone who invested in Terra), but those who care about making principal-based decisions with their money, and who want their investment to be \u201ccensorship-resistant and incorruptible\u201d\u2026And, yes, that might come at the cost of \u201cscaling DAI\u201d to the masses\u2026 Well, so be it. And I\u2019m not saying that reaching the masses and scaling DAI adoption to \u201c500M\u201d (to again quote from LongForWisdom\u2019s comment I linked above) wouldn\u2019t be great, but we cannot do so at the expense of all else\u2026 Otherwise, we become the same as those I just spoke of, who are (to paraphrase myself) \u2018chasing higher numbers with zero regard of the risks they\u2019re taking\u2019\u2026 This has been a newcomer\u2019s two-cents\u2026 TL;DR or maybe a Postscript, IDK it\u2019s really late for me now and I\u2019m tired: I agree that Maker might have a centralized collateral problem, and some disagree but they haven\u2019t convinced me that it isn\u2019t a problem that the thing that started-out as a temporary solution to another problem then became standard practice for no reason I can see other than the genie was already out of the bottle and the wish it was granting (at what cost?) was the opportunity to grab marketshare and/or make Maker/DAI more powerful/influential in the market\u2026 Change my mind.

DAI established its status in the early days as the king of decentralized stablecoin. This means a lot for DAI. For example, inclusion of DAI in Curve 3pool is a big driver of the demand. I believe there are other scenarios DAI enjoys popularity because of this decentralized narrative and impression. Although more and more percentages of DAI are backed by USDC now, it takes time for the established advantage to fade away. Just as it may take more than four years for USDC to surpass USDT, it may take  some years for the industry to realize that there is no need to bother to use DAI. We\u2019ll see. ",

My research has brought me to several projects and I overall get this is a hard problem to solve. I am actively looking at things like DJED, SigmaUSD, DAI, and FRAX. I care most about decentralized money and thus decentralized stablecoins. I will say this bluntly. I am really surprised by the I don't give a fuck, so what if we used USDC attitude. This is actually scary and even CONSIDERING using a CBDC for DAI in the future makes me think this whole DAO should be deleted. As it stands my view is Goverment = Blackrock = Circle = Coinbase = USDC = CBDC. I view USDC as a CBDC and with the recent coinbase orderbook merge, it\u2019s the next step. I really cannot trust anything any employee or rep says that is at Centre/Circle/Coinbase about this as I view the whole entity as the adversary in this situation on principle. As long as there is a central entity that a government can tell to shut something off, or to freeze for any reason, that entity cannot actually be trusted in defi. If MakerDAO continues down this path, it is probably better that it de-pegs or does not exist as there will be no point to it and we might as well just go and bend over and use a CBDC\u2026 To me, it\u2019s an all-or-nothing situation. I agree with the OP in this situation. I am personally building Web3 technology and the idea that my project funds in stablecoin can get frozen on-chain is unacceptable. DAI having this by proxy on principle is unacceptable as well. Kudos. ",

My own goal was to simply use Maker\u2019s ability to mint DAI (i.e. provide liquidity) and the relatively stable value of USDC (or other stables) to provide some liquidity to manage the DAI price.   My own vision for DAI PEG price management was to use multiple PSMs with increasing DCs and widening price bands. Example 50M for a band of like 5bps, 500M for a band of like 25bps, 5B at 50bps etc.    The point here was for Maker itself to do what I was doing with my vault.  Sell DAI high and buy it back lower and I wanted Maker to be the DAI liquidity source because it could offer MORE liquidity than a vault could all the time. @rune ran with this idea, he realized the SAI to DAI bridge smart contracts could be used, but he wanted 0 fees and effectively infinite liquidity on the high side, where as the liquidity of stables on the low side would be limited by the amount of stables.    This creates a perfect DAI short situation in that DAI price can never exceed 1 (unless the DC is hit or the ES is triggered) and if stables exhaust (and this can happen in a single tx btw) then the DAI peg can and will drop below $1.  This is all fine and dandy until the PSMs exhaust and the DAI peg drops below $1. The arguments for this were that it would increase DAI adoption as the DAI price away from $1 hurt adopters and would help IV vaults (as well as real world) by providing them a way to convert large amounts of DAI to USD via USDC etc. The reason the DAI PEG was riding high (like 1.02 consistently) was due to Compound adding COMP rewards for depositors and borrowers creating an incentive for recursive mining effectively changing borrow rates on DAI to below 0, and deposit rates above the SF fee on Maker.   Maker vaults just couldn\u2019t supply the liquidity to keep the price below 1.02 and reducing fees pretty much did nothing.  I suggested we try to raise rates to make borrowing DAI more expensive but was overruled by the community (we never tried this even as a short term test). It took at least 6 months before @rune finally got his way and tin/tou was set to 0 and Maker never created multiple PSMs with multiple DCs and fee bands to create this liquidity provider of last resort on DAI goal to basically bracket the DAI PEG on the high and low side to no more than .5% which I would have considered very good for a decentralized stable.   Maker would also have earned profit doing this and it is likely we would not have 3.5B USDC in the protocol like today and even if we did - we\u2019d have earned something like 10-30M doing it which would have grew the surplus to help us in many ways. What is worse here is that USDP and GUSD were added and all of these have tin/tout set to 0.  Maker in effect has force locked the prices of DAI, USDC, USDP, and GUSD to $1 with the PSMs.  IF any of these have any problems Maker will end up being on the hook for any liabilities caused by any of these dropping off $1 for any reason.   Most have considered such events unlikely but when someone tends to lock market prices to $1, eliminate friction via fees, at some point there almost always is an issue that leads to losses and intense regulator scrutiny.   Time will tell. Lately there has been discussion about adding fees again.     Rethinking PSM-fees Proposal Ideas   TL;DR I have been in favor of 0-PSM-fees to provide a hardened peg since the introduction of the PSM. I am now convinced that this was a mistake as this policy removes the incentive for normal vault holders to arbitrage on depegging and by that just leaving the leverage-usecase for vault holders. As the appetite for leveraging crypto is not very strong, we have reached a stablecoin ratio of ~80% recently - turning DAI more and more into a USDC-wrapper.   Rethinking PSM-fees For those not having\u2026     As I argued in the past tin/tout to 0 basically kills exchange markets elsewhere.  Example uniswap .01 and .05 via GUNI would earn more fees if the current PSM was opened up.  Wouldn\u2019t it be better for Maker to open up a trading gap so GUNI holders potentially earn more return encouraging more liquidity.    My goals are always to test solutions that encourage decentralized players to come forward with liquidity rather than the reverse and Maker hasn\u2019t even moved to do a basic test of a change (by putting tin/tout to 5bps)  to see how the Uniswap .01, .05 v3 earnings and liquidity would change in response (same with curve btw) and whether this would finally allow for USDC to start migrating away from the PSM. This is my biggest beef with Maker btw in that it never does even a test change in system parameters to gauge market response.   Perturbation theory and practice not just in physics is extremely important way to learn about and determine matrix elements between correlated system parameters, this is also true of financial systems.
