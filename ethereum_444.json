He called me up and asked how Ethereum could help with Zimbabwe\u2019s current financial situation. They just reverted their monetary policy back to a part of what drove the earlier inflation spiral. People are only allowed to withdraw 30.00 dollars a day from their bank accounts. They have tried to adopt cash, but it is difficult to get enough cash in the system to support it. There has to be something Ethereum can do. Anyone know of projects addressing adoption in countries like this? Layer two solutions? Can dai be used? What are some obstacles and ways we can overcome them when looking at a situation like this? This is a critical time for them and they are at the point of necessity to adopt something. Lets be there for them. I am going to lunch with him tomorrow to discuss. Anyone in Berlin is welcome to join as well. Cheers, James ",

Maybe paper wallets with small amounts of DAI could be printed (1, 2, 5, 10 denominations) and someone could set up some meta transaction nodes with a bit of ether that could do simple transfer transactions from the accounts. People could trade the paper freely for goods and cash, and redeem the DAI if they need it using the nodes. I mean, how different is a digital dollar backed piece of paper from a real dollar? It might get confiscated, but it would help out in the short term if they\u2019re restricting the dollar. ",
