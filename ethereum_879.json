I think most people have come agreement that:  We want some form of net gas metering before state rent because many people have asked, and We want to apply it without account versioning so that older contracts can take advantage of it.    The only remaining thing I think is the documentation issue \u2013 whether we need to create a new EIP or using existing EIPs and mark it in hard fork meta EIP is enough. This is a rather minor issue, and I just have really strong opinion that we should not create new EIPs for this. My argument hasn\u2019t changed: There\u2019s no spec change in either EIP-1283 or EIP-1706. Creating new EIPs will be direct copying, and will most likely create confusions. We should trace features enabling/disabling via hard fork meta EIPs, and specification EIPs like 1283/1706 should only care about the actual specifications. I remember we nearly reached some form of agreement on this in a previous Gitter discussions, but there were several new positions popping up in the last ACD meeting.  I propose we have an AMA some day next week, before the next AllCoreDevs (July 15-18th) at 14:00 UTC (AllCoreDevs time) to go over these issues. If people have concerns and cannot make the AMA time, they can add them to the thread in advance. Here is a poll to decide on the date:     Mon July 15 Tue July 16 Wed July 17 Thu July 18     0 voters     ",

I just want to voice my support for EIP-1283 / 1706 and encourage finalizing the decision to add it to Istanbul soon since it significantly impacts ongoing dapp designs. I agree with both:  Creating new EIPs will be direct copying, and will most likely create confusions.  and  We should trace features enabling/disabling via hard fork meta EIPs, and specification EIPs like 1283/1706 should only care about the actual specifications.  I know there has been some talk of versioning. Personally, I come down strongly on the side of gas metering applying retroactively to all contracts. ",
