                    "content": " MIP86: CoinShares Active Treasury Management  Preamble MIP#: 86 Title: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards Author(s): @CoinSharesCo Contributors: @jmmognetti Tags: PSM Type: General Status: Rejected Date Proposed: 2022-09-13 Date Ratified: Dependencies: MIP13c3-SP12 Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip86-coinshares-usdc-institutional-rewards/17900 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmXpRmAP   Sentence Summary In MIP86 CoinShares proposes a portfolio management strategy for a portion of MakerDAO\u2019s PSM following the RWA pivot made by the community. CoinShares could deploy this investment strategy for capital ranging from $100 million to $500 million. It is important to ignore the amount of money invested for the vote, we believe that this should be decided and voted on at a later stage by the community. We would propose that the exact amount of the program (100m-500m) will be sized in accordance with MakerDao\u2019s ALM strategy prior to execution of this MIP through a signal request that factors in the optimal amount of the program based on MakerDAO\u2019s ALM strategy at the time we are ready for execution.  Paragraph Summary Under MIP86, a portion (from $100M to $500M) of the PSM\u2019s USDCs will be managed by CoinShares, which will invest on behalf of MakerDAO the funds in various traditional financial assets according to MIP13c3-SP12 3. CoinShares aims to provide a variable APY above the SOFR interest rate (3.01% as of October 26, 2022) in the community\u2019s preferred currency (DAI, USDC, USD\u2026) to MakerDAO and that can be withdrawn on-chain. This MIP describes the architecture of the project.  Motivation This MIP is based on the ratified Declaration of Intent to Invest in Short-Term Bonds (MIP13c3-SP12 3) whereby MakerDAO notes that approximately 60% of MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet is in a stablecoin that does not provide revenue while maintaining counterparty risk on Circle. MIP13c3-SP12 3 details high standards that are consistent with CoinShares\u2019 well-established position in the institutional space (partnering up with top financial institutions like Nomura and Invesco, or a significant investor in one of the most advanced and innovative trading Swiss Banks based in Geneva and Zurich: FlowBank) as well as offering a mature legal and custody structure that allows secure access to many traditional financial assets. Our motivation is reinforced by the fact that since 2022, traditional financial assets have offered a higher APY than DeFi on the USD, which should create an innovative collaboration between, for example, MakerDAO and CoinShares, to generate interest on MakerDAO\u2019s balance sheet. MakerDAO has paved the way for the institutionalisation of DeFi through the professionalism of its teams and the governance of the DAO and above all by promoting collaboration with financial institutions through the RWA program. CoinShares, as a historical player in the digital asset industry and an asset manager since 1998 (formerly Global Advisors), is probably one of the most capable financial institutions to collaborate with DAOs by playing this bridging role between TradFi and DeFi. CoinShares has also developed strong relationships with DeFi protocols. As one of the most DeFi-friendly financial institutions, it is only a natural step for us to offer our services to MakerDAO, the institutional-grade DeFi protocol by excellence.

MIP86c10: What makes us different from the other MIPs to manage MakerDAO\u2019s PSM? It\u2019s a summary of the benefits of our proposal compared to the other recent MIPs made to the MakerDAO community.  Specification  MIP86c1: Presentation of CoinShares CoinShares is a leading full-service digital asset investment and trading group that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment management, trading, securities, and consumer products to a wide array of clients that includes corporations, financial institutions, and individuals. Pivoting towards crypto in 2013, the firm is headquartered in Jersey, with offices in London, Paris, and New York. CoinShares is regulated in Jersey by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, in France by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, and in the US by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. CoinShares is publicly listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the ticker CS and the OTCQX under the ticker CNSRF and preparing for an up-listing to the Nasdaq Sweden Main Market by the end of the year. CoinShares is Europe\u2019s largest and leading digital asset investment and trading group, managing billions of assets on behalf of a global client base. Our mission is to expand investment into digital assets with our trusted, regulated, best-in-class product suite that provides investors with trust and transparency when accessing cryptocurrencies. In 2018, CoinShares built \u2014 along with Nomura and Ledger \u2014 Komainu, one of the leading European institutional-grade digital asset custodians. Komainu is leveraging Ledger Enterprise Solutions to custody digital assets. Komainu was established to fill a gap in the marketplace and provide institutions with a secure and compliant custody service for investment in digital assets. Launched in June 2020, Komainu currently holds several billions of dollars in assets under custody from asset managers, financial institutions, corporations, governments, and agencies.  MIP86c2: The Opportunity The macro backdrop remains challenging. However, the bond market has already priced in much of this news and possibly too much. As a result, we are currently at some of the widest levels we have seen in a decade. This is even though financial issuers remain in a strong position, as reflected by their capital and excess capital. Moreover, asset quality remains solid as non-performing loan ratios of European banks are currently extremely low at 1.8%. Despite the negative performance of significant bond markets year-to-date, our outlook is positive for the next 24 months as credit quality, especially within the solution we have constructed, remains strong. This ensures visibility of the path to high income with yields often double-digit. For example, Swiss Re 4% has a yield to the next call in 2024 of c.13%; the bond is A-rated, while the parent company is rated AA- (very strong). Overall, the strategy portfolio has a yield-to-maturity of 6.77%, utilising national champions that are imperative to their national economies, for example, Bank of America is 6.25% in 2024, which is trading at 97.76%, meaning that as the bond matures at par (100%), it will appreciate 2.16% in capital and an additional 12.5% in coupon payments (2023 and 2024) creating a positive cash flow of 14.6% over the next two years. This represents an exceptional opportunity to deploy capital into such names. We blend this approach by investing in government-related issuers (36% of the portfolio) that typically avoid \u2018hot money\u2019 flows and are less volatile than traditional government bonds. For example, we prefer the 'AA-rated\u2019 UAE government-backed Mubadala Investment Company (MDGH). The UAE is a wealthy nation with little external debt and retains a net foreign asset position of c. 250%. Net Foreign Assets (NFA) refer to the net amount of foreign assets a country owns or the total value of a country\u2019s foreign assets minus the total value of assets within a country that foreigners own. They indicate whether a country is a net creditor or a net debtor. We prefer creditor nations. Using the same method as previously stated, the MDGH 2.5% 2024 provides investors with the potential to achieve a return of 10% over the next two years. The strategy maintains a low duration of just over a year, meaning it actively manages interest rate risk. Indeed many of the instruments in the strategy can actively benefit as rates rise; we currently have c.50% exposure to floating and variable rate notes; these reset to the underlying reference rate and the coupon is adjusted to reflect any increase in rates. An excellent example is A-rated HSBC 2024; the bond currently has a floating coupon of 5.98%. If rates continue to rise, then the coupon will increase. Our approach reduces risk as we invest c. 50% in fixed-rate bonds, meaning they will \u2018pull-to-par\u2019 over the coming couple of years; these issues are trading at heavy discounts and will benefit holders as they mature. At the same time, the remaining element is invested in issuers that will benefit from higher rates. If the prospects of rate hikes diminish, we reallocate capital to bonds that reflect the prevailing conditions of the market. Global authorities are on a tightrope. They need to signal they are willing to fight inflation with higher rates, but at the same time, they need to protect households and businesses as such significant rises from this juncture are somewhat muted. This creates a great opportunity for MakerDAO as a bond investor.  MIP86c3: Investment Program  Benchmark The investment objective is to generate income and capital growth over the short term by investing primarily in quality corporate bonds and to yield an annual return in excess of the SOFR, capitalised daily over the investment period. The SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is a dynamic reference rate for the US dollar (USD) interbank market. It is calculated by the New York Federal Reserve.  1417\u00d71000 64.9 KB  Source: Bloomberg, as of October 18, 2022  Objective To capture a high and steady income by investing in bonds from strong issuers The primary aim is to preserve capital whilst providing returns that are 2.25% in excess of SOFR on a rolling 36-month basis Currently, the positive yield differential is 3.79%.  Philosophy A predominately buy-and-hold and bottom-up driven investment approach that is actively managed through tactical tilts. Invest in national champions and government-backed issuers  Solution The portfolio recognises and attempts to capture the current dislocation in global bond markets. The portfolio actively seeks out highly creditworthy bonds with limited interest rate sensitivity (low duration) that are trading below par (91% of the portfolio). This approach enables the portfolio to benefit from \u2018pull to par\u2019 as it invests in government-backed issuers or national champions representing little credit risk over the next 36 months. The salient features of the portfolio are as follows:  700\u00d769 16.4 KB  Given the dislocation in bond markets, the net cash flow is a useful tool to help assess what your client can expect to receive over the two years. Net cash flow is the collection of income and net proceeds of bonds purchased at discounted less any management fees.  Approach Over the course of 2022, the macroeconomic climate has been very challenging. This challenging outlook has already been priced into many bonds which have sold off this year. We are of the view that the damage has been done and there is little downside remaining especially with assets that are due to mature or be called in the next couple of years. The bond market is currently offering compelling opportunities. We feel that these can be exploited to the benefit of the community using a low-risk approach. The portfolio invests in highly creditworthy issuers from national champions and government-backed issuers. We actively seek out dislocations in the bond market to provide attractive total returns from income and capital. In addition, we invest in a range of instruments across the bond market to protect and grow capital in a reasonably simple way. Fixed-rate bonds represent c.50% of the portfolio. We actively seek out names that are trading below par or that have an attractive coupon, thus providing a solid income for the next couple of years. All of the fixed-rate bonds are trading below par, an average of 94.5thus providing the opportunity for capital appreciation over two years or more. Floating and variable rate bonds represent c. 50% of the portfolio; their coupons reset quarterly to reflect changes in LIBOR /SOFR coupled with a spread, e.g. +0.2%. This protects the portfolio in the event of further increases in interest rates. Rather than hold cash deposits, floating rate notes offer a secure way of benefiting from increasing rates.  Process Research-intensive investment approach to select issuers, debt securities, construct the portfolio, and manage risks. Investment policy  The portfolio recognises and attempts to capture the current dislocation in global bond markets. The portfolio actively seeks out highly credit-worthy bonds with limited interest rate sensitivity trading below par. Strong credit quality: Minimum of 70% of issuers are Investment Grade rated. Low sensitivity to interest rates: More than 50% of securities will be fixed-to-floaters & floating-rate-notes. Credit risk: Government-backed names reduce credit risk. Financial debt instruments will be included to benefit from higher interest rates. Liquidity is a key consideration for this solution although this isn\u2019t cash; we are aiming to provide similar core characteristics. One of them is the ability to add funds or withdraw them easily and quickly. Withdrawals can be made within 7 working days under normal market conditions. We are able to enable this as we focus only on bonds with large issue sizes with high demand and deep markets that are widely covered by brokers. The acquisition or disposal of bonds or debt securities is based on an analysis of the issuer\u2019s credit risk.  Constraints Portfolio construction proposed constraints are aligned with typical institutional portfolio allocation:  Weighting range between 0.75 and 3%. No more than 5% to a single issue (corporate). No more than 5% of any outstanding issue (fairly unlikely). Government-backed debt you can have up to 10% per issue (we didn\u2019t in the case of our portfolio use such a high concentration). Average rating must be at least \u2018A\u2019. Average duration no more than 3 years (our portfolio is currently 1.5%). No more than 50% to one sector (unless government).  Example portfolio - CoinShares Alpha Liquidity  754\u00d7455 48.2 KB  Portfolio construction focused on gradual allocation to build Trust and Transparency  Performance of the CoinShares Alpha Liquidity Strategy since 2014   1068\u00d7500 23.5 KB   Fees   932\u00d7519 36.7 KB  It is important for CoinShares to be aligned with the community. That\u2019s why we offer performance-based compensation only. While maintaining the quality of the portfolio and keeping the risk/return ratio consistent with the management objective, CoinShares will receive 66% of the portfolio\u2019s outperformance against its benchmark, and 50% of the income received by CoinShares will then be used to purchase the MKR token, which CoinShares will hold for at least 2 years from the date of purchase in a totally transparent way and will be used so as CoinShares can be involved in the stewardship of the protocol along with the other delegates.  Why this compensation model?  CoinShares wants to align with Maker\u2019s interests and make a long-term commitment to governance, both for the operation\u2019s success and for Maker\u2019s potential to be a pioneer in the collaboration between DeFi and TradFi. You can see the theoretical results of the investment in the shared document CoinShares MIP86 - Interests model. You can play with the document if you wish.   MIP86c4: Terms for Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity We propose to implement a set of smart contracts accessible only by authorised persons at MakerDAO, which will simplify the process and eliminate possible intermediaries and fees between CoinShares and MakerDAO. This set of smart contracts will be used to perform fund transfers between MakerDAO and CoinShares, as well as transfer the interest to MakerDAO. The smart contract architecture is currently being developed and tested. Later, it will be shared with the community and audited. With regard to the transfer of interests, CoinShares will automatically convert the proceeds of its management (100% up to SOFR and 33% above SOFR) into stablecoins of MakerDAO\u2019s choice, which will be deposited in the smart contract. This smart contract will be executable by MakerDAO, which will be able to recover the necessary amounts on demand. Here is our summary of the implementation of the different steps, from the USDC PSM vault to the investment by CoinShares.  849\u00d7371 68.2 KB   MIP86c5: Transparency and Monitoring Although originally from the traditional financial industry, CoinShares decided in 2013 to devote fully to digital assets because those new protocols allow for unparalleled transparency in transactions, contracts, and operation of protocols. With this in mind, CoinShares has partnered with Armanino LLP to provide investors with real-time transparency of CoinShares\u2019 XBT Provider assets under management, and CoinShares Digital Asset Securities through Trust Explorer Real Time Asset 1. We want to be able to report back to the MakerDAO community in real-time through a similar setup by giving in real-time the value of assets invested. In addition, similar to what we provide to our investors, we propose to provide the community with a quarterly report on the status of the volume of assets managed by CoinShares. Finally, because we are convinced that regular communication is the key to such a partnership, we suggest creating a dedicated channel where you can regularly ask questions to our Asset Management team.  MIP86c6: Proposed Legal Structure  Low intermediation of service and structuring  Unlike other proposals and previous programmes, we propose to concentrate nearly every service at CoinShares, MakerDAO\u2019s direct counterparty, with the exception of asset custody, which must be external. We believe that MakerDAO\u2019s RWA strategy should not be at the expense of disintermediation driven by the digital asset revolution. It seems to us that our proposal is the only one that presents a certain level of disintermediation.  Creation of a dedicated smart contract to limit the use of intermediaries  This desire for disintermediation and a direct relationship between the Community and CoinShares is also reflected in the establishment of a smart contract serving as a receptacle for funds and the ability for MakerDAO to recover its on-chain funds.  Bankruptcy remote scheme  MakerDAO Assets will be segregated from CoinShares\u2019 proprietary account in a Sub-Account held at our Custodian Komainu and/or at one of our traditional prime brokers in a way to isolate financial risk (SPV or segregated account).  Fiat/Stablecoin conversion  All conversions from fiat to stablecoins and USDC stablecoins to fiat will be ensured by CoinShares Capital Markets (Jersey) Limited following our Best Execution Policy.  1566\u00d7638 128 KB   MIP86c7: Custody Komainu as a joint venture between CoinShares, Nomura, and Ledger is an excellent custodian using military-grade security. Komainu is leveraging Ledger Vault which is the most secure solution in the industry thanks to hardware security. Ledger Vault mixes the most advanced security features through its Personal Security Device (a Ledger Nano X upgrade), a dedicated Hardware Security Module, and Ledger proprietary software. Ledger Vault is SOC 2 Type 2 certified. MakerDAO Governance will vote and approve CoinShares with custody provided by Komainu Jersey Limited regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission as a Custodian under Fund Service Business and registered as Virtual Asset Service Provider under schedule 2. Komainu\u2019s principal shareholder is Nomura Holdings International, followed by Ledger, CoinShares, Alan Howard, Galaxy Digital, and Nomura Research Institute. Komainu has been audited by government bodies such as the UK NPCC Cybercrime Program. With regards to the custody and securities held on behalf of MakerDAO, they will be under the custody of Tier 1 Financial Services Institutions.  MIP86c8: Internal Organisation CoinShares aims to be a bridge between TradFi, CeFi, and DeFi.This is where our proposal differs fundamentally from the other ones. We want to participate in Maker\u2019s asset exposure strategies to Real World Assets while trying to keep as much as possible on-chain infrastructure. The investment will be carried out by the CoinShares team and infrastructure that benefit from experienced traders & portfolio managers bringing knowledge from traditional finance. Our Fixed Income strategist who would oversee MakerDAO\u2019s assets currently oversees $450M (outside CoinShares - he is in the process of joining the team full-time to help us accelerate our in-house treasury management solutions. His contribution to our treasury management has been significant, spread over several fixed-income strategies. He has been an expert in fixed income for 20 years with particular expertise in macroeconomics, bonds, and alternatives. The core business activities are built on our proprietary trading platform, Galata, built by the Capital Markets team. Galata acts as an Operating System for the whole company. Galata is a bridge between traditional finance and decentralised finance. It enables the proper execution of orders, our investment strategies, and our product distribution. It links different exchange platforms and services that are today crucial to the success of our business.  The current DeFi infrastructure does not allow strong bridges between DeFi and TradFi, but CoinShares remains open to discussions in this regard.  MIP86c9: Legal Structure & Collateral Onboarding  Legal Structure  CoinShares will put in place a legal trust structure, and governance framework, with the necessary contractual relationships and legal protections to protect the interests of MakerDAO and CoinShares. CoinShares has an experienced team that will be able to provide direct discussion with MakerDAO relevant Core Units. This includes, but is not limited to:   The establishment of an Investment Management Agreement (\u201cIMA\u201d) highlighting CoinShares\u2019 fiduciary duty to manage the portfolio in the primary interest of MakerDAO. The IMA will include restrictions to ensure that the portfolio is managed in accordance with the MIP and within a framework that mitigates risk.   No ability by third parties to the IMA to access the funds or change the terms of the legal structure;   No ability for third parties to the IMA to block the ability of MakerDAO to make decisions or modify the structure;   There must be no apparent weak links or edge cases that allow funds to get misappropriated or stuck;   The correct segregation of the portfolio of CoinShares\u2019 balance sheet assets;   MakerDAO will have the ability to trigger subscriptions and redemptions through a smart contract;   This above-established structure will set up a relationship with CoinShares Capital Markets (Jersey) Ltd which is a regulated crypto broker, and a dedicated Ethereum address (multi-signature) will be used to interact with the deployed smart contract in relation with MIP86c4.   Collateral Onboarding: Assessments   As part of our commitment to full transparency and cooperation with the MarkerDAO Community and Cores Units, CoinShares will create a dedicated page (that could be named \u201cMIP86: Documentation & Assessments Repository\u201d) on the MakerDAO Forum (\u201cCollateral Onboarding\u201d section) which will contain the Risk, Compliance and Legal assessments as well as the Legal and Regulatory documentation on CoinShares and the MIP86. Our teams will fully cooperate and provide MarkerDAO community members with all the necessary information to carry out their own independent assessments on the followings topics:  Legal Assessment Counterparties Assessment Compliance Assessment Technical Assessment  CoinShares is committed to engaging all relevant internal teams to enable due diligence by the Community and Core Units to be completed and this Active Treasury Management program to be effectively deployed within a very short timeframe while maintaining the trust and control of the MakerDAO community members.  Collateral Onboarding: Legal & Governance Verification  At least one community member, with legal credentials, must, through a public forum post, validated by at least one Facilitator, verify the legal and governance structure appropriateness for holding a large amount of low-risk real-world asset collateral for Maker, actively managed by CoinShares.  Collateral Onboarding: Investment Program Verification  The Strategic Finance Core Unit facilitator/member must, also through a public forum post, verify, with regard to MIP86c3: Investment Program, that the tools put in place by CoinShares ensure solid guarantees on low-risk real assets and the quality of the management service, actively managed by CoinShares for MakerDAO As stated in the MIP, CoinShares is available to the MakerDAO teams and the community to build and provide relevant and timely portfolio data.  Collateral Onboarding: Technical Verification  The Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit facilitator must, again through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the technical appropriateness in relation to MIP86c5. A test transaction will take place to ensure the receiving address is correct prior to any release of funds. If the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit facilitator is not satisfied with the security of the assets transfer, the deal would be halted until these concerns were rectified.  MIP86c10: What makes us different from the other MIPs to manage MakerDAO\u2019s PSM? Discretionary, Independent, Active & Professional portfolio management Discretionary: Unlike other proposals and previous programmes, CoinShares will be the manager of the PSM/MakerDAO AND the entity in charge of managing the portfolio. Independent: The portfolio management will be discretionary in the sense that the management will not use (i) intermediaries or (ii) third-party delegates to manage the portfolio, and this is the only proposal ever presented at MakerDAO. Active: Unlike other proposals and previous programmes, our proposition is based on active portfolio management in order to provide a (i) personalised service (ii) free from the passive management of ETFs without added value. Professional: CoinShares is the most regulated group in the crypto ecosystem with :  Its holding company listed on Nasdaq First North Growth Market. Two of its entities licensed as regulated Asset Management Companies (in Jersey by the JFSC & in France by the AMF). One entity registered as Digital Asset Services Providers (in Jersey by the JFSC) and one in the process of registration (France). One Appointed Representative (United Kingdom) entity. Products listed on the main European marketplaces (SIX, Xetra, Euronext, etc.).  Licences that can be obtained on request, especially on the European continent, reflect human, technological and control resources that are evaluated and monitored by regulators. Low intermediation of service and structuring: Unlike other proposals and previous programmes, we propose to concentrate nearly every service at CoinShares, MakerDAO\u2019s direct counterparty, with the exception of asset custody, which must be external. We believe that MakerDAO\u2019s RWA strategy should not be at the expense of disintermediation driven by the digital asset revolution. It seems to us that our proposal is the only one that presents a certain level of disintermediation. CoinShares will be your service provider, your counterpart, and your portfolio manager. It differentiates us from other highly intermediated and outsourced MIPs and seems, to us, to be a good compromise between the use of RWAs and the need to remain decentralised. Finally, CoinShares has a decade of experience in regulatory and legal issues when it comes to financial and crypto projects. We created the first regulated Bitcoin fund, and we assist many foundations in their regulatory issues. Therefore, our experienced legal team is ready to assist MakerDAO with the legal set-up and the establishment of the corporate structure. We are well aware of the difficulties that DAOs or Foundations have in organising themselves and setting up projects of this magnitude. CoinShares is ready to help you, acting as an advisor to the Core Strategic Unit. You are receiving more and more MIPs and it is imperative that you put in place proper due diligence. We would be delighted to assist you in this regard, in the most neutral way possible, of course. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.

CoinShares wants to align with Maker\u2019s interests and make a long-term commitment to governance, both for the success of the operation and for Maker\u2019s potential to be a pioneer in the collaboration between DeFi and TradFi. Based on these statements, our projections below would generate, at the end of 2025:  36,151,111$ to MakerDAO 4,611,111$ to CoinShares 6,495 MKR tokens (worth 4,611,111$ as of 09/13/22) to CoinShares    Thank you for putting together this MIP and welcome to the MakerDAO community. I must say, it provides a lot more information compared to MIP81 \u201cCoinbase Institutional Rewards\u201d   With regards to the above  example of the possible Portfolio Returns \u2014 I think you need to make it more clear that MakerDAO gets 100% of the SOFR (currently 2.28%) and then you divide the outer-performance hypothesis of 100 basis points by 1/3, 1/3, and 1/3. Is that right, or am I misunderstanding the \u201cPortfolio Estimated Returns Example\u201d?     CoinSharesCo:  The investment will allow for being unwound within seven (7) business hours under normal market circumstances (following a MakerDAO executive vote).   Is it 7 hours because you price to Market/calculate NAV at Market close? Trying to understand why 7 hours and not 2 (as an example). And last but not least you\u2019re going to liquidate USDC and acquire short-term bonds? And then if need be liquidate those bonds and return the proceeds/original funds in DAI, USDC, stakedETH, etc. (as examples) back to MakerDAO. ",

MIP86 would be in the bottom bucket as probably not good as a first or second line of defense of the peg, but more to provide strong revenues.

My question relates to the following (emphasis added):     CoinSharesCo:  The portfolio\u2019s outperformance (hypothetical and non-binding) against SOFR capitalised daily over the investment period, will be divided as follows: 1/3 for Maker, 1/3 for CoinShares, and the last 1/3 for CoinShares to acquire Maker tokens exclusively.   Could I request some more detail on this outperformance distribution:  By \u201cexclusive\u201d, I assume you mean that that proportion (1/3) of portfolio outperformance will be used exclusively to acquire Maker tokens, rather than that CoinShares gets some kind of exclusive right to acquire MKR? The language is a little unclear, so wanted to check. The latter reading would be unworkable. What do you propose specifically as the acquisition process for this MKR, and who is it being acquired from? Alternatively, is this provision instead intended to be a commitment to use those outperformance funds to market buy MKR?  ",

                    "content": "Dear MakerDAO community, thank you for your insightful comments and questions, please find below our weekly review of your questions. \u2013     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you for putting together this MIP and welcome to the MakerDAO community. I must say, it provides a lot more information compared to MIP81 \u201cCoinbase Institutional Rewards\u201d    With regards to the above  example of the possible Portfolio Returns \u2014 I think you need to make it more clear that MakerDAO gets 100% of the SOFR (currently 2.28%) and then you divide the outer-performance hypothesis of 100 basis points by 1/3, 1/3, and 1/3. Is that right, or am I misund\u2026      SOFR out-performance This is the correct assumption. We\u2019ve edited our proposal to make it clear. Unwinding of investment We edited our post. We meant 7 business \u201cdays\u201d not 7 business \u201chours\u201d. It is a conservative assumption to liquidate the portfolio in normal market and liquidity periods in order to protect the DAO\u2019s assets. USDC conversion At first, we will swap MakerDAO\u2019s USDC for USD or any other FIAT currency we deem appropriate in order to implement the investment policy. Any income from the holding of assets (e.g. coupons) will be in FIAT currency. The which will then be converted into USDC and sent back to MakerDAO.  \u2013     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       I was wondering the same thing and figured it might have something to do with the typical 7 hour work day but in this space that just might not be applicable.  I would also like to know what we mean by \u201cnormal market conditions\u201d and whether the \u201cmarket\u201d is the crypto market or something else.      There is no regulatory definition or even regulators\u2019 doctrine on the notion of \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d market conditions. It is up to each asset manager, as part of its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its clients at all times, to define the risk management framework for identifying the different risk and liquidity regimes of the portfolios under management. To this end, CoinShares has a Risk Management Policy that addresses the monitoring of liquidity of assets, including bonds. Without being able to divulge too much about the details of this liquidity risk monitoring system, the following is an outline of the system:  Large issue size: Simply speaking the larger the issue the more liquid a bond is likely to be meaning there is a larger, deeper, broader market and the more easily tradable it is. Bloomberg pricing service (BVAL) score: Drawing on real-time observations from an array of contributors Bloomberg Liquidity Assessment (LQA) score: LQA leverages Bloomberg\u2019s robust financial data sets to provide data-driven quantitative evaluation of market liquidity.  \u2013     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       The \u201cpay ~0.6% of your total equity aka at current prices ~12% of expected profits for parking the assets at SOFR\u201d part lost me.      We don\u2019t think you should take CoinShares\u2019 valuation as a point of reference. Our income is much more interesting. In 2021 CoinShares\u2019 total comprehensive income was \u00a3113,443,438. According to our assumptions (1% of over performance of SOFR) the first year CoinShares will earn $2.5M, meaning approximately 2% of 2021 income. \u2013     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC   @CoinSharesCo:  How will you respond if OFAC sanctioned parties are found to be be using DAI, and Maker is unable to do anything about it because DAI cannot be blacklisted or censored?  What will you do if that happens?  This is a serious question so please give it a serious answer.      CoinShares will be the manager to whom the management of part of the assets will be delegated. CoinShares, as a regulated group, will have to verify the legal and non-risky origin of the USDC that will be entrusted to the management. This initial due diligence will be performed by both Komainu, as the custodian, and CoinShares, as the investment manager with first-class \u201cKnow Your Transactions\u201d tools. Beyond this mandatory due diligence, CoinShares does not consider itself to be at risk with respect to the DAI and the potential uses to which it may be put. In no case shall the lawful collateral (of an asset) be incriminated by the asset it collateralises, unless the initial collusion of the parties is proven. \u2013    MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Custodying the USDC that\u2019s backing the DAI that\u2019s being used to violate sanctions could be construed as enabling the violation.      In no case shall the lawful collateral (of an asset be incriminated by the asset it collateralises, unless the initial collusion of the parties is proven. \u2013     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       excellent proposal, superior to Coinbase\u2019s. Nontheless i have questions:   You are a regulated entity, are your audited financial statements available to us? This a request from all lenders part and parcel for KYC and risk assessment. Are you a going concern? SO your strategy is arbitrage on safe investments such as Tbonds, any assurance the investment strategy will not go awry?  Thanks.      Regulation As you all know, CoinShares is a public company listed in Nasdaq First North Growth Market (ticket : CS) .Therefore, everything is public on our Investor Relations website :   Investor Relations Annual Reports \u2014 CoinShares September 2022 - BTIG CoinShares Equity Research  Management team CoinShares was formerly Global Advisors International which was founded in 1999. With a 16 year track record of managing client funds as a regulated investment manager originally in the commodity markets. Global Advisors became CoinShares in 2013. Since 2013, CoinShares has offered digital asset exposure and undertaken digital asset trading activities. Over the course of the past eight years, the Company has grown to become Europe\u2019s largest full-service digital asset investment and trading group, launched a range of products and funds referencing digital assets, and provided exposure to digital assets to a global investor base.   Investment Strategy CoinShares has put in place, through the experience of its teams and its various regulated statutes, an organisation and a risk management system that allows it to stand before you confident in its ability to deliver the management objective on behalf of MakerDAO. However, we would like to remind you that investment and portfolio management always involves a certain number of risks, including the risk of capital loss. Any person or entity that would be able to promote the absence of a problem or risk should not otherwise be trusted blindly. Investing always involves risk, it is a matter of identifying and quantifying the risk one is prepared to take  \u2013    MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       CoinShares is a tenth the size of Coinbase in valuation.  Similar questions on what happens in bankruptcy should be addressed.  However, they seem to operate pretty efficiently and has had positive cash flows with only an exception last quarter due to Terra resulting in a small loss.  Being able to stay profitable even through huge cuts in crypto prices makes me more confident that bankruptcy risks are also low here.      The planned structuring will aim to protect against any risk of bankruptcy and continuity of the assets entrusted by MarkerDAO. We are considering a bankruptcy-remote structuring for the assets entrusted by MarkerDAO by segregating these assets from CoinShares. This has been a long-standing practice of CoinShares in connection with the management of the XBT Provider and CoinShares Physical ETPs. The technical and legal details of this segregation will be discussed with MakerDAO. \u2013    MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thanks for this proposal @CoinSharesCo, appreciate the time and effort put in. My question relates to the following (emphasis added):   Could I request some more detail on this outperformance distribution:   By \u201cexclusive\u201d, I assume you mean that that proportion (1/3) of portfolio outperformance will be used exclusively to acquire Maker tokens, rather than that CoinShares gets some kind of exclusive right to acquire MKR? The language is a little unclear, so wanted to check. The latter reading wo\u2026       Outperformance 100% of the SOFR annualised performance will be distributed to MakerDAO in USDC. In case of outperformance: \u2153 of this outperformance will be distributed to MakerDAO in USDC; \u2153 of this outperformance will be distributed to CoinShares in USDC who may make free use of it; \u2153 of this outperformance will be distributed to CoinShares in USDC to acquire $MKR tokens.   MKR Acquisition MKR token will directly acquire from liquid markets (centralised and decentralised exchanges). The provision is indeed a commitment to market-buy MKR.   \u2013    MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Its difficult to compare given that the proposals have different duration, liquidity, investments and counterparty risks. Both investment programs are beneficial to Maker.      Indeed, the two proposals cannot and should not be fully compared. \u2013 Thank you all for your interest. Let\u2019s continue the discussion with these additional clarifications. ",

With regards to the CoinShares Capital Markets team, per your 2021 annual report this team was responsible for the $17M loss courtesy of the TerraLuna debacle. What changes have been made internally, and what is the Parent company doing to make sure this does not occur again? Also, in your annual report you don\u2019t mention MakerDAO in your views of DeFi\u2019s potentials \u2014 what has changed\u2014why the sudden interest in this protocol?  You also seem to be lagging in gaining market share for Eth Staking, has the focus of CoinShares shifted away from other L1s like Solana, Tezos, etc? You also hold liabilities of $3B++, and have Earnings Per Share of Negative $36++ (No bueno) and exposure to custodial services of tokens from XRP to ETC. How would the failure of any of these custodial tokens effect the overall health of CoinShares? How will MakerDAO\u2019s assets survive a default, hack(like Wintermute just suffered), or CoinShars inability to stay solvent? Thanks in advance. ",

                    "content": "Dear MakerDAO community, thank you for your new round of comments and questions, please find below our weekly review of your questions.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Rereading your proposal, I see that I misunderstood and that you are proposing to 1) pocket 2/3 of the outperformance against SOFR and 2) commit to use 1/2 of that to buy MKR tokens on the open market. Is that correct?     Correct.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you so much for the responses, they are very helpful. I just want to make sure I understand something. The asset manager would be CoinShares or someone from CoinShares ?     The asset manager will be an entity of the CoinShares Group habilited, with his team, by a regulator to provide investment services.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Who is assuming the conversion costs (i.e. USDC to Fiat and vice versa)? Are they split between MKR and Coinshares or taken out the net return? Gas fees and exchange rates are lower today but they might eat up a portion of the returns if market conditions change.  Lastly, its interesting that the return is paid back to MKR in USDC and not DAI? Wouldnt we prefer it in DAI so that it gets added to the surplus buffer? @strat-fin-core-unit   The portfolio will be charged for the conversion costs, performance being computed net of fees (including execution costs). It should also be noted that CoinShares, as a regulated investment company, has implemented, enforces and monitors the application of its Best Execution Policy. In doing so, it is CoinShares\u2019 duty to execute all transactions (including conversions) in the best interests of its clients. Our unit of account being USDC we therefore plan to redistribute the returns  in USDC. If the community prefers a pay-back in DAI, we could consider it.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thanks. If I\u2019m missing this please forgive me but is there a specific jurisdiction that will be governing the presumed agreement between Maker and CoinShares ? Is it Jersey or maybe something else?     This is a typical legal stage question. In general CoinShares\u2019 agreements are governed under Jersey or U.K. Laws.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you for answering my question above. With regards to the CoinShares Capital Markets team, per your 2021 annual report this team was responsible for the $17M loss courtesy of the TerraLuna debacle. What changes have been made internally, and what is the Parent company doing to make sure this does not occur again?  Also, in your annual report you don\u2019t mention MakerDAO in your views of DeFi\u2019s potentials \u2014 what has changed\u2014why the sudden interest in this protocol?  You also seem to be laggin\u2026       Just, to remind you this loss was among our own DeFi lending book (approx. $400M) and we had a position of $100M UST. Thanks to our Capital Markets team, technology stack and Risk Management team we managed to redeem our position early enough to limit our losses to \u00a317.7M. We never invested or traded LUNA tokens. Regarding the PSM, we would like to emphasise that the asset under CoinShares\u2019 management will be totally segregated from our balance sheet (including our DeFi/Capital Market books).   CoinShares is extremely involved in DeFi with our Research team, a dedicated Solidity team, plus we historically interacted with DAI from time to time in our various DeFi activities. We are not lagging in gaining market shares in ETH Staking for our Asset Management products. We are constrained in offering them by the lock-up on stETH which are contradictory to our daily subscriptions/redemptions requirements as stated in our Products\u2019 Offerings Documents & Prospectus. However, to make you perfectly comfortable we have been long time holders of stETH on Lido.   The vast majority of the liabilities held by the Group represent amounts due to holders of the Group\u2019s ETPs, issued by two Group entities, CSDS and XBT. These liabilities are fully collateralised and hedged with digital asset holdings to match what is being referenced by the body of ETPs. Therefore, largely speaking our assets move in conjunction with our liabilities, ensuring digital asset price fluctuations do not impact the solvency of the Group. In respect of \u201cfailure of tokens\u201d, from custodial services, we will assume you are talking here about assets on our balance sheet being misappropriated, which could be for a number of reasons. We hold our assets on a range of exchanges, with regulated custodians and a portion ourselves. There is an inherent risk in the industry, of which everyone is aware, of hacks/bad actors/external events (such as a de-pegging) which can, broadly speaking impact any location/method of storage. At CoinShares we are reliant upon our internal controls and tech stack to constantly monitor our assets and our counterparties to mitigate these risks to the extent possible. While no risk is ever reduced to zero, we have been operating for (in digital asset industry terms) a long time and never had an issue regarding the hedging & collateralising of our liabilities, nor our solvency, and continue to ensure our tech stack and trading and operations teams develop alongside the wider market in order to do everything in our power to reduce any risks that arise. The negative EPS is a bit of a red herring. EPS under IFRS is calculated using Profit After Tax, and we are obliged to present this way in the preparation of our audited financials. This means the calculation is performed PRIOR to taking into account any increase in the value of digital assets we hold (due to their classification as intangible assets). We also include (please see p.72 of our annual report) an alternative statement of comprehensive income which calculates adjusted EPS, taking into account our significant gains on digital asset holdings, which is  1.70 per share, or 1.62 per share on a diluted basis.       MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you for the response. Can you please share the legal basis for this statement? Are you quoting a statute, are you referring to some other sort of legal precedent, or are you just stating Coinshare\u2019s opinion on the matter? Thanks again.     Of course this is CoinShares\u2019 opinion supported by our Legal & Compliance expertise and technical knowledge in this field. As a reminder, CoinShares will never take full ownership of MakerDAO\u2019s assets. If this situation were to happen, it should be managed by MakerDAO, CoinShares only acting as a service provider for MakerDAO.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you for your proposal and these responses. The PSM is entirely permissionless and transparent, so we would like to hear more about what kind of verification of the existing risks you can perform and share during this RFC process. And further specify what CoinShares requires to have comfort that the USDC has a legal and non-risky origin.     Our compliance and AML risk management framework will lead CoinShares to perform mandatory due diligence (KYC) on the counterparty to the management contract. Although the PSM is permissionless and transparent, a legal entity will in all cases be required to enter into an investment agreement with us. We will also perform due diligence on the wallet(s) that will send us the assets to be managed (KYT) using the most advanced solutions on the market today that cross-reference thousands of historical transaction data with a risk score related to several dozen factors.     MIP86: CoinShares USDC Institutional Rewards RFC       Thank you for a detailed proposal.  SOFR is a benchmark for Secured Overnight Financing where the counterparty is giving Treasury securities in return. The proposed investment is in a basket of securities that have varying degrees of market risk, credit risk & liquidity risk. So, there is a substantial difference between the risk of the benchmark and the portfolio - and measuring/rewarding outperformance is not prudent.  Will it be appropriate to choose a benchmark that reflects the risk being t\u2026     We understand in MakerDAO\u2019s MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent - Invest in Short-Term Bonds that the investment objective is to \u201ctarget yield to maturity (\u2026) between 2-year treasuries before structural costs and at least 50bps (3-month t-bills) after all structural costs\u201d. In our opinion this is perfectly reflected by our proposed SOFR benchmark which is also accounting for a dynamic FED Policy. We also understand that the investment strategy is supposed to be \u201cSafe\u201d, \u201cFlexible\u201d and \u201cCost effective\u201d for MakerDAO and its assets. Thank you ",

                    "content": "First of all, our proposal is based on the assumption (verified) that we are professional investors and know how to invest and trade fixed income instruments. Our fee model is based on the simple process that if we don\u2019t perform, we don\u2019t get paid. To define performance, we offered the replacement of LIBOR i.e SOFR. LIBOR and SOFR are dynamic so in a volatile interest rate environment, not locking the benchmark at 3% for instance allows MakerDAO to benefit from the upside of an aggressive rate hiking policy and avoid MakerDAO making discrete speculation about the direction of travel of the FOMC. There is merit in being indexed on their decision from a MakerDAO perspective. Now - refreshing our numbers from the presentation - SOFR is 3.04% (and could continue to follow the rise in rates), and our current portfolio, as presented, could give an annualised return of around 6.75%. Please note we are explicitly transparent about that. Assuming, all things being equal, it would mean that MakerDAO could receive 3.04%+((6.75%-3.04%)*1/3) = 4.28%. This could leave 2.47% for CoinShares (these are assumptions). Out of this 2.47%, 1.235% would be re-invested in MakerDAO and locked in a visible and transparent manner for 2 years to:  highlight our commitment to MakerDAO project align our incentive with the community provide stewardship and governance support by becoming an active member of the governance.  Side note, the duration risk of our portfolio is 1.2 years, with around 50% of the portfolio planned to be invested in floating and variable rate bonds to provide protection against the potential for further rate hikes. Whilst CoinShares agrees that holding the US 2 years Treasury is a sensible way of locking in 4.5%, this is far from being a risk-managed approach in the current volatile rate environment we are living. Our solution allows MakerDAO not to cap the upside whilst having similar volatility characteristics as the US 2 years Treasury. In that sense, we believe it is a superior solution for the protocol.

CoinSharesCo:  CoinShares plans to allow full transparency of investments made with MakerDAO USDC\u2019s through dedicated tools accessible to everyone. Although originally from the traditional financial industry, CoinShares decided in 2013 to devote fully to digital assets because those new protocols allow for unparalleled transparency in transactions, contracts, and operation of protocols. With this in mind, CoinShares has partnered with Armanino LLP to provide investors with real-time transparency of CoinShares\u2019 XBT Provider assets under management, and CoinShares Digital Asset Securities through Trust Explorer Real Time Asset .   Speaking personally and not on behalf of the CES CU. I think this is a great well thought out and professional proposal with a performance based fee that incentivizes everyone in the right direction. Some of my questions relate to the quoted points above and are as follows:   In terms of the investment strategies you utilize should Maker want to wind the investment down over a 14 day period what would be the \u201cpenalty\u201d or potential downside to Maker for such an early termination - given the your investment horizon/policy seems to based on the next 36 months and the portfolio duration is 1.2 years  could you simulate the potential losses Maker would realize in terms of %?   I like the transparency aspect - in the info provided for Trust Explorer, they indicate that they run an oracle service that could write back to the blockchain is this what you have in mind ? and didnt see the info there but I assume we would have access to a Trust Explorer API?   Finally how flexible is the $500 million amount ie. is this the minimum that Coinshares would consider in terms of economies of scale? Asking this question as given the large number of investment options for MIP-13 and other RWAs and the differing terms and conditions, underlying duration of investments etc \u2026 I think it is imperative that MakerDao start conducting active ALM management and looking at these investments holistically? as opposed to assessing each MIP13 proposal independently \u2026   ",

                    "content": "1- MakerDAO could reduce its investment, or complete the contract before the maturity of the bonds, nevertheless this could have several negative consequences for the expected strategy results. In our view, the main challenge remains mark-to-market. As you know the price of the assets will fluctuate up and down sideways, consequently depending on the date MakerDAO wants to wind down its investment, we will have a MTM move either positive or negative. You should take into consideration that with this investment strategy, time is MakerDAO\u2019s friend. Every single day that passes every single minute every single second MakerDAO would accrue income from national champion corporates and quasi-sovereign government bonds. However, the earlier investors exit the solution the bigger the risk that they will take a measurable hit because there is potential for the mark-to-market to go against them. To simplify the further the investor is away from the bond maturing the riskier it is. Let\u2019s say MakerDAO wants to withdraw some of the investment, CoinShares would always take the most secure assets and utilize that as cash, for example, floaters or the shorter duration names. Because 5-10% of the portfolio is made of the most liquid and highly secure bonds our strategy can provide liquidity easily. We will provide on Tuesday some Delta modeling at certain times and provide an example of what MakerDAO might get if It decided to sell the entire portfolio down at 6 months, 1 year months and 18 months.  Back of envelope and to be confirmed later, we are talking basis points territory not points. 2 - TrustExplorer connects directly to our prime broker account through an API and will give to the MakerDAO community an instant view of the assets managed by CoinShares. We saw you used Dune Analytics for another MIP, we could easily implement such a solution nevertheless the big benefit of TrustExplorer is that assets are audited by an independent third-party US based Accounting and Audit firm: Armanino. 3 - This is an excellent question, and we definitely understand your point. Some of the bond sizes trade at a minimum of $100,000 consequently as mentioned in question one, the more assets we manage the less MakerDAO would be subject to mark-to-market and spread issues. We think this investment strategy is meaningful or MakerDAO if the minimum investment is $200M. ",

Can you stimulate potential losses?\u201d Summary: We estimate that taking into consideration some rather severe haircuts to allow for the potential of the following:  Continued market volatility Not our base case The pull to par dragging The bond will price with limited upward pull to par price movement in the first 12 months. Bid-offer spread widening Given the large size of most issues, there is a limited bid-offer spread in the names in the portfolio. However, we have increased the potential here to demonstrate liquidity stress.  This provides us with almost a 'worst-case scenario over the next 12 months of the following return stream:  We will expand on this response. The portfolio is designed to provide returns of +2.25% over SOFR over a 36-month rolling period. The portfolio can be liquidated readily in normal market conditions. However, to commence collecting capital from income and mark-market movements (MTM), the optimal holding period should be for the least 6-months, thus negating fees, costs and impact of the bid-offer spread. Given the question requires us to investigate the future somewhat, we can establish what we know now: Credit   The portfolio has a parent credit rating of AA-. The portfolio primarily invests in national champion corporate issuers that are imperative to their national or regional economy. These are blended with government agency bonds (36%). We seek out those nations with solid balance sheets that can provide investors with value, income, and security.   This approach minimised credit risk. We have stress-tested the portfolio against ten of the most severe events in 20 years, and the portfolio would not have suffered a default. This, combined with the high credit quality and government backing, reduced credit risk as a primary concern.   Income   If invested today, we know the portfolio has a running yield of 3.34%, meaning each quarter, the portfolio accrues 0.85% in income or 0.0093% per day.   Regardless of the price movement of the underlying instruments, income will always be accrued.   Capital   Throughout 2022, the macroeconomic climate has been very challenging. This challenging outlook has already been priced into many bonds which have sold off this year. This sell-off means that at present c. 91% is currently trading below par (100).   Given the limited credit risk in the portfolio, we expect that all bonds will mature or be called at par (100). This means the portfolio will benefit from pull to par. Pull to par is a bond\u2019s price movement toward its face value (100) as it approaches its maturity date. Currently, 91% of the bonds in the portfolio are trading at a discount, which is lower than par. Meaning as they get close to maturity, their value will increase.   For example, Sumitomo 0.85% 2024 is currently priced at $93.48 it will mature at $100 in March 2024. As a result, this bond will experience a pull to a par of 6.52%.   Even if the price is volatile between now and the bond\u2019s maturity date, given the high credit quality nature of the holdings, they are likely to pull to par. As such, the portfolio will achieve a capital uplift.   The longer the holding period, the more confident the uplift in the capital.   At present, the average discount on the bonds in the portfolio is 4.26%. Thus reflecting the average price of bonds in the portfolio of $95.74.   Given the maturity and duration profile of the portfolio in which bonds do not mature for c. 12 months, investors will not receive the full benefit of the pull to par if they exit the strategy.   Reflecting these factors, the weighted annual pull to par is c.3.1%. However, this will be discounted more heavily in our calculations if investors exit the strategy earlier than 6 months.   Our assessment is the sell-off in bond markets has been overdone, and there is little downside remaining, especially with assets that are due to mature or be called in the next couple of years.   Mark-to-Market movements and volatility   We focus on large issue sizes with high demand and deep markets that are widely covered.   At the time of writing, under normal market circumstances, a minimum of c90% of positions can be sold off instantly, the remainder in T+5. BVAL (value out of 10) and LQA (%) are critical, independent measures of market, valuation, demand and trading volumes. Securities with higher BVAL scores have more market makers providing prices. Typically, the higher the BVAL score, the higher likelihood of finding liquidity for those securities. Therefore, the portfolio focuses on those securities with BVAL\u2019s over 8 / 10.   We calculate the bid-offer spread at c. 0.07%. This is a snapshot in time. We based this on modelling treasuries and corporate bonds. This figure is not cumulative in our calculations.   Volatility in the market has dampened dramatically recently. Our model has 5-year annualised volatility levels of 3.11%, adjusting slightly for lower volatility over the coming 12 months. The annualised volatility is changed (mainly because of the pull-to-par effect. At the same time, our calculation will only demonstrate a downside standard deviation. This presents a worse possible scenario that we should envisage due to the stabilisation of the market.   ",

The precise amount of USDC to be invested will be determined by a Signal Request if the MIP is approved. If the portfolio outperforms the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), then CoinShares will pay MakerDAO this interest rate every month on chain. Any profits above the SOFR will be divided as follows: 1/3 for MakerDAO, 1/3 for CoinShares, and the last 1/3 for CoinShares to acquire MKR. The acquired MKR will be held for at least two years by CoinShares. If directed to do so by an Executive Vote, CoinShares aims to be able to unwind the investment within seven business days under normal market circumstances. Under stressed market conditions, withdrawal may take longer and may generate losses for MakerDAO. MIP86-c6, c7, c8, and c9 detail the legal and custodial solutions proposed for the USDC assets and bond assets. An illustration of the flow of funds from PSM to investment is provided within the MIP. CoinShares is regulated in Jersey by the Jersey Financial Services Commission and the agreement would be governed under Jersey or United Kingdom laws.

The Total Assets Held by the Group as at 30 September 2022 is \u00a31,875.4 million. Exposure to FTX is \u00a326.6 million. If we assume the amount to be 100% irrecoverable, this will:  reduce the net asset position of the group by approximately 11%, to \u00a3214.0 million reduce the total asset position of the group by approximately 1.4% to \u00a31,848.8 million  Hope this helps.

Core drivers for the portfolio over the period has been  credit selection with marginally longer duration name is posting returns in excess of 1%. This has largely been driven by US inflation, marginally slowing  to 7.7% and the prospect of further aggressive rate hikes diminishing. As such our floating-rate exposure over the period has been largely flat. We think it is prudent to retain a flexible outlook and not be committed to a binary outcome as such we continue to blend instrument types and geography is from a global universe. The portfolio currently is yielding 6.51%, with an average credit rating of AA and low duration of 1.16 years, implying minimal, sensitivity to ongoing rhetoric surrounding  interest rates. While as an added, layer of comfort, 36% of the portfolio is backed by government institutions. The strategy is continues  high quality instruments that provide an attractive yield above cash. ",
