This particular configuration was chosen to get a mix of USD, USDT, BTC, and ETH exposure while covering the largest swaths of AAVE liquidity. DEXes like Uniswap and Balancer are also included through the use of subgraphs. Limiting exposure to subgraphs to two out of six sources is still highly desirable as subgraphs tend to fail quite frequently. While the trading pairs on Huobi and OKEx exhibit significant amounts of wash-trading, their estimated real volume is still significant enough to warrant using them as sources. The Oracle Domain team will monitor the listing of AAVE on US-based exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken which tend to have stricter regulatory scrutiny. The inclusion of these exchanges would increase confidence in the AAVE Data Model. ",
