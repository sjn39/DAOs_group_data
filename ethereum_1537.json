Could be a github app that at every wiki change checks out the git that backs the wiki. But to prevent link rot when github.com vanishes (or decides it does not want any ethereum content anymore) we could even render this content to html (I did something similar here) - and then perhaps serve it via swarm or IPFS behind an ens name to prevent this scenario. So anyone here has the key to 42ae2a8a80fe2e8dea3820cdf927f454eee0fb12 ? ",
