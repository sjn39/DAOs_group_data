Mostly, does someone reach out to each of us, or do we all need to seek out a specific channel of communication? Apologies if there\u2019s already something in place and I just couldn\u2019t find it.

                    "content": "Hello, I\u2019m Dumitru, representing Maker Foundation TechOps team. Wanted to share some details about Forum functionality.  We are constantly monitoring Forum for downtime and have other monitoring in place that helps us identify issues with it and react almost instantly whenever something happens and technical implication is needed. Forum is part of our Security Bug Bounty Program, that gives an opportunity for Hackers to report critical security issues on multiple Foundation projects and services. On top of that we are always trying to keep Forum on the latest Discourse (platform behind the Forum) version and upgrade it whenever the new version comes out. Maker Foundation does have a status page (https://makerdao.statuspage.io) that shows status of different services and live information about their status. It is linked to our monitoring tools and most of the time display real-time data about system health. Forum is part of it as well. Whenever anything happens, there will be message displayed describing the problem and resolution timeline (if we know it). We perform daily forum backups and save them on an external service. That gives us an opportunity to restore all forum data with minimal losses.  Should the forum become unavailable for an extended period of time, we\u2019ll provide the status of it being recovered on our regular communication channels - Rocket Chat (#general channel), Reddit, Telegram, Twitter, etc. I hope that clarifies the technical side of the situation. P.S. When the Foundation dissolves, there will probably be changes in the communication channels, their ownership and the information that each of them provide. There will be broader discussions with the Community about that. ",
