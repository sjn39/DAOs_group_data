You ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to continue paying the fraud tax as was done during GR9 & GR10. 3. Request further deliberation You do not ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection and Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multi-sig to wait for further deliberation.  See the final results from GR11  To payout the matching allocations from Grants Round 11, we need the stewards to ratify the matching allocations. This comes with the extra responsibility of ratifying the decisions made by Gitcoin Holdings and the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream of GitcoinDAO. To make the payouts in a timely manner, we would like to suggest voting on snapshot to begin on Wednesday, October 6th.*  TL;DR from the GR11 Governance brief:  Round Results  Biggest round ever!  $2.6m raised = $965k pot + $1.6m community 56x growth since round GR1   7.5m now in the community multisig (9.30.21 - Eth only) Should we pay the Fraud Tax?  Will include both options on proposal  Ratify results without paying fraud tax = Disincentivize fraud Ratify results and pay fraud tax = Continue past operations Do not ratify results - Require more deliberations       Fraud Detection & Defense  Anti-Sybil ML L2 Stream  Round Review from Blockscience Community participation for feature engineering Improved to a 12 hour cycle time Integrated to Gitcoin backend w/ human oversight heuristic Fraud Tax $5,787. This is down from $14,350 during GR10. First statistical validation analysis completed 853 sybil accounts down from 1337 during GR11 Most of the attacks came during the last 3 days   Policy L2 Stream  Tornado Cash voluntarily gave up match after being flagged  Survey released to get bottoms-up info on DAO eligibility Fewer total disputes than GR10 New appeals policy designed Public oversight of all Grant Approvals  Public oversight of all Grant Disputes & Appeals       The defensive measures taken to protect against fraud and collusion had incredible results. While there is still more work to be done in progressively decentralizing the grants platform, ratifying this round\u2019s closure will continue the precedent for trusting, but verifying the FDD workstream\u2019s decisions. (Similar mechanism design to an optimistic roll-up). **Moved from 10/6 recommendation to 10/8 after adding the full results worksheet on 10/6. This provides and extra 2 days of deliberation on top of the previous 5 as required by governance. The ethereum ecosystem is governed by the community multisig which we intend to transfer to the GitcoinDAO treasury once select criteria has been met.
