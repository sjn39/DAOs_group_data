Please do join us on Telegram to continue the conversation, or on this Magicians Forum thread.    Telegram    Ethereum LLVM Developers Let\u2019s collaborate on LLVM compiler tooling for Ethereum!      Three key active projects are SOLL + LLVM-EVM and Solang, both of which have working Solidity compilers using LLVM, for eWASM/EVM and WASM respectively:    GitHub    second-state/SOLL SOLL is a new compiler for generate Ewasm from solidity and yul. See a demo here: https://youtu.be/X-A6sP_HTy0 - second-state/SOLL         GitHub    hyperledger-labs/solang A Solidity to wasm compiler written in rust.
