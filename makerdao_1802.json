                    "content": "Here is the update from Dai Foundation Core Unit for Q3 2022: Renewing our budget according to the updated budget MIP took a good chunk of work in the beginning of the quarter. We want to thank Maker Governance for good questions and for approving our Bear Market Scenario budget, in line with the general situation of the Maker Protocol Our mission is to safeguard the MakerDAO assets - this update contain information about our various activities to:  Safeguard and Protect the MakerDAO assets Get the MakerDAO assets into play to support the growth and development of the DAO Enable handover of new MakerDAO assets to Dai Foundation for permanent safeguarding  Handover of new assets to Dai Foundation for safeguarding In Q3 the SES Core Unit has handed over the makerdao.network domain to Dai Foundation. This is important because Core Units that have been incubated by SES have their emails and host web content on subdomains of makerdao.network. All existing Core Units using makerdao.network have been added to the Asset Registry with grandfathered access. Getting assets into use for the DAO With makerdao.network being with Dai Foundation everybody can now apply to use the domain through the MIP60 process. Further, it has now been enabled that Core Units can provide their members with emails on subdomains of makerdao.com or makerdao.network. The Core Units can request to have DNS records configured for their email provider simply by posting a request via https://change.daifoundation.org Utilizing such an email setup can make it easier for Core Units to handle access management and off-boarding for their members. Another good piece of news is that somebody finally has stood up to manage the MakerDAO website. The Growth Core Units has successfully applied to take Content Management ownership of the www.makerdao.com website as well as Content Management ownership of the MakerDAO Linkedin page with updates already being applied to the MakerDAO Linkedin Page. This is really great news! Scamming sites As can be seen in the Asset Registry there still are SoMe accounts without assigned Content Managers. The consequences of this vary across the different platforms. On the Telegram platform we so far have had no success in getting Telegram to act against scamming accounts claiming to be the \u201cOfficial MakerDAO\u201d account. Having a proper official account seems to be the best way to keep imposters at bay. This is just noted for good order. I understand it may be hard to find resources for this in the current climate. On a positive note Techops have successfully managed to have the following reported scamming sites taken down during this quarter:   stabledai.com, which redirected to: _https://makerdao.claims/_ as well as http://mdai.io/  Position on Patent infringement complaints From time to time legal complaints without merit, made in the hope of making a profit, appear on the MakerDAO Forum from actors often characterized as \u201cpatent trolls.\u201d To help community members understand what Dai Foundation can and cannot do in such situations we have published the Dai Foundation position on Patent infringement complaints against MakerDAO. Please give it a read. Trademarks protection The trademark infringement case that I have reported about in the last two updates is still ongoing. Whether one might want to like this to a boxing fight or a chess game make sure to add ultra slow motion ahead of your preferred description. The important thing for Dai Foundation is that we do not degrade our ability to protect the strong DAI, MAKER, and MAKERDAO trademarks going forward, and we thank the community for your support in pursuing this. Ensuring DAO access to assets funded by the DAO We have started asking our questions to Core Units whether assets produced with MakerDAO funding will become public goods. We do it when there are Core Unit budget requests - currently for Oracles CU, the proposed RWF-0x CU and the DUX CU, and in other interactions with Core Units. For example, the Growth Core Unit has responded to the questions in connection with the Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management requests for makerdao.com and Linkedin. You can find all Public Goods Questions main documents and check the answers given (if any so far) using this link: https://forum.makerdao.com/tag/public-good-questions MKR Governance voters may want to check #public-good-questions for further background before voting on a budget request. Adding MakerDAO appointed board members There was a slow start on our Call for interest in becoming a Dai Foundation board member, but several candidates fulfilling the board member requirements have now declared their interest, and submitted applications. The Dai Foundation Board of Trustees will now assess and work with the candidates. We have budgetted for one adding one MakerDAO appointed board member at this time, as planned in the approved  Bear Market Scenario budget. The next step is for GovAlpha to construct the process for Maker Governance to evaluate and potentially elect/appoint one of the candidates when GovAlpha has the bandwidth for it. Conference particiption The Dai Foundation board was present at EthCC in Paris where the Events Core Unit provided a compelling venue for our Meet the Dai Foundation Board during EthCC[5] meeting. Thanks again to @events-core-unit for all your help. Some members of the board will participate in Devcon in Bogota. We are still keen to engage with the community and disperse knowledge about Dai Foundation, so if you are coming to Devcon and want to chat about Dai Foundation please reach out to me. Likewise if you have suggestions for stakeholders that we shall engage with. Budget and Expense reporting The Dai Foundation Core Unit budget reporting has been integrated with the MakerDAO Expenses Dashboard from SES over the last quarters, and was part of it on its launch You can follow the DAIF Core Unit expenses reporting here Makerdao Github Cleanup The announced Makerdao Github classification and cleanup progressing. We have gone through over 200 repositories and identified potential Core Unit assignments, as well as which repositories can be archived, and which we consider candidates for archiving, but need Core Unit input for. You can see the lists of the repositories with questions for relevant Core Units in this spreadsheet. Core Units have been asked to answer the questions by October 18, 2022 after which the classification and cleanup will proceed. Dai Foundation Grants Dai Foundation published a Call for Grant applications on July 20th, 2022, and the board have awarded the grant to this proposal:  The proposal is to produce a White Paper that explores the question of whether DAO\u2019s as a generic organisational category can be said to represent a completely novel form of organisation, and by doing so establish (i) whether novel theoretical resources are required for understanding the di\ufb00erent ways DAO\u2019s can successfully manage their intangible assets and intellectual property, and (ii) the di\ufb00erent ways that the relationship between DAOs and their assets can evolve. The findings will highlight the implications for the management and organisation of DAO\u2019s and an agenda for future research into the governance and performance evaluation of them.  The White Paper is to be delivered in Q4 2022. Dai Foundation and current Endgame Pre-Launch MIP sets Dai Foundation is following the Maker Governance discussions closely including the proposed Endgame Pre-Launch MIP sets. We do not anticipate any large changes to how Dai Foundation fulfills its chartered purpose if the MIP sets are approved. This assumes Maker Governance agrees that any additions to the Maker protocol itself must remain a public good with appropriate open source licenses etc. If MakerDAO funds activities that will produce assets where some are to be public goods where others will remain the property of the party receiving the funds then our recommendation is to ensure that the funding document (which today typically is a Core Unit Budget MIP) contains a clear definition of which deliverables are to be public goods (i.e. part of the Maker Protocol) and which are supporting ecosystem services that may not be made freely available by the recipient of the funds. This was the high level update for the past quarter. As always feel free to reach out with questions here or one to one, we are here to serve the community in the capacity laid and in line with the DAI Foundation Purpose. All the best Your DAIF CU Facilitator ",
