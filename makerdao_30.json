The Vote was active for four days ending Friday, August 28, at 5:29:08 PM UTC.  The bundled contents of this Vote consisted of two subproposals:  MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance) MIP0c13-SP1: Subproposal for Core Personnel Offboarding      Result: The Monthly MIPs Executive Vote did NOT pass.  Thursday  The Governance Facilitator (@LongForWisdom) performed the Governance Cycle Review, summarizing August\u2019s Governance Cycle and opening up the floor for feedback and questions from the community and discussing any plans for September\u2019s Governance Cycle.  This Week\u2019s Activity (Gap Week: August 31-September 4) Monday/Thursday  No polls or votes this week related to a Monthly Governance Cycle! September\u2019s Governance Cycle begins on Monday, September 7. This week\u2019s governance call (or at least my segment) can be used as a time to discuss any upcoming governance cycle activities as well as a chance for Authors of planned MIPs or Subproposals to inform the governance community of their plans to submit them to Septemeberr\u2019s Governance cycle formally.  Next Week\u2019s Activity (September 7 - September 11) Monday  September\u2019s Governance Cycle officially begins on Monday, September 7. The Formal Submission period is September 7 to September 9.  This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle.    Note: If you have any proposals in progress, I encourage you to submit them for review on the forums if you intend to propose them for a near-future governance cycle. Thursday  The Governance Facilitator will perform the Submission Review on the weekly Governance and Risk call to determine which of the formally submitted MIPs/Subproposals may be put forth for Inclusion Polls on Monday, September 14.  Other News Collateral Onboarding  The PAXUSD and USDT Week Cycle Collateral Onboarding Governance Polls passed last week, meaning that the Executive Vote to official onboard them will go live on Friday, September 4. The Signal Request gauging the community\u2019s sentiment around the LRC resubmission ended, concluding that LRC will be re-submitted into the September Governance Cycle.  Next month\u2019s planned collaterals types are:  COMP LINK PAX Gold   LRC resubmission   August\u2019s Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls ended today, and the results can be viewed in the Collateral Status Index.

Apologies to the community.   This Week | June 7 - June 11  Monday  June\u2019s Governance Cycle begins today, and it\u2019s the new MIP51 Governance Cycle!:  Now all proposals go through individual (unless they\u2019re MIP Sets) two-week Ratification Polls. No more MIP Executive Votes.  By the way, that means that the MIP Executive Vote that went live on May 24 was the very last one. Honorable discharge!     Formal Submission window is open and will remain so until end of Wednesday 9. Is you MIP eligible to advance to FS? Let\u2019s find out!    Thursday  Soon-to-be Governance Facilitator @Prose11 will do a Submission Review and communicate its outcome during the weekly Governance Call. There will be a MIPs Update. Promise     Next Week | June 14 - June 18  Monday  Monday marks the beginning of week 2. Under the new Governance Cycle schedule this means that Ratification Polls will go live that day     Thursday  There will be a MIPs Update during the weekly Governance Call.

I have taken charge of the accounting, written status updates, and contributed to our core unit\u2019s goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning, but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. Often, when Travin has scheduling conflicts, I am asked to attend the weekly Mandated Actor\u2019s meeting in his place. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo.\u201d  High @psychonaut     Proposals in RFC     \u2014 RFC and FS Dates for reference and for existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  These proposals are currently in RFC \u2014 they need your feedback! They are not eligible to enter the August Governance Cycle. Newest additions to the proposals in RFC have been placed at the top of the table and marked with :     MIP Author Impact Estimation Summary       MakerDAO Delegates MIP SetThese three MIPs formalize delegates within the MIP framework and establish how they are to be compensated. This MIP Set deprecates MIP61: Delegate Compensation.  @Patrick_J High TBD    MIP4c2-SP23: MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment\u201cMIP50 was too specific to lending protocols. I\u2019ve updated it for the V2 rewrite which covers all external protocols that allow users to deposit / withdraw DAI. I\u2019ve updated the MIP to remove details of the targeting mechanism as that is no longer important.\u201d  @hexonaut High Link    IS-001 (Immunefi Security) Offboarding Proposals The author of the proposal has stated that they are willing to keep the proposal in RFC indefinitely after a compromise has been reached.\u201cThe functions of IS-001 do not require a Core Unit, and should be reduced to contracted services by Core Units that wish to retain Immunefi (the company). This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone. And so this Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.\u201d  @Ippy High TBD    SH-001 (Strategic Happiness) Offboarding Proposals\u201cThe functions of SH-001 do not require a Core Unit. The budget is a significant outlier given the high cost and niche function. Burban should be integrated into growth. The Core Unit is an unnecessary expense and currently represents 64k in monthly costs. It is not essential in a bear market.\u201d  @CodeKnight High TBD    MIP41c4-SP38: Immunefi Security Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding (Psychonaut)\u201cAdd @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.\u201d  @Psychonaut High TBD    MIP4c2-SP21: Add Retrospection Process to prune unused MIPs Will not be formally submitted until some issues have been addressed\u201cBureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning. The goal of the Retrospection Process is to surface a process to help prune unused or low-utility MIPs. This process also helps introduce and familiarize the broader community with MIPs that continue to be used.\u201d  @psychonaut High TBD    MIP72: Delegated Collateral Attachment - RWA Arranger Application - 6s Capital\u201cMIP72 authorizes 6s Capital as a Real World Asset Arranger for MakerDAO to cause commerce by assembling commercial senior-secured transactions based on the authorization #001 outlined herein.\u201d  @mrabino1 High TBD     Things to Come    Latest date for posting proposals* that will be eligible to enter the September Governance Cycle is August 10th.   * Proposals that have a 28-day Feedback Period, that is.

Within this revised MIP, Core Units and proposed Core Units are required to submit standardized, transparent, and clear financial information. Budget Proposals must clearly serve a revenue-driving or supporting business purpose in line with the Objectives of the DAO.\"    Medium  Go to Voting Portal      MIP40c3-SP67: Modify Core Unit Budget - Strategic Happiness (SH-001)Forum | MIPs Portal\"MIP40c3-SP67 updates the budget to expand the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001. It proposes an updated budget breakdown for DAI and MKR. In total, 770,000 DAI is requested (230,000 DAI up-front). Additionally, a 250 MKR vest is requested, streamed over 4 years with an 18-month cliff. A pro-rated offboarding term is also proposed for 2 months of funding if, after funding this Core Unit until March 15, 2023, the community decides not to renew a further budget.\"    High  Go to Voting Portal     The new Core Unit Budget process was approved. This means that from now on budget proposals must:  Use the new MIP40c3 subproposal template  Be submitted during a Budget Submission Window (March, June, September, November).  Et cetera.   Proposals in RFC     \u2014 RFC and FS Dates for reference and for existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  One new monthly-cycle proposal entered last week, which leaves us with nine active proposals in RFC.     Proposal Author Eligible for Submission      MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments\" The original motivation for this amendment was to simplify and to clarify the Core Unit offboarding process. Recent examples (see MKT-001 offboarding: 1, 2, 3) have demonstrated several gaps in this process. Ratifying simple changes started small and, along the way, the ambitions grew into revisions for much of the Core Unit MIP Set. Thanks to generous contributions from GovAlpha we now have a cohesive MIP Set. The aim is to reduce harm to the DAO and community in the event of Core Unit disruptions. These changes are an attempt to make processes more transparent and orderly. In addition, edits to MIP38, MIP39, and MIP41 fill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates. This comprehensive set of changes should inspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote. It will also make tracking and editing Core Unit MIPs simpler.\"   @gfxlabs / @twblack88 just posted significant modifications June    MIP72: Delegated Collateral Attachment - RWA Arranger Application - 6s Capital\"MIP72 authorizes 6s Capital as a Real World Asset Arranger for MakerDAO to cause commerce by assembling commercial senior-secured transactions based on the authorization #001 outlined herein.\"  @mrabino1 June    MIP4c2-SP20: MIP16 Amendments\"MIP4c2-SP20 amends MIP16 to reflect the changes to the weekly Executive Vote cadence proposed by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit here.\"  @Patrick_J June    MIP41c4-SP34: Immunefi Security Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding - IS-001\"Add @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.\"  @psychonaut June    MIP41c4-SP35: Facilitator Onboarding (DIN-001)\u201cThis subproposal adds @tadeo as the Facilitator for the Data Insights Core Unit.\u201d  @tadeo June    MIP41c5-SP6: Facilitator Offboarding (DIN-001)Note that this is a voluntary offboarding and will not be voted on.\u201cThis subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator of the Data Insights Core Unit (DIN-001).\u201d  @tmierzwa June    MIP55c3-SP4: Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway\"The Makershire Hathaway Special Purpose Fund will be a 10M pool managed by Strategic Finance CU under the supervision of Risk CU and prospective Lending Oversight CU to experiment with various yield generation strategies and support DAI liquidity/utility.\"  @aes June    MIP4c2-SP21: Add Retrospection Process to prune unused MIPs\"Bureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning.

MIP10 processes are somewhat eccentric. These two subproposals have Feedback and Frozen Periods of zero days. While they could have gone on-chain today, we consulted with @Nik from Oracles and decided to wait for one week, until Monday, May 30, before going on-chain. These proposals will go up as Short (three-day) Ratification Polls.

Things to Come   Yes, it\u2019s true that there will be no Governance Cycle in December and that the next Formal Submission Window will open on January 3rd\u201435 days from now. However, authors who want their proposals to enter January\u2019s Governance Cycle must post them in the forum in nine days (on December 8) at the latest. I know of these upcoming proposals:  A SPF for a bounty for the creation of a legal communications framework for the DAO A StarkNet Engineering (SNE-001) budget A Chaos Labs Core Unit (incubated by SES) A Maker Talent Core Unit (incubated by SES) A Tech Ops Core Unit (incubated by SES)  Stuff to look forward to! Refreshing!   Also, there\u2019s a number of proposals still in RFC that would benefit from your feedback. So please    Proposals in RFC     Proposal Extract Author     MIP55c3-SP2: Create RealDAO SPF to make Moloch-based SPVs \u201cThe purpose of this subproposal is to create a 50k Dai SPF to provide a prototype SPV DAO with a template code deference agreement\u201d. @jameskmccall   MIP40c3-SP45: Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) \u201cMIP40c3-SP45 appends Maker Oracle gas costs to the Oracle Core Unit ORA-001 budget for August 1 2021 through end of March 2022. The Maker Oracle gas cost budget is separate from the general operations budget of the Oracle Core Unit. Unlike the Operations budget, which is renewed annually, the Oracle gas costs budget will be renewed every three months\u201d. @nikkunkel   MIP41c5-SP2: Facilitator Offboarding (RWF-001) \u201cThis subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator [S\u00e9bastien Derivaux] of the Real-World Finance Core Unit\u201d. @rune   MIP41c4-SP27: Facilitator Onboarding (RWF-001) \u201c[Rune] approached Will Remor and asked if he was willing to take on the role of Acting Facilitator to oversee the decentralization of the RWA Core Units\u201d. @rune   Pairwyse Fixed-Rate Core Unit (MIP39c2) \u201cThe Pairwyse Foundation has implemented an out-of-box solution and deployed a product for the provision of fixed-rate DAI loans of arbitrary term-length via the Pairwyse protocol built atop Maker\u2019s credit and deposit facilities\u201d. @Akiva   MIP61: Delegate Compensation \u201cThis proposal describes how Recognized Delegates will be compensated\u201d. @psychonaut      oh btw  If you have an idea for a proposal and have no idea how to go about making it into a Maker Improvement Proposal, this may be useful. If you\u2019re confused about the dates for the Feedback Period, the Frozen Period, and/or the Formal Submission, please check this forum post. If that doesn\u2019t help, send me a message or post a reply here.

Next Week\u2019s is September\u2019s Governance Cycle Week 1 | September 6 - September 10 The Formal Submission Window for September opens on Monday 6th. I\u2019ll be reaching out to authors of eligible proposals and inquiring whether it is their desire formally to submit or whether they would rather stay in the warm, nurting RFC stage   oh btw  If you haven\u2019t checked the MIPs Portal lately, please do and leave some feedback. What would you like to see there? What would you change? If you\u2019re confused about the dates for the Feedback Period, the Frozen Period, and/or the Formal Submission, please check this soon-to-be-upgraded forum post.

The first week of March\u2019s Governance Cycle has just started and the Formal Submission Window will be open for the next two days (up till Wednesday)! The following proposals have already been formally submitted by their authors:     Proposal Extract Author     MIP4c2-SP17\tRapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) \u201cThe current bug bounty payment process is adequate for large payouts, but inconvenient for small payouts. This MIP adds a small payout process.\u201d @Psychonaut   MIP61: Delegate Compensation \u201cGovernance Facilitators will compute and send the compensation to Recognized Delegates starting from the MIP adoption date with payments sent monthly.\u201d @psychonaut   MIP63c4-SP2\tOnboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network \u201cThis is an onboarding application for Keep3r Network. A decentralized, permissionless keeper network.\u201d @hexonaut   MIP63c4-SP3: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network \u201cGelato Network is Web3\u2019s automation network, enabling developers to automate a wide variety of arbitrary smart contract executions on and across all EVM-based compatible blockchains such as Ethereum.\u201d @hexonaut    The following proposals are eligible to be formally submitted. We\u2019ll be getting in touch with their authors shortly:     Proposal Extract Author      MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process AmendmentsThis proposal is likely to remain in RFC for a little longer   \u201cRecent events (see RWF-001 facilitator and MKR-001 offboardings below) have shown the process for involuntarily offboarding facilitators and core units could be improved. These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.\u201d @GFXlabs   MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds \u201cAs of writing, around 60% of the MakerDAO balance sheet is in stablecoin. We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos. MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter.\u201d @SebVentures   MIP40c3-SP59: GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 \u201cMIP40c3-SP59 adds a 12-month DAI budget of 1,109,793 DAI for the GovAlpha Core Unit starting in April 2022. This will be implemented via a 89,983 DAI per month stream and an initial transfer of 30,000 DAI.\u201d @LongForWisdom   MIP40c3-SP60 Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget \u201cThis budget consists of two key parts, retroactive compensation for @LongForWisdom and an MKR Compensation framework for GovAlpha. Overall, this proposal would commit 227.64 MKR to GovAlpha contributors, covering MKR compensation for the Core Unit from its inception. This is approximately 67.06 MKR/FTE/Year. Subsequent requests will take place every 6 months, featuring the same 12-month cliff. Contributors do not forfeit their vesting upon leaving GovAlpha, providing that their departure is a smooth transition and there have been no serious ethical breaches.\u201d @Prose11   MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) \u201cMIP40c3-SP61 modifies the Dai budget for the Real-World Finance Core Unit.

What is one to do in the meantime? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked.  Short Ratification Polls    In the meantime you can go check these two Oracle-related Short Ratification Polls that will be running until Thursday.     Proposal Impact Estimation Ratification Poll     MIP10c19-SP1: Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles Medium Voting Portal   MIP10c7-SP2 - Modify Oracle Data Models Medium Voting Portal    As usual, these Ratification Polls implement a Minimum Positive Participation value of 10,000 MKR. At the time of writing this, positive participation is ~4,000. What is it? Two Ratification Polls (and short ones at that!) are not enough to fill the void? Well, have you maybe heard about\u2026  \u2026 Proposals in RFC?      \u2014 RFC and FS Dates for reference and for existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  There are lots of proposals to review under the RFC subcategory! Yes, the Frozen Period is upon most of them, but even those might still benefit from your input. And even if they don\u2019t\u2026  Also, some of the proposals there will be entering July\u2019s Governance Cycle, so there goes your objection. I don\u2019t why you\u2019re making this so difficult. I\u2019m just trying to help.

As per MIP51c4: Calendar Exceptions, there will be no Monthly Governance Cycle in December, i.e., no Formal Submission Window and no Ratification Polls.   Friendly reminder for @seth, @pyramidmaker, and @SES-Core-Unit, of whom I know they are currently working on proposals    Proposals that intend to enter January\u2019s Governance Cycle must be posted at the latest on Wednesday 8th. The reason for this is:  That proposals that haven\u2019t fulfilled their Feedback Period cannot be formally submitted And the Feedback Period spans a minimum of 28 days And the Formal Submission Window for January closing on Wednesday 3rd   Once posted, proposals will be open to overt community feedback and authors will have 21 days to act on that feedback (they must honor the one-week Frozen Period!). If you have any question, feel free to message me publicly or privately.   Things to Come   You can see all MIP-relevant dates for 2022 on the freshly updated MIP RFC and Formal Submission Dates post.   Proposals in RFC     Proposal Extract Author     MIP62: Collateral Offboarding Process \u201cThis proposal describes how to notify users of Maker vaults of collateral offboarding\u201d. @PaperImperium   MIP55c3-SP2: Create RealDAO SPF to make Moloch-based SPVs \u201cThe purpose of this subproposal is to create a 50k Dai SPF to provide a prototype SPV DAO with a template code deference agreement\u201d. @jameskmccall   MIP40c3-SP45: Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) \u201cMIP40c3-SP45 appends Maker Oracle gas costs to the Oracle Core Unit ORA-001 budget for August 1 2021 through end of March 2022. The Maker Oracle gas cost budget is separate from the general operations budget of the Oracle Core Unit. Unlike the Operations budget, which is renewed annually, the Oracle gas costs budget will be renewed every three months\u201d. @nikkunkel   MIP41c5-SP2: Facilitator Offboarding (RWF-001) \u201cThis subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator [S\u00e9bastien Derivaux] of the Real-World Finance Core Unit\u201d. @rune   MIP41c4-SP27: Facilitator Onboarding (RWF-001) \u201c[Rune] approached Will Remor and asked if he was willing to take on the role of Acting Facilitator to oversee the decentralization of the RWA Core Units\u201d. @rune   Pairwyse Fixed-Rate Core Unit (MIP39c2) \u201cThe Pairwyse Foundation has implemented an out-of-box solution and deployed a product for the provision of fixed-rate DAI loans of arbitrary term-length via the Pairwyse protocol built atop Maker\u2019s credit and deposit facilities\u201d. @Akiva   MIP61: Delegate Compensation \u201cThis proposal describes how Recognized Delegates will be compensated\u201d. @psychonaut      oh btw  If you have an idea for a proposal and have no idea how to go about making it into a Maker Improvement Proposal, this may be useful. If you\u2019re confused about the dates for the Feedback Period, the Frozen Period, and/or the Formal Submission, please check this forum post.

This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone.

The Ratification Polls for March\u2019s Governance Cycle are now up. Go cast your vote! If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.     Ratification Poll Extract Author     MIP61: Delegate Compensation \u201cGovernance Facilitators will compute and send the compensation to Recognized Delegates starting from the MIP adoption date with payments sent monthly.\u201d @psychonaut   MIP63c4-SP2: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network \u201cThis is an onboarding application for Keep3r Network. A decentralized, permissionless keeper network.\u201d @hexonaut   MIP63c4-SP3: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network \u201cGelato Network is Web3\u2019s automation network, enabling developers to automate a wide variety of arbitrary smart contract executions on and across all EVM-based compatible blockchains such as Ethereum.\u201d @hexonaut   MIP4c2-SP17\tRapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) \u201cThe current bug bounty payment process is adequate for large payouts, but inconvenient for small payouts. This MIP adds a small payout process.\u201d @Psychonaut   MIP13c3-SP12: Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds \u201cAs of writing, around 60% of the MakerDAO balance sheet is in stablecoin. We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos. MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter.\u201d @SebVentures   MIP40c3-SP60 Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget \u201cThis budget consists of two key parts, retroactive compensation for @LongForWisdom and an MKR Compensation framework for GovAlpha. Overall, this proposal would commit 227.64 MKR to GovAlpha contributors, covering MKR compensation for the Core Unit from its inception. This is approximately 67.06 MKR/FTE/Year. Subsequent requests will take place every 6 months, featuring the same 12-month cliff. Contributors do not forfeit their vesting upon leaving GovAlpha, providing that their departure is a smooth transition and there have been no serious ethical breaches.\u201d @Prose11   MIP40c3-SP59: GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 \u201cMIP40c3-SP59 adds a 12-month DAI budget of 1,109,793 DAI for the GovAlpha Core Unit starting in April 2022. This will be implemented via a 89,983 DAI per month stream and an initial transfer of 30,000 DAI.\u201d @LongForWisdom   MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) \u201cMIP40c3-SP61 modifies the Dai budget for the Real-World Finance Core Unit. Based on the new vision for structured finance applications 1, which includes a more thorough legal review process, and the currently available funds, a higher budget cap is proposed to ensure the proper operations of the Core Unit.\u201d @williamr    MIP41c5-SP5: Facilitators OffboardingThis proposal offboards the MakerDAO Shop Core Unit   \u201cAfter wasting everyone\u2019s time and delivering zero results --both in terms of branding or monetary-- we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several miles higher.\u201d @Deimos    These Ratification Polls will run until Monday, March 28.     Poll Extract Author     MIP4c3-SP1: Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount \u201cThe reward for Critical website and application bug reports was not specified as intended. The reward was specified at 100,000 DAI \u201cif the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote.\u201d This part is clear. \u201cAll other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 50,000. The words no more than suggest that an inequality is intended. That is, bounty <= $50k instead of bounty = $50k. We omit the words \u201cno more than\u201d to obtain the intended reward mechanics.\u201d  @psychonaut    This proposal has entered the weekly cycle and will run for three days, until Wednesday, March 16th.  Latest Proposals in RFC    Last week came with several new proposals that are now in RFC. They are all eligible to enter April\u2019s Governance Cycle.     Proposal Extract Author     MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution \u201cThe MIP intends to 1)Set up a starting Liquid Bond Strategy to replace part of the Maker USDC funds; 2) select a professional fund manager for the execution of the above strategy; 3) set up a Maker Execution and Governance Operating platform necessary for implementation; 4)implement and Deploy USDC [TBD]; 5) devise a staged plan for further deployment.\u201d Allan_Pedersen   MIP66: Pairwyse Licensure \u201cPairwyse is an active protocol and blueprint for creating bespoke fixed-rate DAI lending and investment Agreements on MakerDAO between borrowers and lenders. We wish to thank the Maker Community for its previous feedback concerning the negative impact of patents on open source projects and potential concentration risks posed by fixed-rate innovations currently incubating in the Maker ecosystem. In posting this MIP, we wish to directly address these shared concerns with a fresh proposal we feel is favorable for Maker DAO, its contributors, its users and all current and future DeFi innovators throughout the collective ecosystem.\u201d Akiva   MIP39c2-SP30: Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001 (Mandate Refresh) \u201cThe Governance Communications Core Unit performs a set of programs that focus on MakerDAO\u2019s informational accessibility, stakeholder coordination, and communication practices as a decentralized and public organization.\u201d DavidUtro   MIP67: Methodology Review and Process for Structured Finance Transactions \u201cMIP67 intends to formalise the methodology and high-level process to evaluate structured finance transactions made under the MIP6 application process.\u201d williamr   MIP6c3-SP2: Modify the collateral application form \u201cThe goal is therefore to amend the collateral application template to contain relevant questions that allow Core Units and the MakerDAO community to more easily make an informed opinion on whether or not a collateral type is fit to be greenlit to be onboarded into the Maker Protocol.\u201d monkey.irish   MIP68: Monetalis Vault V2 \u201cMIP68 is a self-contained collateral onboarding MIP that will onboard and activate a RWA vault backed by the assets of a trust arranged by Monetalis.\u201d AllanPedersen   MIP40c3-SP65/66, MIP41c4-SP33, MIP39c2-SP32: Events Core Unit Onboarding (EVENTS-001) \u201cThe Events Core Unit will handle planning, organization, and execution of MakerDAO branded events. Our vision is to use an exhaustive list of themes, visuals, set dressing, technology and branding to carry out events to the highest standards for the MakerDAO community.\u201d PonJerry   MIP55c3-SP3: ETHAmsterdam Event SPF \u201cThe purpose of this sub proposal is to allocate 50,000 DAI for the MakerDAO event in Amsterdam scheduled between April 20-24, 2022.\u201d PonJerry   MIP4c2-SP18: MIP7 Amendments \u201cDue to the expansion of the MakerDAO Core Units (CU) and the focus on crypto native and real world assets (RWA), a Domain Team is requested to be added to better support the collateral onboarding process: Collateral Engineering Services Team\u201d monkey.irish   MIP7c3-SP7: CES Domain Team Onboarding \u201cCollateral Engineering Services Domain Team is a new Domain Team proposed in MIP4c2-SP18 and is currently in RFC.\u201d monkey.irish   MIP4c3-SP2: MIP62 Amendments  \u201cThis subproposal amends MIP62c2 1 and MIP62c3 to reflect the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) that occurred with the passage of MIP41c5-SP3 and MIP40c3-SP49.\u201d Patrick_J   MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments \u201cRecent events (see RWF-001 facilitator and MKR-001 offboardings below) have shown the process for involuntarily offboarding facilitators and core units could be improved. These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.\u201d gfxlabs   MIP40c3-SP67: Modify Core Unit Budget - Strategic Happiness (SH-001) \u201cMIP40c3-SP67 updates the budget to expand the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001.It includes a proposal for a new budget breakdown for DAI and MKR\u201d aburban90   MIP40c3-SP62: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 \u201cMIP40c3-SP62 slightly modifies the existing budget for COM-001 and extends funding to the end of December 2022.\u201d DavidUtro   MIP40c3-SP63: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 \u201cMIP40c3-SP63 significantly modifies the existing budget for COM-001, adding a fourth FTE, and extends funding to the end of December 2022.The passing of this proposal is contingent on the passing of SP62, a parallel budget proposal.\u201d DavidUtro   MIP40c3-SP64: Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget \u201cThis subproposal adds the budget for Data Insights Core Unit. It\u2019s a regular monthly budget of 88,600.00 DAI from May 2022 until April 2023, included\u201d tmierzwa    MIP39c2-SP31: Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate \" This subproposal modifies the Data Insights Core Unit (\u201cDIN\u201d) mandate previously ratified with MIP39c2-SP22. It\u2019s mostly about simplification of the previous document and stressing of our focus on L2 and cross-chain data as well as RWA datasets.\" tmierzwa   MIP40c3-SP68: Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget - (PE-001) \u201cThis subproposal is requesting a 12 month Budget of 7,590,000 DAI for the Protocol Engineering Core Unit starting from May 2022. This will be implemented via a 632,500 DAI per month stream using DssVest.\u201d Derek      Things to Come    The last day of modifications for proposals expecting to enter April\u2019s Governance Cycle is March 30, 2022! The next Formal Submission Window will be open from Monday, April 4th through Wednesday 6th. To enter May\u2019s Governance Cycle, a proosal must be posted on the forum on April 6th at the latest.    oh btw  Do you know that every piece of feedback that you give to proposals gives you +1 karma in some possible universe (that might be this one), and that you can trade positive karma for a better next life? We don\u2019t either. For everything MIPs-related: reach out to @gala, @sebix or @blimpa!

The Formal Submission period was from September 7 to September 9.  This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle.   The following proposals were formally submitted to September\u2019s governance cycle:  MIP7c4-SP2: Subproposal to Offboard Smart Contract Domain Team: Mariano Conti  MIP7c4-SP1: Subproposal to Offboard Risk Domain Team: Cyrus Younessi  MIP12c2-SP5: COMP Collateral Onboarding MIP12c2-SP6: LINK Collateral Onboarding MIP12c2-SP4: LRC Collateral Onboarding MIP7c3-SP4: Domain Team Onboarding (Smart Contract Domain Team) MIP7c3-SP3: Domain Team Onboarding (Risk Domain Team) MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism MIP13c3-SP2: Declaration of Intent - Dai Flash Mint Module    Thursday  The Governance Facilitator performed the Submission Review on the weekly Governance and Risk call to determine which of the nine formally submitted MIPs/Subproposals may be put forth for Inclusion Polls on Monday, September 14.  Result : Seven of the nine proposals were confirmed to move forward to Inclusion Polls.  The reason the two domain team offboarding proposals were not confirmed to move forward was that the mandated actors (with acknowledgment from the community) determined it was best suited for all Maker stakeholders that a mandated actor can offboard themselves voluntarily (without governance) as long as it comes with open communication to the governance community via a forum post / subproposal.  This will be the minimum requirement for domain team/mandated actor offboarding and will serve as reference/proof that the mandated actor did indeed voluntarily offboard themself.      This Week\u2019s Activity (September 14 - September 18) Monday   Inclusion Polls for the formally submitted MIPs/SPs were be proposed on Monday, September 14. The polls ended today with the following results:   MIP12c2-SP5: COMP Collateral Onboarding: PASSED   MIP12c2-SP6: LINK Collateral Onboarding: PASSED   MIP12c2-SP4: LRC Collateral Onboarding: PASSED   MIP7c3-SP4: Domain Team Onboarding (Smart Contract Domain Team): PASSED   MIP7c3-SP3: Domain Team Onboarding (Risk Domain Team): PASSED   MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism: PASSED   MIP13c3-SP2: Declaration of Intent - Dai Flash Mint Module: PASSED     Thursday  The Governance Facilitator performed the Inclusion Poll Review and confirmed that all of the proposed MIPs/Subproposals would be included in the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll the following Monday, September 21.  Next Week\u2019s Activity (September 21 - September 25) Monday  On September 21, the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll will be published for the seven proposals that passed the Inclusion poll stage. The poll will run for three days ending on Thursday, September 24, at noon EDT.  Thursday  The Governance Facilitator will perform the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting and confirm the poll\u2019s outcomes in preparation for Week 4\u2019s MIPs Executive Vote that will occur on Monday, September 28.

MIP63c4-SP4: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network\"This is a budget amendment application for Keep3r Network: a decentralized and permissionless keeper network.\"  @0xPEPO Medium Yes      \u2026 which should have entered May\u2019s Governance Cycle. It will instead enter June\u2019s. As posted elsewhere:  Due to an oversight (of which I\u2019m particularly responsible) this proposal didn\u2019t make it into May\u2019s Governance Cycle. Instead, it will enter June\u2019s Governance Cycle, with its Ratification Poll going up on Monday 13. We\u2019re sorry for the somewhat eccentric situation. Because of this mistake, this proposal may not have been reviewed by the Maker Community. We encourage @Recognized-Delegates and other community members to voice opinions on this proposal ASAP.  A post mortem is forthcoming.  Short Ratification Polls    We\u2019ve had two Short Ratification Polls closing last Thursday:     Proposal Author Impact Estimation Ratification Poll     MIP10c19-SP1: Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles @NikKunkel Medium   Voting Portal    MIP10c7-SP2 - Modify Oracle Data Models @NikKunkel Medium  Voting Portal     Both Ratification Polls passed with 100% positive votes.  Proposals in RFC      \u2014 RFC and FS Dates for reference and for existing proposals can be seen on this proposal tracker. If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  The following proposals under the RFC subcategory will benefit from your feedback:     Proposal Author Impact Estimation      MIP4c2-SP21: Add Retrospection Process to prune unused MIPs\"Bureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning. The goal of the Retrospection Process is to surface a process to help prune unused or low-utility MIPs.

I laid down my reasoning here, but don\u2019t click away \u2013 I\u2019ll just copypaste them here:  I may be wrong, but I feel this proposal assumes the community will be paying attention to Retrospection Dates and act on them, while at the same time implicitly acknowleding (or is this just me misreading between the lines?) that engagement with proposals is not optimal. So I feel it\u2019s presupposing what it\u2019s trying to achieve. It assumes that community members will:  Pay attention to Retrospection Dates. When a proposal past its Retrospection Date is detected, consult with Facilitators whether the proposal is still useful. Where it\u2019s not, remove it via a MIP4c2 subproposal; where it is, post a MIP0c15 (in tandem with a MIP4c2 for greater good, but not sure what the incentive is) to update its Retrospection Date.  I\u2019m having a hard time picturing this. However, there is something to be said for retrospection dates. We don\u2019t have any such (internal) process in place currently. The pruning, however, is part of GovAlpha\u2019s Year-Ahead Plans.  I think the changes introduced by this amendment would just add to the stack of stuff that we will be pruning eventually. ",

My rationale was that it fits the criteria set out in the initial impact estimations post that:   Anything that permanently changes governance processes or structures within MakerDAO will likely be marked as high impact.   The addition of a retrospection process is certainly a permanent change to the governance process within MakerDAO. Happy to discuss whether or not we should have been more lenient on this occasion, or whether the high impact definition needs to be tweaked. Remember, impact estimates are just estimates and also:   We\u2019re not infallible, use these estimates as a guide and not as a source of truth. If you have input on any specific estimate, feel free to bring it up in discord or in the relevant forum thread. In most cases (at least to start with) we will escalate impact estimates if requested by a member of the community.   ",

Things to Come    The Formal Submission Window for January opens on Monday 3rd (20 days from now) and closes on Wednesday 5th. Since proposals must remain unchanged for one full week before their Formal Submission, the last day for modifications is December 29, 2021.  You can see all MIP-relevant dates for 2022 on the freshly updated MIP RFC and Formal Submission Dates post.   oh btw  If you have an idea for a proposal and have no idea how to go about making it into a Maker Improvement Proposal, this may be useful. If you\u2019re confused about the dates for the Feedback Period, the Frozen Period, and/or the Formal Submission, please check this forum post.

                    "content": "Last Week\u2019s Activity Monday  An Inclusion Poll for the Core Personnel Onboarding of @LongForWisdom was published. This poll determined that the subproposal to add @LongForWisdom as a Governance Facilitator would proceed to the Governance Poll in Week 3.  Thursday  Last Thursday, the Inclusion Poll for the Core Personnel Onboarding of @LongForWisdom passed with the following results: 5,529.13 MKR > 403.99 MKR + 3000 MKR (Default Inclusion threshold). On Thursday\u2019s Governance call, the Governance Facilitator and community members reviewed the Inclusion Poll results. The result of the review confirmed that the proposal at hand would be included in the Governance Poll that went live this Monday (2020-05-18). In addition to the review of the Inclusion Poll Review, @LongForWisdom introduced two new MIPs (MIP13: Declarations of Intent & MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer) and announced that they have entered the Request for Comments (RFC) phase. The intention is to formally submit both of these MIPs in June\u2019s Governance Cycle.  This Week\u2019s Activity (Week 3 of the Governance Cycle) Monday  The Governance Facilitator submitted a Governance Poll for the Core Personnel Onboarding of LongForWisdom to be added as Governance Facilitator. This poll is still live until Thursday at noon EST (running for a total of three days)! The purpose of the Governance Poll is to determine if the subproposal to add  @LongForWisdom  should proceed to the final Executive Vote in Week 4 of the Governance Cycle.  Thursday  Tomorrow, the Governance Poll for Core Personnel Onboarding formally comes to an end, and the Governance Facilitator will perform the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting in which they confirm the outcome of the Governance Poll in preparation for Week 4 of the Governance Cycle.  Next Week (Last Week of the Governance Cycle): Monday  The Executive Vote will be submitted if the Governance Facilitator confirms the \u2018yes\u2019 outcome of the Governance Poll during Week 3\u2019s Thursday governance meeting.  Executive Vote Details:  The vote will have an expiration of 4 days, after which it has no effect. MIPs and subproposals only move to the \u2018Accepted\u2019 status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 4-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 4-day limit, the MIPs and subproposals have their status changed to \u2018Rejected.\u2019    The first Community Greenlight Poll is Published (Collateral Onboarding)  The Community Greenlight poll will be published. The purpose of this poll is to give direction about what to do next regarding the active MIP6 applications. In general, the Community Greenlight polls will be published on the 4th Monday of the month to the 4th Friday of the month. The polls will run for two weeks. For further context, the Community Greenlight process is defined in MIP9. MIP9 defines the process by which MKR Token Holders can signal their judgment on the value of a potential collateral type before domain teams spend time thoroughly investigating its inclusion into the Maker Protocol. While domain teams are free to choose their workload, the on-chain governance polls provide the Domain Teams critical insights into the community\u2019s sentiment for each collateral type that has been proposed via a MIP6 application. In addition to this, it is crucial to gather the opinion of MKR Token Holders towards the proposed collateral asset before the full domain work takes place. This process helps prevent work from being wasted on undesirable collateral types.    Thursday  The Governance Facilitator will perform the Governance Cycle Review as part of the governance and risk meeting, in which they summarize and discuss the past Governance Cycle with the community. This meeting is also an opportunity to discuss the upcoming governance cycle and potential submissions for the next governance cycle.  In Other News Collateral Onboarding  With respect to the transition to the collateral onboarding framework, I want to re-emphasize that we are all still in the transition period from the current collateral onboarding practices to the MIPs process. During this period, the community will continue to use the weekly cycle format for collateral onboarding this month. Given that the Community Greenlight poll results will conclude two weeks after they are posted, the MIP12 proposals that include the domain work for the agreed-upon collateral assets will not be ready for June\u2019s governance cycle. In summary, this means that the domain teams will determine which assets they intend to work on and begin work on the deliverables throughout the month of June.  Related Community Calls   Community Collateral Onboarding Call (2020-05-20)   Agenda:  Continue the discussion that started last week on the Governance and Risk call regarding the [PC-DROP] and [CF-DROP] application. Go through other applications (such as [FIAT]) that are awaiting Domain Team Greenlight.   Video Recording    ",

More specifically, it defines two phases:   Phase 1:  when a core governance framework is put in place and a functional collateral onboarding process is ratified.  Phase 2:  when the Problem Space is in the process of being addressed with MIPs and MIP Sets.  To answer your question, we are currently in Phase 1 of this process. Phase 1 states that if a MIP is rejected, it can be reintroduced to the community for another vote once the issues that resulted in its initial rejection have been addressed. So, it is not his \u201cone shot\u201d  ",

In addition, edits to MIP38, MIP39, and MIP41 fill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates. This comprehensive set of changes should inspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.

If you have any questions about the voting process at MakerDAO, the Practical Guide to Voting will be useful.  Proposals in RFC galore!

This MIP Set deprecates MIP61: Delegate Compensation.  @Patrick_J High TBD    IS-001 (Immunefi Security) Offboarding Proposals The author of the proposal has stated that they are willing to keep the proposal in RFC indefinitely after a compromise has been reached.\u201cThe functions of IS-001 do not require a Core Unit, and should be reduced to contracted services by Core Units that wish to retain Immunefi (the company). This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone. And so this Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.\u201d  @Ippy High Link    SH-001 (Strategic Happiness) Offboarding Proposals\u201cThe functions of SH-001 do not require a Core Unit. The budget is a significant outlier given the high cost and niche function. Burban should be integrated into growth. The Core Unit is an unnecessary expense and currently represents 64k in monthly costs. It is not essential in a bear market.\u201d  @CodeKnight High TBD    MIP41c4-SP38: Immunefi Security Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding (Psychonaut)\u201cAdd @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.\u201d  @Psychonaut High TBD    MIP4c2-SP24: Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics[These subproposals] split the current Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) into two separate Core Units and allocate the existing RWF-001 personnel and budget between the two separate Core Units.  @GFXLabs High TBD    MIP4c2-SP21: Add Retrospection Process to prune unused MIPs Will not be formally submitted until some issues have been addressed\u201cBureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning. The goal of the Retrospection Process is to surface a process to help prune unused or low-utility MIPs. This process also helps introduce and familiarize the broader community with MIPs that continue to be used.\u201d  @psychonaut High TBD    MIP72: Delegated Collateral Attachment - RWA Arranger Application - 6s Capital\u201cMIP72 authorizes 6s Capital as a Real World Asset Arranger for MakerDAO to cause commerce by assembling commercial senior-secured transactions based on the authorization #001 outlined herein.\u201d  @mrabino1 High TBD     Things to Come    The August monthly-cycle Ratification Polls will close on Monday, August 22.

The poll passed successfully    Thursday  The Governance Facilitator performed the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting, in which the outcome of the Governance Poll was confirmed in preparation for the Executive Vote to be submitted on the following Monday.  This Week\u2019s Activity Monday  The Executive Vote to ratify @LongForWisdom as a Governance Facilitator went live on Monday. The vote successfully passed on Thursday, officially onboarding LFW as the second governance facilitator   The subproposal can now be formally assigned the \u2018Accepted\u2019 status.    The first Community Greenlight Polls were published on Monday  The community greenlight polls will run for two weeks as of this past Monday, ending on June 8. There is a total of 11 polls waiting to be voted on!       Thursday  The Governance Facilitator performed the Governance Cycle Review   During the review, I summarized and discussed the past Governance Cycle as well as the upcoming governance cycle and potential submissions for June.  Governance Cycle Recap (May)  The first governance cycle has come to an end   The first proposal to go through the governance cycle was successfully ratified. With the passing of this proposal, Maker now officially has a second Governance Facilitator! Three new MIPs were proposed over the month:   MIP13: Declarations of Intent  MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer  MIP15: Dark Fix Mechanism These proposals are in the Request for Comments (RFC) phase, so be sure to give feedback on them     Lastly, as we went through the first governance cycle and learned about what works and what can be improved, there were four Amendment MIPs published to further improve the governance cycle flow and allow the collateral onboarding process to be more efficient.  Next Week\u2019s Activity (The first Week of the 2nd Governance Cycle) Monday  The first week of the second governance cycle begins on June 1. The formal submission period for June\u2019s governance cycle is from June 1- June 4. This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle    Thursday  The Governance Facilitators will do the Submission Review as part of the governance meeting and determine which of the proposed MIPs/Subproposals are in accordance with guidelines (defined in the MIP0 Framework) and should be included in the inclusion polls.  Collateral Onboarding Updates  Both the TUSD and USDC-B Governance polls passed this Thursday successfully    USDC-B Poll   TUSD Poll    The Executive Vote to officially add both the USDC-B and TUSD collateral types to the Maker Protocol went live today. Go vote! The community greenlight polls are currently in progress and will run for ~9 more days ending on Monday, June 8.  Lastly, since I got quite a few questions during the week regarding how the Community Greenlight Polls are scored, I wanted to go over it briefly in this update. The polls are scored as follows:   Score = Yes Votes - No Votes Score > 0 = Greenlit Score < 0 = Deferred   Note that the Community Greenlight poll scores are used to provide a reasonable first approximation of which assets domain teams should prioritize. However, this prioritization is not binding on the domain teams. Domain teams are free to determine the order in which they perform domain greenlight and domain work.    /fin ",

Next Week\u2019s Activity (January 18 - January 22) Monday  The Monthly MIPs Governance Poll will be published for the six proposals that passed the Inclusion poll stage. This bundled poll will run for three days ending on Thursday, January 21.  Thursday  The Governance Facilitator (@LongForWisdom) will perform the Governance Poll Review to confirm the poll\u2019s outcomes in preparation for the MIPs Executive Vote\u2019s that will go out on Monday, January 25.  MIPs Activity Proposals in the Conception Stage:   MIP33: Maker Stability Price Module  This proposal allows Maker governance to defend an MKR price by pre-allocating dai to buy at a pre-defined level.    MIP35: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure - With Farming  This proposal defines a new Peg Stability Module which converts USDC to DAI and DAI to USDC, during the conversion it lends and farms the gem via a lender token and leverages the position using cDai using the same technique to farm it.    MIP36: Peg Stability - Compound Governance Dai Leverage  This proposal defines a Peg stabilizer actionable only by governance, which uses a flash minting technique paired with either MIP35 or MIP32 for Dai lending in order to leverage MakerDAO\u2019s position on cDai.    Proposals in the Request for Comments (RFC) Stage: MIPs   MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module  This proposal provides a smart contract implementation of a Streaming Payments System for Maker.    MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign  This proposal defines DssGov, a contract replacement for DSChief that comes with improved security, usability, and functionality for holders of the Maker governance token (MKR).    MIP31: Active Reserve AMM (dss-ara)  This is a technical proposal for an active reserve based on the Uniswap V2 contract.    MIP32: Peg Stability Module for Compound Mixed Exposure  This proposal provides an extension for the PSM. The extension allows the PSM to leverage USDC via dai using cDai. It also converts USDC to cUSDC using the same join adaptor (lending join).    Subproposals   MIP13c3-SP9: Onboarding a new collateral type backed by B.Protocol (Declaration of Intent)  This proposal asks Maker Governance to declare its intention to experiment a native integration with B.Protocol.

In addition, edits to MIP38, MIP39, and MIP41 fill in process gaps, or streamline them, with additional documentation and/or templates. This comprehensive set of changes should inspire substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.

I\u2019ve updated it for the V2 rewrite which covers all external protocols that allow users to deposit / withdraw DAI. I\u2019ve updated the MIP to remove details of the targeting mechanism as that is no longer important.\u201d  High   Voting Portal      Proposals in RFC   We have a couple of new proposals adding to our extense RFC list this week. There\u2019s still time to leave your feedback, so get a coffee and enjoy the reading!

Newest additions to the proposals in RFC have been placed at the top of the table and marked with .     MIP Author Impact Estimation Summary      MIP4c2-SP25: MIP65 AmendmentsMIP65 requires a certification from the RWF-001 Facilitator and the \u201cin SES-incubation\u201d Facilitator of the prospective Legal and Transactional Services Core Unit (LTS). As the circumstances regarding RWF-001/LTS have changed, the RWF-001 Facilitator requests this certification requirement to be moved elsewhere. This subproposal amends MIP65 accordingly.  @Allan_Pedersen High TBD    MIP55c3-SP8: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose FundThis SPF reimburses the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) team for advancing funds to @christiancdpetersen for the legal work he is doing on MIP65.  @adcv High TBD    MIP55c3-SP7: Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador ProgramThis subproposal aims to allocate 81,000 DAI to the Ambassador Program.  @kat High Link    MIP55c3-SP6: Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund This subproposal is eligible to enter the Weekly Governance Cycle, as per MIP55.SPF to request 50k DAI advance for legal expenses relating to domain work in the context of greenlit bIBTA application.  @adcv High Link    Core Unit Onboarding: RWF-0x Splitting Off RWF-001[These subproposals] split the current Real World Finance Core Unit (RWF-001) into two separate Core Units and allocate the existing RWF-001 personnel and budget between the two separate Core Units.  @christiancdpetersen High Link    MIP40c3-SP80: Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget - Q3 2022This budget proposes a MKR compensation for GovAlpha (GOV-001) with a vesting component (Q3 2022).  @prose11 High Link    SF-001 Offboarding Proposal Set[These subproposals] is to offboard Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001).  @deimos High Link    MIP40c3-SP79: MKR Compensation for StarkeNet Engineering Core Unit (SNE-001)MIP40c3-SP79 adds the MKR Compensation budget for Core Unit SNE-001: Starknet Engineering Core Unit.  @pyramidmaker High Link    MakerDAO Delegates MIP SetThese three MIPs formalize delegates within the MIP framework and establish how they are to be compensated. This MIP Set deprecates MIP61: Delegate Compensation.  @Patrick_J High TBD    IS-001 (Immunefi Security) Offboarding Proposals The author of the proposal has stated that they are willing to keep the proposal in RFC indefinitely after a compromise has been reached.\u201cThe functions of IS-001 do not require a Core Unit, and should be reduced to contracted services by Core Units that wish to retain Immunefi (the company). This is expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI a month in personnel cost savings alone. And so this Core Unit should be granted severance and offboarded.\u201d  @Ippy High Link    SH-001 (Strategic Happiness) Offboarding Proposals\u201cThe functions of SH-001 do not require a Core Unit.

                    "content": "This Week\u2019s Activity (Begining of June\u2019s Governance Cycle) Monday (June 1)  Monday began the first week of the second governance cycle. The formal submission period for June\u2019s governance cycle was from June 1 - June 3, when MIPs/Subproposals are Formally Submitted to enter the governance cycle and await the approval of the governance facilitators to proceed to the next stage of the governance cycle (Inclusion polls).  This month, nine proposals formally requested to enter the governance cycle:  MIP13: Declarations of Intent MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding MIP12c2-SP2: Domain Work Requirements for KNC  MIP12c2-SP1: Domain Work Requirements for ZRX   Thursday (June 5)  During the weekly Governance and Risk Call, the Governance Facilitators (@rich.brown and @LongForWisdom) performed a Submission Review and determined which of the nine proposed MIPs/Subproposals should be included in inclusion polls next Monday.  The Proposals that will proceed to next week\u2019s inclusion polls (7 total) are:  MIP13: Declarations of Intent MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding  Note: The two MIP12 Subproposals to add KNC and ZRX were not formally accepted to enter the governance cycle due to some missing work requirements in the proposals. Note that the subproposals were declined as part of the MIPs process, but will instead use the weekly cycle until we can clean up and clarify the format for proposing MIP12 subproposals and figure out what exactly needs to be included in MIP12 subproposals going forward. Next Week\u2019s Activity Monday (June 8)  The Inclusion polls will go out on Monday for the seven MIPs/Subproposals to determine if they should proceed to the Governance Polls in Week 3. The polls will officially end at noon (EST) on Thursday, June 11.   Reminder: Inclusion Polls occur when the governance community (MKR Holders) decides which proposals they want to proceed to the next step of the Governance Cycle. The Inclusion Polls allow MKR holders to have a significant impact early on in the Governance Cycle and serve as the threshold to necessitate the attention of a Governance Poll. For an Inclusion poll to successfully pass, the yes votes must be greater than the  Default Inclusion Threshold  plus the no votes. The default inclusion threshold is set to 3000 MKR.    Thursday (June 11)  On Thursday, there will be an Inclusion Poll Review as a part of the Governance and Risk call, where the Governance Facilitators (with support from the community) will confirm the proposals that will be put up for Governance Polls on the following Monday (June 15).  In Other News Collateral Onboarding Updates  The Executive vote passed yesterday to officially onboard the TUSD and USDC-B collateral types to the Maker Protocol. The Community Greenlight polls are still in progress for the next ~3 days, so don\u2019t forget to vote!  MIPs Forum Updates  A New MIPs Forum Subcategory was added for Community members to discuss ideas for future Maker Improvement Proposals. The Proposal Ideas Category can be found here!  ",

                    "content": "Last Week\u2019s Activity (June 8 -12) Monday  The seven Inclusion Polls went out on Monday, June 8, and ended on Thursday, June 11, at noon EST.  Thursday  The Governance Facilitators performed the Inclusion Poll Review for the seven polls. They confirmed which of the proposals can be included in the Governance Poll next Monday. All of the proposals, except MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer, were confirmed to move to Monday\u2019s Governance Poll.  Note that MIP14 may be reintroduced to the community for another vote once the issues that resulted in its initial rejection have been addressed. If you have any feedback regarding MIP14, such as suggested improvements or arguments against, please comment on the forum post with your reasoning so that the Author can work to resolve them.    This Week\u2019s Activity (June 15-19) Monday  Tomorrow, the Governance Poll will be published for the proposals that passed the Inclusion poll stage. The poll will run for three days ending on Thursday, June 18, at noon EST.  To reiterate the purpose of the Governance Poll, it is to determine if the proposals at hand should proceed to the final Executive Vote in Week 4 of the Governance Cycle, ultimately determining if they should become officially ratified or rejected.    The Proposals that will proceed to the Governance Poll on Monday, June 15 are:  MIP13: Declarations of Intent MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding  Thursday  This Thursday (June 18), the Governance Facilitators will perform the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting and confirm the governance outcomes of the poll in preparation for Week 4\u2019s Executive vote.  In Other News Collateral Onboarding Updates   @Mariano_Conti and members of the TUSD team spoke towards the TUSD Token Upgrades - video. Two Governance Polls for onboarding the KNC and ZRX collateral types to the Maker Protocol will go out on Monday, June 15, as a part of the Weekly Cycle. The Governance Polls will determine if the collateral types should proceed to an Executive vote on Friday, June 26 ultimately determining if they will be officially added to the Maker Protocol. The May 25 Community Greenlight polls have concluded, and the Collateral Status Index has been updated to reflect which of the collateral types have been greenlit. The next Community Greenlight polls will go out on June 22 in the final week of June\u2019s governance cycle.   Note: If the amendments MIPs (more specifically, MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments) pass at the end of the month, the Community Greenlight Polls will start on the 3rd Monday of the month and will run for two full weeks. This change allows the Community Greenlight Polls to conclude at the end of the governance cycle instead of carrying over to the following month\u2019s cycle.    A New \u2018Proposal Ideas\u2019 Post Was Submitted  A \u201cpre-MIP\u201d discussion started last Wednesday regarding a redesign of the Maker Protocol\u2019s liquidation system. The main goal of this \u201cpre-MIP\u201d forum post is to introduce a proposed solution for a liquidation system redesign and gather feedback in preparation for the creation of a formal Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP), which will contain more implementation details. I encourage all community members to take a look and provide feedback when you have the time.  A New MIPs Forum Subcategory Added   Polls and Votes  This read-only category will be dedicated to providing more awareness and notification of what is going in terms of voting during the current governance cycle. It will offer a go-to place to find the active Inclusion polls, Governance polls, or Executives Votes that are related to MIPs.  Note: The category was just created and is currently empty, but I will be updating it for the Governance Poll tomorrow.    /fin ",

MIP4c2-SP1: MIP6 Amendments MIP4c2-SP2: MIP8 Amendments MIP4c2-SP3: MIP9 Amendments MIP4c2-SP4: MIP12 Amendments MIP7c3-SP2: Subproposal Adding a Risk Domain Team Onboarding MIP13: Declarations of Intent   Four polls also went out for Whitelisting Oracles:  DeFi Saver on ETHUSD Oracle DeFi Saver on BATUSD Oracle DeFi Saver on WBTCUSD Oracle MCDEX on ETH/USD Oracle   Lastly, eight polls went out for Appointing and Proposing New Light Feeds. More specifically for:  Kyber Network Infura Etherscan Gitcoin    Note: All the Whitelisting Oracles and New Light Feed proposals that passed the governance poll stage will likely be confirmed in the Executive Vote on June 26 (earliest date). Thursday (June 18)  The MIPs Governance poll passed with zero no votes! The Governance Facilitators performed the Governance Poll Review as part of the weekly governance meeting. They confirmed that the six proposals (highlighted in the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll) would proceed to today\u2019s Executive Vote. Video recording   This Week\u2019s Activity (June 22-26) Monday (June 22)  Today, the Executive Vote to officially ratify the six proposals will be published.  The vote will have an expiration of 4 days, after which it has no effect. Note that proposals only move to the \u2018Accepted\u2019 status if the executive vote they are included in passes within the 4-day limit. If the executive vote fails to pass within the 4-day deadline, the proposals will have their status changed to \u2018Rejected.\u2019    Thursday (June 25)  The Governance Facilitators will perform the Governance Cycle Review as part of the governance and risk meeting, in which they summarize and discuss the past Governance Cycle with the community. This meeting is also an opportunity to discuss the upcoming governance cycle and potential submissions for the next governance cycle.  Note about July\u2019s Governance Cycle:  Even though the next governance cycle is a few weeks away, I want to note that the formal submission period is July 8. If you have any proposals in progress, submitting them for review sooner rather than later is a good idea!  In Other News Collateral Onboarding  The two governance polls to onboard KNC and ZRX have successfully passed. They will proceed to an Executive vote at the end of the week, on Friday, June 26. Today, the new Community Greenlight polls will go out. This month\u2019s Community Greenlight Polls are for:  LEND MATIC PAXG LINK ENJ WKT    Note that if the amendments MIPs pass at the end of this month, the Community Greenlight polls will start on the 3rd week of the governance cycle ending at the end of the governance cycle instead of carrying over to the following month. MIPs Forum Subcategories Updates  Proposal Ideas  This category is for community members to post and discuss any proposal ideas to improve the Maker Protocol and Maker Governance System.  The \u201cpre-MIP\u201d discussion for a redesign of the Maker Protocol\u2019s liquidation system is still going strong. Again, I encourage everyone to take a look when you have time. There are now three other posts in the Proposal Ideas category! More specifically, the proposals are for:  Soft Locks and Future Guidance Bounties & Grants to improve governance and MKR protocol Decentralized MakerBroker     Polls and Votes   This read-only category will be dedicated to providing more awareness/notification of what is going on during the governance cycle in terms of voting. It provides a go-to place to see the active Inclusion polls, Governance polls, and Executive Votes related to MIPs.  /fin ",

The Executive successfully passed on Thursday, June 25, at 18:42 UTC.  The six proposals can now officially move to the \u2018Accepted\u2019 status on the MIPs Github repository.    Thursday (June 25)  The Governance Facilitators (Rich and LongForWisdom) performed the Governance Cycle Review, summarizing June\u2019s Governance Cycle and opening up the floor for feedback and questions from the community.  This Week\u2019s Activity (June 29 - July 3)  No polls or votes this week! The July Governance Cycle officially begins on July 6. The Formal Submission period will run from July 6 to July 8. This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle. If you have any proposals in progress, I encourage you to submit them for review on the forums if you intend to propose them for July\u2019s Governance Cycle.  In Other News Oracles  The Whitelisting Oracles and New Light Feed proposals that passed the governance poll stage will be put up in an Executive Vote this Friday.  See last week\u2019s update for the links to the proposals here.     Collateral Onboarding  The Executive Vote to add KNC and ZRX to the Maker Protocol successfully passed. Both collateral types are now officially added to the Maker Protocol.  The Executive Vote also raised the Dai Savings Rate Spread from 0% to 0.25% and the Base Rate from 0% to 0.25%.   The Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls will run for seven more days. This month\u2019s Community Greenlight Polls are for the following collateral types:  LEND MATIC PAXG LINK ENJ WKT KNC    Important Note: Now that the MIPs Executive Vote passed, the Community Greenlight polls will now start to begin during the 3rd week (Monday) of the governance cycle and conclude at the end of the monthly governance cycle. MIPs Forum Subcategories Updates This category is for community members to post and discuss proposal ideas to improve the Maker Protocol or the Maker Governance system. There was only one new entry this week:   Adding a poll to prioritize collateral applications by @Andy_McCall   ",

                    "content": " Last Week\u2019s Activity (October 5 - 9)  Monday  Monday marked the first week of October\u2019s Governance Cycle. The Formal Submission period ran from October 5 to October 7. The following ten proposals were formally submitted:  MIPs  MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox) MIP21: Real World Assets - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender MIP22: Centrifuge Direct Liquidation Module MIP23: Domain Structure and Roles  Subproposals  MIP13c3-SP5: Declaration of Intent: Maker to commence onboarding work of Centrifuge based Collateral MIP13c3-SP4 Declaration of Intent & Commercial Points - Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets as Collateral for a DAI loan MIP13c3-SP3: Declaration of Intent - Strategic Reserves Fund MIP12c2-SP8: BAL Collateral Onboarding MIP12c2-SP7: YFI Collateral Onboarding   Thursday  The @GovAlpha-Core-Unit performed the Submission Review to determine which of the formally submitted MIPs/Subproposals should be put forth for Inclusion Polls on Monday, October 12.    @LongForWisdom confirmed that eight of the formally submitted proposals would move forward to the Inclusion poll stage. The two proposals that would not go up for Inclusion Polls were the two MIP12-Subproposals for adding BAL and YFI as collateral assets. These proposals were not included because the Governance Poll to take a more flexible and transparent approach to Collateral Onboarding passed, resulting in collateral onboarding to start using the weekly cycle. Therefore, the collateral onboarding proposals did not need to go through the Monthly Governance Cycle.   This Week\u2019s Activity (October 12 - 16)  Monday  The eight Inclusion Polls for the Formally Submitted proposals were proposed and will run until October 15 at noon EDT. You can vote for all eight Inclusion Polls here!   Thursday  During the weekly Governance and Risk Call, the @GovAlpha-Core-Unit will perform the Inclusion Poll Review and determine which proposals are eligible for the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll on Monday (October 19).   Next Week\u2019s Activity (October 19 - 23)  Monday  The Monthly MIPs Governance Poll will be published for the proposals that passed the Inclusion poll stage. The poll will run for three days ending on Thursday, October 22, at noon EDT.  As a reminder, for Inclusion Polls to successfully pass, the Yes votes for a given option in the inclusion poll must be higher than the combination of No votes plus the Default Inclusion Threshold (DIT).  Yes > (No + DIT) = Allows inclusion in the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll. The DIT is set to 3000 MKR.       Thursday  The @GovAlpha-Core-Unit will perform the Governance Poll Review as a part of the Governance and Risk meeting and confirm the poll\u2019s outcomes in preparation for the MIPs Executive Vote\u2019s that will go out on the final Monday (October 26) of October\u2019s Governance Cycle.   Collateral Onboarding Updates  The Governance Poll to take a more Flexible and Transparent Approach to Collateral Onboarding passed today with the following results:  YES - 44,309.54 MKR NO - 0 MKR Therefore, the new weekly collateral onboarding process is now active.   YFI and BAL are currently going through the new weekly cycle collateral onboarding process and are both up for Governance Polls:  Add BAL as a Collateral Type - October 12, 2020 Add YFI as a Collateral Type - October 12, 2020   The Collateral Prioritization Framework will be made public next Monday (October 19)  The Collateral Prioritization Framework will be a publicly shared spreadsheet that anyone in the community can read to understand why certain collateral assets are getting prioritized.   October\u2019s Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls will be published on Monday, October 19. The Polls will cover the following collateral types:    MIPs Activity  Proposals in the Request for Comments (RFC) Stage MIPs  MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments MIP24: Emergency Response MIP25: Flash Mint Module MIP26: DssGov - Governance Contract Redesign MIP27: Debt Ceiling Instant Access Module MIP28: Operational Support Domain Definition  Subproposals  MIP13c3-SP6: SourceCred Funding MIP28c7-SP1: Subproposal for Operational Support Domain Facilitator Onboarding MIP4c2-SP6: Calendar Exceptions   Ongoing Pre-MIP Discussions New Proposal Ideas  FlapperDistributor: A Way to Distribute System Surplus while Minimizing Governance Liquidations 2.0: Technical Summary Replace the mechanism to burn $MKR with a treasury   /fin ",

Our team stands behind this proposal as an optimal solution for scaling the Core Unit in a dynamic environment. We encourage readers to review that post in conjunction with the below budget request.\"  Go to voting page    Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001)\"The Events Core Unit will handle planning, organization, and execution of MakerDAO branded events.

To complete a fast withdrawal, DAI is burnt on L2, minted on L1, and sent to the user as soon as the L2 transaction is confirmed. This MIP focuses on the above L2 to L1 transaction. L2 to L2 transactions will be defined in a future MIP when the full wormhole functionality is ready to be launched.\"  Protocol Engineering (PE-001) May    MIP4c2-SP19: MIP40 Budget Process Amendment Subproposal\"For the DAO to grow long-term, it is critical that MKR holders be able to evaluate and compare Budget Proposals with minimum cognitive overhead. Within this revised MIP, Core Units and proposed Core Units are required to submit standardized, transparent and clear financial information. Budget Proposals must clearly serve a revenue-driving or supporting business purpose in line with the Objectives of the DAO.\"   @Aes, @adcv, @SebVentures  May    MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments\"Recent events have shown the process for involuntarily offboarding facilitators and core units could be improved.

Link   MIP4c2-SP28: Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) The December exception in MIP51 has been made in a time with huge problems on getting anything done in the Maker on-chain governance. This amendment removes the December exception so we can continue to govern the protocol without a break. Link   MIP4c2-SP29: Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics This amendment proposes two changes to the Recognized Delegate Compensation MIP. (i) Setting a minimum threshold of non-abstaining votes for compensation eligibility and (ii) increasing the participation requirements in the case of executive votes. This Ratifcation Poll uses Ranked Choice Voting. Link   MIP4c2-SP31: MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment This amendment to MIP63 defines more strictly how payments are sent and buffers reported. Furthermore, it makes stream durations explicit (versus the current implicit 6-month duration). Finally, the amendment makes it possible for the sequencer to set custom windows per network. Link   MIP4c2-SP32: Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) MIP14c4 places a cap on the total amount of DAI that can be distributed through MIP14. Rather than dealing with sequential subproposals to raise the Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling, or setting it to an arbitrarily high number that renders it useless, it makes more sense to simply remove this restriction. Link   MIP4c4-SP2: MIP14 Repeal In an effort to simplify the growing body of DAO governance processes and policies, this subproposal repeals MIP14 in its entirety due to obsolescence. Link   MIP4c4-SP3: Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) This subproposal removes MIP23 and MIP28 as the Domain framework they define has been superseded. Link   MIP13c3-SP13: Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults Current RWA monitoring is lagging behind as much as 13 months in the case of New Silver. MakerDAO is scaling up RWA vaults for yield and diversification. We need to develop maximum transparency around that. Link   MIP14c2-SP1: Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 This amount will sustain the team, critical infrastructure, tools and services through the month of February. Link   MIP14c2-SP2: Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 This amount will sustain the team and services through May by which point we anticipate dissolving as a Core Unit and becoming an EndGame ecosystem actor. Link   MIP39c3-SP7: Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) This is an offboarding proposal for the GovComms Core Unit that includes both a golden parachute based on salary for the two permanent Core Unit members and retroactive MKR compensation for all contributors. Retroactive MKR compensation is denominated in DAI. Link   MIP55c3-SP12: Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs This SPF requests a 209K DAI transfer to support the expanded SF-001 mandate regarding RWAs. Link   MIP55c3-SP13: Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster This MIP will set up a Special Purpose Fund of 500k DAI to fund a set of RWA projects to be undertaken by the Viridian Cluster 5 within the 6-month period of Jan 2023 - Jun 2023 Link   MI55c3-SP14: Defense Fund This SPF requests 5 million DAI for establishing a Defense Fund which will have the purpose of reimbursing legal defense expenses incurred by active participants of MakerDAO in case they are the target of legal or regulatory action.

It\u2019s important to note that the framework will not be the only tool used when the domain teams choose what collateral assets they will prioritize. Forum Post Announcement    The Community Greenlight Polls for October were published on Monday and will run until November 2. There is a total of 11 polls covering the collateral types displayed in the image below:  Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 4.28.21 PM692\u00d7612 57.8 KB MIPs Activity Proposals in the Request for Comments (RFC) Stage: MIPs  MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments  MIP24: Emergency Response  Recently updated by @DavidU as he joins as one of the proposal\u2019s authors.

Recent examples (see MKT-001 offboarding: 1, 2, 3) have demonstrated several gaps in this process. Ratifying simple changes started small and, along the way, the ambitions grew into revisions for much of the Core Unit MIP Set.\u201d  Medium    MIP4c2-SP21: Add Retrospection Process to prune unused MIPs\u201cBureaucracy tends to grow without active pruning.

                    "content": "Last Week\u2019s Activity (July 20 - 24) Monday  The Monthly MIPs Governance Poll was published for the five proposals that passed the Inclusion poll stage. The poll ran for three days ending last Thursday at noon EDT.  The Governance Poll passed with the following results:  Yes Votes = 18,125.55 MKR No Votes = 0 MKR      Thursday  The Governance Facilitator performed the Governance Poll Review as part of the governance meeting and confirmed the poll\u2019s outcome in preparation for the Monthly MIPs Executive Vote on July 27.  This Week\u2019s Activity (July 27 - 31) Monday  Yesterday, the Monthly Governance Cycle Executive Vote went live and passed today (July 28). Below is a twitter thread on what the implemented changes mean for Maker:  https://twitter.com/CharlieStLouis/status/1288127698263347206    Thursday  The Governance Facilitator will perform the Governance Cycle Review as part of the governance and risk meeting. This includes summarizing and discussing July\u2019s Governance Cycle with the community. This meeting is also an opportunity to discuss the upcoming governance cycle and any potential submissions.  Next Week\u2019s Activity (The Next Governance Cycle Starts on August 3) Monday  On Monday, August\u2019s Governance Cycle Officially Begins. There will be no polls or votes this week! The Formal Submission period will run from August 3 to August 5. This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle.  As a side note, if you have any proposals in progress, I encourage you to submit them for review on the forums if you intend to propose it in a near-term Governance Cycle.    Thursday  The Governance Facilitator will perform the Submission Review to determine which of the formally submitted MIPs/Subproposals should be put forth for Inclusion Polls on Monday, August 10.  Other News Collateral Onboarding  MANA was officially onboarded to the Maker Protocol today. You may now create Vaults with the MANA collateral type on Oasis Borrow. This month\u2019s Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls are still in progress until Monday, August 3. The Community Greenlight Polls for the following collateral types:  [PAX] [WiV] [EURS] [LRC] [renBTC] [AMPL] [HUSD] [USDT] [C20] [BNT] [COMP]    Don\u2019t forget to vote - your vote matters!  Recent MIPs Activity  MIP17 Working Group Call   Given that MIP17 was initially rejected from the Governance Cycle this month and there has been a lot of discussion on how to improve/modify the proposal\u2019s logic to meet Maker\u2019s needs, I held a community call to discuss our options going forward.   Results: A call summary will be provided over the next couple of days in the form of a forum post/thread, and a new proposal will be put forward focusing on Debt Ceiling Adjustments only.    Proposals in the Request for Comments (RFC) Phase:    MIP20  Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox)  In short, this proposal defines a process for adjusting the target price of DAI according to a governance defined rate, allowing the institution of negative effective interest rates.     MIP13c3-SP1  : Declaration of Intent for Forward Guidance (in RFC)  In short, this proposal aims to help Vault users hedge their exposure to the base rate via various derivative contracts.     MIP15  Dark Spell Mechanism  In short, this proposal formalizes a process for applying critical bug fixes to the Maker Protocol as an alternative to an unplanned Emergency Shutdown.    MIP14 Protocol DAI Transfer  In short, this proposal defines a generic process for transferring DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target ethereum address. This process is a fallback method of transferring value from the protocol in the event that a more specific process does not exist to do so.  @LongForWisdom also mentioned that he would be open to having MIP14 be taken over from him to a new champion/Author. So if anyone is interested in taking over MIP14 and working with the community on a resubmission, just ping me (MIP Editor) and I can facilitate the transition of Authorship.    A few Pre-MIP Discussions are still ongoing:  A Governance Chief Contract Redesign A Liquidation System Redesign  Adding a poll to prioritize collateral applications  A TUSD Update  A Governance Poll to Adjust the TUSD Debt Ceiling was posted on Monday, July 27, and will run until Thursday at noon EDT. If the poll passes, the next steps are to propose an Executive Vote for the Debt Ceiling Adjustment this Friday. Further information about the proposed adjustment can be found in this forum post.   /fin ",

The Ratification Polls for the November Governance Cycle are now up.     Ratification Poll Extract Author     Immunefi Security Core Unit \u201cThe overall goal of the Immunefi Security CU is to secure the Maker ecosystem through multiple angles by leveraging its existing and growing security community and expertise. This involves dedicated services to the Maker ecosystem, effectively establishing a security partnership with the DAO\u201d.  @travinimmunefi, @psychonaut    Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit \u201cImprove security, transparency and accessibility of the Maker Protocol by providing and maintaining auction services through open-source development\u201d. @danik    Deco Fixed-Rate Core Unit Resubmission  \u201cThe Deco protocol, in collaboration with MakerDAO, can offer fixed-rate vaults to Maker vault users. The vault itself remains fully independent, and within the Maker Protocol. Fixed rate token issuance on Deco is controlled and maintained by Maker governance, allowing MakerDAO to control the fixed rates without relying on external governance\u201d. @vamsi    MIP40c3-SP33: Modify Core Unit Budget - Content Production (MKT-001) Resubmission   \u201cMIP40c3-SP33 adds the budget for Core Unit MKT-001: Content Production for December 2021 through May 2022. We are requesting a 6-month budget allocation of 424,944 DAI\u201d. @seth   MIP40c3-SP40: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 \u201cThis budget modification adjusts the team\u2019s budget figures, extends our funding through to the end of 06/22, and updates the budget implementation to accurately reflect the current setup. The annual budget figure has changed from $486,000 to $515,000\u201d. @Davidutro   MIP40c3-SP38: Real-World Finance Core Unit MKR Compensation (RWF-001) \u201cThis proposal contains the MKR Compensation budget for the Core Unit RWF-001: Real-World Finance. It provides an average of 80 MKR per FTE per year over 3 years with a 1 year cliff\u201d. @SebVentures   MIP40c3-SP39: Modify Core Unit Budget, RWF-001 \u201cMIP40c3-SP39 extends the budget for the Real-World Finance Core Unit defined in MIP40c3-SP12 2 in 2022\u201d. @SebVentures   MIP6c3-SP1: (RWA Only) Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application \u201cThis proposal to supplement the MIP6 application for RWA only is intended to enhance the onboarding applications and facilitate the onboarding process\u201d. @christiancdpetersen    These Ratification Polls will run until Monday, November 22. Corrigendum: On the 11-04 G&R Call I announced* MIP55c3-SP01: Adding Special Purpose Fund for Feasibility Study for Securitisation Framework in Singapore as one of the November Formal Submissions, and you may have noticed that there\u2019s no Ratification Poll for it. The reason for this is that the proposal is incomplete. We believed at that point that the missing, not-quite-of-the-essence-but-still-necessary bits would be filled in in time, but sadly that was not the case  * /sp\u026a\u0292\u026b p\u0250\u027eps fant/ what?   Things to Come There will be no Governance Cycle on December. The next Formal Submission Window will open on January 3rd\u201456 days from now.   Proposals in RFC     Proposal Extract Author     MIP41c5-SP2: Facilitator Offboarding (RWF-001) \u201cThis subproposal is to offboard the current Facilitator [S\u00e9bastien Derivaux] of the Real-World Finance Core Unit\u201d. @rune   MIP41c4-SP27: Facilitator Onboarding (RWF-001) \u201c[Rune] approached Will Remor and asked if he was willing to take on the role of Acting Facilitator to oversee the decentralization of the RWA Core Units\u201d. @rune   Pairwyse Fixed-Rate Core Unit (MIP39c2) \u201cThe Pairwyse Foundation has implemented an out-of-box solution and deployed a product for the provision of fixed-rate DAI loans of arbitrary term-length via the Pairwyse protocol built atop Maker\u2019s credit and deposit facilities\u201d. @Akiva   MIP61: Delegate Compensation \u201cThis proposal describes how Recognized Delegates will be compensated\u201d. @psychonaut     oh btw  If you have an idea for a proposal and have no idea how to go about making it into a Maker Improvement Proposal, this may be useful. If you\u2019re confused about the dates for the Feedback Period, the Frozen Period, and/or the Formal Submission, please check this forum post.

                    "content": "Last Week\u2019s Activity (Start of the August Governance Cycle) Monday  August\u2019s Governance Cycle officially began on August 3. There were no polls or votes scheduled last week related to MIPs. The Formal Submission period was from August 3 to August 5.  This period is when MIPs/Subproposals in the RFC phase are proposed to enter the governance cycle.    The Formal Submission entries for August\u2019s Governance Cycle were:  MIP0c13-SP1 - Core Personnel Offboarding (Richard Brown) MIP13c3-SP1 - Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance) MIP12c2-SP4 - LRC Collateral Onboarding  Thursday  The Governance Facilitator (@LongForWisdom) performed the Submission Review to determine which of the formally submitted Subproposals should be put forth for Inclusion Polls on Monday, August 10.   Results: All three of the proposals were confirmed to move to Inclusion Polls on Monday.    This Week\u2019s Activity (Inclusion Polls) Monday  Inclusion Polls for the three Subproposals that were formally submitted will be proposed on Monday, August 10, and will run until August 13 at noon EST.  Thursday  During the weekly Governance and Risk Call, the Governance Facilitator will perform the Inclusion Poll Review and determine which of the three Subproposals are eligible for the Governance Poll the following Monday (July 20).  As a reminder, in order for Inclusion Polls to successfully pass, the Yes votes for a given option in the inclusion poll must be higher than the combination of No votes plus the Default Inclusion Threshold (DIT).  Yes > (No + DIT) = Allows inclusion in the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll.   The DIT is currently set to 3000 MKR.    Other News Collateral Onboarding   MANA was officially onboarded to the Maker Protocol last Tuesday. You may now create Vaults with the MANA collateral type on Oasis Borrow.   As mentioned above, Loopring (LRC) is planned to go through the Monthly Governance Cycle this month.   The Weekly Governance Cycle will be used for USDT and PAXUSD once the risk evaluations have been published. Timelines are still being discussed by the Domain teams.   This month\u2019s Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls ended on Monday, August 3. The Community Greenlight Polls results can be seen in the below table:   Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 8.02.07 PM992\u00d7710 71.6 KB MIPs Update  MIP17 Working Group Call   MIP17 Working Group Call Summary  Next Steps  I and @Planet_X are working to finalize the proposal draft and share it with the rest of the working group when completed. As it stands, I believe it still needs to show how we can reduce the uncertainty around when the debt ceiling will be increased beyond its current maximum as well as add an agreed-upon mechanism to help increase DCs. If anyone else is interested in helping draft the new proposal, please comment in the thread or reach out to @charlesstlouis on the Maker Rocket.Chat.    The following proposals are still in Request for Comments (RFC) stage:    MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module-(Vox)   In short, this proposal defines a process for adjusting DAI\u2019s target price according to a governance-defined rate, allowing the institution of negative effective interest rates. There will be an overview presentation on this week\u2019s Governance and Risk call to showcase the proposal further and provide a period for discussion.     MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments   In short, this proposal defines and formalizes a solution using the Weekly Governance Cycle (MIP16) for making weekly Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments. Furthermore, the proposal describes how to propose modifications to the calculation logic behind the debt ceiling adjustments. The new version of this proposal is still a work in progress, as mentioned above.     MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism   In short, this proposal formalizes a process for applying critical bug fixes to the Maker Protocol as an alternative to an unplanned Emergency Shutdown. This proposal\u2019s feedback period ends at the end of August, making it eligible for inclusion in September\u2019s Governance Cycle.     MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer   In short, this proposal defines a generic process for transferring DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target ethereum address. This process is a fallback method of transferring value from the Maker Protocol.  @LongForWisdom is looking for a new author from the community to champion this proposal going forward.    A few of the Pre-MIP Discussions that are still ongoing:  A Governance Chief Contract Redesign A Liquidation System Redesign  Adding a poll to prioritize collateral applications  TUSD Update  The team at TrustToken recently posted a response to the Smart Contract Domain team\u2019s implementation concerns. The post can be viewed here. The TrustToken team is working towards a new TUSD token upgrade that will significantly simplify the code and reduce the attack surface. The Maker Smart Contracts team has reviewed TCAD, which was simplified in many of the same ways that TUSD will be simplified in their upcoming upgrade. Once this new TUSD code is ready, the Maker smart contracts team will review the new implementation again and create another poll to adjust risk parameters.   /fin ",

This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO.

Inclusion Poll Results:   MIP0c13-SP1 - Core Personnel Offboarding (Richard Brown)  (PASS)   MIP13c3-SP1 - Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance) (PASS)   MIP12c2-SP4 - LRC Collateral Onboarding (REJECTED)     Thursday  During the weekly Governance and Risk Call, the Governance Facilitator (@LongForWisdom) performed the Inclusion Poll Review and confirmed that two of the three formally submitted subproposals would be included in the Monthly MIPs Governance Poll on Monday, August, 17.  Governance and Risk Call recording     This Week\u2019s Activity (Monthly MIPs Governance Poll, August 17 - 21) Monday  The Monthly MIPs Governance Poll went live today at noon EST.  The Monthly Governance Poll will be active for approximately three days ending August 20 before the Thursday Governance and Risk call. This poll asks whether the bundled contents of this month\u2019s Governance Cycle should proceed to an Executive Vote to be held on August 24, 2020. The bundled contents of this poll consist of the following two subproposals:  MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent (Forward Guidance) MIP0c13-SP1: Subproposal for Core Personnel Offboarding      Thursday  The Governance Facilitators will perform the Governance Poll Review as part of the Governance and Risk meeting. They will confirm the poll\u2019s outcomes in preparation for Week 4\u2019s Monthly MIPs Executive Vote that will occur on Monday, August 24.  Other News Collateral Onboarding  As mentioned previously, the Weekly Governance Cycle will be used for the onboarding of PAXUSD and USDT (Tether).  A tentative timeline (to be confirmed by the domain teams):  The PAXUSD and USDT Governance Polls will go live on Monday, August 24. If the Governance Poll passes, the Executive Vote would be published on September 4.      [LRC Onboarding] Given that LRC was rejected in the Inclusion poll stage of this month\u2019s Governance Cycle, a Signal Request was put up on the official forums to gauge sentiment regarding the timing of its resubmission. The signal poll will run until August 23, 2020, at 12:00 PM EST.   @LongForWisdom made an excellent point, stating the following:  \u201cWe could use the weekly cycle, but I think that sets a really bad precedent for governance, so there would have to be a good reason for me to consider allowing it (which I don\u2019t think exists given the proposed debt ceiling on LRC is only 3 million.) As a general rule, if something is voted out of the monthly cycle at the inclusion stage, it seems a bit scummy to allow a re-vote in the same month because the community didn\u2019t like the outcome. To some extent, I\u2019d also like larger MKR voters to see this as a relatively low-cost lesson and hopefully, an incentive to vote more consistently in on-chain polls.\u201d   In summary, the results of this signal poll will provide a signal from the community to the domain teams that the community would like to see LRC resubmitted into September\u2019s Governance Cycle.   This month\u2019s Collateral Onboarding Community Greenlight Polls went live today and will run for two weeks ending on Monday, August 31. There is a total of 12 polls covering the following collateral types:  Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 11.56.09 AM1250\u00d7678 63.4 KB    Collateral Status Index   This index was created to help the community to track the current statuses of all proposed collateral types.    MIPs Update The following proposals are still in Request for Comments (RFC) stage:    MIP20: Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox)   There was an overview presentation on last week\u2019s Governance call by Lev, who discussed the proposal details and had a period discussion with the community. Link to recording      MIP17: Weekly Actual Debt Ceiling Adjustments   The new version of this proposal is still a work in progress but could be re-introduced for September\u2019s Governance Cycle.     MIP15: Dark Spell Mechanism   This proposal\u2019s feedback period ends at the end of August, making it eligible for inclusion in September\u2019s Governance Cycle.     MIP14: Protocol Dai Transfer    @LongForWisdom is looking for a new author from the community to champion this proposal going forward.

These changes are an attempt to make the process more transparent, orderly, and conducive to substantive discussion surrounding an offboarding proposal prior to a vote.\u201d @GFXlabs March   MIP13c3: Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds \u201cAs of writing, around 60% of the MakerDAO balance sheet is in stablecoin. We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos. MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter.\u201d @SebVentures March   MIP39c2-SP30: Governance Communications Core Unit, COM-001 (Mandate Refresh) \u201cThe Governance Communications Core Unit performs a set of programs that focus on MakerDAO\u2019s informational accessibility, stakeholder coordination, and communication practices as a decentralized and public organization.\u201d @DavidUtro April   MIP41c5-SP5: Facilitator Offboarding \u201cAfter wasting everyone\u2019s time and delivering zero results --both in terms of branding or monetary-- we need to remove this team to allow for space so that other teams can grow into it. This team representing Maker is enough to discourage new talent from joining the DAO. The quality bar needs to be several miles higher.\u201d @Deimos March   MIP65: Project Clydesdale: Monetalis Arrangement I: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution \u201cArrange, coordinate and execute a liquid bond strategy to replace part of the current Maker USDC exposure.\u201d @Allan_Pedersen March      Things to Come    If you want your proposal to enter March\u2019s Governance Cycle, the last day for modifications is March 2, 2022!

All MIPs that are not Endgame MIPs are to be marked as obsolete and left without effect. Endgame MIPs are:  MIP0 MIP16 MIP24 MIP38 MIP39 MIP40 MIP41 MIP51 MIP55 MIP62 And the above listed Endgame Constitution MIPs    Note that the passing of MIP102c2-SP1 therefore precludes any MIP that\u2019s not contained in this list (and any SP not derived from those MIPs) from being/remaining accepted and active in the Maker Protocol. This includes those proposals eligible to enter the March Governance Cycle. Also note that, while on the list, some of these MIPs have been restricted so that no new SPs can be instantiated from them. Such is the case for MIP55 \u2014the SPF MIP\u2014, which is to remain active until all ratified SPFs have run their course, but has been restricted so that new SPFs cannot be proposed. This also includes those SPFs that are eligible to enter the March Governance Cycle. Please refer to the relevant PR on GitHub to see all changes to the preexisting Endgame MIPs (that is, those that predate MIP101 through MIP114).

For further details about the calendar exception, please see the newly Accepted MIP4c2-SP6: Calendar Exceptions proposal.  Thursday  As mentioned above, the Governance Facilitator (@LongForWisdom) will perform the Governance Cycle Review this Thursday (December 3). This includes summarizing November\u2019s Governance Cycle and opening up the floor for feedback and questions from the community discussing any plans for the next Governance Cycle in January.  Collateral Onboarding Updates  Three Governance Polls for Collateral Onboarding have been published to the voting portal and will end on Thursday, December 3. The Governance Polls are for signaling support for/against adding the following collateral types in a future Executive Vote:   Add renBTC as a Collateral Type.  Add RWA-001 (6s Capital) as a Collateral Type.  Add UNI (Uniswap) as a Collateral Type.   The Executive Vote to onboard the GUSD collateral type to the Maker Protocol officially passed on November 18 and executed on November 23, 2020. The Community Greenlight Polls for November were published on November 16 and ended today (November 30). The Community Greenlight Polls covered [NEXO] and [YFII].   Results: Both Collateral types were voted to be deferred .   For more details on the status of Collateral Onboarding, check out the Collateral Prioritization Framework spreadsheet here.
