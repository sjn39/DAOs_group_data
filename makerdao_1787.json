                    "content": " Overview Gemini proposed a partnership with MakerDAO in which a marketing incentive of 1.25% of GUSD in Maker Protocol ownership will be paid to MakerDAO when the GUSD in the PSM is above $100M. For a $500M exposure, this represents $6.25M of annual revenues (currently only defined up to the end of 2022). The GUSD PSM is currently empty and limited to a Debt Ceiling (DC) of 60M which wouldn\u2019t give any marketing incentive to MakerDAO. This Signal Request provides the opportunity to Maker Governance to enable exposure to GUSD by adding friction to any outflow of GUSD (by setting the tout parameter to 20bps) and unlock a significant exposure to GUSD by setting the DC at 500M DAI. The gap will be increased from 10M per day (ttl 1 day) to 50M per day. Parameters changed for PSM-GUSD-A:   tout from 0bps to 20bps  line from 60M to 500M  gap from 10M to 50M  Those parameters could be altered if deemed too risky by a Risk Facilitator.  Analysis As you can see from the graph below, there is some activity, but any inflow is automatically arbitraged by a flashbot. Setting the tout to 20bps would remove the arbitrage and keep the GUSD inside the PSM.  1448\u00d7528 36.7 KB  Historically, on secondary markets, GUSD was never at a premium of more than 6bps above DAI but liquidity is thin. USDP/USDC was as high as 0.15% on one occasion. We think 20bps is a good starting point and should significantly reduce/avoid the GUSD outflow yet keep a good enough converting facility in case of stress. On the exposure to GUSD, we assume our liquidity need (fiat-backed stablecoin that can be traded at 1:1 with DAI within a block) to be 1,967M. Setting the DC of PSM-GUSD-A to 500M and excluding those from the liquidity reserves (as there would be at a 10bps cost to the users so not a 1:1 conversion) is consistent with short-term expected uses (incl. MIP65, Coinbase USDC rewards and GUSD incentives) if we unwind GUNI-DAI/USDC and USDC-A vaults. Those are not providing much revenues compared to 1.25%.  Therefore, we don\u2019t expect a liquidity issue by having this exposure. Ideally, we would have a smart contract that permissionlessly decrease the tout to 0bps when our liquidity reserves (0bps tout PSMs are getting thin (< $100M). But, at this stage, it doesn\u2019t seem a priority.  Pro  Would generate up to 6.25M additional revenues Would diversify our fiat-backed stablecoin exposure (less USDC more GUSD)   Con  Will reduce by 500M our 1:1 and intrablock liquidity reserves (but keeping a 20bps cost liquidity reserve) GUSD is less liquid on-chain than USDC but convertibility 1:1 to/from USD or USDC can be done at many places like Gemini, FTX and Binance.   Poll    Do you want to change the parameters as per this Signal Request?  Yes, change the parameters No, keep current parameters Abstain     0 voters     This signal request will be on vote for 1 week, until 2022-10-06T22:00:00Z. This shorter duration assume some level of participation and a clear result. If the result is not clear by then, another week might be added. ",

The proposed modifications are, changing:   tout from 0bps to 20bps  line from 60M to 500M  gap from 10M to 50M   This SR poll will run until Thursday, October 7 at 10:00 PM UTC. It is a binary poll with options \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, and \u201cAbstain\u201d. If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes are in favor of this proposal, it will go on-chain as a poll on Monday, October 10. Changes on all three parameters - tout, line, and gap - will be polled as a bundle. Given the accelerated timeline, the author of the proposal might decide to add one week to the off-chain period, if community participation is not high enough.

One thought here, could the movement of USDC to GUSD cause DAI to be under collateralized while assets and/or fiat are in transit? Especially if it happens off chain? If so, this scenario looks eerily similar to the setup that developed for the UST peg to hard break on Terra due to the Curve pool liquidity changes. Haven\u2019t fully thought this through but wanted to throw it out there. If so, it would make sense to have some sort of throttling mechanism on either the GUSD ramp up or the USDC decrease from the respective PSMs to ensure a more gradual transition as opposed to a bulk swap.

However, I refrained from posting a long comment on MIP84 so far, but the TL;DR is I\u2019m having a tough time seeing the timing alignment between these RWA MIPs and others.
