                    "content": "Hello everyone, Based on the recent on-chain poll, governance voted for activation of liquidations on stablecoin vaults (specifically USDC-A, USDP-A and GUSD-A) and subsequent clearance of false revenue accrual accounting in the surplus buffer, which is a consequence of interest accrual on some of the vaults positions which are currently below 100% collateral ratio. The bad debt will therefore be written off after vaults are liquidated with corresponding realized loss in the collateral auctions. Maker will not realize a loss due to these positions, but rather write off the falsely accrued revenue. There will be a slight loss due to the necessary price discount on the collateral auctions. The accounts which are below 100% CR are present in USDC-A and USDP-A (formerly PAXUSD-A). In USDC-A there are 161 such positions with aggregated 1.2416m dai bad debt. In USDP-A, there are 7 such positions with aggregated 55.1k dai bad debt. GUSD-A has no such positions. Once liquidations are turned on, we will liquidate positions which are currently below the LR of 101%, which will include the bad debt positions and also some others which are not currently under water. Proposed liquidation parameters for USDC-A, USDP-A and GUSD-A (ilk.hole differs between assets);  Enable liquidations Set liquidation penalty to 0 Set chip to 0 Set tip to 0 Use Abacus/LinearDecrease \u2013 tau [seconds]  Set buf to 1 Set ilk.hole to 20m for USDC-A, 3m for USDP-A, 0.3m for GUSD-A Set tau to 4,320,000 second (est. 10 bps drop per 72 minutes = 50 days till 0) Set tail to 43,200 second (12 hours, implies minimum price of 0.99) Set cusp to 0.99  In the worst case scenario, where we reach the highest price discount allowed by the auction (1%), Maker incurs 3.58m DAI bad debt. However, we expect the auctions to be settled before the maximum 1% discount is reached, especially for larger vaults, which means the loss from this liquidation event will be much lower (est. 1.5m DAI loss at average 10 bps keeper profit). The figures include writing off the 1.30m DAI falsely accrued revenue. ",
