Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP55 modifies the Dai budget implementation for Core Unit SES-001: Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. It contains:  Changes against the previous version The Quarterly Budget Cap: the hard limit voted by Governance Breakdown of budgets:  Permanent Team Incubation Program Grants Program     Changes (compared to MIP40c3-SP31)  Automates payments from the Maker Protocol to the Auditor Wallet by putting a DssVest stream in place. Reconfiguration of the Auditor Wallet to a nested multi-sig, modifying signers. Configure Maker Protocol as Beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. Adjustments and additions to the Monthly Top-up Cycle. Introduces DssBlow as a method of returning funds to the protocol. Changes quarterly budget cap approval to annual budget cap approval by Governance. Minor changes in the budget categories for better consistency with other Core Units. Removed the MKR Compensation Expectation as it is now covered by a separate MIP: MIP40c3-SP17.    Specification  Motivation Going by the critical nature of the work done by the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit, sufficient funds need to be provisioned to guarantee the success of the Maker ecosystem in the long run.  Core Unit ID SES-01  Budget Implementation The budget is split into three separate categories: Permanent Team, Grants Program, and Incubation Program.  1440\u00d7788 82.3 KB   Multi-sig Wallets The following multi-sigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2013 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multi-sig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role based multi-sigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have 2 roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants. The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have 2 signers, both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multi-sig will also have 2 signers, both TBD. Both roles will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multi-sig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a back-up. This multi-sig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallets.   The Operational Wallets \u2013 One wallet for each budget category. These are 2-out-of-3 multi-sigs controlled by SES. Signers include the facilitator, the team lead, and one other SES member from the permanent team, responsible for the associated budget category.  The Permanent Team Wallet  The Grants Program Wallet  The Incubation Program Wallet      Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, SES will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month\u2019s Actuals, i.e., the actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast, based on the latest available information, of the budget (in DAI) required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team.  MKR Vesting Overview \u2013 this schedule has the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallets to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallets that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in this git repository on Github.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2013 Within the first 5 days of the month, SES submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.   Transaction Requests Submission \u2013 In parallel, SES submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2013 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallets that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallets to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallets balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2013 SES creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull - The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the SES DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.   Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by SES to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist, and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings. A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the SES\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals \u2013 Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer, and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the Operational Wallets.   Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer. As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.    Final Transaction According to MIP40c3-SP26 No additional governance transactions are needed to enable the transition from MIP40c3-SP31 to the new MIP40c3-SP55, other than putting the DssVest stream in place that is defined further down. The last top-up transaction from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet according to MIP40c3-SP31 is expected to happen throughout the month of January, after acceptance of the December budget statement by the auditors.  Auditor Wallet Reconfiguration To enable this payment flow, a modification in the configuration of the existing SES Auditor Wallet will be required. These changes will occur within the first month of the executive vote passing.  Add Accountant Role Wallet (0xA2A855Ac8D2a92e8A5a437690875261535c8320C) as a signer Add Auditor Role Wallet (TBD) as a signer Add MCD_PAUSE_PROXY as a beneficiary, with an allowance of 1B DAI withdrawal. Remove existing 3 signers of wallet and reconfigure required confirmations from 2-out-of-3 to 2-out-of-2.   Transactions   DssVest Stream A total of 5,844,444 DAI will be streamed to 0x87AcDD9208f73bFc9207e1f6F0fDE906bcA95cc6 starting 2022-2-1 and ending 2023-1-31. (5,844,444 DAI is calculated as  Quarterly Budget Cap x 4 = 1,461,111  x 4).    Budget Breakdown The proposed budget comprises three parts:   Permanent Team Budget \u2013 The Permanent Team Budget covers Dai compensation and operational costs for the permanent team members of the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. This is a standard budget based on the breakdown of actual costs. It will evolve in a relatively slow and predictable way.   Incubator Program Budget \u2013 The Incubator Program Budget is not based on a breakdown of actual costs but rather acts as a spending limit for a financial buffer used for funding incubation projects at the discretion of the SES Facilitator and multi-sig co-signers. A big part of the Incubator Program\u2019s value lies in this ability to allocate budgets without waiting for governance approval quickly. This is to avoid a situation where promising teams have to wait in great uncertainty, typically 3 months or longer, before potentially receiving the first DAO payment for their Core Unit. This is seen as a requirement that is an unreasonable barrier to entry for new teams joining the ecosystem.      Grants Program Budget \u2013 The Grants Program Budget is a similar budget based on prior experience with the Governance Communications\u2019 grants program that has now been sunset.   Dai Expenditure Quarterly Budget Cap We\u2019re asking for a Quarterly Budget Cap of $1,461,111, spanning a 3-month runway.     Group Monthly Total 3 Months     Permanent Team $177,037 $531,111   Incubation $250,000 $750,000   Grants $60,000 $180,000   Grand Total $487,037 $1,461,111    Permanent Team     Type Monthly Total     Dai Compensation  (11.5 FTEs) $146,918   Travel Costs $3,333   Buffer $8,333   Software Development $4,168   Software $1,785   Payment Fees (gas & payment processor) $12,500   Grand Total $177,037    See our Team Spreadsheet for more details about the included FTEs. Incubation Program The limit for the Incubation Program was estimated based on some team configuration scenarios that we want to support, as outlined in the table below. The requested limit is the maximum amount needed for any of these scenarios.      Teams Avg Team Size People Total Avg Dai Compensation Annual Cost Monthly Cost     Sr. Engineers 4 4 16 $160,000 $2,560,000 $213,333   Non-technical 6 4 24 $125,000 $3,000,000 $250,000   Mix 4 5 20 $137,500 $2,750,000 $229,167    Estimations of different incubation costs at industry standards. Grants Program The details for the Grants Program are still being worked out. To avoid updating the budget MIP soon, a budget is included that will be sufficient to get the program up and running. Once the program is active, more detailed estimates will be included in the Monthly Budget Statement.

Overall the implementation looks superior to the previous but it helps provide context and illustrates SES\u2019 thinking.   Yes, sure. It\u2019s a good question: Automates payments from the Maker Protocol to the Auditor Wallet by putting a DssVest stream in place. This is mainly to remove any auditing workload from GovAlpha\u2019s plate (and the other CUs that need to put the executive spells for payments in place.) In our previous model, the payment depended on the balance of the auditor wallet and GovAlpha had to either calculate themselves or just trust us with the number; this doesn\u2019t scale up. The manual work also introduces potential errors, and the budget cap can be breached if the manual check fails. With DssVest, it\u2019s certain that no more than the budget cap will be sent to the auditor wallet. From the protocol\u2019s pov, it\u2019s also more transparent to have the DssVest streams in place that stream the budget cap (see makerburn.com ) Reconfiguration of the Auditor Wallet to a nested multi-sig, modifying signers. This is a preparation to professionalize the roles of accountants and (finance) auditors of core units. The accountant role does the bulk of the work that\u2019s so time-consuming: running all the checks on the monthly budget statement. The auditor reviews this output as a double-check: both roles need to sign. The auditor can also advise when complications arise or judgement calls need to be made. By having nested role multisigs with 1:N quorum, the accountant and auditor roles can be executed by teams rather than single individuals. This increases scalability and redundancy. For example payments won\u2019t get blocked because someone is on vacation. (Today, SES is taking up both the accountant and auditor role of the core units we\u2019re advising, even if the signers are already different individuals. We\u2019d like to see this done by independent CUs in the future. For ourselves, we\u2019ll look for another team to do the auditor check as a start.) Configure Maker Protocol as Beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. Using this configuration, the Maker Protocol can unilaterally withdraw the funds from the Auditor Wallet (with an executive vote.) This is good for multiple reasons:   It emphasizes that the Accountant and Auditor roles work in a reviewer capacity. The funds are not owned by them but by the protocol.   This can also be important for tax liability reasons, depending on the jurisdictions where the Accountant and Auditor signers are located.   It\u2019s consistent with MIP47 requirements.   Adjustments and additions to the Monthly Top-up Cycle. These are modifications to keep the Monthly Top-up Cycle consistent with the other changes in the list. Introduces DssBlow as a method of returning funds to the protocol. The down-side of using DssVest, is that the entire budget cap is streamed, while the core unit will consistently use significantly less than the total cap. This difference can be especially large in the case of SES because the expenses for our incubation program and grants program may vary significantly from month to month. Instead of relying on the CU to return the funds at the end of the year after they\u2019ve accumulated unused budget all the time, the auditors will require a more exact, 3-month forecast (typically quite a bit lower than the budget cap) from the CU. This is done before funds are moved from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallets, and the Operational Wallets will be topped up only with the difference between their current balance and the forecast. So, this provides the CU with more exact funding than when the budget cap is used. And, any budget that still surpasses a buffer of 2 months budget cap in the Auditor Wallet (after the transfer was made to the Operational Wallet), will be returned immediately by the auditor to the protocol. DssBlow is the technical tool needed to properly return funds to the protocol surplus buffer. (The surplus buffer cannot receive a normal ERC20 transaction for technical reasons.) Changes quarterly budget cap approval to annual budget cap approval by Governance. This applies a budget expiry of one year. After one year, a new budget MIP needs to be submitted. This further reduces governance overhead. Minor changes in the budget categories for better consistency with other Core Units. In order to support DAO-wide summaries of the CU budget statements, budget categories (line items) need to be consistent. For example: if one CU has a \u201cTravel\u201d line item and an \u201cEvents\u201d line item while another lumps the two together, summarizing becomes difficult. There\u2019s still more work to be done here. But we\u2019re already trying to apply the same naming convention and grouping when the opportunity arises.  Good timing too: @Retro will talk more about our transparency and quality control framework for core units later today on the SES Weekly Status Update: The Art of Core Unit Budgetting.
