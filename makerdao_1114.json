This is an exciting update for the teams onboarding real-world assets. The Indenture Trust Agreement these teams have been developing is open source, reusable, and adaptable by anyone in the Maker Ecosystem. This agreement creates a pathway for Centrifuge, and potentially other RWAs, to build a sound foundation that scales the financing of RWAs. Eli Cohen @elidco - General Counsel of Centrifuge & Christian Petersen @christiancdpetersen from LTS will co-lead this discussion. The team will explore:  What is the goal of the agreement How the agreement works in practice How the structure will scale real-world assets for both Centrifuge and MakerDAO   Join us!  @juan and @retro will host.

Discussion  Christian Petersen & Eli Cohen 00:00  1914\u00d7924 146 KB   Questions 25:21 - ElPro: What are the trustee\u2019s pre-default duties compared to a DST structure, and how will it protect MakerDAO? How would those pre-default duties differ from country to country? 28:23 - ElPro: The trustee acts for the benefit of MakerDAO, whose right to payment is based on a contract claim against the issuer. Is that right? Is there a scenario where the trustee will act in the best interest of the ten token holders? 29:48 - ElPro: How far away are Ricardian Contracts from being a reality, and what needs to happen for them to be admissible in a court of law?  Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",

As MakerDAO thinks about institutional quality and investing responsibly into RWAs, a sound legal framework must accompany these off-chain assets as they come on-chain. This has been a work in progress for over 6 months and is huge step forwards for unlocking a large new market for MakerDAO through Centrifuge. There\u2019s a quick glimpse into the importance of this framework from @Khan here:  twitter.com    Asad Khan @FinTech_Khan  Want to talk about the hard parts of bringing Real World Assets to DeFi?
