The term is used several times in the testimonials on the homepage, but without explanation. I believe there should be a prominent (link to the) explanation on the homepage, and that not having it leads to a higher bounce rate. I\u2019ve navigated gitcoin.co quite a bit, but the only way I managed to find the explanation of Quadratic Funding was by using Google Search with site:gitcoin.co. The homepage doesn\u2019t seem to link to Fund | Gitcoin or to https://qf.gitcoin.co/. ",
