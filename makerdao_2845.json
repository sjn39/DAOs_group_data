It explains what Feeds are, why we need Feeds, and why some Feeds needs to be public whereas others are pseudonymous. This proposal was also discussed on the Governance Call on September 5th.  DeFiPublicFeedBlockImage.png1600\u00d7716 58.9 KB  Public Feed Appointment This proposal appoints the organizations 0x, dYdX, Set Protocol, Gnosis, and the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation as Public Feeds in the Oracle V2 system. As Feeds they will be responsible for pushing prices of assets to the Oracle V2 system. They will have the same status and weighting as the existing 15 Feeds without any special privileges. As compensation for the valuable service they provide they will get a monthly Feed Stipend (currently 1000 Dai) paid by the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation. The first month\u2019s stipend will be prorated depending on which day their Feed is integrated into the Oracle V2 system. The Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation shall waive their Feed Stipend in perpetuity. If accepted this proposal will appoint the organizations 0x, dYdX, Set Protocol, Gnosis, and the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation to each run a Public Feed in the Oracle V2 system ",
