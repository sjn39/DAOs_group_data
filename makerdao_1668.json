I do not regularly attend Endgame meetings.  Levels of Detail This summary is organized into sections summarizing the same information in different levels of detail.  LOD0 represents the most-simplified and abstracted version of this concept LOD1 is more complex and more accurate. LOD2 is a direct summary of Rune\u2019s post. Runes post could be considered LOD3, with the highest level of detail and explanation.  Lower numbers = Easier to grasp and understand. Higher numbers = More complex but more accurate.    Endgame V3 - Unbiased Currency Stances  Level of Detail - 0  \u2018Stances\u2019 that dictate how much RWA collateral DAI can be exposed to, and the consequences of this. Movement from Pigeon \u2192 Eagle \u2192 Phoenix as regulatory environment becomes more hostile.      LOD1  Level of Detail - 1  \u2018Stances\u2019 that dictate how much RWA collateral DAI can be exposed to, and the consequences of this. Three stances: Pigeon, Eagle, Phoenix. Evolution from Pigeon \u2192 Eagle \u2192 Phoenix when/if/as regulatory environment declines.  Stances  Pigeon Stance  No limit to RWA exposure. DAI remains at pegged at 1:1 with USD. Matches Maker\u2019s current state. Suitable while regulatory threat is minimal. Maximum profitabilty.   Eagle Stance  No more than 25% RWA Exposure. DAI becomes free floating with a negative Target Rate. Balance between profitability and resiliency.   Phoenix Stance  No RWA exposure. DAI is free floating with a negative Target Rate. Maximum resiliency.    Rules  Each Stance comes with rules implemented through smart contracts that effect\u2026  \u2026 the Dai Savings Rate \u2026 the Stability Fee Base Rate \u2026 the Target Rate.   \u2026 based on the make-up collateral portofolio. Full list of rules in LOD2. Generally, rules are intended to enforce desired collateral exposure and diversification of the active stance.  Evolution  Start in Pigeon Stance. Pigeon lasts 30 months, with optional extension. Eagle becomes active after Pigeon. Phoenix only triggered if either:  Clear signs of an impending attack on the RWA collateral General global economic and geopolitical instability        LOD2  Level of Detail - 2 What?  Endgame Plan requires the Maker Protocol to be able to handle the possibility of a significant deterioration of regulatory security alongside global economic and social decline. To be able to adapt to this changing environment, the Maker Protocol will adopt different \u201cstances\u201d that impact the collateral makeup of the Dai Stablecoin. This prepares the Maker Protocol to survive and recover from the realistic worst case scenarios that can occur over the coming years and decades. Overall multi-year strategy:  First focusing on \u201cworld currency\u201d by prioritizing keeping the 1:1 USD peg and not putting a limit on RWA exposure Then switching to focus on \u201cunbiased\u201d by allowing the peg to break and enforcing hard limits on RWA exposure. Then switch to a new stance that is triggered by conditions that are set as part of the Endgame Plan approval, providing long term certainty and risk guarantees to users of the Maker Protocol.   There are three stances:  Pigeon Stance where there is no limit to RWA exposure and Dai remains pegged 1:1 with USD Eagle Stance where Dai becomes free floating with a negative Target Rate Phoenix Stance where Dai no longer allows any RWA other than Physically Resilient RWA   Stances have a set of Automatic Targeting Rules  Global rules implemented with automatic smart contracts that measure the state of the collateral portfolio and react by adjusting levers like\u2026  \u2026 the Dai Savings Rate \u2026 the Stability Fee Base Rate \u2026 the Target Rate.       Pigeon  Maker starts in Pigeon at the moment of the Endgame Plan Launch. Suitable as long as the regulatory threat is still minimal and global economic conditions are stable. Make as much money as possible that can be used to accumulate ETHD in the Protocol Owned Vault. Pigeon Stance lasts 2.5 years (30 months), and the protocol then automatically switches to Eagle Stance after having had 3 years of preparation. Should the external threats to Maker be much better understood and it is clear there is no immediate risk, then can be extended.   Targeting Rules  If Cashlike RWA < 10% = DSR and SFBR begin to automatically increase If Cashlike RWA > 15% = DSR and SFBR automatically decrease until 0% If Clean Money RWA < 5% = Propose increase in debt ceilings to MetaDAO Clean Money Vaults if good deals are available. If RWA > 25%: 90% Of protocol surplus must go to accumulate ETHD for the Protocol Controlled Vault. Physically Resilient RWA counts as only half RWA for the purposes of these calculations. So as an example if there is 10% exposure to Cashlike RWA and 20% exposure to Physically Resilient RWA, it would count as a total RWA exposure of 20% for the sake of calculating the targeting rules.   Eagle  Becomes active after 2.5 years of Pigeon, or in a rare situation where it provides a clear regulatory benefit to not have a 1:1 pegged stablecoin. Eagle Stance guarantees that Maker\u2019s exposure to seizable RWA is limited to no more than 25%, and to achieve this Dai in unpegged from the dollar if necessary. The result is that Dai is able to survive even the most severe regulatory crackdown or physical attack\u2026  \u2026 but at the same is still able to take advantage of RWA liquidity and Clean Money projects that demonstrate the positive impact of Maker and DeFi.   6 month windup period where there is a limit to how negative the TR can get. This limit is removed after 6 months.   Targeting Rules  Physically Resilient RWA counts as only half RWA for the purposes of these calculations. So as an example if there is 10% exposure to Cashlike RWA and 20% exposure to Physically Resilient RWA, it would count as a total RWA exposure of 20% for the sake of calculating the targeting rules. If RWA > 25% within 6 months of entering Eagle Stance: TR starts to decrease to a minimum of -5% If RWA > 25% after 6 months of entering Eagle Stance: TR starts to decrease with no minimum If RWA < 25%, Cashlike < 10% and TR < 0%: TR starts to increase up to a maximum of 0% If RWA < 25%, Cashlike < 10% and TR = 0%: DSR and SFBR starts to increase If RWA < 25% and Clean Money RWA < 10%: Make governance proposals for increased Clean Money RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available. If Physically Resilient RWA < 25% (after accounting for 50% weight multiplier for Physically Resilient RWA): Make Governance proposals for increased Physically Resilient RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available. If Clean Money RWA + Physically Resilient RWA > 25% (after accounting for 50% weight multiplier for Physically Resilient RWA): Begin to slowly liquidate Clean Money RWA projects.   Phoenix  Phoenix Stance is the final stance of the Endgame Plan, where Maker and Dai reache the form of maximum resilience and survivability. ]  Only triggered if either\u2026  there are clear signs of an impending attack on the RWA collateral there is general global economic and geopolitical instability     No longer allows easily seizable RWA as collateral.  Only Decentralized Collateral and Physically Resilient Collateral. PSMs will no longer function  Target Rate will be modified based on Market Price deviation rather than PSM collateral.     If there are no currencies, inflation of Dai purchasing power relative to a consumer price basket chosen by Maker Governance must be calculated directly by the Stability and Liquidity Scope (Explained further later)   Targeting Rules  Cashlike RWA, Clean Money RWA and misc RWA are not allowed as collateral in Phoenix Stance. Any remaining Cashlike RWA, Clean Money RWA or Misc RWA is \u201cuprooted\u201d, which means that all of the assets are immediately converted to ETHD and the debt and ETHD proceeds is transferred to the Protocol Owned Vault. Physically Resilient RWA has no weight modifier like in Eagle Stance, as it is now the only type of RWA available. If Physically Resilient RWA < 50%: Make governance proposals to increase Physically Resilient RWA debt ceilings if good deals are available.    ",
