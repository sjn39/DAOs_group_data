                    "content": " Update to the GovAlpha Multisig As per MIP47, GovAlpha is updating our multisig. We are adding @0xdeniz as an additional signer on the multisig. This takes us to 3 signers. In addition, the signatory requirement will be 2-of-3 rather than the previous 2-of-2 setup. This provides increased flexibility if a GovAlpha Facilitator becomes unexpectedly unavailable, which would previously have resulted in funds being locked at the cost of requiring trust in an additional signer. We believe the benefits outweigh the (minimal) risk in this instance. Here is the transaction adding Deniz to the multisig. We have also updated the Spending Limits. In addition to the pre-existing Spending Limit that authorized the Pause Proxy to spend 1 billion DAI, we have authorized the Pause Proxy for one-off transfers of:  1,000 ETH 1 billion USDC  Multisig address: 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73 (govalpha.eth) Signers:   @prose11 : 0xf3ED2bdeBa77940E6759B806cd55CE20cAE369BE  @Patrick_J : 0x06ADa798f9323392cA30C755383Af879bd853168  @0xdeniz: 0x388e9e5a889C4cDF3f752C1AFcF88B75BDE673eE  Per MIP47c1:   Governance must be able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time.   You can check the spending limit section here. The DSPauseProxy Contract is allowed up to 1B DAI, 1B USDC, and 1,000 ETH.   Signatory requirements providing no less than \u2154 of listed signatories to sign off on an action.   It\u2019s a 2-of-3 multi-sig, with @prose11, @Patrick_J, and @0xdeniz  as keyholders.  All signers must be tagged on the forum, and their willingness to be included in the Multi-Sig publicly confirmed.  Confirmed. @prose11 and @0xdeniz, please confirm below.  A representative for the Multi-Sig must be designated as an official point of contact.  @prose11 remains the primary contact.  There must be a clear and public explanation of the purpose and scope of the Multi-Sig.  Administering funds designated by Maker Governance to be spent to achieve the GovAlpha Core Unit mandate.  A clearly defined process for onboarding and offboarding signatories.  Facilitators of GovAlpha will be added as keyholders to this multi-sig. Signatory requirements will be adjusted as necessary to maintain 2/3rd signers wherever possible. In certain circumstances, members of GovAlpha or Facilitators of other Core Units may be added as keyholders at the existing Facilitators\u2019 discretion to maintain an adequate level of security for administered funds.   A wallet address to be whitelisted.   0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73  Following an approved Governance action that involves a newly recognized Multi-Sig, the information provided will be added to a list of recognized Multi-Sig Wallets.  @MIP-Editors update the MIP47 list when appropriate.
