People hold it because they expect that it\u2019ll capture the intrinsic value of the Uniswap platform somehow, resulting in price appreciation; otherwise they would only acquire it (briefly) to vote, and then sell it again thereafter. All these people trying to sell us this idea that price doesn\u2019t matter - I get it, it\u2019s about legal concerns, but there\u2019s no need to treat each other like kids - need to finally address the elephant in the room. We need a good tokenomic model for UNI so that the token at least keeps its ETH value, otherwise holders will lose interest entirely, the treasury will become worthless and the project won\u2019t be able to finance any further development. Let\u2019s be pragmatic and think long term please. There\u2019s a lot of potential here. ",

In the announcement made on Dec. 20, Uniswap shared that its users will now be able to convert fiat to cryptocurrency on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, Optimism, and Artibrum in a matter of minutes. If Uniswap gathers bullish momentum from the heights of this year and with new announcements and acquisition, the uniswap price prediction for 2023 might brush its potential high of $13.69 as analyzed by experts of Coinpedia. Uniswap is a safe buy, the network presently hosts 322,019 active addresses and is good for long term investors. Now, It is to wait and watch - Will the bears outweigh the bulls and price plunge or bullish catalysts surge the price of UNI in 2023? ",
