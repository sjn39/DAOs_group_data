This is all rare and we need to retain and support this kind of talent.   I just wanted to second this. Additionally, I feel that one of the most valuable attributes for contributors to the DAO is autonomy (coming back to this old post). @SebVentures has shown that he\u2019s very prepared to push the DAO forwards in a number of areas. Additionally, his teams work has shown self-reflection. This is another extremely positive sign in my view. ",
