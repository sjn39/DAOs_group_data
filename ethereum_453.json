                    "content": "Hi there Ethereum Magicians, My name is Tim Daubensch\u00fctz and I\u2019m one of the co-authors of the COALA IP specification (https://github.com/COALAIP/specs). I\u2019m currently working with a client that wants to put film rights on the Ethereum blockchain and thought of using ERC721 to tokenize the rights and COALA IP for modeling a right\u2019s metadata. I did some research into ERC721 and found out that there is an optional metadata extension that specifies name, symbol and tokenURI. That\u2019s great, I thought, but when I looked more closely into the specification I noticed that tokenURI expects a very specific JSON schema of the form: {     \"title\": \"Asset Metadata\",     \"type\": \"object\",     \"properties\": {         \"name\": {             \"type\": \"string\",             \"description\": \"Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents\",         },         \"description\": {             \"type\": \"string\",             \"description\": \"Describes the asset to which this NFT represents\",         },         \"image\": {             \"type\": \"string\",             \"description\": \"A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive.\",         }     } }  As we\u2019ll see later, this JSON schema will lead to problems defining a COALA IP right as an ERC721 tokenURI. But first, let\u2019s introduce COALA IP. COALA IP is a blockchain-ready licensing protocol for intellectual property. It\u2019s based on the LinkedContentCoalition\u2019s Right Reference Model, a model that existing IP standards are drafted upon (e.g. DDEX for music, PLUS for stock photos). At COALA IP\u2019s core are data models that can be used to model an ontology using JSON-LD. There are data models for an entity creating a work (the Party entity), the work itself (Creation and Manifestation entity) as well as an entity for representing copyright and licensing rights (the Right entity). These models are then linked to build an ontology using JSON-LD (and IPLD - a minor detail). A specialty of COALA IP is that it maps the LCC\u2019s \u201cRightAssignment\u201d entity - which represents a transfer of copyright or licensing rights from one Party to another - to blockchain transfers. The idea behind it is to make as many blockchains compatible with COALA IP as possible as they only need to have the following features:  Need to allow for an entity to be stored on the substrate (I\u2019m saying substrate because it can include tech like IPFS) Need to allow an entity to be transferred natively.  So when I first heard of ERC721 I got excited, especially because it would mean that we can tokenize COALA IP Rights as ERC721 tokens and transfer them between wallets seamlessly. However, a COALA IP Right looks like this: {     \"@context\": \"http://coalaip.schema/\",     \"@type\": \"Right\",     \"@id\": \"<URI pointing to this object>\",     \"usages\": \"all|copy|play|stream|...\",     \"territory\": \"<URI pointing to a Place>\",     \"context\": \"inflight|inpublic|commercialuse...\",     \"exclusive\": true|false,     \"numberOfUses\": \"1, 2, 3, ...\",     \"share\": \"1, 2, 3, ..., 100\",     \"validFrom\": {         \"@type\": \"Date\",         \"@value\": \"2016-01-01\"     },     \"validTo\": {         \"@type\": \"Date\",         \"@value\": \"2017-01-01\"     },     \"source\": \"<URI pointing to a Copyright>\",     \"license\": \"<URI pointing to a license on an immutable ledger>\" }  My initial excitement deflated once I saw the JSON schema that ERC721 optionally recommends. It\u2019s totally incompatible. How can we reconcile this? A few ideas I had so far are: 1. Change COALA IP to make it fit ERC721 Hardly possible. We can try to squeeze COALA IP information into name, description and image, but that will ultimately only confuse wallet end users. A COALA IP\u2019s right\u2019s essence is that the license is linked as a PDF and that certain crucial values like share, exclusive, etc. are contained in the data model. Making COALA IP fit ERC721 would erase most of COALA IP\u2019s positive properties and only add a half-baked tokenized right into users\u2019 wallets. 2. Define name, description and image, but also define COALA IP Right\u2019s properties Probably the easiest solution out there. Instead of changing anything in COALA IP and ERC721, I\u2019ll just add more metadata to the JSON schema. In fact, some websites like Opensea.io have gone ahead already and support additional properties in the tokenURI. The problem with this is the challenge for wallet developers. Will they care about COALA IP properties enough to implement them separately? Likely not. 3. Write an EIP that supports a COALA IP Right as JSON schema More difficult than 1. and 2\u2026 To create an EIP one needs to gather use cases, reference implementations, etc. In the end it\u2019s also highly unlikely that an EIP solely for the purpose of tokenizing IP rights is gonna stand out enough for wallet developers to implement it. 4. Write a standard to allow arbitrary data to be included into an ERC721 tokenURI (e.g. using JSON-LD) Definitely the most difficult thing to do. Not only is some of the tech controversial (e.g. JSON-LD), it\u2019s also unclear to me if wallet developers would adopt such a way more complicated standard. So now what? After all of these thoughts, I\u2019m now here, looking for the council of the Ethereum Magicians. What do you think is the best option to go with? Is there options that I missed? Specifically, what do you think of options 3. and 4., and do you think they\u2019re viable. Additionally: Are you an ERC721 implementer and have encountered the issues described in this post? If so, I\u2019d like to hear from you. After all, we\u2019re calling these things non-fungible tokens, but so far they can hardly be more than in-game items. There are so many more use cases to be explored! Best, Tim ",

You would not be \u201cout of spec\u201d by choosing to implement any additional metadata stored in the tokenURI location. People may want to use JSON or csvs or what have you.  The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the \u201cERC721 Metadata JSON Schema\u201d.  Emphasis on the may and the lack of must. There\u2019s no way we can define a off-chain metadata schema that will solve all use cases. The EIP can only attempt to define a standard for on-chain interfaces and behaviour. TokenURI is an extremely loose guarantee which can change at any time and is non binding. The community can decide on what this should look like outside of the blockchain interface for an ERC721. Consider moving some of that metadata up into the ERC721 token itself, ERC721 defines the basic interface for a interoperable token, you can extend it and add any data on-chain. The example from OpenSeas is bad, level, weapon_power should all be on-chain attributes otherwise the value of the asset can be changed by who ever has control of the destination of tokenURI. TokenURI cannot be resolved and read on-chain so it has no on-chain interop capability. ",

(1) If its a movie script, why is on-chain interop capability necessary? check out EIP 1046, by team https://www.rareart.io/ and zeppelin personnel.  it takes the ERC 721 metadata to ERC20.  This is the draft EIP I\u2019ve been working on: https://github.com/RiganoESQ/EIPs/blob/patch-2/EIPS/eip-1048.md , basically defines new metadata structure for licensing intellectual property on a blockchain - using 1046 as a baseline and it leverages the COALA IP schema. I think this is something the community should work towards given that we can for the first time ever make IP (worth trillions of dollars, legacy system is non-fungible) fungible. (2) As an immediate solution, consider the following: leverage 1046, create an ERC20 w/ the following Metadata { \u201ctitle\u201d: \u201cAsset Metadata\u201d, \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cobject\u201d, \u201cproperties\u201d: { \u201cname\u201d: { \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cstring\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d: \u201cMovie Title\u201d, }, \u201cdescription\u201d: { \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cstring\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d: \u201c[SWARM/IPFS link to all intellectual property assets, all rights reserved]\u201d, }, \u201cimage\u201d: { \u201ctype\u201d: \u201cstring\u201d, \u201cdescription\u201d: \u201c[a PDF of the actual human readable license]\u201d, } The metadata license agreement should be part of the IP token issuance documentation, thereby enabling the initial set of buyers (from the issuer) to click a check box (standard for token sales) agreeing to the license terms (binding). On the secondary market, transacting in this ERC20 token is consent to the legal agreement in the metadata, thereby enabling IP transactions to occur between two parties using the Ethereum blockchain for enforcement as opposed to lawyers, admins and courts. This is similar to markets trading contracts for commodities. Parts of EULAs are deemed unenforceable when the language is unreasonable.  If this is a standard market licensing agreement, w/o extreme language I\u2019d like to this its ok. Regarding making more binding for tx on the secondary market, is it possible that every transaction broadcast on the ethereum blockchain must incorporate the hash of the actual license as part of the signature, thereby explicitly binding the signer to the contract every time the token is traded? So get the hash on the signature level as opposed to metadata? (3) Also, the fact that the minter can change tokenURI can be to your advantage in that you can upload new intellectual property to the SWARM/IPFS database, thereby giving the token holders more solid rights, as opposed to having to speculate that the new trademark or derivative work is not part of this IP package. thoughts?
