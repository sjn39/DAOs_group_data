Edit 2022-02-02: For the latest updates, check out my reply below Edit 2021-11-26: IPFS will be supported Keeping track of our deployed contracts is essential for allowing different stakeholders to safely interact with the system. Furthermore, since our smart contract infrastructure is in constant flux, stakeholders should not simply copy/paste the address of some Maker contract they are interested in, because that address might change in the future. Instead, they need a registry where the up-to-date contract addresses are kept. Traditionally, this registry has been the Changelog, where, through a beautiful and modern interface, users are able to access the latest deployment addresses of MakerDAO contracts.  The Changelog has one main drawback, though: it is just a web2 page. Although it provides IPFS versions of its content, it is subject to being hacked. If only we had access to some sort of d\u00e9centralized ledger to solve this problem !  Introducing the Chainlog Cognizant of this risk, MakerDAO\u2019s smart contract engineers have been using an on-chain Changelog that they aptly christened the Chainlog. Although it has been around for some time now and is being used on numerous scripts and external smart contracts, it lacked a user interface that would rival its beautiful web2 counterpart. Until now. A proof-of-concept UI of the new Chainlog is now available at chainlog.makerdao.com.   Feature comparison The new Chainlog UI will not have all the features the old Changelog webpage had. Some are hard to do in web3 and some are impossible. However, users may not need these features:     Feature old Changelog new Chainlog (planned)     active addresses     testnets  only G\u00f6rli   old addresses     IPFS     Link to deployment scripts     ABIs  external link   Decentralized     Automatic updates     Different address formats       Automatic updates While the old Changelog requires constant manual updates from PE and TechOps, the new Chainlog gets updated automatically whenever a new spell is cast. This not only benefits users who will have more certitude that the addresses are up-to-date, but also frees up valuable human resources from performing an error-prone and repetitive task.  Future steps If the community agrees, the new Chainlog will replace the old Changelog. A deprecation notice will be added to the old Changelog\u2019s webpage until finally it will redirect to the new Chainlog UI. Or some other deprecation strat\u00e9gy set forth by TechOps.  Community input Please let me know what features you want to see in the new Chainlog. Also, if you have UI/UX skills, please, please get in touch ! ",

If it\u2019s less of a security issue, should we fetch them from the etherscan API?

It would be nice to have a link/button to switch between chains.   It will use Metamask as the Gateway, which means people will probably have to switch chains in their Metamask plugin. For browsers without it, a DoS-vulnerable Infura connection will be used and there will be a dropdown to choose between mainnet and G\u00f6rli.     valia:  Please add a link to the source code of the page (maybe here, but also to the page itself)   Good point ! I will add it to the UI. In the meantime, here it is: GitHub - makerdao/chainlog-ui: UI for MakerDAO\u2019s chainlog contract It is a single HTML with vanilla JS in it and no d\u00e9pendencies, so you can also just look at the source code in your browser.     valia:  Please provide a way to copy or download all addresses as json (in the old changelog format)   It will have an API to get machine-friendly data. You will have to provide your own Infura key to use it (or your own full endpoint URL, I am not sure). The formats would be JSON and BASH. Any other formats in mind ?     valia:  I guess the very important feature of the old page is the versioning, which will be lost.   It could be implemented via events, but it is hard and I am not sure people need it. Also, for older versions it would only work with clients connected to nodes with archiving capabilities.     valia:  Would be nice to at least know when the addresses changed last time   Thank you for this. I will add it.     valia:  What would be a good way to retrieve ABIs for the latest contracts? If it\u2019s less of a security issue, should we fetch them from the etherscan API? Or can you have a IPFS folder with all historical ABIs stored under their addresses so we have less dependencies on the web2?   Yes, I was planning on using the Etherscan API, but you are right that it would be better not to d\u00e9pend on Web2. Probably Sourcify is a better option if we start using it to v\u00e9rify our contracts. And I am not very sure about an IPFS folder because that option feels like it requires human labour to maintain.     valia:  We would be happy to see exchange callee addresses in the log as well, so it\u2019s possible to have a single place and method to set up all maker-related contracts   The contents of the Chainlog are a separate issue. Maybe create a Signal request ? I am not sure. But the Exchange Callees are more like r\u00e9ference implementations for Keepers to use as a starting point for their own usage, so I am not sure their d\u00e9ployment addresses are good candidates for the Chainlog, to be honest.

I imagined that could be an additional Copy all addresses as JSON button  I was planning on using the Etherscan API  So you mean, there can also be a button in front of the address to download its ABI from something like Sourcify? I think if you\u2019re going to validate source code via external service, that would be comparable amount of labour as uploading ABIs to IPFS, but maybe external service is better (but probably less reliable?).

A more practical way may be to push snapshots of the data to a GitHub repo through a CI/CD (backup) process that runs daily. Could even be a folder in the UI client\u2019s repository. These can just be JSON files in a time-stamped folder, or even overwrite upon commit and use git version history as the historical record. If the export to JSON function is made available as CLI command, a bot could just pull repo/run export/push new commit. If we can import or link to the latest state of changelog.makerdao.com too, in the same repo, the entire record will be available. I do think the historical data is important to have in case developers want to interact with decommissioned contracts. Think of the old DSChief that still has a ton of MKR in it, as an extreme example. But also researchers / blockchain archeologists need this data. ",

The centralized API is not on IPFS  no link to deployment scripts ; I don\u2019t think people need this, let me know if you do  ABI (integration with Etherscan\u2019s API allows you to copy it)  decentralized UI  automatic updates for the UI  the API is updated via a script run by TechOps (not yet live, so manual updates for now)  export chainlog as JSON and BASH (let me know if you want any other formats) Recently a link to the Chainlog was added in the old Changelog. At some point we will define a date in the future where the old Changelog will stop receiving updates. ",

This is an interesting suggestion in case we need to upgrade the chainlog smart contract in the future. However, that contract is just a key/value store and is unlikely to ever be upgraded. I know it sounds odd to say it in this context where we are upgrading the old changelog, but bear in mind that the old changelog is not a smart contract, just a website, and that is why we are replacing it with a smart contract.
