            "discussion": "",
            "body": "The DeFi Education Fund (DEF) proposes to move the organization's assets to a custodial wallet viewable on chain. Here is the governance forum thread debating this idea: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/moving-defs-assets-to-an-on-chain-custodial-wallet-to-bolster-security/14328\n\nThis is the right move for the organization for several reasons:\n1. The governance proposal that funded the DEF envisioned the implementation of a security-enhancing product like Tally's Safeguard onto the multisig, but it's not ready for implementation. Safeguard would give UNI governance the ability to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to the Community Treasury. These features would significantly enhance the security of the multisig against unauthorized/coerced/ etc. transactions.\n2. Moving to a custodial wallet likely will present fewer risks to the fund's assets than relying on a four of seven multisig controlled by the committee's publicly-identified committee members, each being effectively 1/4 of a $22M bearer asset.\n3. The DEF would only onboard with a custodian that would support an individual wallet for the DEF's assets, meaning it would offer the same level of transparency as a multisig. \n\nOther details: \n1. Custodian criteria: Security, transparency, and cost. How the custodial wallet would be visible on chain is probably the factor with the most variance across custodians. For example, some use omnibus wallets for multiple clients\u2019 assets, some create a new wallet every time a transaction is completed, etc. A dedicated wallet would be an absolute must in order for the DEF\u2019s funds to be viewable/verifiable on chain, and ideally the wallet wouldn\u2019t change every time there was a transaction in and out of the wallet because that would make viewing/verifying the assets a hassle for the community. When moving assets to the centralized custodian, the DEF would incur a fee based on the dollar value of the assets, which is typically in the range of 25-50 basis points per year. If the DEF moves forward with this proposal, the hope is to work with a custodian sympathetic to the organization's mission who could offer the DEF a \"deal\" on cost. \n2. The DEF would directly on-board with a custodian, and the DEF would continue to pre-announce and explain withdrawals from the custodial wallet on its blog. The DEF would only use a custodian that wouldn\u2019t move any of the assets unless four of the seven committee members validate a transaction to vindicate the four of seven requirement of the current multisig. In other words, only consensus among four of the seven committee members would have the power to validate an outgoing transaction.\n3. There has been no security issue to date motivating this proposal.\n4. The DEF initiated this snapshot but will not vote on it. \n\nThanks all",

                    "content": "Hello Uni governance, The successful governance proposal that funded the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) sent $UNI to a multisignature wallet (DEF.eth) that the DEF\u2019s seven steering committee members control. To enhance the UNI community\u2019s control of the assets, the proposal directed the committee to implement Tally\u2019s open-source product Safeguard (then called Failsafe) when it is ready. Safeguard would give UNI governance the ability to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to the Community Treasury. These features would not only enhance the governance community\u2019s oversight of the funds but also significantly bolster the security of the multisig against unauthorized transactions and other risks. Safeguard\u2019s code is currently being audited, and Tally is in the process of building an interface for the product. In the meantime, the committee proposes to transfer the DEF\u2019s assets from its multisig wallet to a dedicated custodial wallet that can be viewed on-chain. Holding the DEF\u2019s assets at a centralized custodian presents less risk than holding them in a seven person multisig without a product like Safeguard implemented. Because the custodial wallet and its transactions will still be viewable on-chain, moving the Fund\u2019s reserve to a centralized custodian is a win-win at this time. We will continue to pre-announce and explain withdrawals from the custodial account. When moving assets to the centralized custodian, the DEF will incur a fee based on the dollar value of the assets, which is expected to be in the range of 25-50 basis points per year. We seek the community\u2019s advice and thoughts on this proposal and eventually intend to initiate a snapshot vote with more details based on the discussion. -Miller ",

                    "content": "Hi Getty, thanks for the questions. 1. What custodian are you guys planning on using? We haven\u2019t decided which custodian we would use, but I think the criteria that is most important for DEF will be security, transparency, and cost. Transparency\u2014how the custodial wallet would be visible on chain\u2014is probably the factor with the most variance across custodians. For example, some use omnibus wallets for multiple clients\u2019 assets, some create a new wallet every time a transaction is completed, etc. A dedicated wallet would be an absolute must in order for the DEF\u2019s funds to be viewable/verifiable on chain, and ideally the wallet wouldn\u2019t change every time there was a transaction in and out of the wallet because that would make viewing/verifying the assets a hassle for the community. How the wallet could be used (see point 3) would also be important in order to vindicate the majority requirement of the current multisig. 2. Will the DEF be onboarding directly with the custodian? Yes. The DEF would own the account in which the DEF\u2019s assets would be stored. 3. Who will have the ability to move coins out of the account? We would only use a custodian that wouldn\u2019t move any of the assets unless four of the seven committee members validate a transaction. I don\u2019t really think that this requirement would limit the custodian choices because all that I\u2019ve looked into include the ability to restrict the \u201cpowers\u201d individuals could exercise over the account/assets. For example, only the seven committee members would have the power to \u201cvalidate\u201d an outgoing transaction, while a non-committee member could hypothetically have the ability to initiate a transaction that would have to be validated by four of the seven committee members in order to go through. 4. What will the process be (roughly) for moving coins out of the account? Custodians use a variety of security practices/features, so the specific process would vary depending on the custodian. For example, some use passwords, yubikeys, and video calls to authenticate that individuals attempting to access the account are 1) who they say they are and 2) are \u201cvalidating\u201d transactions freely and not under duress, etc. Other custodians scrap passwords all together and use biometrics like face scan and voice print in addition to videos to achieve the same objectives. So while the specific process will vary, I think from a process perspective the critical requirement is that four of the seven committee members would have to validate any outgoing transaction before it were completed. 5. What is something that Gnosis and other multisig wallets can learn from DEF\u2019s multisig experience to improve? What was the pain point that drove you guys away from the multisig? I think in the context of organizations like the DEF, the implementation of something like safeguard or other features that would bolster the security of the assets is the \u201cpain point\u201d if that makes sense. For example, a process to verify that a transaction is not being \u201csigned\u201d under duress (or some \u201cfailsafe\u201d feature if one is like the one offered by Safeguard) by a committee member would make a multisig more secure. I also think features that could mitigate the consequences of \u201cblack swan\u201d events could help. For example, a catastrophic earthquake in San Francisco or a massive tsunami in Miami might render a lot of crypto multisigs lost, which might be worth preparing for in some way. -Miller ",

I\u2019d be very hesitant to support a move to a custodial wallet with a vague promise that one day, maybe we\u2019ll move back to a multisig if SafeGuard ever sees the light of day.

In my mind, the guiding principle on the DEF\u2019s custody of its assets should be to hold the assets where ever they are going to be the safest while retaining the same level of transparency offered by a dedicated on-chain wallet like the existing multisig. While there have been no security issues with the multisig to date, I think that a custodial wallet is the safest option currently available for the reasons laid out in the original post and my response to Getty. I agree with your second point, which is why I think the ultimate guiding principle should always be to custody the DEF\u2019s assets wherever the assets are going to be the most secure while retaining that same level of transparency.

Not sure I get the reasoning to move to a centralised solution given that:  It will incur additional ~$100,000 annual costs Its centralised (and DEF is DEF not CEF\u2026) Your will no longer own funds (no privKey not ur funds) Centralised is less secure in the events of catastrophic events you\u2019ve outlined It contradicts core values of decentralised finance  But if 4 out 7 owners sign the move, I\u2019m ok since its not decision for me to make. Nor will I be disappointed, considering that DEF have already used centralised solution to trade half of granted UNI for USDC (not DAI?) instead of using Uniswap Protocol pools for some questionable reasons at the expense of LPs and UNI hodlers.     eek637:  In my opinion, one of the core messages of the DEF should be how important and powerful self-custody is   Totally agree here with @eek637, it contradicts ethereum core capability of people controlling their data On a slight side note both tsunami in Miami and earthquake in SF are \u201cwhite swan\u201d events if we take that guys terminology, but thats probs due to confusion caused by him dedicating an entire book to explain single concept instead of simple medium post. Apologies for being maybe too blunt, but it\u2019s just I think for organisations that represent/educate/defend our values it would be a requirement to also share them. I appreciate you coming here and see this proposal discussion as genial attempt to gather community feedback, but at this point the reasons that have been outlined in post and answers  provided make this temporary moves look unjustified and even harmful, but I might not have all the information, nor knowledge in fields touched here.

Chris, re your question, it\u2019s not resolved yet because the community hasn\u2019t voted on the question. I\u2019ll put together a snap shot and post the link to this thread and on twitter. I agree that keeping the DEF\u2019s assets in a secure multisig would be the most ideal outcome, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case right now (which I appreciate is debatable and a judgement call). On net, Im not really worried that moving to a custodial wallet would undermine the DEF\u2019s goals and mission. The gun lobby is extraordinarily effective, yet I\u2019ve never seen an NRA lobbyist carrying a rifle around DC (and if a policymaker chirps the DEF for using a custodial wallet instead of a multisig wallet, that\u2019ll be a highly educated policymaker). Appreciate everyone\u2019s patience and will be back with the link as soon as it\u2019s set up. Miller ",
