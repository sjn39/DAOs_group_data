I am thrilled to be a part of the Optimism Crypto community and I am excited to share my thoughts on the recent announcement of a second airdrop. As a current holder of the token, I believe that this second airdrop is a fantastic idea. Not only will it provide more opportunities for new users to get involved with the project, but it will also reward current holders for their continued support. This shows a strong commitment from the team to not only growing the community but also rewarding the early adopters. I am looking forward to seeing the positive impact that this second airdrop will have on the project and I am excited to see where Optimism Crypto will go in the future. Let\u2019s continue to support the team and grow this amazing community together!  ",

Not everyone who\u2019s contributing to the network is genuine with a lot of sybils going on lately. Maybe contribution such as running a bedrock node, searching for bounty audits by devs should be considered as a small part for the upcoming airdrop to increase dev contribution. ",
