There is another URL that shows the delegates, but there\u2019s no functionality there to actually pick a delegate (Optimism Gateway). That second URL should be fleshed out with the ability to change your delegate, and also to view the voting history of delegates. We should also be able to see how much voting power each delegate currently has, so we can choose a less popular delegate if we desire. This is sort of a basic request, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s already in the works, I just wanted to mention it here in case it slipped through the cracks. ",
