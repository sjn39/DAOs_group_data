This allowed to increase the existing DAI liquidity not only through Uniswap but also from the MakerDAO protocol itself, allowing us to surpass the 7B barrier again.  We know that currently the MakerDAO protocol is in discussions to move away from centralized guarantees, I am one of the first to raise my voice against the problems of centralization. But we are in a crucial stage to be well positioned to face the next bull run in the crypto market, we know that one of the first problems of DAI is its liquidity, what do I do with my DAI? we can increase the use cases of DAI and its % of participation in the chain. I propose to integrate liquidity groups such as G-UNIV3 DAI/FEI and USDP/DAI (G-UNIV3 BUSD/DAI is already under discussion). This will increase the liquidity of the DAI by allowing for increased issuance and blocking in UNISWAP, as well as increasing the uses of the DAI.  image1224\u00d7416 29 KB  As an example and possible success story, currently the only use case for USDP in the PSM. In Liquidity it does not even reach 0.01% of what is in the SMP, how can you generate those arbitrage opportunities that allow you to generate interest in opening positions as it exists with USDC/DAI? Easily by generating that initial push through the inclusion of G-UNIv3 groups for DAI. This is part of an idea to add them as collateral, but by recommendation before the signal request @prose11  recommended me to first get feedback from you the forum community and study how we could approach this.

[FEI] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application   While filled as a MIP6, this proposal can be seen (and converted) to a D3M (or even a PSM). It is suggested to have a good overcollateralization, meaning that the only use case for this vault will be Tribe Protocol to put FEI as collateral to mint DAI. The Tribe DAO will use this loan to finance its balance sheet and provide a better peg for its users.   The proposal wanted to use Maker as a credit facility without requiring TribeDAO to bring their underlying Eth collateral. We can imagine how unfortunate that could have ended up. It seems reasonable for FEI to unwind while it is still ahead. Unfortunately, the project has suffered recurring setbacks since launch. ",

The windup/unwind process of acquiring this leverage requires that there is liquidity for the other asset available w/ reasonable slippage. In the case of GUNI3-DAI-USDC we have the PSM which gives 1:1 conversion and so allows leverage to be wound and unwound with no slippage. With USDP and BUSD I see two problems.  There is no sizeable liquidity pool to support any kind of significant leverage without massive slippage The LP fees are so low that even with maximum leverage the yield is still garbage. Now try to pump 15M of Dai liquidity into this and you\u2019re looking at garbage^2 yield.  Without the yield you won\u2019t see any Dai generation stimulated by onboarding these pairs. There\u2019s really no point to onboarding any of this. It would be a massive waste of developer resources and Oracle costs that could better be spent elsewhere. ",
