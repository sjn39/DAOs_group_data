                    "content": "As we are about to ponder around way to improve engagement in our governance, I would like to restart the conversation on solving voter\u2019s apathy. I brought this topic on many occasion in the past  [1, 2], this(Solving voter apathy) complete thread by Polynya is dedicated to this topic(highly recommend reading that thread if you havent already). But so far we didn\u2019t see any progress to include more community member is Optimism Governance. Apart from Delegates, we have seen few protocol sharing the same thought and working towards overcoming this challenge. Continuing the discussion from Introducing Otterspace, a Soulbound Badge solution for DAOs:    Introducing Otterspace, a Soulbound Badge solution for DAOs   DAOs struggle to effectively incentivize participation and engagement from community members with ERC-20 token   Continuing the discussion from [READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Mean Finance:    [READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Mean Finance   Growth strategies and community engagement   But this is not a new problem, forbesfinancecouncil defines lack of user engagement as one of the three major challenge within DAO. In a paper published by World Economics Forum on DAO defines engagement as challenge within DAOs along with privacy, scalability to name a few. Where We Stand   Voter turn out :- Total percentage of users who vote could be metric to show overall community engagement [3].  We see downfall in both, total OP delegated and actual vote count. In phase 0, total $OP delegated was around 35M and in Cycle 7 its only 22M.   image1900\u00d7702 52.8 KB   Grants with millions in $OP is being approved by mere 12% of voter turn out, to give you a reference total vote turn out for Brexit was 72%( Brexit referendum: Voting analysis) and US presidential election is 62%( Voter turnout in United States presidential elections - Wikipedia) . Total governance vote turn out change of more than 50%(from 25M to 12M), in less than 6 months is alarming and we need to take some action before its too late.    Suggestion :- Show me the incentive and I\u2019ll show you the outcome\". Charlie Munger, Other DAO are also doing their brainstorming on this topic. Promote DAO by incentivising voting - Vaults - yearn.finance   Give incentives to user delegating their token to active delegates (definition of \u201cactive delegate\u201d could be defined later) Rational :-   Its more beneficial when a group of participant take an informed decision based on their research and due diligence compare to a larger group of users casting their vote just to gain the system and to collect the reward. Could motivate more token delegation, either self or delegated to someone  Execution :- Option 1  Public announcement by OP team suggesting multiplier in next airdrop for active participation in governance. Similar comment share by other delegate OPUser - Delegate Communication Thread - #17 by polynya, Solving voter apathy - #8 by lefterisjp  (I am unsure on legal requirement ) Retroactive multiplier could be another option.  Option 2  Token house is responsible to distributing governance fund to grow Optimism governance and I believe increasing user engagement is a part of it. So, a proposal could be submitted requesting token house to allocate an arbitrary amount of $OP to reward participation. (complicated than first one)  Expected Benefit :-  Sustainable participation, out of seven pillar discussed in SOK research paper on DAOs, it was suggested that giving incentives to participant could lead to sustainable governance. SoK: Blockchain Governance - IOHK Research  Could counter laziness of rational ignorance. Rational ignorance - Wikipedia  In more general term, governance grant are more important than management proposal so we need to motivate more engagement from community. What Determines Participation in Corporate Voting?  By giving incentives we are justifying cost of engagement which could lead to higher engagement. This could be anything, from monetary to reputation based incentives  Looking forward to your feedback and suggestion.  Note :-  My goal from this thread is to reach on a consensus to motivate user engagement. In long term, we do need compensation for delegates but this thread is not the right place to discuss that.

The majority of users will do the exact minimum to secure the bag. What do we get? For delegation: more day-one delegation without regard for actual affinity or alignment and zero follow-up. We end up right back where we were, with the massive distortions in distribution. For \u2018participation\u2019: spam  image818\u00d71116 85.8 KB  (I\u2019d guess that a lot of the spam participation to date has been in anticipation of such an airdrop.) For voting: a ton of noise in vote outcomes, again because people will do the minimum: vote (YEA, probably) without reading the proposal It\u2019s not simple participation you want to incentivize \u2013 it\u2019s quality participation by a broad, informed citizenry. Incentivization of some sort is probably in order, but achieving that sort of participation is probably more of a slow grind, facilitated by structural changes (in the vein of what @raho proposes here) and, of course, effectively demonstrating that participation in governance is worth it.

We could ask around but my feeling is an average person with a day job has 30 min to 1 weekly hour to spend here if not less and it\u2019s impossible to catch up. If we want to capture the attention of these people then we need a 10min daily TLDR for them. The second one is delegate participation. In this case, I ask myself   Do I want to those who don\u2019t want to get involved to be involved because there\u2019s some sort of compensation?   Do I want to reward those already involved even if they don\u2019t get anything about it because they think this matters?   Personal opinion, I prefer people to find that if they get involved sooner or later could have some sort of compensation. But those who are here no matter what have a bigger interest and that is to keep Optimism as the priority and not themselves. That is the kind of people I would want to be involved with optimism. It would be nice to see not involved delegates losing some % of their delegation every time they are not active and distributing that % between active members. You may think this is against people choosing their own representation but in the end, they choose someone not representing them at all. At the same time, those who want to participate will know some % delegation will go their way if they keep getting involved. ",

The proposer can also place a nominal bond or a nominal amount of incentivisation OP can be placed as a bond. Different types of votes can have different levels of minimum stake requirements depending on the complexity of the proposals within those sections. The more complex votes with higher stakes ensures that those participating in those votes have the required competency and skill set to be able to vote coherently. The vote totals would be kept hidden until the end of the vote cycle. If everyone votes 100% coherently, then you receive your stake back and the nominal bond is split between everyone. If you vote incoherently, you lose a portion of your stake and the cumulative lost stakes are split amongst the coherent cohort. This system forces people to do individual due diligence and also have actual skin in the game. This would probably need a rework of the incumbent delegation system, but I feel it would cut out alot of the noise that exists now. ",

Regarding redistributing inactive delegate; I definitely think it makes sense for inactive delegates to lose their votes. However, I think a better outcome is simply if the OP holders were incentivized to delegate to active delegates - which will carry their opinion on who to redistribute to. Yes, there\u2019ll always be some who are apathetic anyway, but I think 99% OP holders will start paying attention if they are actually paid to delegate to active delegates. ",

But, as of now, there is no added benefit or motivation for user to re/delegate their token which is causing the drop in total OP delegated. With this proposal the idea is give reward retroactively to user for delegating their token, either self or to a delegate. This reward could be in form of airdrop, a multiplier may be like we have seen in airdrop 1. Key-word to focus on being active in gov, either by self-delegation or delegating to an active delegate as the reward will be proportional to your activity in the gov. Now the criteria of active could be wide and we can discuss this later or let foundation decide that. An example, as a user If i choose you as my delegate then the reward in form of airdrop will depend on how active your were in the past with OP Gov. So as a user I will be motivated to look for active delegate because of reward, this is one of my motivation. Two side benefit, less active delegate will see decrease in their voting power and total delegated token count will see a boost. ",

B)100.01k-199.99k = 9 points C)200.01k-299.99k = 8 points and so forth with a cap at 1 million+ receiving 1 point per staked token. i still think this is too dramatic and the scale should maybe be like 0.2 points at each tier. but using those numbers, delegate A with has 55k tokens which is 550k points. those tokens are delegated across 100 wallets, they have 55m total points. now everyone adds up their points. the grand total of points is 7 billion. the total allotment for that week\u2019s incentives is 10k op tokens. Delegate A has 0.7857142857142858% of the total points. which means they get 78.57 op tokens for themselves and to distribute to stakers. now lets assume delegate A takes nothing and distributes all of that to their stakers. thats a 7.4% apr to the stakers of delegate A. it could be dramatically less for stakers with larger delegates if using the 1 point step down per 100k tokens delegated scale. thats just an example of the math breakdown. i like where you are going with the ideas. im personally not sure on the numbers though regarding what the budget for this could be as my example here requires 520,000 OP tokens per year assuming something like 6-60 million staked op tokens varying wildly in total tokens staked to total points earned because of the sliding scale and wallet number factors. This method, especially in light of how polynya akins it to pos, sounds reasonable and possible imo. would just need to iron out the numbers and come up with some models. ",

Not in like the little regional votings in small towns or villages, but on a national level. I\u2019ve checked different elections in the past in \u201cwestern countries\u201d and in many of these 40% percent or even more of the voting-age population didn\u2019t vote at all. Why is that? The answer is simple, each new election Politicians promise changes that will benefit the people but in the end they are just lying to them in order to get the most votes. Once elected they usually don\u2019t follow through on their claims and most people by now have figured this out and have resigned because they learned that in the end voting doesn\u2019t change a thing. The remaining 60% of the voting-age population or at least a big chunk of them are hopeless romantics who probably think that, \u201cthis time it will be different\u201d. This time they will follow through on their promises. There are certainly more factors to it but this is I think the biggest issue of all. Now since only 8 to 12% of the \u201cvoting-age population\u201d is voting at the moment one could argue that the described issue at top can be translated into our current \u201cvoter apathy\u201d issue on the Optimism Collective. Now how do we change that? The only option that comes to my mind is to eradicate this presumption by showing that their vote can actually make a difference and actually change something. But in order to do so we first need an incentive for people to vote. The different options coming to my mind can be found here. ",

Incentives aren\u2019t going to make votes meaningful to the point where stakeholders see it as being in their benefit to participate in governance, whether by voting, delegating actively, or engaging in discussions. I do agree we should at minimum consider short-term solutions to juice productive participation, but the more I think about it the more it seems clear to me that we simply need to foster an environment where voting matters, and that\u2019s more of a long game. In the meantime, as much as I hate to say this, it could be acceptable to have less participation and more concentration with an eye toward making votes count, the same way the network itself isn\u2019t sufficiently decentralized though we have the intention of making it so. The most important thing is laying down the infrastructure so we can grow and build for success. The conditions I\u2019m imagining as prerequisites for the kind of participation we want:  broad participation in the network itself (in terms of users and projects) as a share of all crypto both token house and citizen house in a semi-mature state of operation at least one round of RFPG in the books successful round of governance grants; i.e., grants with results exceeding expectations These ensure there\u2019s a sufficient participation base and a demonstration of the promise and intent of distributing grants as a governance  These are off the top of my head so might be incomplete, but this is all to say that we should be looking forward to what the world needs to look like for voting to matter, rather than reacting to the state of things with band-aid solutions.

                    "content": "The further I keep digging into that topic the less I agree with you even though I see where you are coming from. Incentives do make votes meaningful. Here are the 5 most common incentives to pick from:  GOALS. Some people are motivated by the pursuit of a particular achievement, and the knowledge that they\u2019re the person who made something happen. For example, the billionaire space race between Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk. GLORY. Others seek the public recognition they get from achieving something. For them, an achievement would feel much less rewarding if no one knew about it. This incentive is common in areas like academia and sport. GUTS. For some, it\u2019s more about the arduous journey. For example, many marathon runners are spurred on by the gruelling hours of training and the mental resilience required to succeed at long-distance running. GOLD. Putting aside the goal, the recognition, and the challenges along the way, some people are simply motivated by money, prizes, or some other kind of tangible reward. GREATER GOOD. In the cases of climate change, persistent inequality, and other major societal challenges, many people are called to innovate by an inner sense of justice or altruism, care for others, and a desire for a better future.  Translated to our \u201cvoter apathy\u201d cause I would formulate it as follow:  The people who are already motivated by the pursuit of a particular achievement, by that I mean seeing OP win are already participating and are already actively voting and delegating. They don\u2019t need another incentive. (But I guess these are the least of all people) People seeking the incentive of GLORY could be incentivized by some sort of badge of honor similar to getting a NFT by finishing a certain quest. Make a quest for participating in the delegation and voting process. Nothing comes to my mind that would be comparable to this type of incentive to be honest. (probably need to think about it a little longer). That\u2019s the incentive I\u2019ve already pointed out and which is the most obvious thus I won\u2019t go into further detail. (For reference see my earlier post here) This is what we are already doing here by discussing the topic and trying to find a solution to it. We are doing it for the greater good.  In summary these are the types of the most common incentives we could use to fix the apathy of voters. Furthermore if I look at the most common reasons for not voting include (source):  People don\u2019t think it makes a difference A complex voter registration process They don\u2019t like the candidate or campaign issues They are to busy of having conflicting schedules  Regarding Number 1 I\u2019ve already taken my stance on this one in my inicial post, which can in my opinion only be fixed by showing them that their vote can make a difference. But to make it thus far we first need to get them to vote at all. Since there is no complex voter registration process we can discard this one as well as not liking the candidate or campaign issue since I guess we all more or less like OP and want it to succeed. Number 4. however could be tackled by giving people a monetary incentive because nobody is too busy or has no time - it\u2019s just not their priority. By giving an incentive whether it is by completing a quest and earning a NFT or getting rewards in form of OP tokens or even being eligible for future airdrops will definitely solve this one. So 33% of the issues we face today could be fixed by giving people an incentive. Thus I have to come to the conclusion that I have to disagree with your overall stance on \u201cIncentives aren\u2019t going to make votes meaningful to the point where stakeholders see it as being in their benefit to participate in governance, whether by voting, delegating actively, or engaging in discussions.\u201d!

This could be anything, from monetary to reputation based incentives   Incentivized participation on the part of those that do not see it as their part to contribute is of no value. This forum is already plagued with 1-line reply Andyies and the most popular topics seem to be a triplicate \u201cmake OP gas token\u201d. This, as well as the wider DAO space holds the default that the cost of participation (particularly in this primitive forum-proposal format) is not two, but one sided. It is not only that the participant, the voter, the poster that incurs a cost; but also the wider body. All well-intended participants incur an additional such cost with each additional input. There\u2019s a cost to you reading this. Thank you for paying it. Higher engagement is useful only insofar the aim is to enact decentralization theater or pump KPIs for a VC round. I do hope that that is not the aim here. Governance that requires bribes or punishments is likely broken and plagued by agents that are not genuinely invested in its outcomes. ",
