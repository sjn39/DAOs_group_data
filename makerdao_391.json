This was my point about adding \u2018new\u2019 asset classes to Maker.   I would not bother adding other assets that only have caps of < $1B as they won\u2019t add that much to the DAI borrow.   ETH is growing by itself nicely and the BAT probably will grow with it as more people with multple assets find out about Maker. In effect based on the above imo there is nothing amiss and having the BAT DC be 2x the % of available cap as compared to ETH is like having ETH DC at 200M and complaining it isn\u2019t being utilized.   The idea that Maker could or would claim significantly more than .5-1% of the total available caps in anything at this point really isn\u2019t a realistic view.  I\u2019m thinking at the current rate of debt and deposit expansion that Maker could hit $200M DAI outstanding in approximately 6 months give or take and by then the $3M DC on BAT likely will be hit as well and need to be upped.  By then Maker will have raised the ETH DC probably 3 more times to approx $200M all with ~1% of the total available ETH and BAT market cap value in DAI borrowed.   FYI given the collateralization of > 200% this means there is at least 2-3x the collateral value deposited vs. the DAI minted which I\u2019m looking at above and so this means Maker already has about 1-1.5% of the available caps as collateral deposited and by summer will have 2-3% of the available cap value deposited. As to Risk Premiums on top of the SF\u2019s I\u2019m going to leave that for Cyrus.  BTW:  Total DAI outstanding grew to $130M (1.85M in the past 24 hours).    Folks just sit back because from what I\u2019m seeing growth in DAI outstanding has been consistent and only slows during significant market pull backs (probably due to liquidations).   My only annoyance is not seeing a chart of the total ETH and BAT deposited vs. the $$ amounts as I think this is a more important metric to keep track of along with collateralization ratios.   One of my concerns here is that it took SFs of 16-20% to slow this growth, and about the same time we saw the market pull back.    There is some concern here that the SF rates were not very effective in controlling debt facility growth and a more dynamic debt facility SF based on utilization curve would be more appropriate for managing this.

Obviously this is still just another volatility metric though but i thought it was more useful than the previous one I posted since it compares the two against the volatility of the overall crypto market.

                    "content": "As a preface, I want to say that my understanding of DAI is that it gains its value through the value of the collateral offered to mint it. That said: I\u2019ve given this a bit more thought over the past couple of days and at this point I\u2019m at least fairly certain that at least conceptually BAT SF should not equal ETH SF because its rate of return (RoR) is not equal to the ETH RoR. I haven\u2019t seen much in this thread to explain to me why the BAT SF == ETH SF. IMO, we only find ourselves in this place today because setting the BAT SF == ETH SF was the simplest course of action when launching MCD. Having thought a bit more about the SF the past few days I would like to put out a strawman argument that the SF should be more or less be defined by the green line in the following graph for each asset.  That is, that the SF should equal the difference between the expected RoR for a particular asset and the desired RoR at the given risk level times the desired collateralization ratio. Whether or not beta is an adequate way to quantify risk is probably up to debate, but i think conceptually the idea is there i.e risk v return. As i see it, when demand dynamics are ignored, the SF is simply a mechanism to protect DAI against the inflation caused by the DSR which ensures that each and every DAI token remains backed by the appropriate amount of collateral. To drive this point home I\u2019ll provide a quick example. Let\u2019s imagine a world where the SF of all assets is 0%. All dai is backed by 2 assets types A and B. The DAI DSR is 8.75%. Asset A has a return rate of 7.75% and asset B has a return rate 9.75%. On Jan 1 I mint 100 DAI by offering up $100 of asset A and $100 of asset B. My collateralization ratio at this point is 2. I immediately lock the 100 in the DSR to begin drawing interest. At the end of the year my DAI has grown and I now should have 108.75 DAI (54.38 DAI / vault). The value of my collateral also grew over this time the $100 worth of asset A is now worth $107.75 and the $100 in asset B is now worth $109.75, but now my collateralization ratio is not 2. The 54.38 DAI that is backed by the collateral in vault A now only has a collateralization ratio of ~1.98. For vault B that number is ~2.02. However, if we change this example and charge asset A a SF of 2% we should find that at the end of the year that the DAI minted by that vault should still be backed by 2x the collateral. I\u2019ll leave refuting my strawman as homework for the reader, but here is where I will segue into my point. Whether or not the past 3 years of price appreciation is going to be representative of the future is unknown. ETH may prove to be the better asset to hold but that too is unknown. What i do know is that ETH RoR over the past 2.7 years is not equal to BAT RoR over the past 2.7 years, and I\u2019d be willing to bet that BAT RoR will not equal to ETH RoR over the next 2.7 years, so it seems a bit off to me that we would keep the SF for these two assets in sync. BAT over the past 2.7 years has been both a higher return and a lower volatility asset, so MAYBE I\u2019m justified in saying that the SF should be lower. That said, I think it is ultimately up to the MKR holders to decide if I am right or not, so what i am trying to figure out at this point is what is stopping us from letting the MKR holders vote on the SFs separately. Is there a tech limitation or are we just looking for some signal to justify polling separately? ",

In that case risk of an asset should be handled by Debt Ceiling and Collateralization Ratio   I must say I do not understand Your example. This one in particular would allow risk free rent - so it would operate on loss of MKR holders. I do not see correlation between expected returns on an asset and SF and if there is one, it is positive not negative. If asset is expected to increase in value then owners of this asset will be ready to pay higher SF in order to generate DAI and leverage on this asset with newly generated DAI. Historically SF was higher during bull market  (to keep DAI peg) not lower. I believe You are making false asumtion that by generating DAI against collateral You somehow give up ownership of this collateral. This is not the case. If collateral increases in value, you still 100% benefit from that increase, so You do not give up any of your profits (you can eve increase them if You used generated DAI in order to buy more collateral not to put them in DSR)   This thread looks very interesting.

We know it doesn\u2019t accurately represent the risk for BAT, we know the same thing for ETH, which has also not yet had risk parameters defined for it. At this stage, we are effectively waiting for risk models to be produced by the interim risk team (@cyrus) and risk parameters proposed for both BAT and ETH. Neither of these assets is currently being priced correctly according to their risk. Both assets are being priced solely due to the requirements of monetary policy. Risk isn\u2019t even a component yet, which is why I think your arguments here are premature. All that said, I\u2019m fantastically encouraged that more people are contributing to the discussion around risk, so please don\u2019t think of this as a criticism. We need people to work as part of risk teams! If you don\u2019t mind me asking, is this a general interest of yours or is your interest limited to BAT? To be completely honest risk analysis goes over my head at this point, so you\u2019ll have to forgive me for not engaging directly with your argument above. ",

I was only trying to point out that as long as the RoR > DSR DAI can remain appropriately collateralized even in the complete absence of the stability fee. Which IMO should in theory mean that 1 DAI == $1 again ignoring the demand dynamics of the marketplace. It doesn\u2019t really bring in factors such as the desired profit of the maker holder. You are correct in saying that maker would be operating at a loss or at best break even in that example. Nor does it bring in risk factors which also should be included in the whatever model you use to set SF. I would argue that if you expand upon that idea a bit and instead of trying break even (by making the sure you are charging enough interest to cover the DSR) you set the SF to make up the difference between the RoR of the asset and some desired RoR for the MKR holder (maybe that security market line??) then things start to change.

As others mentioned, however, we are opting to take a slightly different approach. While it is counterintuitive, a market risk approach (such as the one you have used using CAPM and such) is less appropriate given the CDP nature of MakerDAO. Instead, a credit risk analysis is (in our view) more applicable. So daily volatility becomes much less of a factor as opposed to risk of a CDP defaulting, which occurs due to sudden and sharp drawdowns in a collateral asset. Daily volatility is less useful for anticipating these sudden drawdowns, versus some other approaches (such as just basic fundamental analysis). So while BAT may have a lower daily vol over the past 3 years, or a higher expected return, it is (likely) to have significantly higher risk of a sudden drawdown. (In a credit risk model, you might liken this drawdown to a probability of default and the loss given default). A simple counterexample that I like to use a lot is Tether. USDT has incredibly low volatility, but that does not make it a safe collateral type for MakerDAO. ",

Wanted to explain my methods and discuss my findings. Wanted to get peoples critiques. Ok first the TLDR. My methods are probably too over-simplistic to be certain, but based on the numbers i came up with it may be the case that BAT_SF < 9% but it is also the case that BAT_SF > ETH_SF. Ok so now the boring part! Numbers! Let me talk through my methods for solving the Merton Model (there were probably plenty of the things i did were suspect).  just like in my CAPM model above i set the risk free rate == DSR. i am basically treating the whole of the debt ceiling for each asset as 1 big CDP, and that the DC for each asset == K V = CR * K I also had a constant CR == 2 * LR == 3 You can find my work here. Like i said there is probably a few things i have gotten wrong. I encourage anyone who is interested to take a look.  Those simplifications noted you should probably just look at any of the numbers below as (at best) a ballpark estimate. Ok so what did if get for my SF calculation? Well the first numbers I\u2019ll give you is cyrus\u2019s method where I calculate the ln(Risk free CDP / Risky CDP) = SF. Using this method i found the SF_BAT should be ~ 5.58%. Hey its lower right!?!? Well news isn\u2019t so good i also found that ETH have a SF ~4.04%. Knowing that, maybe the argument is over BAT_SF > ETH_SF, and all of my numbers are measurably too low so who cares? Well I personally found the model used to calculate those numbers a little too simplistic bc it doesn\u2019t take the market risk premium into acount. However, i found a metric that i can derive from K, V that does take those two factors into account and seems more in touch with the current SF votes; Expected Return on Debt (RoD). Using that CAPM graph from earlier i found those numbers for each asset to be RoD_ETH ~ 18.08% and RoD_BAT ~ 10.61%. Maybe my original argument still stands? Just doing a quick gut check both of these numbers seem like better candidates for SF given how the executive votes since MCD launch have been pushing the SF from ~ 4% -> 9%. So time for new questions!  Firstly, any criticism into my methods are always welcome. Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion, how is the foundation trying to incorporate the \u201cmarket risk premium\u201d into their risk model? Obviously i know the \u201crisk model\u201d is a work in progress, but any pointers to reading i can do would be very appreciated.  ",

So, we\u2019ve come a bit of a ways longer since we presented those slides, but yeah that\u2019s is the gist of it. Here are some additional thoughts/ considerations.  There\u2019s really no good justification for what the crypto risk-free rate should be, although I am expecting some super-quants to come in and make some solid justifications for something or another. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter though as the drift ends up having minimal impact on the outputs. we have broken up the CDP distribution into buckets instead of 1 giant CDP, which allows for some additional granularity. Instead of using a constant CR, we incorporate a behavioral function that allows for users to adjust their CR over time (users tend to add collateral or wipe dai on selloffs, and vice versa on rallies).  There are also two additional critical features we have been incorporating.  liquidity risk means that there is additional slippage to be incurred upon liquidation the merton model does not include jump risks, which we view as critical to the model. so we add an additional jump component to the basic stochastic model. The parameters of the jump component can be estimated using a fundamental analysis framework for the collateral asset.  Finally, there is a slight difference between CDP pricing and CDP risk management. While the model you describe is for an average or expected stability fee rate, we need to take a few extra steps for the scenario analysis. So we\u2019re doing a value-at-risk analysis that helps inform us what the max theoretical debt ceiling can be. Would love to get your input on any of the above. Unfortunately we haven\u2019t published too much stuff yet regarding what i\u2019ve said, but hopefully in the next few weeks. ",

Yeah i know, but the DSR seems to me to be about as good of starting place as anything else would be. Maybe you could come up with an index that incorporates the some yield numbers from other stablecoins? Coinbase is paying something for holding USDC iirc. Still might not be any more useful though     cyrus:  the merton model does not include jump risks, which we view as critical to the model.   I do have some thoughts on jump risk. I assume what we are trying to do there is quantify the likelihood of some sort of black swan event and price that number in somehow. I could see how that would be a very useful number for overall VaR analysis, but I question how relevant it is to the stability fees charged for an asset. Firstly, my intuition says that the premium we would end up charging for \u201cjump risk\u201d probably could be measured in the 10s of basis points if not single digits. Secondly, it seems like even if I could quantify the risk and decided the premium was significant enough to start charging for, the protocol doesn\u2019t appear to have a great way of storing that value for a rainy day. Maybe you could assume that the MKR holders would take the extra money and set it aside, but it seems like we would need the facilities to earmark that premium for some sort of insurance fund. Maybe put it into some non-dai stablecoin? Maybe buy some off-chain asset like a 10y T-note? Again this is only an opinion but is seems to me that the \u201cbest\u201d risk management strategy as it pertains to black swan events in the crypto market is going to be bringing in off-chain assets as DAI collateral, but I\u2019m sure that is going to be a fairly large effort that brings in a ton of questions concerning how to appropriately decentralize it or price in the counter-party risk. For the time being (and probably for the next few years) the fate of DAI seems very intertwined with the fate of crypto generally. Meanwhile though MKR is trading at ~90 PE ratio (Ben Graham would not approve), so it seems to me that seems to me that we should be more interested in getting earnings up for the sake of the MKR holder.

I don\u2019t know how suspect it is, but I do think it\u2019s a good idea to diversify the buffer outside of Dai. While Dai is the only thing you need to cover bad debt, it feels a bit weird for MakerDAO to hoard a chunk of the Dai supply. There have indeed been various proposals for some sort of treasury, and I think some people inside the Foundation are working on a plan as well (although I am not really involved with that initiative). $500k is also certainly not enough. I was hoping we could put out some models to calculate more meaningful numbers before we hit that amount, but unfortunately it did not happen. As we scale, that surplus will need to go much, much higher. Additionally, there are some technical concerns about the behavior of the surplus in regards to emergency shutdown, and we\u2019re still working through how to remedy that. So for now, the surplus is just kind of up in the air. The jump risks do affect MKR as well, of course, and we have built in a steep discount to the spot price as an input parameters (close to 80-90% IIRC). $500 mil market cap certainly doesn\u2019t mean $500 mil of insurance.

The jump risk premium goes up as the LR falls, right? The SF is ultimately a function of losses. Lower LRs lead to more harmful jumps. Right now with a high LR, the jumps just aren\u2019t large enough to trigger any losses (hence why we\u2019ve never had an undercollateralized Vault). We\u2019re more likely to see this with a lower LR. Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding your point. ",

As far as I\u2019m aware in current setup surplus buffer should not be arbitrarily large because in case of emergency shutdown it goes to dai holders and that may screw incentives if it will be too large in comparition to dai supply. But truth be told probably in an event of sudden market crash DAI buffer is probably better backstop against undercollateralisation than minting MKR and hoping there will be suffficient demand for them.

                    "content": "Hi guys, it\u2019s been a bit since my last post and I wanted to give an update on my findings. \u2026So after calculating the expected return on debt (rD) number from before and finding that it seemed to approximate what we have been seeing in the executive votes i decided to refine my model a bit to hopefully reduce the difference between our calculated sf and the calculated actuals. To do this I decided to not model each collateral type as one large cdp and instead find the weighted average rD for each individual CDP. You can find the source code of the program i made to do this here: https://github.com/tamccall/dai-vaults. Looking at the CDPs individually did make a small difference for my rD calculation. Using the same CAPM parameters from before. I found that the rD_ETH to be ~14.7% and the rD_BAT to be ~9.04%. Although, You can probably take those numbers with a grain of salt though as they are very dependent on how you determine the market risk premium for eth and bat respectively. As I said earlier between the time periods of Jun 1, 2017 - Jan 26 2020 ETH had an annualized return of about -10% that said if you look at ETH over the period of 2016 - 2020 you\u2019ll come out with very different numbers, and of course all of these numbers are based on past returns which are not necessarily correlated with the future. A second criticism might be the usefulness of rD itself. Should a better metric be used to help inform stability fee votes? I\u2019m unsure. Ultimately having gone through this exercise I have come away with 2 main takeaways.  Maker should probably consider making the underlying debt portfolio easier to access The way we vote on spread seems a bit backward to me.  First I\u2019ll tackle what is probably the first of the most controversial of those two assertions. If you notice in both my models above to calculate an estimate for SF one of the first things that we need to know is the \u201crisk free rate\u201d (rf). Now, if you accept my premise that the rf in the crypto market is == DSR then it seems odd to me that we first decide on SF and then subtract a few basis points from there to determine DSR. Given a rD number in the model above along with the input parameters sans rf (K,V, etc). I would have a hard time arriving at rf that was used for calculation. It is much easier to calculate the former (rD) from the latter (rf). Likewise, it seems to me that maker voters should probably be setting stability fees based on the DSR and not the other way around. My last point was touched on a bit earlier by @jernejml , but I\u2019ll drive this home as my biggest take away from this exercise. Although it is public information, looking at the underlying debt portfolio of maker is certainly not a trivial task to do. I am a software engineer and a \u201cmoney enthusiast,\u201d so with a little help from @Adam_Skrodzki I was able to get the data I was looking for. For most people, however, I would imagine writing a javascript program to query the ether blockchain is just too much of a barrier of entry to cross. Could be keeping out people with more of an economics background from adding their input on the protocols risk. Perhaps the foundation might consider publishing certain datasets in easy to consume formats such that independent analysis need not be such an undertaking. I could imagine something like a weekly snapshot of the debt portfolio linked from makerdao.com. Maybe I\u2019ll put together a signaling request around the later at some point. That said, I may come back to this topic at some point in the future, but I think I\u2019ve spent enough time trying to figure this out for now! ",

There only a couple of tokens with the same or higher SF, namely: MANA (10%) and YFI-A (9%). This seems objectively a bit weird.  BAT has been the first ERC20 to be added to MCD, because it was considered a serious project back in 2019. The Brave company has been building up since then, so I guess the evaluation should be the same. See, e.g., consistent growth-over-time of the BAT purchases from Brave: https://twitter.com/BraveSampson/status/1344378924567035906/photo/1  BAT token holders have grown 4x (from 100k to 400k) in the last 24 months. The price of BAT has been very stable, between 15 cents and 35cents over the last few years (now it is 20cents).  Question: What is the general sentiment here towards reducing the SF of BAT to, e.g., 4%? Note: The amount of BAT in Maker is kind of negligible vs other tokens (2.8 millions). But this, imo, should not imply that we do not care about it and/or disincentivize its usage in MCD. ",

                    "content": "Thank you both for the answers.     Andy_McCall:  Ultimately it just boils down to where we want our margin spreads to be.   My impression is that we should:  be safe, i.e., have a SF that agrees with the risk model and is sufficient to cover the risk. So, accordingly with what you said, SF > 5.93%. Calculate both the \u2018margin\u2019 and the \u2018total debt\u2019.  Regarding the current example of BAT which we are discussing discussing, we have SF=8% and 2.8m DAIs. If setting the SF=6% would bring up the amount DAI minted to 6m, that would be a clear gain in terms of total fees earned. ",

                    "content": "When I was referring to margin before I was really referring to \u201cprofit margin.\u201d Meaning if you have an expected loss of say 6% well that\u2019s pretty much the minimum you have to charge, but you may well want to charge 8% so you could pocket the 2% difference. As far as whether or not dropping the SF 200 bps is a \u201cclear gain\u201d that\u2019s probably debatable just depends on what your goals are. If the goal is more DAI issued then yeah I think it\u2019s worth considering, but if your goal is profit that might be another story. ",
