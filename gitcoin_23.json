A key way for us to communicate is through our emails. Some emails are sent automatically upon an action (transactional) and some are sent manually (campaigns). And now we are now looking to improve our campaigns. Our newsletter currently has \u2248267K subscribers, that we send campaigns to regularly. These emails are today created, tested and sent through Acquia, an open source email service provider that we send \u22483 million emails through every month. After working in Acquia for the last 3 months, I\u2019ve learned both personally and from our team that Acquia does not meet our current marketing needs. They don\u2019t have the right tools to help us improve our communication and facilitate our goal to create a lean mean marketing machine. So, what\u2019s next? Together with the team we\u2019ve made a list of what we would like a potential new email service provider help us do;  Improve our ability to A/B test content and subject lines Improve the workflow of creating a campaign Better reporting Provide tools to help us grow the email list Make a more personal approach to connect the user with the content they want.  We also want to make sure that we partner with someone who values privacy, and only collect the necessary data. We\u2019re still early in this Web 3.0 journey, and for now we have not identified any Web 3.0 native solutions that enable us to do our job and serve our needs. So until then, we need to look to web 2.0 providers. Hubspot is a marketing suite we feel solves our needs and will help us grow moving forward. They have market-leading marketing tools, reporting and usability. They also have a really solid knowledge base and a lot of tutorials to help us do our jobs more efficiently. They also support open source. I would love to get some feedback on this, as I think a move like this would benefit the marketing of GitcoinDAO and would level up our marketing significantly. ",
