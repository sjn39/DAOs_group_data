                    "content": " Maker Brand Team Yearly Update Hi Maker Community, This is a continuation of the Growth Core Unit Yearly Update, where we aim to describe in more depth the milestones and ongoing work from the Growth\u2019s Brand Team throughout the 2022. The Brand team was first proposed & incubated within the Growth Core Unit during the end of April 2022;with the objective of building a strong and reputable brand for MakerDAO to engage with our users and a broader audience.  Highlights of the year:  Nature \u2013 a brand initiative for Maker Vault Owners  We designed the whole Nature campaign and coordinated the execution of all needed assets to make it work: narrative, website, integrations with POAP and One Tree Planted, etc. In which Maker Vault owners minted 444 POAPs and planted 125 trees in Mexico to help maintain the habitat of the butterflies native to that region.    Internal Announcements Process:  We developed a visual designing process for each of our assets required in our social network Postings, which will help us elevate the Maker brand as we celebrate each of our milestones. The most important success stories were: The Huntingdon Valley Bank Integration video: The first commercial loan participation between a U.S. Regulated Financial Institution and a Decentralized Digital Currency. And The official announcement of the Maker Teleport: An infrastructure for teleporting DAI across the multi-chain space without losing security or scalability.    Argent Campaign:  We ran a test campaign with Argent, which will create the standard for future campaigns we will run with potential partners. Our objective for the campaign was to understand whether for future campaigns we should focus on reaching more users or more DAI volume. For the purpose of A/B testing, in this campaign we focused on attracting more DAI users.  The campaign consisted in a raffle draw for Argent users, who seeked to get an amount of DAI based on their purchase,  500 winners of $10 ($5k) - deposit at least 10 DAI 100 winners of $50 ($5k) - deposit at least 50 DAI 10 winners of $500 ($5k) - deposit at least 500 DAI  This campaign ran between the 1st and the 14th of August. During this period, Argent sent educational materials to their user base. During the campaign, on zkSync DAI circulation increased by 4.78%, whilst in the same period both USD and USDT circulation decreases. We generated $17 for every $1 spent, generated 438 unique users and completed 623 transactions with and average $526 purchase amount.  1600\u00d7838 201 KB  1600\u00d7839 216 KB  Consecutively, we ran a post campaign survey which delivered the following Insights: -9% first time buyers will repurchase -62% believe in DAI stability -50% use DAI as value preserve -90% said they also use USDC -70% use DAI as inflation protection  Partnership Ad campaign on the Bankless podcast:  The promotion consisted in integrating our ad promotion for maker Vaults at the beginning of their podcasts episodes. See screenshot below.  Here are some of the Reach Highlights over the months: May Sponsor Analytics indicated the podcast saw the most downloads & views that quarter than any other \u2013 a whopping 6.7M views on the Bankless Newsletter and 6.71M downloads on the Bankless podcast. Hitting an all time high engagement on the Newsletter. Bankless seemed to be the place where people sought for advice during the bear market\u2014subscribers went up 11% in Q3. Seeing the most impressions on Twitter the page had ever seen \u2013 26M (versus 10.6M the previous 60 days!). Through August and July it continued to see crazy high open rates across both newsletters! Bankless (57%) and Metaversal (46%)   The First in-real-life Maker AD/Awareness campaign:  We ran our first in-real-life awareness campaign during Devcon, where we were the only crypto project that ran video campaigns at El Dorado International Airport in Bogot\u00e1 airport to run during the event. One of them was a rolling video strategically placed on a TV at the immigration check-in, where everyone flying in had exposure to it while standing in line. Our ads were recognized by many of the crypto community, and we have received plenty of Twitter mentions & positive feedback around it! Besides, thousands of non-crypto people were also exposed to it. This was a first-time test of IRL ads for our Brand team, which was very successful and taught us more about brand awareness, the knowledge that we will further use in the favor of growing Maker\u2019s exposure to the world. With the 17 different screens all over the airport (focused on international flights) we reached upside of 71k visual impacts in 2 weeks, exposure to 1m international passengers and external tweets with astounding performance reach. By using the 17 different screens located throughout the airport (with a focus on international flights), we were able to reach more than 71,000 visual impacts in just two weeks. This exposure allowed us to reach over 1 million international passengers, and generated external tweets with impressive reach and performance.   The Result of our PR work was able to secure notable mentions of Maker in major media outlets such as Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, and Forbes, among others. This helped to improve the visibility of our project and increase brand recognition within the crypto community and the market as a whole.   Redesign of the Maker DAO website:   We are continuing to work on its redesign with very important progress. Improving the structure, navigabilit of the site, as well as updating the content and adding its corresponding features to provide a more pleasant and user-friendly experience. As a team we are planning on implementing a content strategy to improve the visibility of the site on search engines and increas organic traffic. Overall, we are very satisfied with the progress we are making and are excited to share the new design of the site in the near future.  Communication strategy for the Endgame Plan (to deploy it through 2023)  The Endgame plan has been one of the most exciting things to happen in the DeFi world. However, the big challenge is the complexity of Endgame is difficult to comprehend for people outside of the DAO and sometimes even for people inside the DAO. Since the beginning of the Endgame discussion, we have had a lot of interest from the media to cover it, unfortunately, without a simple and non-complex description, some media outlets are misrepresenting and misinterpreting Endgame. To tackle this, at Growth CU, we are working on creating a simplified media-friendly narrative to describe Endgame, focusing on what improvement it will bring, how it will function and the benefits it will bring for anyone that wants to engage with Maker. Our ambition is to create an easy-to-understand narrative which will create comprehension through the repetition of the same version of the story. Once this simplified external facing Endgame narrative is finalised and formalised, we will work closely with our PR agency to educate media outlets. Our motivation for carrying out this task is to promote the benefits of Endgame and reduce the focus on complexity.  Our Social Media Work Twitter Since February 2022 (the month we started to manage the MakerDAO Twitter account), these are our metrics:     Our Tweets with the most impressions of the year: HVB Bank Tweet - 298k impressions HVB Bank Tweet - 169k impressions Monetalis Poll - 139k impressions HVB Bank Tweet - 132k impressions HVB Bank Tweet - 114k impressions Our Tweets with the most engagement of the year: HVB Bank Tweet - 8,300 engagements HVB Bank Tweet - 5,500 engagements HVB Bank Tweet - 5,100 engagements HVB Bank Tweet - 4,400 engagements Maker Protocol Status - 3,600 engagements LinkedIn Since September 2022 (the month we started to manage the MakerDAO LinkedIn account), these are our metrics: Note: For the engagement rate chart, we take September as a starting point, because in prior months, Data shows the engagement rate is considerably higher due to the insignificant amount of impressions versus engagements.

There needs to be a better way to make the valuable and excellent work teams and contributors do more visible at the Governance level. It\u2019s often challenging for Delegates (even more so for MKR holders) to see and digest all the information about what goes on day-to-day with so much focus being on new proposals and the dynamics of governance itself. Even we missed mentioning Growth in our recent platform update where we explained why we voted against funding a new Endgame information portal because internal teams were already working on this.     MakerGrowth:   Communication strategy for the Endgame Plan (to deploy it through 2023)  The Endgame plan has been one of the most exciting things to happen in the DeFi world. However, the big challenge is the complexity of Endgame is difficult to comprehend for people outside of the DAO and sometimes even for people inside the DAO. Since the beginning of the Endgame discussion, we have had a lot of interest from the media to cover it, unfortunately, without a simple and non-complex description, some media outlets are misrepresenting and misinterpreting Endgame. To tackle this, at Growth CU, we are working on creating a simplified media-friendly narrative to describe Endgame, focusing on what improvement it will bring, how it will function and the benefits it will bring for anyone that wants to engage with Maker. Our ambition is to create an easy-to-understand narrative which will create comprehension through the repetition of the same version of the story. Once this simplified external facing Endgame narrative is finalised and formalised, we will work closely with our PR agency to educate media outlets. Our motivation for carrying out this task is to promote the benefits of Endgame and reduce the focus on complexity.   One suggestion for the team would be to devote some time to internal marketing! You should promote yourselves in the Forum and main Discord channels in addition to working with external parties. This might look like more actively commenting in other threads and inserting the Growth perspective in debates that do receive a lot of eyeballs. You might share reminders in internal posts that various other social media channels are active where community members can follow news about MakerDAO. Consider sharing data and information such as reported in this EOY review in a real-time way that\u2019s integrated in community conversation so we can all be better informed about these important contributions and initiatives. The content we see published on Twitter for example, including the video animations, has been superior in quality, design and messaging. Your summaries and content might be very welcome and impactful as regular Forum posts in addition to social medial shares for the wider public. ",
