                    "content": "Abstract: This EIP proposes a decentralized tracking system for ERC-721 and ERC-155 tokens, which will make it easy for the community to access and track the daily statistics of these tokens. This will help to prevent the centralization of the NFT marketplace by companies such as OpenSea and others, and will provide greater transparency and accessibility for all members of the community. Motivation: The current centralized tracking system for ERC-721 and ERC-155 tokens is controlled by a few large companies, which can create a bottleneck for access and information about these tokens. Additionally, the centralized nature of these marketplaces can lead to a lack of transparency and accessibility for the community. This EIP aims to address these issues by providing a decentralized tracking system for these tokens. Specification: The proposed decentralized tracking system will consist of a smart contract that will be responsible for tracking and storing information about ERC-721 and ERC-155 tokens. This smart contract will be accessible to all members of the community, and will provide the following information:  Token ID Token name Token symbol Token metadata Token ownership Token transaction history Token trading history Token market statistics Token creation date Token destruction date  The smart contract will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be accessible through a web-based interface. This will allow for easy access and tracking of these tokens by all members of the community. Rationale: A decentralized tracking system for ERC-721 and ERC-155 tokens will provide greater transparency and accessibility for the community. It will also help to prevent the centralization of the NFT marketplace by companies such as OpenSea and others, by providing a decentralized alternative. This will help to promote greater decentralization and community participation in the NFT market. Backwards Compatibility: This EIP is backward compatible with existing ERC-721 and ERC-155 tokens, as it only adds new functionality to track these tokens in a decentralized way. ",
