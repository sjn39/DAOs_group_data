I also think that we should do this sooner rather than later. As in have a poll this week or next week at the latest. We don\u2019t really have a framework for calculating a safe/ideal debt ceiling based on the collateral risk yet, so seems like we should just eyeball it. Here are the trade-offs I\u2019ve managed to come up with. Significant increase (to 150-200 mil) + We shouldn\u2019t have to revisit the debt ceiling before MCD hits. - More value at risk in the case of a catastrophic failure of the system. - Puts the peg in danger in the event of a significant sustained bull-run that prompts mass-printing of Dai of to the new limit. Moderate Increase (to 110-120mil) + Less value at risk in the event of catastrophic failure. + Puts the peg in less danger in the event of a significant sustained bull-run that prompts mass-printing of Dai. - Increased likelihood of having to revisit the debt-ceiling if we get close again. Personally I like the idea of a significant increase, despite the risks. In the event of a massive bull-run we should be able to disincentivize solely using the stability rate (even if this means a large hike). If Dai continues to be minted at the current rate, this is going to come up again in two months or so. I\u2019d rather kick the can further than two months down the road. ",
