This allows managing both fungible and non-fungible non-transferable tokens in one smart contract and for example minting a badge and reputation points in one transaction. It requires consent from the recipient for minting. Some extensions have been explored but might not need to be included in this standard.  Feedback here, or as comments on the notion pages, is welcome! ",
