We will work to:   Support the launch of Grants 2.0 protocols and the growth and adoption of Passport   Level up Grants Programs through strategic marketing efforts and streamlining marketing processes round over round   Grow the Gitcoin community, deepening engagement & improving brand affinity   Improve cross-stream communication by establishing thriving partnerships with other workstreams that create shared alignment on marketing efforts and ops best practices   MMM underspent significantly against our Season 14 budgets (details outlined below). More specifically, after proposing our Season 14 budget, we made the following changes in response to market conditions:  Postponed planned investments in brand strategy (into Season 15 & 16)  MMM also spent less than budgeted in the following area:  Product marketing (hired one part-time, level 2 person supported by a workstream lead). Given workstream lead capacity & market conditions, we were not able to invest as much as we intended in this area. This will change in Season 15.  Based on what we learned from S14, MMM is making the following changes for S15:   Moving from a team structure with 7 substreams (content, brand & creative, community experience, growth, product marketing, PR/Comms, Ops, Strategy & governance) to a team (and budget) structure with 3 key go-to-market areas and one team support area (see \u201cTeam Composition\u201d below)   Doubling down on investments in product marketing, shifting resources significantly to support the DAO\u2019s protocol-first strategy   Pausing paid engagements with our PR/Comms partner, pausing experimental webdev-projects & canceling several other projects that do not closely align with the DAO\u2019s ratified essential intents    Amount MMM\u2019s S15 budget is $417, 543 (-15% vs S14 budget of $504,635). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, MMM is requesting $172,935 for Season 15 from the treasury.

We have restructured our workstream and workflows to align to 4 major focus areas: Protocols, Programs, Community Engagement, MMM Ops and are committed to operating as lean as possible. A note on community engagement: Currently, there is an emergent DAO-wide conversation regarding duplicative efforts around community engagement. As MMM carves out its place in community engagement work that is foundational to Gitcoin\u2019s success, it is important to understand how MMM defines community. Community, as defined by us, can be divided into 4 rudimentary categories (exact segmentation TBD):     Level of engagement Audience Segment     Core Contributors   Second Stakeholders   Third Participants   Fourth Web3 Citizens    Each level is categorized by depth of engagement/action in relation to Gitcoin & the level of integrity to our business functions. From very participatory & integral (core) \u2192 less participatory & integral (fourth). Over the course of S15 MMM will work to understand our audience segments more deeply and create a comprehensive strategy that will aim to define and align the DAO on roles and responsibilities of each WS as they relate to marketing efforts (grassroots & beyond) across these 4 levels of engagement. Through this process, we will have a unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO & our community of fans and stakeholders will be empowered to champion our vision, mission & activities organically. See below for more information on key results as they relate to the community engagement initiatives of MMM.     Initiative/Dept Essential Intent S15 Objective Key Results     Protocol launches & adoption EI1: Protocol Adoption  Discover & refine product-market fit for Gitcoin\u2019s protocols (with premier partners). We will both shape and communicate our products & protocols. We will shape it by doing customer & competitor research (to help identify unmet needs) and persona development (to better define the target audience). We will communicate it with content and collateral, market education, and coordinated & effective product launches.  Protocols general:  Sales materials created and being used by sales team   Protocol product marketing pages integrated into website   Brand/positioning strategy finalized for protocols   Complete key website migration changes of Gitcoin.co including homepage and grants page banners to MMM\u2019s control and revised top and sub navigation (aligned with Protocol launches)Passport specific:  1000 new passports created from content marketing traffic (blogs, Twitter, etc.)   5 autonomous partner integrations from SDK traffic   Publish 3 new branded walkthru demos  Grants 2.0 specific:   Finalize names, logos and typography for the grants product suite and each individual product   10,000 cumulative views on Grants 2.0 blog posts   Grow awareness of the protocol through co-marketing efforts and case study creation with Optimism and Fantom   5,000 total visitors across all Grants 2.0 product website pages    Grants program marketing & growth EI2: Grants Program Success  Grow awareness, comprehension, and participation for Grants Rounds. Awareness, comprehension & participation will grow successively round over round for all target groups: matching partners, grantees & individual funders  10% increased in unique (non-sybil) contributions (15,000)   10% increase of grants receiving $5,000+ in funding  80% grant saturation for ecosystem and cause rounds  Comprehensive grants program marketing strategy by end of season  Deliver Grants Round marketing internal runbook  Implement SEO audit recommendations into back-end of Gitcoin.co website  Develop marketing templates & toolkit for ecosystem partners    Community engagement EI1 and 2: Protocol Adoption & Grants Program Success  Grow Gitcoin community, deepen engagement & improve brand affinity. We will have a unified strategy for community engagement across the DAO & our community will be empowered to champion our vision, mission & activities organically.  Develop community engagement strategy to align and coordinate grassroots efforts of PGF, DAO Ops and MMM (including identifying audiences and outlining/aligning on DAO-wide objectives)   Develop and execute Twitter channel strategy With increased Twitter content outputs, maintain engagement rate of 2.5% (includes likes and RTs) Increase number of Twitter followers by 10% (12,000 followers)    MMM OS EI4: DAO Organization  Refine our OS for a thriving MMM Workstream & DAO.

GTC amounts are rounded values.  S15 Priorities MMM is laser focused on improving the DAO\u2019s overall marketing tactics and operations with a strategic lens. Much of this work will be focused on creating solid marketing foundations for our protocols while also growing our community and grants programs. In addition to aligning and driving strategic marketing initiatives, our S15 priorities will include social media management, analytics, content development, and protocol branding work. Below is a list of our top 6 priorities for the next 90 days:  Branding for the Protocols suite including new names, a narrative framework, visual identity, and robust content plan Onboarding a fractional product marketing manager to support the launch of the protocols suite Create a comprehensive grants program marketing strategy in partnership with with PGF Publish grantee success stories in the form of blog posts and case studies Develop clear guidelines for what \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d means and looks like at Gitcoin through a community engagement strategy (in collaboration with PGF and DAO Ops) Successful co-marketing partnership product partnership launches with Optimism and Fantom   Notes on team composition Programs & Protocols Squads MMM has recently restructured our operations and team structure to create lean, agile cross-functional teams in support of our 4 Essential Intents. Program and Protocol teams will each be equipped with a:  Content team  Marketing ops function   Marketing strategy function The goal of having these three functions centralized to Programs & Protocols is to support rich context-building amongst contributors within each area. At the beginning of S15, the marketing ops role and marketing strategy role will be held by the same person with an opportunity to hire for these functions once roles and responsibilities have been clarified and established.  MMM S15 Structure2212\u00d71296 154 KB  Support Squad At the heart of MMM there is a cross-functional team that supports all 3 go-to-market areas.

The news that in s14 you: \" * Created go-to-market metrics\" caught my eye. Could you speak a little more to how metrics are used or will be used to refine marketing efforts?  I know there are some efforts that are very hard to quantify - and others where it is almost too easy to quantify\u2026 Is this mostly a growth function?  Would these be used in the future to define success criteria? Regarding the focus on personas and helping to articulate them at a higher level of depth - how will this be performed w/ GPC and product leadership?  Would product contribute however MMM would take lead in articulating the persona, explaining their characteristics, and so on?  And then product could use these to inform their roadmap? I see that my questions are not specifically about the amount being spent and rather about metrics and how some work is being divided.  Nonetheless, I hope they are of some value in unpacking a little more MMM\u2019s value and focus. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Pop for the summary of our discussion.  A few key things to highlight  The MMM restructuring This workstream is undergoing a transformation which the other workstreams seem to feel is positive. Having gone through this with FDD, I wanted to understand if other workstream leads felt there was strong collaboration and effective leadership empowering the workstream to align their outcome to the EI of the DAO. The answer I have found is: Leadership across the DAO is confident in @Viriya and @CoachJonathan to make the needed changes to align the workstream behind the most impactful efforts in a way that is collaborative and effective.  My steward opinion In my humble opinion, the role of a steward council member who is assigned to a workstream for an in depth review must be deeply considered. These opinions can heavily influence the way other stewards vote and should not be expressed weakly. The following high level considerations are most important for me in deciding HOW I will approach public vs private critique. Always Public Critique If these items are in an acceptable state, I will privately critique the items in the following section.  Alignment of work with DAO Essential Intents Alignment with Roadmaps & Priorities Set by CSDO* Alignment with Gitcoin Values & Principles* Leaning into rather than away from collaboration Follows agreed upon format, terminology, etc.  *These items have not yet been defined by the DAO, therefore I must use my best understanding of what these are. It is my opinion that this budget meets the acceptable standards for each of the above. Private Critique if the Above is Acceptable These domains are what I consider private critique as long as the above is in an acceptable state:  Prioritization Accuracy, Definition, and Reporting of Metrics Competency & Efficiency of Key Individuals Operational Processes Pay Rates  This is not to say that I have concerns in all these domains with the MMM workstream at this time. I am attempting to set a clearly defined guideline to define how I might best support GitcoinDAO in a position with a high level of responsibility & consequence. The goal is to avoid micro-managing while assisting the workstream to more effectively use their resources with the help of my perspective and experience.  In Conclusion In understanding the context around why and how MMM is making bold changes, I intend to vote for this budget provided a willingness to work to alleviate any private critiques I have during the season which leadership from MMM has already shown.

I believe @krrisis and @Viriya are coordinating more here and expect to coordinate more in S15, is that right? Ideally we have a solid community engagement plan outlined (that still respects the autonomy each WS wants to have with the community).

Good  MMM wanting to work with workstreams for some clarity is great. We\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to tap onto MMM\u2019s talent the past year. Experimented with forms, raids, etc more demos would be healthy, I tend to get a lot of questions about how to use Gitcoin etc I\u2019ve heard great things about Laura coming in and having some guidance for Grants 2.0 would help  Could improve  15/26 goals weren\u2019t successful last season. This season you\u2019re looking to do another 26. Based on S15 priorities, you\u2019re working on mostly planning and strategising which means you\u2019ll miss the GR15 period. This is, honestly, quite worrying. This is reminiscent of S14 where the notable accomplishments are mostly plans, strategies, decision-making processes too. I would suggest to improve accountability by implementing a performance based approach. @CoachJonathan and @Viriya perhaps you could withold 30% of the budget and if 100% if hit all 30% could go out as a bonus, 75% then 20% goes out etc. @kyle I hope this isn\u2019t too controversial I see the Social media manager role repeated across all 3 squads but in the diagram there is just 1 person. Previously I think we relied on just cynthia to manage it and I think this is still the model? Could anyone help clarify why we need more people to do it now? Especially if its one Twitter account @CoachJonathan @Viriya  you\u2019re missing a budget for a strategist under grants program marketing & growth (I know Laura\u2019s handling it now but someone specialised in it would help). Suggest perhaps expanding the community engagement strategist role to encompass it. In fact, as a side note, I\u2019m curious how do you view strategy? What are the outputs of a strategy? Because under S15 priorities I see that the outputs are \u2018guidelines\u2019.  What is the high-level breakdown of responsibilities for contributors (esp. those who are PT)? There are 5 FT and 15 PT contributors and some are assigned critical functions like supporting GR side rounds.  Looking forward  personally, some added help for community will be helpful and I\u2019m hoping that with better management of the content team we could finally have some media support to put forth the 50+ weeks of library sessions and twitter spaces, a goldmine of content. I will reach out to Mathilda for this I previously supported on writing (did some of GR13\u2019s posts, lots of tweet summaries, and the digest) I\u2019d like to see this cadence returned and Gitcoin help to push forward the narrative of public goods once more!

Leadership across the DAO is confident in @Viriya and @CoachJonathan to make the needed changes to align the workstream behind the most impactful efforts in a way that is collaborative and effective.  I\u2019d like to publicly attest to the drastic shift I\u2019ve seen as a GPC workstream lead and previously Gitcoin Holdings VP of Product. @jpepper contributions to product marketing in S14 have been tremendous, but I continued to find overall collaboration with MMM to be a bit rudderless around bringing the Grants 2.0 and Passport protocols to market. Over the last 4-6 weeks we\u2019ve turned a major corner that includes project management across the multiple streams of branding and marketing work required to have a complete GTM plan.  While I share some of the perspective around wanting to see more concrete outcomes committed from MMM, I also see and acknowledge the need to slow down to speed up a bit here.  I will be voting to support this budget request. ",

In my S14 voter guide, I wrote: My main point of feedback to the workstream is around focus - I believe this budget strives to do too much, at the expense of doing a few things well. I wonder if the S14 list-of-things to do could be pared down even more. As S15 begins, I am seeing this move in the direction I have been hoping for - I\u2019m a huge supporter of the substream simplification effort within MMM this season, moving from seven substreams to three key areas - and I love the clarity with the visuals on team structure. More tactically, the support for the Grants Program ahead of GR15 has been lightyears ahead of prior seasons. Ahead of S16, I think the big area to figure out will be \u201cCommunity Engagement\u201d and how MMM, PGF, and DAO Ops collaborate on this effectively. We have had disparate efforts that haven\u2019t successfully coordinated in the past and my hope is that, in S15, we can change this. ",

The best place to find this at the moment is to look at our Notion page of who\u2019s who. Not all roles have been documented. Our intention is to be at 100% fully documented roles by end of season.

Essential Intents In S15, FDD has components of our work that focus on all four of the DAO\u2019s Essential Intents - though our priorities will be on the following EIs in the given order:  Grant Program Success Protocol Adoption DAO Organization & Financial Sustainability  More Information on the Essential Intents can be found in this post.  TL;DR In Season 15, FDD aims to provide the Gitcoin community with the knowledge that matching funds are allocated as optimally as possible within the given set of assumptions and constraints. One focus will be operationally executing the fraud detection & defense needs of the Gitcoin main/Ethereum round & any other community moderated rounds. The second is assisting Gitcoin Product Collective with operational insights, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic/mechanism design research. Based on what we learned in Season 14, we will improve our communication during the season to remove confusion regarding FDD priorities, purpose, and alignment with GitcoinDAO.  For more context regarding our vision, the current state of FDD and more please refer to the supplement document.   Amount FDD is requesting $349,500. This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves. Breakdown of the budget per budget category and initiative can be found at the end.     Gitcoin Season Season 15 Season 14 Season 13     FDD Season Budget $349,500 $330,000 $596,295   FDD Season Reserves $233,000 $220,000 $596,295   Unspent Reserves % 1)  100% 100% 100%   Treasury Request 2)  $362,500 $281,041 $879,590    1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower. 2) The Season 15 treasury request amount is an estimate using the price of $2.99 GTC to calculate the total of the reserves rolled over from Season 14.

                    "content": "Thank you @epowell101 for your feedback. Here are our answers to your questions: Question      epowell101:   where does cloud or data center spending show up?    Spendings for software as a service does show up in the budget breakdown. However, the visibility of SaaS expenses could have been outlined more clearly.     tigress:  Bounties & SaaS - $7,5k   SaaS expenses for cloud / data center are considered to be part of the initiative Data Empowerment in our percentage split estimates. The current cost is < $250/month for Google Cloud Platform & Github. At some point we might look into and explore decentralized cloud solutions. Question      epowell101:   do we anticipate it growing as we gather more data?    Yes, but not a significantly (< $1,000 monthly) anytime in the next 3-6 months. Much of what we are doing is making  great documentation for which subgraphs and open web3 APIs are best keeping current data sets clean for crowdsourced analysis.  Neither FDD nor our initiative Data Empowerment is intended to be a data services organization. Question      epowell101:  would FDD potentially generate revenues in the future as other platforms embrace Grants 2.0 and need \u201cour\u201d / your protective services?   This is a spicy question. Our current answer is:  We highlight that FDD is aiming to protocolize solutions, not to be a services company of any sort. That said, there are definitely avenues for monetization including spinning out a service DAO or even building and owning digital public infrastructure for sharing data, feature and model engineering for ML, and crowdsourcing data science insights. However, one could argue and ask: why does protocolizing seem to be at odds with generating revenue? Which one applies:  Revenue XOR Protocolizing Revenue OR Protocolizing  The need is for buy in from the rest of the DAO and stewards to give us the freedom to discover where the value is. To make that happen, the stewards community would have to reconsider their decision, because they voted DOWN a discovery for a revenue-generating sybil detection DAO. We understood that the driver behind this decision was continually viewing attempts of revenue generation as \u201cdefecting\u201d. Question      epowell101:  What have been the most difficult areas of responsibility to clarify between FDD and other workstreams?   @DisruptionJoe has been leading most of alignment conversions and he outlines: One area is our work toward solutions which decentralize the moderation inputs to a grant round. User and grant moderation is one of our core competencies. Our bottoms up suggestions all recommend that we build digital public infrastructure to sustainably serve these needs in a credibly neutral way that is equally accessible to all the communities that will run their own rounds in the future. The stewards, guided by a few strong opinions, however, have pushed us to centralize our efforts for efficiency and simply execute until a time when the other workstreams can design protocol-based solutions. One of our strengths is Protocol Research. We believe our research could be much better utilized to align roadmaps and context awareness across the DAO. Here are some hands-on examples: Example 1 - Using Ethelo for scaling grant reviews Example 2 - Discovery for Sybil Detection DAO Example 3 - Shutting down the community model only to be wowed by a presentation of on-chain features. And \u2026 The best example - We couldn\u2019t get our contributors\u2019 Data Access to cGrants database until last season for all but Blockscience. We couldn\u2019t tinker with data to improve rounds over rounds. So then we literally moved the whole SAD model to be run by the DAO with no way to get or check data other than requesting it from Blockscience and scraping it. (We didn\u2019t have any access to data prior to season 14.)   We like to highlight that alignment efforts made by other workstreams, especially GPC, since last budget season have made drastic improvements for us in all the mentioned areas. We do feel the results of better communication about these issues.   Hope this helps  ",

The vibes are awesome, I love to catch bad projects, bad actors/ sybils  One aspect I really don\u2019t understand is why we got so much push back on grant reviews when we were very effective as a group and managed to protect Gitcoin for 4 seasons.  I agree that maybe we should have been more proactive or maybe more involved in the DAO as a whole, but we are still here  ",

Specifically to make sure collaboration is strong and we are focused on the protocol future. I am supportive of the budget as proposed. I think throughout S15 I would want to confirm ownership of specific areas are well defined (ie, where Grants review lives, where protocol research lives). This could leave more room in the FDD mandate to support data research, data access and developing integration with other tools (perhaps aura). Thanks again for the work to get us to this point! ",

Thank you for your service @AnnAnna96 ( I see a fellow person born in '96) and @romeonebun   Could improve  would really like to see FDD take on some thought leadership about its data operations. What is being done here is truly unique and could definitely benefit the ecosystem at large I think during one of our calls we reframed FDD\u2019s role as ensuring efficient capital allocation. I hope to see more of this in your thinking about FDD\u2019s value not just within Gitcoin but to the ecosystem at large especially when looking at the future of Gitcoin as a protocol  Looking forward  we\u2019re working on grantee engagement next season over at PGF and grantees always tend to have issues about reviews, appeals etc. Looking forward to improving this user experience!  Overall, thank you for your hard work and forward to S15 ",

Hmm, can you detail more please? We are always looking for feedback and if we can improve in any way I would love to hear your opinions  FYI. The main obstacle of GE has been the fact that the rounds were coupled and we had to \u201cbalance\u201d everything as objectively as we could(from a review, appeal, dispute standpoint + the fact that we had to \u201cfilter\u201d through a lot of old grants that started to game the system + the grant investigations which are \u201ccomplex\u201d at times to say the least). All of this + the big DAO shifts = FDD love   PS. I agree that we can always improve, in fact if we don\u2019t constantly innovate, we will become obsoleteee ",

                    "content": " Essential Intents In S15, PGF has components of our work that focus on all four of the DAO\u2019s Essential Intents - though we primarily emphasize EI1 and EI4. As a reminder, the EIs are:  EI1: Protocol Adoption EI2: Financial Sustainability EI3: DAO Organization EI4: Grants Program Success   TL;DR In S15, PGF will focus on setting up the grants program for a transition into a protocol world. If successful in S15, the workstream will define \u2013 with the rest of the DAO\u2019s involvement \u2013 where the grants program is headed, will help the DAO better track partner conversations, and will continue to iterate on ops structures (e.g., horizontal scaling, more self-serve for partners and clear managed service tiers) within our cGrants rounds today. In the context of the program specifically, PGF will continue to improve the overall round experience, meaningfully engage grantees, funders, and partners, and in turn increase the number of measurable success stories rounds help create. Beyond grants, PGF will help spin out a public goods coalition (pgDAO) that will act as an investment DAO allowing partners to commit long term to empowering large scale internet-native communities to fund their shared needs and create a sustainable funding source for the grants program. Based on what we learned from S14, we will be more intentional about what sub-rounds we fundraise for \u2013 and what constitutes a \u201cminimum viable round\u201d for side rounds \u2013 in GR15. We will decouple the main and side rounds in GR15, a step toward a permissionless protocol and improve our scalability processes, based on some of the challenges (e.g., tagging) in GR14. We will also add a focus area within our grassroots efforts on engaging grantees to drive higher quality grant applications. Finally, we intend to better define the distinction between the program and the protocol heading into a nascent grants 2.0 world. Our Always-On Goals, which our S15 objectives map to, are as follows: 1. Increase Sustainable Funding for Gitcoin Grantees  S15 Objective 1: Grow net new S15 matching funds and partners by 25% S15 Objective 2: Define Service Levels & Model for the Protocol (based on continued learnings from the design partner program)  2. Improve Overall Grantee Quality & Success  S15 Objective 3: Leverage grassroots efforts to increase grantee quality & engagement S15 Objective 4: Improve grant eligibility & round timeline processes alongside FDD  3. Scale Grants Program Process & Workflow  S15 Objective 5: Define Program & Protocol Structure in a Grants 2.0 World S15 Objective 6: Scale PGF team + contributor processes to reach a healthy homeostasis   Amount PGF is requesting $664,550 (232k GTC at a spot price of $2.87). This is a decrease of 31% vs. our S14 requested budget of $960,000. The budget is broken up into three key areas of focus, aimed at creating a sustainable grants program and, eventually, protocol.  Grassroots Grants Operations Partnerships  This budget does not include the additional 60 days of reserves. Breakdown of the budget by workstream, plus reserves, is detailed at the bottom of this post. The GTC total will be determined, based on (a) the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally, and (b) the remaining balance in the PGF Multisig (which will determine how much net new funding we require).  Milestone Report In our previous budget, we outlined a number of key objectives, many of which were less precise than in our revised format for S15. We have done our best to highlight the wins and losses, but welcome any questions about precise metrics used.     Initiative/Dept Objectives Past Season Value Delivered     Inspiring Spaces: Sustain and grow the Public Library community as a gateway for new contributors Continue regular Public Library sessions and invite salient thinkers on Public Goods and Web3 as our speakers and moderators while inviting new participants interested in Gitcoin\u2019s mission   Develop and operationalise an onboarding flow for reliable participants to contribute to the Public Goods Funding workstream or other workstreams around GitcoinDAO.  Kickstart initiatives hosted by our Public Library participants beyond Gitcoin to discuss Public Goods   We hosted a great mix of salient thinkers, including the President of RadicalXChange and the CEO of Ethelo.  During GR14, we specifically hosted topics related to GRs. We have 236 members and consistently engage 20 every week.  We created a PGF-specific 90-day onboarding flow which we operationalized with two S14 hires, and will continue iterating going forward.   Interviewed 20 potential contributors for the PGF workstream and GitcoinDAO.  Developed best-practices for WS-wide meetings, prioritizing updates asynchronously and using synchronous time together to discuss important topics.  We experimented with an intimate reading club exploring Ivan Illich\u2019s work, and will continue to experiment with how we can provide grantees non-monetary value through library-offshoots in S15.  Continued to explore Gitcoin-sponsored courses.    Accessible dialogue: Host the \u201cPublic Goods are Good\u201d Twitter Space consistently  Maintain a regular space for people curious about Public Goods and interact with key organizations and people through Twitter Spaces  Support GR14 by hosting discussions on cause rounds and showcasing grantees   Throughout S14, we held 10 spaces, and each space highlighted past/present grantees or past/present funders, with guests ranging from Solarpunk Girl and Austin Griffith to Filecoin and Coinbase.  We had an average of 182 attendees at each Twitter space, with the range being 268 (GR14 Funder Feature) and 142 (GR14 Diversity Equity & Inclusion Panel).    Nurture ideas: Kickstart a publication on Public Goods  Grow awareness of Public Goods and inspire action to contribute  Create a public good (non-rivalrous, non-excludable open publication) about Public Goods to move beyond synchronous community interactions    During S14, we authored a manifesto for the publication   Explored working with writers and former editors of major publications, but failed to operationalize the publication in its entirety    Community Cartography: Support and grow the ImpactDAO mapping initiative  Complete an initial map of ImpactDAOs in the space to provide a baseline for evaluation and insight generation  Explore mental models, narratives, relationships, and culture around ImpactDAOs to help foster the growth of the Public Goods ecosystem through educational material and research   An initial map and book was launched by Owocki and Ale during EthAmsterdam at the end of S13.  Narratives, relationships, mental models, and the culture surrounding ImpactDAOs have been thoroughly explored during S14.  The ImpactDAO Cartography Telegram group remains active with over 570 members and recurring weekly sessions to ideate and track progress on initiatives.   The term \u2018ImpactDAO\u2019 has been cemented into web3 as a canonical term encapsulating the ability for web3 to produce positive externalities.    Community Lore: Create art for Gitcoin\u2019s lore with collectively-owned IP  Grow a collective of lore-builders, creatives, and builders shaping a solarpunk future through the Gitcoin mythos  Funded Comic #4 which will be released at an upcoming conference in Q3.   Scale: Grow grants program  Increase number of high quality grants that raise >$5K/quarter by 50% (pending market condition) * Increase the number of side rounds by 100%   GR14 had 155 grantees who raised over $5K total, compared with 157 in GR13. We actually don\u2019t think we yet have the right metric to track here \u2013 \u201chigh quality grantees\u201d being synonymous with those who raise $5K/quarter is not quite accurate. Defining better grantee quality metrics is a focus for the grantee engagement work slotted for S15.   Side rounds grew by 100% in H1 2022 \u2013 9 in GR12 to 18 in GR14    Sustainability: Set ourselves up to execute grants on a larger scale  Minimize the number of hiccups during the round  Achieve NPS for participants, partners, and donors of >70  Test at least two new constructs for funding grants (e.g., public goods coalition, aqueduct)   We didn\u2019t have any major outages or program-related issues during GR13 or GR14, and most friction points were the result of inter-WS coordination, which we hope to address during GR15  We shared surveys with grantees and donors, and have conducted retros with partners.   Grantees and donors have been slow to respond, and we were able to get rough estimates for an NPS from partners by asking \u201cHow satisfied are you?\u201d Based on low partner-response for retros, we will send out a survey for GR15.   We\u2019ve made considerable progress in launching a public goods coalition in the form of pgDAO, and this will remain an ongoing priority for S15.    Decentralization: Continue to decentralize grants program   Move grants ops completely out of Gitcoin Holdings & into the DAO    Increase role of stewards/community in grants strategy & decision-making; define governance surface area    Grant ops has been successfully moved out of holdings and into the PGF workstream!   We\u2019ve continued to welcome and encourage steward and community feedback on grants strategy and decision-making via the governance forum post and following discussions (i.e., Annika\u2019s post about GR14 Round Structure & Grants Eligibility Update has 1.7k views and 64 comments).    Ecosystem Funders: Test Grants 2.0 assumptions   Run a new Ethereum Infrastructure round in GR14 and solicit funds from ecosystem builders   Run 15-20 Ecosystem Rounds in GR14   Assess which ecosystem funders are equipped & motivated to self-run rounds   Share survey / interview results from post-GR13 partner discovery work    We successfully ran a new Ethereum Infrastructure round in GR14, deploying $500K in matching funds in this round alone   We successfully ran 14 ecosystem rounds and 3 cause rounds.   As a result of running so many rounds, we were able to get good data points on funders & their motivation/ability in self-running rounds    We shared survey and interview results from GR13 internally    Scale: Grow the size of matching rounds executed by the DAO   Increase the number of net new partners we work with by 20%   Increase the average size of side rounds (with emphasis on cause rounds) by 50%   Continue to level up new full time and part time contributors towards the above    During GR14, of the 28 total partners, 16 were new partners - meaning that new partners increased by 57%   Overall - cause round totals increased by 28% vs. goal of 50%, and ecosystem rounds increased by 52%   In GR13 - we had:   $1.2M main round    $489K Ecosystem round total   $700K Ukraine round   $465K Climate round   $40K Longevity round    ($1.2M cause round total)   $3.169M total funding    In GR14 - we had:  $1M main round  $742K Ecosystem round total   $530K Climate round   $500K ETHInfra round   $350K Advocacy round   $150K DEI round   ($1.53M cause round total)   $3.417M total funding     This is especially meaningful considering GR14 happened in a bear market - with wildly different funder sentiment than GR13 (more headwind), yet we were able to make substantial gains.  We also added much-needed capacity to the team in the two strong fundraisers with strong Web3 ecosystem context.    Sustainability: Tighten processes to scout and execute partnerships (Growth Ops / Partnerships)   Refresh partnerships process to handle a larger load of potential partnerships while ensuring that we seek out the most aligned partners to work together by growing the partnerships team\u2019s capacity   Continue to build out new documentation to ensure members of the team have full context on each other\u2019s responsibilities and current objectives (e.g. robust relationship tracking)   Formalize our evaluation process to support partnerships across the DAO with support from Stewards via the mutual grants committee    Hubspot is live, allowing us to both define a process for handling a larger load of partners and increase our team\u2019s overall capacity.   Hubspot and its previous iteration on Notion have resulted in accessible \u201csources of truth\u201d that enable all contributors to share context and view each other\u2019s responsibilities.   Mutual Grants Committee is live and active, with several grants in the pipeline and one recently completed with Radicle. We have a robust v0 framework which is now being used to evaluate ongoing potential mutual grants.    Measure impact: Help set the stage for new cause rounds that augment our mission (Growth Ops / Partnerships)   Fundraise for the Ethereum infrastructure round to bring Gitcoin back to its roots   Focus on bringing in new values aligned web2 partners like Fifty Years and double down with other existing values aligned partners like Protocol Labs   Ran a very successful Eth Infra round - funding core projects in the space with funds from high-signal partners.   During GR14 we brought in 28 partners, 16 of which are new values-aligned partners.    LARP together: Experiment with fundraising efforts around art, open-source partnerships, and collectively-owned IP   Kickstart a new team focused on experimenting with different methodologies to raise funds for Public Goods  Raise at least 20 ETH through 1-3 net new NFT sales     Ultimately, this initiative did not fully come to fruition. While working on the project, market conditions shifted such that we couldn\u2019t fully resource the project as we had hoped to - due to comic production involving fiat-heavy costs. This led to contributor churn and the project didn\u2019t end up actualizing its initial goals.  We will be sunsetting this initiative, and going forward we will operationalize better treasury management practices      S15 Objectives In order to streamline our work, we have consolidated our initiatives and cut low performing areas to arrive at 6 key objectives for Season 15.     Outcome Description Essential Intent Connection Steering Metrics Likely Projects/Initiatives     \u201cWhat impact will we see?\u201d \u201cHow does this align with our most important work?\u201d \u201cHow will we know if we\u2019re making progress?\u201d \u201cWhat will the work likely look like?\u201d   Objective 1: Grow Net New S15 Matching Funds and Matching Partners by 25% Aligns with:   EI1: Protocol Adoption   EI4: Grants Program Success     Matching funds distributed exceed $4M (vs. $3.2M in GR14)   100% of those funds are raised this round (i.e., not pulled from any existing multisig balance)   75% of those funds are paid by round start     Total round partners are scaled up to 35 (vs. 28 in GR14)  At least 15 total ecosystem rounds     Reach out to more GR15 partners than ever before    Improve cross-selling across partners   Enable better tracking in Hubspot   Improved payment process   Launch novel funding experiments (e.g. pgDAO)    Objective 2: Define Service Levels & Model for the Protocol (based on continued learnings from the design partner program) Aligns with:   EI1: Protocol Adoption   EI2: Financial Sustainability    Ratified model of flow of funds both for endorsed / program-led rounds and broader rounds by protocol users   Partial ordering of types of projects that fit into scope for the program vs. those that are likely to be self-service    Working across PGF & with GPC / partners to outline initial service offerings  Continuing to advocate for and bring in new, large-scale deals that help push forward the protocol vision (e.g. the Optimism partnership)    Objective 3: Leverage Grassroots Efforts to Increase Grantee Quality & Engagement Aligns with   EI1: Protocol Adoption  EI3: DAO Organization  EI4: Grants Program Success    Stand up a sub-squad in Grassroots to define our grantee engagement priorities   Hold 10 discovery interviews with successful grantees about how we might better engage grantees in subsequent seasons   Identify and define specific, measurable objectives to assess grantee quality in subsequent seasons  Create an implementation plan for the specific objectives in order to collect data & measure impact starting in S16   Build onboarding playbook Notion doc for grantees to get involved with Gitcoin and the larger ecosystem interested in public goods   Sustain the library while refactoring it to kickstart grantee engagement   Continue to highlight grantees and funders in weekly Twitter spaces   Kickstart a sustained effort to engage grantees for overall grant program success   Experiment with providing non-monetary support to grantees through relationship building and knowledge-sharing opportunities    Objective 4: Improve Grant Eligibility & Round Timeline Processes Aligns with:   EI1: Protocol Adoption  EI4: Grants Program Success    Returning partners\u2019 assessment of whether the process improved or not  Grants Ops hours spent dedicated to eligibility reviews decrease  Confirm and announce rounds by Aug 8   More grant applications in before the round begins vs. during round   Execute on the playbooks we\u2019ve written out in a more structured / planned way Decouple main and side rounds Advise FDD on their reviewer training Hire Eligibility Analyst with an eye to PGF owning Grant Eligibility & Policy as of S16    Objective 5: Define Program & Protocol Structure in a Grants 2.0 World Aligns with:   EI1: Protocol Adoption   EI4: Grants Program Success    Forum post outlining protocol vs. program vs. services  Defined mapping of ecosystem legitimacy within program scope  Alignment across teams   Setting a bi-weekly cadence with GPC to iterate on and ratify the proposed model  Writing & socializing across the DAO    Objective 6: Scale PGF team + Contributor Processes to Reach a Healthy Homeostasis Aligns with:   EI3: DAO Organization  EI4: Grants Program Success     Increased efficiency of work across sub-streams  At least half of PGF contributors experience a thorough performance review   100% of contributors have their roles + responsibilities documented and accessible to other contributors   Creating and solidifying workflows + runbooks across Grant Ops, Partnerships, and Grassroots (e.g. via Hubspot)  Designing a performance evaluation process established beyond peer reviews Leveling up current contributors to reach their fullest potential  Iterating best-practices for cross-functional work      Budget Breakdown The objectives above can be mapped to three main departments or \u201csquads\u201d. For simplicity, we have marked the objectives [O1\u2026O6] to these groups, since they are the key functional units of the workstream.

I was happy to see the milestones that were achieved the past season and that there was a sizeable decrease in the budget requested this season. My main concern was around work duplicated in other workstreams. For example, it seemed Grant Eligibility FT hire has some potential overlapping work with FDD. I would like to see workstreams make sure we are not paying salaries for duplicated work in a season. I also gave feedback that given the current market environment I have seen many teams I work with cut back on hiring for new roles unless absolutely critical. I would like to see all workstreams, not just PGF, evaluate if the new role is a nice to have vs an absolutely critical hire so we can ensure long-term DAO sustainability. ",

Currently there is a discussion around GrantOps taking over grant review starting from GR16. As it stands currently, grant reviews are an extremely time intensive process for GrantOps with our current GrantOps team reviewing all side round grants with our round partners. There are a lot of upcoming changes with Grants 2.0 on the horizon, Passport, the work in moonshot around Identity staking and FDD\u2019s work with Data Empowerment that will all have an effect on Gitcoin Grants and how eligibility works. There is a lot of operational effort that we need to put in to rethink the manual process for grant review and overall grant policy in a protocol world. Given the operational and coordination lift behind this, importance of our grantee population as a whole for the success of our program, and future grants protocol to achieve long term success, we consider this an important additional role that is being discussed closely with other workstreams, like FDD and we hope will help sustainable scalability of grants 2.0.

That s14 succeeded despite the bear market is a great validation for PGF and Gitcoin. Of all of the budget proposals this is the one that as an outsider I found most difficult to get my arms around.  I think this is largely due to the sheer scope of efforts and where I am in my learning curve. Additionally, I believe there are cases in which we are still listing as objectives tasks that one might be able to logically group as tasks within overall objectives.  Also, even though it was a big achievement to go from 13 objectives to 6, that still may be too many. To nit pick - objective 3 is listed as \u201cleverage grassroots efforts to\u2026 increase grantee quality & engagement.\u201d  The objective here is \u201cincrease grantee quality & engagement\u201d and the excellent work of grassroots would be considered a means to that end IMO.  We put a tactic into the statement of an objective - unless I\u2019m off base here.  What do you think? Continuing on that thread - and here comes an actual question  - am I right that we currently lack metrics that are agreed upon that measure \u201cgrantee quality\u201d and \u201cgrantee engagement\u201d?  Could we set for example an imperfect metric such as \u201chost at least X grantees in weekly Twitter spaces\u201d?  What about success metrics for past cohorts?  Do we have such metrics and would it be useful to look at how many grow and prosper over time?  I wonder if it will be a powerlaw like distribution, what do we expect? Regarding engaging grantees - just wondering if grantees also receive GTC?  If so they could be welcomed as owners, taught how to delegate, presented w stewards and report cards, and otherwise walked through Gitcoin governance 101.   Just an idea re: engagement. Overall objective 3 - because it does not have metrics associated w/ it - sounds a bit like a list of well-meaning efforts. Objective 4 - while there are some metrics mentioned, the base lines are not provided which would help to set expectations and build confidence we are going to exceed these targets.  For example, \u201cmore grant applications in before the round begins vs. during round\u201d begs the question - what % of grants are received during or before the round NOW and by how much do we plan to shift applications from during to before? I share @linda question about FDD vs. the new hire of an Eligibility Analyst and see your response.  Nonetheless, I was still wondering whether the FDD crowd funding efforts (humble brag I got my NFT!) of grant reviews be impacted by this new hire and by PGF taking on this additional role? Is Objective 4 mostly about improving the grant applicant experience, or mostly about controlling our costs, or both?  At the risk of over stepping, this feels to me like the classic 2nd objective you see in a groups objectives.  Objective #1 is often about top line as it is in our case.  Objective #2 then is often about increasing throughput while controlling costs.  Classic metrics here then are process metrics (for example reduce grantee wait time by X%) & also something like a NPS.  Do we have the ability to measure or infer metrics from the customer or grant applicants perspective?  If so, capturing 1-2 key ones here might be useful either now or in the future? Regarding NPS like measures, when we list \u201creturning partner\u2019s assessment of whether the process improved or not\u201d - do we mean we will survey or interview at least X% of returning partners and report on our findings within the DAO and for the next funding cycle? Objective 5: here I was a little lost.  What is meant by \u201cdefined mapping of ecosystem legitimacy within program scope\u201d?  Is this a mapping of the landscape? Objective 6: seems clear.  The lack of fully defined roles & responsibilities & the ongoing work on runbook development and usage does raise the question of whether additional hiring is appropriate right now, especially given the external environment.  I think overall we are advocating for three hires?  partner account manager marketing ops grant analyst  The grant analyst work raises for me the question - again - of potential FDD overlap regarding crowdsourcing efforts. Perhaps you might want to argue for why hires 1 & 2 are urgent and cannot be delayed while more work is ongoing to define roles and responsibilities and so forth? Leaving the \u201cbest\u201d or at least most quantitative for last - Objective 1 seems nailed down from my perspective.  It is after all a quantifiable and strategic objective.  Again, do you need the hire to hit these objectives?  Also, do we have a sense yet of the funnel, \u201csales cycle time\u201d and so forth for round partners?  To get those additional 7 round partners (35 vs. 28), do we need to be in discussions w/ approximately 3x that number 60 days before the round?  I know we just adopted Hubspot so I\u2019m guessing we don\u2019t yet know much about our funnel ratios? Regarding objective 2 - it seemed to be another aspect of prepare for Grants 2.0 - which is also essentially what object 5 is.  Is one more outward facing (I think objective 2) and one more inward facing (i.e. objective 5)?  Or am I missing the gist of it? As I mentioned, thanks to the scope of your activities and my location along a long learning curve about Gitcoin, this proposal was the most challenging for me to understand and hence to provide some feedback to.  Nonetheless, I hope the above provides some questions that are worth responding to and some ideas on how to tighten up the objectives & metrics for understanding and possibly for increased focus.  I look forward to your responses including any pointers I can follow for additional understanding about the work streams themselves. Many thanks! ",

I\u2019m not sure what it takes to do that, but intuitively it seems like a lot of hours to run these activities. In line with the above, what have been some metrics that can be shared about # of participants at each of these events?

PGF Operations     annika:  Travel slush fund    I\u2019d like to see more details on this - how much spending is being planned for S15 on travel? I imagine that any FT contributors that qualifies for this already has an idea of which conference they will attend, and therefore specific funds can be earmarked for them.   All in all, alongside the curiosities I am stoked on the work that PGF has been doing. I think they are bringing a TON of intentionality to everything they are working on, constantly trying to amplify and streamline all of their work and processes. A larger question to ponder for the DAO is: If we\u2019re playing the game of \u201cbecoming profitable\u201d with our work on the protocols side, how much do we continue to grow and amplify our grants program, which is purely a cost-centre?

They seem to center largely around two areas:  Grassroots objectives/outcomes - which I\u2019ll let @Fishbiscuit, Grassroots Lead, respond to Grants Ops new hires - which I\u2019ll respond to here  On the Eligibility Analyst - As @DisruptionJoe outlined above, we have coordinated with FDD on the need for this hire. This is, frankly, a hire we probably should have made months ago before scaling up Ecosystem Rounds. A couple pieces of context here: (1) In GR14, Grants Ops spent ~80% of its time, many nights and weekends, reviewing grants for ecosystem & cause rounds. We have scaled from zero ecosystem/cause rounds a year ago to 17 of them in GR14, and each round having its own policy and group of stakeholders to manage to is a ton of operational complexity that we haven\u2019t hired for whatsoever. The solving of it has been very yolo to date. We need a systems thinker who can build this from the ground up and massively reduce our human evaluations. On the Marketing Ops Manager - As you pointed out @CoachJonathan, as of recently @Viriya is indeed stepping up and playing much of this role. We are incredibly excited by what we\u2019ve seen so far in her leadership of this! Here is the original JD for context - and, as you note, a good chunk of this is now covered by her work as of the past couple weeks. To be clear, given the progress we\u2019re seeing, we do not plan to hire this role prior to GR15.  That said, we want to budget for it for later in the season in the event that we (and @Viriya) feel we still need more marketing ops support within PGF looking ahead to GR16. For GR15, some of this budget will go towards Coleen (who is already contributing part-time) and we hope to keep some as a buffer. @J9leger - feel free to add anything I\u2019ve missed.  ",

I love the thoughtful dialog from @CoachJonathan and @Viriya! Many of the items flagged by them are also similar sentiments I am feeling. This budget still feel really big. The grassroots work likely needs a deep rework as we transition to launching our protocol and the grantee engagement is not inspiring as defined. Working to increase engagement and quality on the current platform should be a non-goal IMO. We would ideally build that engagement and momentum on the protocol. Overall, it feels a bit misaligned. Without the clear community engagement strategy from the DAO, It\u2019s hard to understand the value of that focus area. IMO, there is a lot of momentum that will be coming from the launch of the protocol. We may have found ourselves (and the market) growing out of the need for us to plant the regen seeds. Public goods are good - that mantra is present in many places because of our hard work. The next phase of this discussion could shift to \u201csay not that public goods are good - say I will fund them!\u201d - but this likely needs to be deeply linked to the new protocol. Our budget for the Partnerships work also seems large given we are pausing the mutual grants and have not been able to launch pgDAO. Round size has stayed consistent (in a bear market!) which is a great accomplishment, but we are not really seeing much gains by increasing that team size yet. I wonder if this because focus has been too spread, or that we are missing clear goals and accountabilities for the team. I could see a budget reduction of maybe $75k-$150k and still have PGF be as effective as they are today. Those numbers assume pausing grassroots (to retool towards a protocol future and engagement strategy) and also scaling down the partnerships work given the pause in mutual grants and no pgDAO yet. I am posting this thinking aloud to get other\u2019s thoughts. I recognize as this impact\u2019s contributors roles its a hard conversation to have in public. ",

                    "content": "Firstly, thank you for your feedback. I appreciate the guidance on helping to align our work across the DAO and to the future of the protocol. A detailed overview is in this document, broken down to a per-hourly basis. This is as detailed as it gets and even though it might not completely dictate how S15 might go, I hope this makes it clear how carefully and resource constrained we are now even as we try to meet our goals. I suggest reading this before continuing to the rest of the forum post. I\u2019d like to emphasize that grassroots has cut a lot of initiatives from last season. We\u2019ve gone from 210k to 96k while starting a pivot towards grantee engagement. In fact, every season we\u2019ve had to reorient our community efforts to galvanise our community towards more pressing issues. For S15, that is grantee engagement. To @kyle 's questions: First, one can\u2019t simply pause grassroots efforts and restart them at will. The rapport, community, and trust that goes into the day-to-day running of these safe spaces will be broken if we simply close them down. Second, members of these grassroots efforts have gone on to be informal ambassadors of Gitcoin, helping other grantees or even being grantees themselves. Since the protocol is being built, keeping a space for potential users is key. Also, it\u2019s not like we intend to close the grants program. Future Gitcoin will have both the program and protocol. More importantly, the program will be opinionated, and thus these spaces that facilitate discussions on the nature of the grants program will be even more crucial. We are reworking our grassroots activities based on @annika and @J9leger 's feedback that the grants programs is looking to engage grantees better. Having run and kept the community for a year, I believe this is the best place to start. We have been designing a clearer grantee engagement strategy referencing a hierarchy of needs that utilises Heartbeat, a community platform, and a community hub at Devcon to achieve this. The user journey of grantees will thus be.  Grantee support prior to GRs that get them ready to become a grantee Grantee engagement during and after GRs so that we can facilitate key conversations that help them become better grantees on the platform and beyond, achieved through creating a community for S15 as devcon is near, we intend to host a community hub for public goods as many grantees new and old will probably be at Devcon.  To @CoachJonathan questions:  What is the high-level breakdown of responsibilities for contributors (esp. those who are FT)? Based on what I\u2019m seeing, it looks like we have 2 FT and 3 PT contributors running the Library and Twitter Spaces. I\u2019m not sure what it takes to do that, but intuitively it seems like a lot of hours to run these activities.  Your intuition is right. It does take a lot of hours to run a good community. Despite this, we have accumulated a year of experience running both Public Library and Twitter Spaces, and thus have optimized to only requiring 2 PT contributors for each initiative. It takes 8-10 man hours to curate, guide, execute, and review each Twitter Space and Public Library.  In line with the above, what have been some metrics that can be shared about # of participants at each of these events? + 3. What is the overall strategy of running Library calls and running Twitter Spaces? Who are the audiences? What is it that we hope to accomplish by having people join us at each event?  The strategy is simple. On average our Twitter Spaces have 181 active listeners and the Public Library has 20-22 attendees. Even more important than mere metrics, our grassroots efforts have been the key to onboarding great members to the DAO. Something that DAO Ops has consistently promoted as a great way to take part in Gitcoin, and I\u2019m glad to see @safder in several Public Library calls. Over the year, Public Library attendees such as Ale Borda, Alisha, Ben Percifield, Ben West, Colton Orr, Gary Sheng, Jason Cook, Jim Chang, Juanna, June, Kris, Kyle Jensen, Madison Adams, Maxwell Kanter, Michelle Ma, Sarah Drinkwater, Umar Khan (and of course, myself) have all gone on to become valuable contributors to the DAO. We\u2019ve also had speakers for the Public Library such as Amber Case (micropayments and calm design), Ale Borda (public goods ecosystem synergies), Bhaumik (designing inspiring learning communities), Aaron Maniam (digital public goods), Matt Prewiit (local currencies), Vivian (pluralism). You can find the full list of 50+ sessions here. During GR14 we switched our conversations to talking about the grant round itself and got speakers from Gitcoin to share about setting up the round and its challenges. For the upcoming library sessions during GR15, we\u2019ve had a great idea proposed by Sage from Grants Ops to utilise it as grantee 101s which we have cleared prior library sessions to execute on. August sessions are already fully booked with members from Taiwan\u2019s g0v taking center stage. For our Twitter Spaces we\u2019ve had speakers such as Tina He, Jasmine Wang, Cyn Bahati, Lauren Luz, Eva Beylin. But since we are pivoting to focus on grantee engagement for the next season, our calendar line-up has changed accordingly.  August 11 (Thursday): Open Gaming Round August 16 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A August 18 (Thursday): Advocacy Round August 23 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A August 25 (Thursday): DEI Round - Host Gloria August 30 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A September 01 (Thursday): DeSci Round September 06 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A September 08 (Thursday): Climate Round - Host Ben West September 13 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A September 15 (Thursday): Community Collection Curation / Shill Your Collection September 20 (Tuesday): Open Hours Prospective Grantee Q&A September 22 (Thursday): Funder Panel  The Twitter Spaces audience is a diverse mix of people who are: newly entering web3, interested in funding public goods, past and future grantees, and people who are simply curious about joining the Gitcoin community. This space creates an open, welcoming environment, and top level funnel for prospective contributors and community allies. Our focus is shifting and expanding to encompass grantee engagement to better support grantees who are new to the ecosystem. We believe that the Twitter Spaces foster a sense of genuine connection and meaning to those who attend. Twitter Spaces are a vehicle for storytelling and provide opportunities for each guest to share their own pathway, perspective and experience\u2014to help educate and inspire the community to think outside the box and dream big! Beyond supporting the grants rounds, spotlighting grantees, and highlighting funders, our core intention is to illuminate innovative projects within our community that probe the edges of what is possible and explore the ways in which blockchain tech can support communities in funding and sustaining their shared needs.  Library Slush Fund I get concerned when I see a \u201cslush fund\u201d when we are trying to lock down our spending and bring more intention to our activities. What is the purpose of the slush fund? What have been some past unforeseen costs that have come up? How large is this slush fund? How important is it that it stays here?  The slush fund is USD 2k per month. It is important because we use it for onboarding contributors during our trial period. It is a small slush fund but has brought on writers that have ended up in MMM such as @umarkhaneth  and @kylejensen . edit: I agree with @M0nkeyFl0wer 's suggestion to not use the term slush fund, however that was a policy tool that Loie left us as a flexible fund that was agreed during the CSDO call sometime in\u2026 November\u201921 and hence we use this term. To @epowell101 's questions:  To nit pick - objective 3 is listed as \u201cleverage grassroots efforts to\u2026 increase grantee quality & engagement.\u201d The objective here is \u201cincrease grantee quality & engagement\u201d and the excellent work of grassroots would be considered a means to that end IMO. We put a tactic into the statement of an objective - unless I\u2019m off base here. What do you think?  Firstly, welcome to Gitcoin  I\u2019m glad to see a fellow WildfireDAO person here, and I welcome your feedback. We have been designing a clearer grantee engagement strategy that utilises Heartbeat and a community hub at Devcon to achieve this. Those would be the tactics. The reason why it\u2019s not on the forum is because it\u2019s being designed as we go, as we talk to more members of the community. This is because excellent grassroots work must come ground-up!  Continuing on that thread - and here comes an actual question  - am I right that we currently lack metrics that are agreed upon that measure \u201cgrantee quality\u201d and \u201cgrantee engagement\u201d? Could we set for example an imperfect metric such as \u201chost at least X grantees in weekly Twitter spaces\u201d? What about success metrics for past cohorts? Do we have such metrics and would it be useful to look at how many grow and prosper over time? I wonder if it will be a powerlaw like distribution, what do we expect?  You\u2019re right, however setting metrics that are merely counting how many times we do things bears no meaning. If you look up at the rest of the post, it is clear that we\u2019ve been hosting regular Twitter Spaces and since it\u2019s publicly hosted, we\u2019re all held accountable. Now, analyzing grantee success is practically a research topic in itself. However, we are willing to attempt this challenge this season too and kickstart the conversation of what a successful grantee is as it will inform our community strategy. ",

                    "content": "Thanks so much for your feedback here, @kyle! I appreciate your call outs, and the opportunity to clarify the importance of partnerships. Regarding Mutual Grants, we are targeting 1-2 mutual grants a quarter. You\u2019re correct, we\u2019ve decided to slow down this initiative for now, but it\u2019s still an ongoing priority. As Owocki has talked about, we still think finding values aligned partners throughout the bear market is important, in addition to continuing to level up the structure of our relationships with key partners. Regarding pgDAO, the launch has been moved to a key priority for S15 as we continue to explore the best partners for the initiative. It\u2019s important that we do pgDAO right, and thus we didn\u2019t want to rush it during S14, and want to make sure we give the formation and launch adequate energy during s15. While getting capital is important, having the right partners on board, and launching it in a way that is aligned with an ethos all of us would want to get behind is more important than getting something done a few months sooner. Regarding grants fundraising, I agree - that we haven\u2019t seen much increase in the round size by increasing the team yet, with yet being a keyword. I am confident that during GR15 and GR16 our team will be able execute above expectations, and that we will be able to positively steer the future of the program in combination with Grant Ops. I don\u2019t think our focus has been too spread, but I do agree that we historically haven\u2019t done the best job of tracking goals and accountabilities. This is an ongoing priority for PGF as a whole, and something we will remedy in S15. But to zoom out, why do we need to raise these funds? The future of Gitcoin Grants relies on a protocol, but it also relies on showcasing the success of a canonical instance: the program. This is because the program is where many existing design partners have started, where are brand equity comes from, and in turn where a substantial amount of GTC utility could arise from. In addition, while it might be easy to see only the final number of what\u2019s raised, it\u2019s also important to take time to consider Gitcoin doesn\u2019t take money from just anyone. We are highly particular about the kinds of organizations we would like to take capital from for grants rounds, this ensures that we have the best possible partners in a protocol world. Again, to emphasize, there are lots of companies and individuals within the ecosystem who would be happy to brand align with Gitcoin allowing us to launder their reputations in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, but doing this in the wrong way would be short term thinking and reduce our long term success. Partnerships is about strategy as much as it is about execution. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that we are in a challenging macro environment, and the pool of companies we can raise money from continues to diminish given budget constraints. This will likely change over time. With all that said, I\u2019d like to push back on your call to reduce the partnership\u2019s budget. We\u2019re currently a lean team, and if you look across the web3 ecosystem, ecosystem and partnerships leads have extremely generous compensation packages (nearly 2-3x what we currently offer). People who come to work here are mission are aligned, but it\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s extremely valuable work we do that should be compensated in a fair way. In an ecosystem so small, I\u2019d hope everyone would understand how hard it is to find the right people for this, which is made even more difficult if we aren\u2019t able to compensate those people well. Especially when getting another role would be extremely easy for them to do. Individuals who are able to raise funds within web3 need to have high context, understand the nuance of the space over the course of many years, typically have pre-existing relationships they can lean on (cold to close in sales for this work is impossible), and also have the ability to do sales. Excited to work more closely with you to continue ensuring our future success. ",

Thank you. Have to disagree with this sentiment. I am, of course, totally on board with coordinating our efforts towards grants 2.0 but that needs to be an iterative process that flows from our existing grants program regardless of the platform.  I feel we have a responsibility to continue to try to support our grantees and donors. Even more so in fact as we roll out new tools and there are bugs and other issues that need dealing with. The Gitcoin community is growing to include many people who aren\u2019t developers and this shift has brought some challenges with it that are worthy of attention. Its worth noting that by running large cause rounds we have invited many n00bs and even people without their first wallets to engage with us and our brand. I think we need to do more engagement as our products are not fully built, not less. This has impacts on our ability to spread the adoption of the platform, which is a core strategic goal. Furthermore, this is extra important as we are moving into the space of celebrity involvement and more non web3 brands (Serena Ventures, Schmidt Futures, Kimbal Musk etc). This will mean more scrutiny of our user experience and how we support our users. Our brand should be associated with positive web3 experience so our partners are happy to continue sponsoring rounds and we can leverage their positive response to bring on more high profile partners. I agree we shouldn\u2019t prioritize spending money or developer time on the existing platform but lets not conflate that with the efforts that are needed to continue to successfully build partnership and to run increasingly effective grants rounds.

                    "content": "I share some similar concerns to what others have raised about the amount of money that\u2019s being spent here. I won\u2019t cover partnerships as that\u2019s outside my domain of expertise/I don\u2019t have a good intuitive sense of how much \u201cshould\u201d be spent on these activities, but feel like it\u2019s fair for me to raise these with Grassroots spending. Let me start by saying I really appreciate the work PGF Grassroots does - I\u2019ve really enjoyed the Library sessions and Twitter Spaces that I\u2019ve been able to attend, and I think they\u2019re adding a lot of value to the ecosystem. I 100% believe these efforts are worth dedicating time to, especially with a new focus on planting protocol seeds. My concerns are two-fold:  I feel like close to $100k/season is a lot to be spending on these activities.   I went through the detailed budget shared by @Fishbiscuit and I\u2019m still not convinced that we need this much time and resources. I also don\u2019t fully understand how it has been labelled, for example for the first Public Goods Library column it says :   Sessions: 4h* 8* 40usd = 1.28k Planning: 4h* 12* 40usd = 1.92k  What are the \u201c8\u201d and \u201c12\u201d numbers and why are they different? I\u2019m assuming this is to be read as 4h per month * 8 (what\u2019s this?) * 40USD/hr (contributor salary). Is this consistent throughout the document?  I feel like there\u2019s a lot of overlap between the goals and efforts of the Library + Twitter Spaces, and I feel that this could be counterproductive. Why have both Library calls as well as Twitter Spaces with the goal to increase grantee engagement? Shouldn\u2019t they have distinct goals? From what I know of community management, you want to decentralize community leadership but centralize plaftforms/channels for community as much as possible, otherwise you risk distractions and information overload of the community you are trying to engage. The biggest part of this budget is the Lead salary ($36k) at a very generous rate (higher than what some workstream leads are getting paid), but it isn\u2019t clear what the Lead\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities are? There seems to either be a full-time or a number of part-time contributors dedicated to owning and running each initiative - what sort of leadership duties are required at a Grassroots-wide level and if these are vast, why aren\u2019t the 6+ other contributors being empowered to take on some of these responsibilities? There\u2019s $25k dedicated to experimental grantee engagement which hasn\u2019t been tested, adds yet another channel for communication with grantees (adds to level of overwhelm), and doesn\u2019t seem to have been planned with any consultation with DAO Ops or MMM community building efforts - why couldn\u2019t this be completed with the current DAO Citizens strategy being planned at DAO Ops? Which leads me to my next area of concern.    A lot of grassroots work is community engagement work, but there has historically been little to no collaboration with other community efforts in the DAO, and there doesn\u2019t seem like there is any plan to include this in this budget. The DAO Ops and MMM community initiatives share many of the goals as PGF Grassroots, and I\u2019d love for us to share resources and distribute some of the important work of community engagement.  Just want to close by saying that again, I really appreciate the work that PGF has done so far for the DAO, and couldn\u2019t think any higher of this team. That being said, other workstreams have really taken the \u201cleaner DAO\u201d approach very seriously, often in ways that hasn\u2019t been very pleasant and has required us all to reprioritize and hold each other to higher levels of accountability. I\u2019m just not seeing the same sentiment in this proposal. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the really thoughtful post, @Fishbiscuit      Fishbiscuit:  one can\u2019t simply pause grassroots efforts and restart them at will. The rapport, community, and trust that goes into the day-to-day running of these safe spaces will be broken if we simply close them down.   this is a really valid assertion, if we believe we have the right community in our sessions today. I think I am envisioning a shift in who shows up and the content we present. As we shift to a protocol, I could see us shifting these space to be more focused on helping people understand why the protocol exists, how to use it fund shared needs and encouraging people to get started, experiment with the funding mechanisms, etc. grantee engagement is a subset of who matters in the protocol world (ie, we need high quality grantees, but we also need ecosystems who care deeply about funding their shared needs, and to explore what those shared needs might be). I am less certain we are targeting the right community on these calls (just grantees?) and that we are not aiming our sights high enough (not just grantees).     Fishbiscuit:  at Devcon to achieve this.   This seems slightly askew\u2026 though Devcon may have many potential grantees, a single event as the culmination of activity doesn\u2019t seem aligned. Is there work planned to build this community outside of DevCon too? Our Grantees likely need more tools on platform, more info in docs and more guidance during a round - none of which are handled via support at an event.     Fishbiscuit:  The user journey of grantees will thus be.  Grantee support prior to GRs that get them ready to become a grantee Grantee engagement during and after GRs so that we can facilitate key conversations that help them become better grantees on the platform and beyond, achieved through creating a community for S15 as devcon is near, we intend to host a community hub for public goods as many grantees new and old will probably be at Devcon.    This is helpful, but also seems to be silod. I know the DAO Ops group is working to improve our documentation and knowledge base. Are you proposing working with them to improve the experience for Grantees there? my .02 wei\u2026 The Devcon thing seems like a waste. We already have an event planned (Schelling Point), it feels silly to really budget anything extra (time or energy) to engage grantees there. \u2013     Fishbiscuit:  have all gone on to become valuable contributors to the DAO.   This has been such a huge strength to the DAO over the last year. And this is exactly why I feel being more ambitious and focused on the protocol would continue to attract the next wave of contributors with the mindset and skillset to be successful here. As we move from impact DAO to protocol DAO, increasing our technical capabilities within our community would be a boon to our creativity and success. \u2013     azeem:  As Owocki has talked about, we still think finding values aligned partners throughout the bear market is important, in addition to continuing to level up the structure of our relationships with key partners.   He and I disagree on the value of doing this. I will hodl that debate for another convo, but I do want to note I appreciate the thoughtfulness in slowing these down as we evaluate our own sustainability.     azeem:  I don\u2019t think our focus has been too spread, but I do agree that we historically haven\u2019t done the best job of tracking goals and accountabilities. This is an ongoing priority for PGF as a whole, and something we will remedy in S15.   This is really helpful context and I appreciate you sharing. We often grow the most when we can admit and recognize where we have made mistakes. I really do appreciate the dialog. I am really torn on how to vote for this season. Given the added accountability I am inclined to vote yes, but the Grassroots work still seems aimed a bit off\u2026 I am interested in continuing to learn more though. ",

I\u2019m very grateful you\u2019ve all taken the time to provide such thoughtful feedback.     kyle:  Given the added accountability I am inclined to vote yes, but the Grassroots work still seems aimed a bit off\u2026 I am interested in continuing to learn more though.   I think that generally, to your most recent concerns Kyle around Grassroots being a bit off, I believe that S15 is in a critical period of transition for Grassroots. Historically, Grassroots has been focused on creating extremely high-quality and rich community experiences through our Library and Twitter Spaces. These spaces are consistently well attended, and those who attend meaningfully and authentically participate. Our Library calls are run like intimate reading groups made up by a group of best-friends (thanks to @linht.tran and Madison), and our Twitter Spaces are run like exceptionally well-crafted podcast episodes (thanks to @lanitrock and Vermeer). I\u2019d consider our grassroots efforts in PGF to be a huge success, I think our key two faults up until this point have been:  Not collaborating super closely with other workstreams And not doing the best job telling our stories or re-purposing content      safder:  A lot of grassroots work is community engagement work, but there has historically been little to no collaboration with other community efforts in the DAO   I agree with Saf that in the past we haven\u2019t collaborated closely with other workstream\u2019s in our efforts. But to defend Grassroots a bit, up until S14 DAO Ops and MMM weren\u2019t principally focused on Community Efforts. Given the other workstreams new interest in supporting community, I\u2019m confident that Grassroots will collaborate closer with MMM and DAO Ops in S15 and beyond. The Grassroots team is highly motivated to align our efforts across the DAO. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve begun aligning efforts with DAO Ops (by opening up our Library sessions to all Gitcoin Citizens) and with MMM (by continuing to explore how Twitter spaces can be leveraged to \u2018spread the good word\u2019 about grant rounds and help onboard grantees). As Joe said,     DisruptionJoe:  I\u2019m not particularily happy with the way we are blessing DAOops community experience initiative, and MMM community initiative, and deciding this is the one to cut.   I couldn\u2019t agree more here. I find it a bit odd that folks generally feel very dismissive of the success Grassroots has had building community over the past year. Many folks seem to be over-indexing on the novel DAO Citizen initiatives, and MMM\u2019s increased desire to focus on community as well. While we begin shifting our focus as a DAO to the protocol, I\u2019d argue that Grassroots community efforts will becoming increasingly critical to our success. As we begin to help other communities fund their shared needs, we might begin considering the shared needs of our own community. I believe that Grassroots is in the best position to lead this charge, and I believe that Grassroots is in the best position to figure out how we might, as @kyle wrote here, \u201cfocus on helping the world understand why the Grants protocol is such a game changer.\u201d That being said, I think Grassroots will look substantially different during S16, and I think in order to get there, Grassroots will spend S15 transitioning our efforts and aligning ourselves with the DAO. To address your concern around compensation, @safder, Grassroots has a degree excellence I\u2019m quite proud of. $100k/season is a healthy amount of funding, but as @Fishbiscuit wrote,     Fishbiscuit:  We\u2019ve gone from 210k to 96k while starting a pivot towards grantee engagement. In fact, every season we\u2019ve had to reorient our community efforts to galvanise our community towards more pressing issues.   In response to @CoachJonathan\u2019s budget concerns, QZ also succinctly said, \u201cYour intuition is right. It does take a lot of hours to run a good community.\u201d Despite the expense of funding Grassroots during S15, I\u2019m confident that we can \u2018stretch our tokens\u2019 to the fullest extent possible and produce immensely positive externalities through Grassroots community endeavors during S15. We\u2019ll produce these positive externalities in the service of both the program and the protocol, and we\u2019ll, as I\u2019ve mentioned, align ourselves with other workstreams. All in all, it has been a bit frustrating to see everyone pushing back on Grassroots. Community is not a means to push forward protocol adoption or increase impressions on social media, community is the bedrock of trust and care within the Gitcoin ecosystem. As we shift our focus to other communities funding their shared needs, and I do think its critical that our community efforts remain well funded in this DAO. ",

As we shift our focus to other communities funding their shared needs, and I do think its critical that our community efforts remain well funded in this DAO.   Just want to add here that the pushback is not on community efforts - in fact you could argue that the DAO is leaning more towards community this season with at least three workstreams having very clear community-based objectives instead of just one. The concern is more the amount of money that is being spent on this specific effort, and the hope is that through more cross-stream collaboration and a better distributed community focus, we can achieve many of these same goals with a much smaller drain on our treasury. Another thing I want to add: I feel the $216k number for past Grassroots budgets isn\u2019t a very good one to anchor to. I wasn\u2019t involved in discussing previous budgets, but I have no idea how we were spending that much on Library calls and Twitter Spaces before and how it was justified (unless there were also other activities that got discontinued/I\u2019m not aware of).

I definitely agree, and see S15 as an opportunity for the three workstreams with community-based objectives to align efforts, eliminate redundancies, and ideally reduce costs substantially, during S16 and onwards. Regarding the second concern, the first PGF budget passed on Snapshot on August 6th, 2021. The first proposal was for 45k $GTC. On August 6th, the price of $GTC was roughly $9 USD (so the rough $USD value of 45k GTC was  $405,000). You can find a detailed breakdown of the first proposal here. TLDR \u201cGrassroots Efforts\u201d was just one of four key objectives. I agree it isn\u2019t too helpful, generally, to compare anything we are doing now to what we are doing over a year ago. But it is a helpful practice, I find, to look at the beginning when we are considering the end. The first objective for Grassroots efforts from July 2021 was to \u201cincrease collaboration between community members and level up new participants and increase matching pool donations.\u201d I believe Grassroots (and PGF) has done an exceptional job staying true to this original objective. The Library, also, to my knowledge emerged from this initiative where there was a request for proposals on \u201cSeeking a New Kind of Public Good\u201d.     Jodi_GitcoinDAO:  I think PGF is uniquely positioned to make this initiative a success, and I would love to hear a stronger commitment to working with DAO Ops and MMM on that initiative.   PGF, like all workstreams at Gitcoin, has continued to adapt since July 2021. I\u2019m excited for Grassroots to especially adapt to the protocol development, and continue building community in very close collaboration with DAO Ops and MMM during S15. ",

There\u2019s been great dialogue regarding making collaboration across Grassroots, MMM, and DAOops happen around community engagement. This seems like a very positive direction to be moving in. The partnerships budget is the one that I struggle the most with and where the dialogue is still lacking in building my confidence at this point.  I don\u2019t think our focus has been too spread, but I do agree that we historically haven\u2019t done the best job of tracking goals and accountabilities.  I shared this exact feedback during the CSDO review session and it was largely shrugged off. My experience on high performing sales teams is that they are run with extreme transparency and very clear accountability around pipelines and targets. I\u2019m supportive of paying commiserate with performance and thus far we continue to see a lack of ability to really measure performance. Paying on a promise to deliver in future seasons and as market conditions improve does not seem like a prudent use of DAO treasury. I believe, at a minimum, I would need to see a plan for how the partnerships team will be tracking performance and progress in a more transparent and accountable manner to be able to support this budget request as currently proposed.

It\u2019s great to hear that this will now also be opened up to DAO Citizens and looking forward to a deep collab between Saf (DAO Ops), Maxwell and Gary (MMM) on all things Community.

Public Library = More here Easiest way to discover more is via gitcoindao.com and/or joining our discord and applying to become a gitcoin citizen.     abitrolly:  This Google doc is not public.   Maybe this was changed in the meantime but it actually is public. Hope this helps! ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Maxwell for the reply and thoughts. I love to hear that so many in the workstream understand and see value in the slight pivot in a few areas. I will be voting Yes to budget in good faith that we can make the changes discussed:  Specifically confirming Grassroots is oriented around the highest leverage community engagement work The Sales team is developing more accountability on performance, and thinking about recurring sponsorships Grants Ops is continuing to scale and think longer term protocol approach (more permissionless, more runbooks, more approachable)  Here is what I added to my Voter\u2019s Guide for a bit more details:  I am voting Yes on this budget, but it comes after a lot of dialog with PGF and the commitment to revise some of where teams are focused (over the next few months). More specifically, Grassroots has done a really strong job of bringing Public Goods into the web3 spotlight over the last year, and I would love to see them focused more on the Grants Protocol messaging now - advocating for why permissionless giving protocols are so important and how Gitcoin fits into the space as a result. Grantees are one of five constituents we likely care about. Donors, Matching Funders, GTC Token holders, our DAO/Community are the other four. Finding a narrative that speaks to the collection of constituents, and that also dovetails nicely with work MMM and DAO Ops are doing is a large opportunity (and I know other workstreams are working to advance as well). I want to make sure the workstream can still take some risks in exploring better BD habits, and that they can fully adopt HubSpot. I would love to see more recurring Grants rounds from folks, and Aqueducts was one way of doing this. Once the protocol is live, it may offer a more tangible way for folks to grok who the Aqueduct can be used to fund their ecosystem.  ",

I\u2019ve meant the report template could be updated to include the tooltip, if the same reporting format will be used in the future.     krrisis:  Public Library = More here    This was tough to grasp without the explanation. In my area libraries are usually silent spaces with books, where speaking is discouraged. So I didn\u2019t expect it to be a discord channel.  My best bet was that it is an list of public goods like Registry \u00bb Digital Public Goods Alliance But yea, if there is an initiative to record opinions, then I have a point to say about protecting digital things in public domain. Which status lawyers say is not clarified. And there is also no activity from them to clarify it. Also initiatives like SPDX are effectively erasing public domain and forcing to replace it with licenses. My guess why is this happening is that opting out from copyright is not being paid as well as protecting the copyright. And I guess people spend big lumps of money to get education in copyright protection. I think decentralized approach can fix that. ",

I asked about funnel, cycle time, etc. fwiw and didn\u2019t see a response other than that it does not make sense to measure activity alone - which is fair unless you can see activities tied to future outcomes. We might actually be underinvesting in partnerships & grassroots & PGF altogether; i.e. we may have high return efforts that are not well measured yet that are going to be comparatively starved because of this lack of measurement.  Anyway - more data & as you said a plan for operationalizing the accountability. ",

Therefore, I will commit to ensuring that the Grassroots team will have a more holistic view on community engagement and to orient around the highest leverage we can as @jodi and @Lindsey have advocated for too.
