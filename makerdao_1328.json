It is not necessary to realize the hypothesis that a gold meteorite falls to cause the price of gold to fall, so with this it seems that the technology of cryptocurrencies with their finite extraction is once again taking the lead    MINING.COM    Uganda says exploration results show it has 31 million tonnes of gold ore Most of the deposits were discovered in Karamoja, a parched sprawling area in the country's northeastern corner on the border with Kenya.  Est. reading time: 2 minutes       China already went ahead and had started bilateral agreements with Uganda (pretty bad) https://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/como//eng/news/t1580860.htm If the discovery is true and knowing the agreements that China has and at the same time how authoritarian China is with its agreements, how would this affect gold as a refuge value? And what role will cryptocurrencies have as a value escapement, or even as a future refuge value? ",
