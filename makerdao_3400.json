That is what MakerDAO and Dai offer, and that is also why I am applying to become a Facilitator. As someone passionate about equality, I want to utilize my expertise in marketing and decades of experience as a former Bloomberg journalist to promote and share MakerDAO and Dai\u2019s benefits.   Core Unit ID  Core Unit ID: CPM-001 Strategic Marcomms Core Unit   Facilitator name and information  Kathleen and Kathleen_Chu on Maker Forum  @kathleen on Rocket Chat 0x21401CCa9b3E237E6c5De9cD227CEC690d566A60   Facilitator Commitment   My commitment to MakerDAO is to fulfill the mandate, engage in discussions regarding Maker governance, and collaborate with other facilitators and units to contribute to the success of MakerDAO.   My unit\u2019s structure is relatively flat, with experts covering the key markets. They will be in charge of executing their strategy and deliver results. My role is to find the right people for the rest of the roles and ensure they get the help and resources they need. I will also make sure their efforts are coordinated, and their achievements are highlighted.   We plan to use OKR to set a clear direction for the unit and utilize KPI to gauge our performance. I plan to share quarterly updates to ensure the transparency of our progress.   Retaining and hiring talents can pose a challenge. I plan to focus on finding the right people and getting the team up and running in the first couple of months.   In the second quarter, we plan to activate several outreach programs we have listed in our business plan. I expect the speed of budget spending to increase in the second half of the year once the team is in place and gaining momentum.
