At some point ( provided the peg does not drop below 1 so vault owners can liquidate and get the profit) we will stop making revenue on part of the stablecoin portfolio. Since liquidations aren\u2019t enabled all vaults at 1.01 that have been for more than 3 months will be undercollateralized therefore if the revenue were to be burnt we would have to mint maker to back up the undercollateralized debt. That\u2019s why it was also proposed to increase the SB because once we reach a certain threshold of CR of stablecoins any loss would be offset from the SB and we would still accrue income from new vaults. Another alternative was to keep the burning while later in time dropping the SF of stable coins to cero. That would imply burning but leaving money on the table for all stablecoin vaults that have room to grow on the interest. In summary my vote is more related to this point than domain teams or expenses (and also taking into account a month if not more of maker burning) those could be taken out of the SB and eventually if it were not enough increase it. If we are to use the funds from the SB we better make sure that they are not contigent and the best alternative I\u2019ve heard so far is to increase the SB (once we stop burning maker if that is decided) keep the interest on stablecoins & keep track of underwater vaults since those funds on the SB are temporary pending write off of the vault.

I agree. Still, from marketing perspective, i think it would be good to burn some MKR. Since (crypto) market is very speculative at this point, this might even push MKR price higher. In the end, i think I\u2019ve learned 2 lessons this year:  unexpected (rare?) events are probably much likely then we thought we need to go faster (even when things seem to calm down) -> we should not optimize (discuss) solutions too much to find perfect solutions, but focus on moving forward first  Anyway, efficient MKR burning is quite unimportant at this point.

Assuming the farming stop and we go back to 400M DAI, a surplus buffer at 4M DAI would mean DAI = 1.01$. If DAI is below that, that incentivize triggering an ES (especially if a good amount of the collateral is stablecoins). Having more DAI aside is also not helping the peg. Each more DAI is basically a new USDC in a vault. But I don\u2019t see a way to solve that. I\u2019m not against the overall idea but I would put the surplus of the surplus buffer in a DAI holder remote wallet (like strategic reserves). I also like the idea to burn enough to go back to 1M MKR. Finally, most of the fees are from stablecoin vaults, so those will likely by cut down in 2 months. It\u2019s not quite clear that this income is real (as we have no solution to liquidate yet). It could soon become an expense. We might want to avoid to burn virtual money. ",

Having a slush fund without a clear mandate from the community on who controls it and how to spend it can be a set up for recrimination and mistrust and breaking the social contract with MKR holders.  I would start with a mandate on what and how much we should spend money on to support the protocol and then consider how to fund it.   Its the same cost for MKR holders if you divert income into a slush fund or mint new MKR to pay for a cost but allow existing income to be used to burn MKR.  The main issue here is getting consensus on how to spend the money before diverting income from burning MKR. ",

I have tried to address some concerns that may have not been addressed before this poll where people voted in favour of not increasing Surplus Buffer. I am going to run another poll, by proposing a 2m increase of the Surplus Buffer. At current rates and potentially implementing this increase on next Friday\u2019s executive vote, this buys us about 5 weeks time from now before we hit it again. Another reason for increasing Surplus Buffer that I haven\u2019t addressed in my previous post but mentioned on the G&R call is that Maker currently has around 900m debt exposure, of which 420m is based on volatile collateral. Ideally Maker should be always aiming to have between 2% and 4% buffer available for loss coverage (these levels are based on risk premiums). In case Surplus Buffer is increased to 4m it would represent around 1% of debt from volatile collateral and is somewhat better than the current 0.5%. Although still not ideal in my mind, it is a step forward. Should we increase the Surplus Buffer by 2m?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Poll is open until this Friday and will proceed to Monday\u2019s on-chain Poll. ",

Ideally Maker should be always aiming to have between 2% and 4% buffer available for loss coverage (these levels are based on risk premiums).   Feels like this is a key point here. Even disregarding the stablecoin issue, the total debt has increased faster than the buffer. On a sidenote @Primoz can you add an abstain option  Edit: Have updated the poll at Primoz\u2019s request. Please vote again if you had already voted. ",

In case we believe DAI price can fall faster than the CR of these Vaults, they will self unwind. Speed of CR decrease is of course related to SF: lower SF leads to slower CR decrease. In that case it makes more sense to lower SF so that there is a higher chance of repayment and less reliance for liquidation. On the other hand this doesn\u2019t necessarily maximize return for Maker. Because if CR is pushed all the way down to 100% before self unwinding occurs, there is still a chance to collect full 1%. But then we would need to be sure there is enough DAI supply below 1 to actually collect these fees. So to me it seems like some kind of tradeoff where one would need to have a really good estimation of speed of DAI price starting to trend lower so that collection of these fees is optimal. Plus governance needs to decide whether the goal is to get rid of stablecoins quicker rather than later, because unwinding will lead to another push on DAI price upward. So for instance if fees are disabled today, it will take more time to push DAI price down from 1.01, although stablecoin exposure will drop faster (in a scenario where DAI demand < DAI supply). ",
