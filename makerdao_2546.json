This issue was brought up in the rocketchat by @cmooney. Recently the price of gas on Ethereum has been going up. It\u2019s no longer cost effective to liquidate dusty vaults due to the gas costs of the auction process. We also need to consider that gas costs could increase sharply during a liquidation event. There\u2019s also the gas cost of cycling capital, and which can also be quite high compared to the profitability of a dust vault liquidation. Another thing to note, is that opening a vault costs a lot of gas anyways. It\u2019s not cost effective for users to make small vaults as well. (It can cost more than 550k gas to open a vault. That\u2019s $9 at 50 gwei.) Considering these gas costs of these actions, the dust amount should probably be raised to 100 DAI or higher to ensure \u2018dust\u2019 vaults are cost effective to liquidate.
