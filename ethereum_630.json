The \u201cwhat we are trying to solve\u201d context is:  we are asking for people to pay ETH for tickets to next Council  there will be expenses in fiat for catering someone will need to pay fiat, and get re-imbursed in crypto turning ETH into DAI (edited!) as it is accepted means that we can be sure we have the right amount to cover the catering expenses at the same time, the ECF sponsorship of 2KEU (that we have listed in the budget) should also get turned into DAI now any other sponsors that pay in crypto should also be converted to cover hard fiat costs  A longer term issue is what to do with the rest of the (very small) EthMagicians treasury. I think keeping portions of it in DAI makes sense \u2013 but I personally would like to find more people who will accept ETH directly. This process \u2013 of turning ETH into DAI and helping to manage the treasury \u2013 is what I want to see a volunteer help with. How to do it?

I\u2019m not on the same page as the previous two posters. A CDP allows us to generate DAI on the fly without worrying about fees, slippage or managing multiple transactions. Personally I think it makes sense to generate them directly rather than have to rely on someone else to stabilise the funds. The other benefit would be that anyone can see and repay the CDP\u2019s debt or add collateral as a way to support whatever the funds are being used for (you could theoretically use this model to allow the community to vote on which part of an event they want their money to go to). I like the simplicity, transparency and security that come with using a CDP, but honestly, it won\u2019t make a huge difference either way. EDIT: I should probably note that we would need to safely collateralize the CDP until it is payed back, you can\u2019t simply convert everything into DAI. ",

So, feels like the two options are: (1) Convert ETH to DAI On a weekly basis / when some amount of ETH from ticket sales have accumulated, do a direct exchange using Oasis[^multisig]. Exchange fees are paid, 2-of-3 wallet holders must schedule and do these transactions weekly (say, 4 or 5 times). [^multisig]: Can a multisig wallet use Oasis or do we need to trust eg. me or @jpitts to transfer into our own wallets and then back? DAI is held in the EthMagicians wallet. Expenses are paid back from the DAI held in the EthMagicians wallet. (2) Create a CDP A CDP is created, presumably requiring some minimum amount funds from the EthMagicians wallet. It can be topped up with ticket sales over time. @Flash \u2013 can you point us to and/or explain what creating a CDP means? Is there a minimum? Are there costs? Can it be done from a multisig wallet? Do we get interest? When expenses are submitted, the CDP generates DAI as needed. New sponsorships in ETH (for example) could be sent to this CDP in the future. Convert projected costs now Since we do have a treasury, we could choose to do (1) or (2) soon \u2013 essentially lock in that we need 3KEU for catering, and 2KEU from previous ECF sponsorship.  Closer to the event (basically, as people submit expenses), most of which would occur around the time of the event or shortly after, DAI would be transferred to the people who paid (who would be responsible for converting to fiat or holding DAI). Right now, who will pay the caterers is an open question. I think we can ask Jerome if he / Asseth might do this. I can do this if need be as long as they will take EU with an IBAN transfer. Tomo might be able to as well. I\u2019ll follow up on this. ",

At any time you can deposit and withdraw your Eth as long as you keep the DAI collateralize at over 150%. It charges 2.5% of the created DAI per year(0.0068% per day) as its fee. I\u2019m not sure how we would go about creating one as I haven\u2019t done it from a multisig before but it should be straightforward. Call the MakerDao contract that creates it, deposit Eth as collateral, and then create DAI as required. The debt is public, those that want to buy tickets in DAI could pay it back directly and watch the number shrink. After the event, once everything has been payed for, we can close the CDP by paying back the remaining debt (in DAI) or set a goal for the next one(donations to the CDP effectively lowering the ticket prices for next time.) Some DAI will need to be bought if we want to close the CDP by paying the remainder of the debt in full. The advantage being that there is no rush for this. ",

Also we might not need much exchanging at all. IMHO we should just request DAI from participants instead of ETH.

This is false, we are not buying Eth with the DAI so this does not apply, the DAI used to close the CDP can be bought at any time. If we want a part of the wallet\u2019s funds to be in DAI long term (as I believe @boris has hinted at) then we would buy them separately. I believe I\u2019ve made my reasoning clear so I\u2019ll leave it at that. I think the CDP idea is neater but if people would rather things be done more traditionally, the end result will be the same. EDIT: The biggest downside is that a significant amount of Eth could be locked up at one time(even if it\u2019s easily released) to secure it. If the funds need to be on hand for something else or if it makes people uncomfortable to move a large amount then I would advise going with another solution. ",

AdamDossa:  accept that between the point where you receive the ETH and turn it into DAI you have an open risk position to ETH / USD so try and keep this period reasonably short).   This logic should put you in favour of a CDP as this is exactly what it allows, a short, calculated move away from Eth. Using a CDP means you are in fact taking less of a \u201ctrading position\u201d. The debt created in DAI will be payed back in DAI. Both through donations and through exchange based conversions. The difference is in the timing. if you are skipping the CDP, you are converting vague large portions of your Eth into DAI (aka taking a relatively long term position against Eth for the purpose of stability) so that it is on hand to pay for expenses. If you are using the CDP, you have as much DAI as your collateral safely allows, you are effectively paying for expenses in Eth (with DAI) until you are ready to pay back the debt. Then and only then are you converting the exact amount of Eth necessary into DAI.

Thanks, yeah, this is valid but keep in mind that if the value of Eth drops and we are forced to close the CDP, the value \u201clost\u201d will be equivalent to what it would have been if we had initially bought DAI. It might also be worth pointing out that the same is true for holding Eth, if its value drops too low, we can\u2019t pay for anything. If coming up with the collateral is a problem for any reason then I\u2019d happily advocate for something else. I\u2019m only trying to clear up misunderstandings, apologies if I ever came off as aggressive. We\u2019re all trying our best here. ",

I agree that you don\u2019t get extra exposure from opening up a CDP, but you still have exposure to the price of ETH in USD. If the value of ETH (in USD) increases then you profit, if it goes down, then you lose (potentially more than the value decreases if the CDP is liquidated and you pay a liquidation fee of 13%). If instead you turn any ETH received immediately into DAI (or as soon as is practical) then you have no exposure to the price of ETH in USD. So, IMO, it really comes down to whether EM wants to maintain exposure to the value of ETH in USD or not. If it wants to maintain exposure then using a CDP is a reasonable option (although so would only converting ETH into USD at the point it is needed and / or retaining some portion of the treasury in ETH, and some in DAI). If EM doesn\u2019t want any exposure to the value of ETH in USD then it should not hold ETH, and instead hold USD (or DAI). It is a reasonable view for an organisation like EM to want to maintain exposure (given its place in the ecosystem) but if you want to be able to plan longer term in a very prudent fashion it should convert at least ~6 months operating costs into DAI so that if the price of ETH plummets it can still operate for this time. I came in to this conversation a bit late, so if the above decision (that EM wants to retain exposure to ETH/USD) has already taken place I wasn\u2019t aware. Possibly an analogy would be:   suppose you own a house, and you want to start a business that is going to cost $100,000. You could either sell the house for $150,000 (convert ETH => USD) and use that as operating capital (leaving you with no exposure to the housing market), or take out a mortgage against your house for $100,000 (CDP) and use that (leaving you exposed to the housing market). The more prudent approach (in a volatile housing market) is the former, but if you\u2019re an expert on housing and convinced the price is going to increase, the better approach is the latter.   by analogy selling 66% of your house for $100,000 would be a compromise leaving you some exposure to house prices, but also guaranteeing you your first year of operating capital regardless of what the housing market does.   NB - I should add that I love makerDAO and the concept of CDPs - just not sure it makes sense in this context  ",

You are also making the dangerous assumption that if the value of ETH falls, EM will be liquid enough to purchase enough DAI to free its locked ETH. In a falling market with an organisation like EM this may well not be true resulting in punitive charges vs. pretty much any other option. ",

Mag CDP.png588\u00d7544 41 KB  The key thing to notice here is that a CDP does not make any decisions as to (or have any impact on) the composition of the wallet. What is 100% Eth will stay 100% Eth, what is 40% Eth stays 40% Eth. The DAI available to be created with said Eth is NOT bought. Only one market transaction needs to be made, it is exact, has no urgency whatsoever and serves to close the CDP. The wallet and its funds will only be changed for the duration of time it takes for this transaction to execute (whether it is made up of 10% or 100% Eth). None of the above applies to buying DAI, quite the opposite, as that is an explicit decision on the wallet\u2019s composition and involves holding a position against Eth (nothing is wrong with this, that same decision can be made in tandem to the CDP\u2019s creation).
