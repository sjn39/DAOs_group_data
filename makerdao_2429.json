                    "content": "[EURS] - Stasis Euro stablecoin MIP6 collateral application This is a MIP6 Proposal for the addition of Stasis\u2019 tokenized euro to MCD. EURS is a standard erc20 token with approximately $35 million market cap. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @befitsandpiper, A member of the makerdao community. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. EURS mirrors the value of the euro on the blockchain, and is supported by liquidity assurance mechanisms provided by ecosystem partners. Each token is backed 1:1 by euros held in reserve accounts. In addition to euros, EURS can be issued in exchange for securities, which are purchased by STASIS\u2019 liquidity providers. 3. Provide a brief history of the project. Closest thing I could find for this question, since I am not a member of the stasis team: \u201cIn physics STASIS, pronounced stey-sis, refers to the balancing of various forces in order to reach equilibrium or keep something in one place. Our tokenization services account for all the forces that affect a digital asset, from technology to corporate structure, and from government relations to public relations. To do this, we\u2019ve pulled together an ecosystem of licensed financial intermediaries, top law firms, and a top global accounting firm. Each party contributes to the ecosystem based on their own particular expertise, allowing us to create a comprehensive framework for tokenization while ensuring that a digital asset mirrors its off-chain counterpart in the long run. Despite shifting regulatory and economic environments, the assets we tokenize stay the same; they\u2019re in stasis.\u201d 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. the closest thing is this transparency page: https://stasis.net/transparency/ 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. smart contract audit: https://blog.coinfabrik.com/stasis-token-smart-contract-audit/ 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. community page: https://eurs.stasis.net/community/ There\u2019s also a blog: https://stasis.net/blog/ 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? collateral is used as a stablecoin representation of the euro. The liquidity/asset reserve process is shown in the schematic here: https://eurs.stasis.net/ 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? Yes, Stasis (STSS Limited) is a Malta based company. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? Hit-BTC is probably the largest exchange where EURS is traded, but there a number of centralized and decentralized exchanges: https://eurs.stasis.net/community/ The rest of these questions will have to wait for a Stasis representative:  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  ",

This position has a carry cost and make sense only as long as government bonds appreciates. That\u2019s pure speculation. I don\u2019t like it but assuming a correct leverage (<5x) and average country rating (>= A) that\u2019s not too risky (but obviously parameters matters). Under such conditions, I can\u2019t see why money market funds (MMF), or other players, are not taking the opportunity (pushing rates in the negative territory). Liquidity with no duration risk and low credit risk can\u2019t be above 0 for long. Is such opportunity only temporary? Which is a risk. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like EURS, I really like it. But as a good chunk of the MakerDAO community already finds USDC risky (hence the 4% risk premium), EURS has the same issue plus currency risk and credit risk. Does it makes sense to provide such a collateral with a +6-10% risk premium (regarding the EUR/USD evolution over the last month, it seems so  )? I would love to be confident enough to vote for 4% risk premium. I don\u2019t want to have a EUR stablecoin at disadvantage with a USD one. PS : Great experience using the EUR on ramp. Really fast and cheap. PPS : @LongForWisdom the spam is probably due to Stasis marketing team \u201cbribing\u201d for greenlight votes and messages in this thread. A bit unfortunate. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your comments, exciting to have a conversation with knowledgeable person. So there is a market for residence via investments across Europe. It is quite big. All those residence programs usually require applicants to purchase government bonds and hold them for considerable time (5y+). Our custodians are providing leverage to those applicants to purchase bonds as this is very safe and committed customer who will not be closing the position to risk his residency. We, in turn, aim for big money market fund to run ourselves (but it\u2019s only possible with significant reserves 100MM++, you are correct) and meanwhile we are tracking ~32mm, made \u201cISDA-like\u201d agreements with licensed institutions to have a fixed yield for the capital we deploy to them. Keeping in mind our 5% rule. Regarding USDC. There are more than 500 million people who use EUR. I think the market for DAI should include EU customers who have EUR as a natural balance sheet currency, EUR accounts and cards. We offer the best user experience and the cheapest on and off ramps out/to of EUR, including unbeatable 1.5% visa/mastercard fee, which is almost 3x cheaper what coinbase charges. Also, our light-KYC user experience is the richest on the market, allowing to transact up to 1000 eur without submitting identity documents. This euro-as-a-service via APIs allows anybody to transact instantly in EUR and accept payments with visa/mastercard, outsourcing the headache of huge transaction fees and negative interest rates to us. The risk premium on EURS will definitely be lower than on USD. If a EURS deposit market existed, millions of euros would be happy with 2-3% annual yield. Hope it helps. PS thank you for the off and on ramp feedback. glad you liked it. ",

My questions are a bit late to the game, but I was hoping you all could answer the following for the DAO\u2019s benefit:   STSS Limited is the entity that controls the EXT bank accounts that custody the EUR assets, correct? Or is that the Stasis Foundation?   Is STSS Limited or the Statis Foundation regulated as an Authorized Payment Institution in any European country? If so, does STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation have passporting rights across the EU?   Is STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation registered with the European Banking Authority to provide payment or e-money services?  If not, can you explain why?    Does STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation operate a KYC/AML compliance program for all liquidity providers purchasing EURS from or exchanging EURS with the STSS Limited?   If neither entity performs exchange services, can you please describe the relationship, if any, with XMT Gozo Ltd? I believe I read that XMT Gozo Ltd. also provides exchange services for EURS?   If XMT Gozo Ltd. provides exchange services, can please clarify whether it is regulated as an Authorized Payment Institution in any European country and, if so, whether it passporting rights across the EU?   If XMT Gozo Ltd. provides exchange services, does it operate a KYC/AML compliance program?   Can you disclose the beneficial owners or controlling persons of the Statis Foundation (the entity that controls STSS Limited, as described in an earlier thread: [EURS] - Adding crypto Euro to MCD)?

                    "content": "Hi. Certainly, that\u2019s not a problem, please see your questions answered below: STSS Limited is the entity that controls the EXT bank accounts that custody the EUR assets, correct? Or is that the Stasis Foundation? STSS Limited controls only our IP and Wallet development. The entity that holds EURS reserves is a specially designated for the stablecoin reserve holding purpose only and is called STSS (Malta) Ltd. It\u2019s established in the EU, audited by BDO, and is compliant with the MFSA out of Malta and their Virtual Financial Assets Act from 2017. Both entities belong to the Stasis Foundation. Is STSS Limited or the Statis Foundation regulated as an Authorized Payment Institution in any European country? If so, does STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation have passporting rights across the EU? No and no - they are not required to do so currently as they are not involved in either the stablecoin issuance or trading. No licensing exists presently for a stablecoin issuer, but we do self regulate our SPV to the highest standards similar to category 2 licensed investment companies that qualify as MiFID firms. Is STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation registered with the European Banking Authority to provide payment or e-money services? If not, can you explain why? Neither entity you mentioned is involved in the stablecoin issuance or trading. The SPV entity is compliant with the VFA Act in Malta and serves as a safeguard of reserves. We chose the most efficient way to facilitate secondary market transactions - by creating a competition among partners who hold licenses themselves and offer the most convenient terms for customers to transact. We call this fungible settlement infrastructure and there are currently multiple licensed endpoints available, for example, XMT Gozo Ltd., UAB NexPay, Nortide Capital AG, SCB AG, and others. Does STSS Limited or the Stasis Foundation operate a KYC/AML compliance program for all liquidity providers purchasing EURS from or exchanging EURS with the STSS Limited? The SPV entity conducts KYC/AML on all transactions it facilitates although it is only used to face accredited investors buying or selling significant amounts of EURS (5mm+). Everything below is facilitated by the liquidity providers mentioned above as well as our \u201cSellback\u201d interface which is accessible both through web and mobile here: www.stasis.net/sellback and is also available via OpenAPI: https://stasis.net/sellback/api/v2/docs/swagger. Currently, it has no KYC requirements for transactions below 250 euro lifetime, but we are working to increase that limit to 1000 euro per customer in August. If neither entity performs exchange services, can you please describe the relationship, if any, with XMT Gozo Ltd? I believe I read that XMT Gozo Ltd. also provides exchange services for EURS? Please see the above. If XMT Gozo Ltd. provides exchange services, can please clarify whether it is regulated as an Authorized Payment Institution in any European country and, if so, whether it passporting rights across the EU? XMT Gozo is authorized by MFSA to operate under the Vfa class 4 license. If XMT Gozo Ltd. provides exchange services, does it operate a KYC/AML compliance program? Yes. Can you disclose the beneficial owners or controlling persons of the Statis Foundation (the entity that controls STSS Limited, as described in an earlier thread: [EURS] - Adding crypto Euro to MCD)? There are no beneficial owners, but a board of directors constitution of which we are happy to disclose to our verified clients. Our project is literally a charity to the industry to create a clean, transparent, institutional-grade quality cash-on-chain, financed by the gains our stakeholders made by investing in Bitcoin back in 2013. CEO of STASIS is one of the directors on the board of the foundation. We welcome other industry veterans to join the board. In your economic model, are \u201cliquidity providers\u201d the only entities able to directly exchange EURS with STSS Limited, the Stasis Foundation, or XMT Gozo Ltd.? Anybody who can be qualified as an accredited investor by MiFID terms or an entity, licensed to hold customer\u2019s funds is able to face our SPV to directly exchange EURS. But so far competition among liquidity providers made the terms for retail customers probably the most attractive on the on/off ramp market: it is free for SEPA transfers to purchase, just 0.1% with 50 Eur cap to sell and using Visa/MC 1.5% for EU-issued cards and 3.5% for the rest. We hope this info helps to clarify any doubts. Let us know if you have any more questions, please. ",

As a MKR holder, I don\u2019t feel particularly comfortable (and I think this feeling is widespread) with centralised stablecoins. Sure, EURS claims to be audited and documents are directly available online. But still, it is regulated in MALTA and so there is a level of uncertainty. For example, @Gregory_Klumov mentioned     Gregory_Klumov:  So there is a market for residence via investments across Europe. It is quite big.   and there you go: \"The European Commission launched infringements procedures Tuesday against Cyprus and Malta over their \u201cgolden passport\u201d programs,  (source: https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-takes-action-malta-cyprus-golden-passports-73711080) But beside these legal aspects, My main question (to anyone reading) is: why would MakerDAO want to embark another centralised stablecoin which:  has much lower market cap than others we already have. EURS marketcap has been stuck at ~35m EUR since july 2020, so it has not seen any growth. By contrast USDT, USDC, DAI, and other stablecoins have all seen a growth of 200/300% or more.  Also, but this is just me, I don\u2019t particularly like statements like:     Gregory_Klumov:  We offer the best user experience and the cheapest on and off ramps out/to of EUR, including unbeatable 1.5% visa/mastercard fee, which is almost 3x cheaper what coinbase charges.   The best user experience claim\u2026 meh, whatever\u2026 The cheapest on and off ramps out/to of EUR, I don\u2019t think so.

Because EURS is one of the most transparent solutions in the stablecoin market segment due to audits and reserve transparency outlined about - qualities that many projects fail to deliver. Meanwhile, the high speed of asset growth can\u2019t be considered as a non-risk mark.

Currently, observed volatility works as a conviction for investors to stick to the stablecoin field and their balance sheet currency. Speaking of transparency & growth, it\u2019s worth to remember the infamous story of GUSD, where certain actions taken by Gemini to boost GUSD adoption have had unintended impacts in practice. In a bid to capture market share, Gemini issued roughly 1 percent discounts on GUSD in 2018 to OTC desks and market makers, who were then made to agree on restrictions that would bar them from immediately redeeming the assets. According to the trader based in Latin America, Gemini pitched the company on a discount deal that offered his firm the ability to buy tokens at below market value. (The company declined because the desk wanted to obtain GUSD so that it could be transferred to fiat.) When the desk later acquired GUSD from its own network, the trader said he was warned by Gemini staff that redeeming millions of dollars would harm the stablecoin.

Our community thrives and often asks about EURS onboarding on MD. We realize that the main problem was associated with the risk of our smart contract back in the day, as it is also designated in the collateral prioritization sheet above. Not denying that, we want to outline that the STASIS team upgraded EURS smart contract a month ago (I\u2019ve shared the links in my previous post), so the aforementioned risk is now gone. We honestly believe that these circumstances must be taken into account, and our priority in the line should grow higher now (EURS is taking the 64th position at the moment). Looking forward to knowing community and domain teams\u2019 opinions. ",

EUR has negative yield, but EURS does not - this begs the question of how EURS is able to pay for this negative yield cost on their fiat deposits. The answer I\u2019ve heard is fairly opaque - Stasis invests a portion of funds in high yield/high risk investments to shield EURS from negative rates, but there\u2019s no transparency into the quality and composition of those investments. I don\u2019t see how MakerDAO can earn excess risk adjusted returns on an EURS vault in these circumstances, which helps explain the low prioritization. ",
