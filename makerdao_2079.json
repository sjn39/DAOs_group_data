                    "content": "MIP81 passed with overwhelming support and since then, the Core Unit teams and Arrangers have been working with the Coinbase team to complete the MIP requirements and assessments in advance of transferring the USDC to coinbase to earn the 2.37% institutional reward. CES has completed and posted the technical risk assessment of the smart contract implementation. The smart contract approach whilst not perfect, does provide some advantages with respect to on-chain transparency (all withdrawals and funding of the institutional rewards Safebox contract are completely transparent on chain) and potential future automation of the institutional rewards arrangement. However, this comes at the expense of the additional technical risks, engineering and audit costs that would be required to complete an implementation under this arrangement. To move MIP81 forward while the smart contract implementation is being finalized, the DAO can move forward with a MIP65-like implementation - traditional custodial arrangement with the trust/foundation responsible for managing the amounts custodied through resolutions approved by Maker Governance. Please note that under this arrangement, Coinbase will have full control of the funds rather than only a veto in the case of the smart contract implementation, but the trust/foundation would have well-known legal protections. Monetalis has stepped forward and offered to be the arranger for this MIP, as they have an existing functional relationship with Coinbase Prime via MIP65 - and the MIP21 implementation would generally mirror the existing MIP65 version. As a reminder, the arranger is responsible for setting up a safe structure that can be controlled by Maker governance and safely hold the RWA assets for Maker - and in this case comply with all necessary Coinbase Prime KYC/AML requirements. At least one community member, with legal credentials, must, through a public forum post, verify that the proposed entity is appropriate to onboard to Coinbase Prime. Should the James Asset PTC be the SPV holding vehicle (Trustee) - instructed by MakerDAO (and also used in MIP65)?  Yes No Abstain  MIP81 states that 33% or $1.6B USDC should be transferred to Coinbase upon deal execution. There is some ambiguity in the amount to be transferred that the DAO must ensure the envisioned amount is clarified and confirmed for the transfer. Today, 33% of the USDC PSM amounts to approximately $750M USDC. What should the maximum debt ceiling for MIP81 be?  $750M $1.6B No amount should be transferred (explain in comments)  Typically with RWA MIP implementations, the debt ceiling is raised gradually over time to the maximum approved debt ceiling. Given the community\u2019s desire to move forward with the smart contract implementation, it may make sense to have the debt ceiling raise to the maximum be dependent upon the completion of the smart contract implementation. Should MakerDAO tie the debt ceiling and initial transfer of USDC to the implementation of the smart contract solution?  No, the maximum debt ceiling amount should be sent immediately Yes, transfer $250M until the smart contract is ready Yes, transfer $500M until the smart contract is ready  ",

With the Legal Assessment being posted yesterday, a lot of questions came up and it seems prudent to make sure we are following the assigned MIP process for Coinbase before we take a further vote. We\u2019ll be chatting with CES-001 and SF-001 today to figure out the best path forward and will keep the community updated on the outcome. MIP81 details a signal take place for the onboarding of a legal entity, so at the very least that will need to take place rather than a facilitator directed poll. The other new information in the legal assessment will also be addressed, likely with a separate governance process. CC: @collateral-core-unit @strat-fin-core-unit @Recognized-Delegates ",

In particular, we want to draw attention to the following: \u201cMaker Governance has complete ability to trigger a liquidation with a successful executive vote encoding an instruction to the authorized account users of the legal entity.\u201d and \u201cMaker Governance will be able to freely mint, burn, withdraw, and settle almost instantaneously in USDC (<6 mins), consistent with Coinbase Prime\u2019s standard offering.\u201d Note that this is inconsistent with a veto or other ability to block Maker governance from exercising full control over deposits and withdrawals. In our view, it would violate MIP81 as it is currently written, and no signals should be pursued for such an arrangement under MIP81. ",
