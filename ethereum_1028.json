Last year over 6000 submissions were rejected - people did not get a single comment back On the other hand, many talks at devcon had nothing to do with ETH. The reason I think we need at least 20 people for the original EIP committee is , if we do not have many people we wont be able to push this through. If we  cant get at least 20 people, it does not make sense to start IMO. It cant be an EIP submitted by one person. We also need to have a neutral coordinator for this EIP with no affinity to any company project etc Lets start pulling some ideas and seeing if there is enough people interested in having an EIP like that Here are some of ideas -  have a github repository and a youtube channel for all submissions, so people that end up being rejected can present online have a virtual website so everyone rejected for a physical presentation can present virtually limit all talks to 20 minutes so more people can present autoreject all talks dealing with non-eth-compatible blockchains establish a transparent submission and review process similar to online  openaccess journals (which journal should we take as an example?) have a clear nomination and vote process for reviewers have a clear conflict of interest policy  Lets start brainstorming \u2026 ",

I do like upper limits on talk length, though I\u2019m curious if that would be at odds with giving more time to more popular presenters\u2019 Batches of Devcon 5 talks were haphazardly uploaded to youtube at irregular intervals with very minimal description. I suspect that could be improved upon. A website for everyone who was rejected presents risks. Mainly, giving an undeserved platform to those who shouldn\u2019t be elevated (off topic, sketchy, or otherwise low quality). ",
