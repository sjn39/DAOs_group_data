                    "content": "Executive Summary TL;DR Kredika is an end-to-end solution incorporating a technology platform and a legal framework for tokenising EU- and UK-based real world assets (RWAs) and funding them from both traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralised finance (DeFi) sources. Kredika platform will allow asset managers and other institutions working with credit portfolios to tokenise RWAs and lock them as collateral in Maker DAO vaults in compliance with the UK and EU regulation. Our technology solution is designed to provide the highest possible degree of transparency on a loan-by-loan level. This is achieved by encoding terms and conditions of individual loans in smart contracts and incorporating real-world data from multiple reputable sources (oracles) \u2013 legal firms, regulated surveyors, banks, accountants, etc. into the portfolio tracking and valuation process. ERC20-compliant Kredika tokens representing collateral will be issued and locked into the vault. The supply of Kredika tokens will be controlled by the quantum and performance of the collateral. Initial focus in 2022 is on the first implementation of the platform with a \u00a3100m vault allowing for a comprehensive test of the infrastructure for tokenisation and portfolio management. For the first implementation, the portfolio of loans secured by UK property will be originated, underwritten, and serviced using existing infrastructure of an FCA-regulated investment manager Yes Growth. As we run the pilot portfolio/vault in the initial implementation, we will continuously develop our technology to fintune all processes and accommodate more products, participants, events, etc. making it a generic open platform for compliant onboarding and management of RWAs locked in Maker DAO institutional vaults. In future, we are looking to work with Maker DAO as an Arranger for onboarding RWA portfolios from institutional investors of all sizes covering the UK and European markets. Kredika platform is developed by the team of credit and securitisation specialists with a proven track record in managing multi-million loan portfolios and technologists with experience in tokenisation of the real world assets. 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? Kredika LTD (\u201cKredika\u201d), a company incorporated in England and Wales (Company Number: 13582375) with a registered address at 264 Banbury Road, Oxford, England, OX2 7DY). Kredika LTD was created and funded by YesGrowth Ltd for the sole purpose of developing the Kredika project \u2013 a legal framework and technology solution to bring real-world asset (RWA) portfolios into the domain of decentralised finance, providing high level of transparency and accountability suitable for institutional investors as well as stablecoin collateral pools. Kredika is represented by Artem Tolkachev @ATolkachev, [email\u00a0protected] and Max Chmyshuk @max.chmyshuk, [email\u00a0protected]. Yes Growth Ltd (\u201cYG\u201d) is a private limited company in England and Wales, registered number 08540463. Registered office: 264 Banbury Road, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX2 78DY. YG is licensed and regulated by the FCA in the UK (Reg. 615031). Since 2015 YG has been building and managing loan portfolios, with a particular focus on short term unsecured and real-estate secured loans to UK Small and Medium enterprises. The company provides deal flow generation, monitoring, collection and security management services to several financial institutions. Together with their dealflow generating partners, YG has built up and managed over \u00a3250m portfolios of secured and unsecured loans using an institutional level underwriting process. YG also puts together and manages funding structures for the portfolios allowing for syndication between lenders. BondAppetit is an Ethereum-based decentralised lending protocol for collateralized debt. The protocol was built by a team of coders, lawyers, and financiers, who worked at and with the most well-known global corporations. BondAppetit launched in April 2021 with a scalable solution for bringing tradeable bond collateral on-chain and issuing stable coins against the value of such collateral. The technology behind the protocol was adopted and extended for the purposes of Kredika project to accommodate new types of debt obligations (property-backed private loans), new participants (surveyors, lawyers, asset managers) acting as independent oracles verifying status and value of the non-tradeable collateral. Kredika platform integrates directly into origination and underwriting workflow of YesGrowth as well as Maker DAO RWA vault. 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Kredika is a UK-based financial technology company, which is developing a scalable solution incorporating a technology platform and legal framework allowing UK- and EU-based lenders and asset managers to use their real world asset (RWA) portfolios as collateral in Maker DAO institutional vaults and draw DAI as senior secured funding. The main features of Kredika solution are:  Transparent and robust legal structure recognised in the UK, EU, and Switzerland for encapsulating loan asset portfolios in ERC-20 token format suitable for MakerDAO vaults; Legal and regulatory compliance and tax efficiency; Independent verification of the value-defining parameters of RWA collateral by third-party oracles - regulated valuers, law firms, auditors, banks, etc. For the first MD vault, the loan book and associated security is managed by an FCA-regulated portfolio manager \u2014 YesGrowth providing institutional-grade reporting and portfolio management; On-platform representation and traceability of individual underlying loan assets and their performance \u2014 ability to transparently onboard and continuously monitor each loan, property collateral or other RWA. Kredika platform incorporates a collection of oracles, which send data about the current state of collateral assets to the platform allowing it to automatically update the value of the collateral and regulate the supply of Kredika\u2019s ERC20 tokens. Direct interface with the sources of transactional data providing verification for received scheduled payments under each RWA in the portfolio.  With the initial implementation, we are requesting access to a \u00a3100m institutional vault to mint DAI against Kredika ERC-20 tokens issued on the Ethereum mainnet and representing a senior claim over a portfolio of bridging loans secured with full legal charges over UK-based properties with an average loan-to-value (LTV) of 75%. The loans will be originated, serviced, and monitored by an FCA-regulated portfolio manager Yes Growth Ltd. First \u00a3100min liquidity for the conversion of DAIs into USD/GBP was confirmed to us by one of the authorised Swiss banks which is happy to support our project. We consider this implementation as the first step in developing the Kredika platform for accommodating multiple asset managers and growing capacity to \u00a3500 million and beyond. Why we chose UK-property-backed loans as collateral for the first vault? Property is historically one of the most secure types of RWA, providing stability of value and liquidity. When used as collateral in SME loans, property provides superior risk-adjusted returns to the funder. Within our structure, there are two layers of credit enhancement providing stability to the senior claim held in the Maker DAO vault:  Overcollateralization on an individual loan level \u2014 individual loan amount is set at no more than 75% of the estimated value of the underlying property used as collateral; Further 10% credit enhancement will be provided by junior lender(s) funding 10% of each loan with subordinated capital.  As a result, Maker DAO will only fund 67.5% of the property collateral value, verified by independent UK-regulated valuers/surveyors acting as oracles for Kredika platform. Stability and resilience of the UK property market through multiple economic cycles and transparent collateral enforcement process in the UK are additional points of strength for the chosen type of RWA and legal structure.  Graphical user interface Description automatically generated913\u00d7906 68.3 KB  From technology perspective, we are leveraging BondAppetit existing framework and audited smart contracts to develop the first implementation of the platform suitable for working with Maker DAO institutional vault under MIP6 and MIP21 guidelines. We will continue enhancing the platform in parallel with running the first vault to accommodate more asset classes, vaults, multiple participants/oracles (originators, asset managers, law firms, banks, surveyors, auditors, etc.) and improving on-chain transparency of the full life cycle of the loan assets - from origination through servicing to the repayment. BondAppetit protocol was audited by HashEx and MixBytes. Kredika to a large extent utilises protocol\u2019s technology (smart contract, oracle module) to build a transparent platform for bringing property-backed loan collateral into MD vaults in a transparent traceable manner. We will implement the Kredika platform in two stages First Kredika Platform Implementation (\u201cFirst Implementation\u201d) will have all the necessary functionality to tokenise a portfolio of loans secured by UK property and bring it into a Maker DAO vault in 2022. For the First Implementation, we will use modified audited DEPOSITORY and ISSUER contracts used for capturing oracle data, evaluation of the collateral, controlled issuance of collateral tokens and ongoing monitoring and re-valuation of the portfolio. The mechanism for issuing ERC-20 tokens proposed in the diagram has already been implemented and is fully functional within the framework of the protocol (see BondAppetit). Schematic of Kredika\u2019s First Implementation platform:  1600\u00d7598 111 KB  Click to see the full version Origination and underwriting of the loans will be done by YesGrowth leveraging the teams and expertise of select origination partners in the UK utilising the same criteria YesGrowth used to underwrite and successfully manage over \u00a3220 million of property-backed loans funded by TradeFi sources with zero losses. Asset Manager\u2019s loan management system however will not be the only source of information about the status, quality, and ongoing performance of onboarded loans. It will be just one of the several independent oracles providing timely data on the validity of the loan and status of the collateral from regulated entities involved in the underwriting and loan management process. Such additional oracles include:  Legal firm involved in the documentation of the loan and charge as well as checking the availability, clean title, and status of the collateral. Legal firms are licensed and adhere to strict standards as to any claims and representations they make. Legal Firm\u2019s representation as to the validity of the executed loan documentation will be one of the key requirements for loan\u2019s eligibility for the pool. Surveyor/Valuer - a company valuing and checking the physical condition of the property pledged as collateral in the individual loans granted by the UK SPV. Surveyors are regulated individuals or entities in the UK adhering to established standards. Surveyors are involved in valuation and ongoing monitoring/revaluation of property collateral in all TradFi structures. Open Banking Oracle - an API directly to the bank account of the lending SPV or Asset Manager confirming disbursement of the loans as well as servicing and repayment. When data from the Open Banking Oracle is compared to the Asset Manager\u2019s data, loan delinquencies, prepayments and other irregularities are flagged that affect the value of the collateral. Other Oracles - other sources of truth will be added in future further enhancing transparency of the collateral portfolio. Maker DAO Validator - a special power can be granted to Maker DAO\u2019s governance, which can in manual or automatic mode approve loans to be added to the collateral pool once other oracles confirm their validity.  Once all Oracles report to the protocol a valid and approved status of the loan, borrower, and/or current value of the pledged asset, a special ISSUER contract issues an equivalent value in Kredika ERC-20 tokens, deposits them in the MD vault and updates the value of the collateral in the vault in turn triggering availability of new DAI to Kredika. Kredika tokens are ERC-20 tokens issued on the Ethereum mainnet by Kredika Switzerland, a Swiss Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and will be delivered into Maker DAO vault by the issuer as collateral. From legal and regulatory perspective, Kredika tokens are recognised as a self-issued uncertificated negotiable securities under the Swiss law and encapsulate the claim under a senior secured loan facility (the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d) from Kredika Switzerland to Kredika UK, a UK SPV. The Loan Facility underlying the tokens is provided for the purposes of funding a portfolio of RWA and is secured by a floating charge over the UK SPV\u2019s assets \u2013a highly diversified portfolio of 12-18 month bridging loans to UK SME borrowers in turn secured by UK properties. Kredika token holder therefore has a strong verifiable legal recourse to three layers of underlying claims:  the credit-enhanced senior claim under the Loan Facility (90% LTV); the charge over the underlying portfolio of secured bridge loans; and the properties provided as security for the individual bridge loans. In each loan, the value of the property is on average 33% higher than the loan amount (75% LTV).  The total supply of Kredika ERC-20 token can only be updated when:  approved loans are added to the UK SPV\u2019s portfolio and UK SPV borrows more senior secured debt from the Swiss SPV. The Swiss SPV will then mint additional Kredika tokens, deliver them in the vault and mint DAI against this new collateral. some or all of the loans in the UK SPV portfolio are redeemed, the Loan Facility is partially or fully repaid to the Swiss SPV, which converts GBP into DAI and delivers into the vault. Some or all of Kredika tokens are then released and burnt by the Issuer \u2013 the Swiss SPV. UK SPV faces a default, which it will cure through the sale of the properties pledged against the defaulted loans at no more than 75% LTV. YesGrowth acting as a security agent for the UK SPV will enforce the charge over property and sell it in the open market. Proceeds will be used to partially repay the Loan Facility, convert GBP into DAI and deliver into the vault in order to release some Kredika tokens for burning. In a highly unlikely event, the property sale does not recover the principal of the loan, first 10% losses on the portfolio are absorbed by a junior debt provider.  We believe it is extremely important for a good RWA platform to regularly report an up-to-date status and value of the collateral to MD in the most transparent manner possible. Such an approach is inherently difficult with non-tradable loans, however Kredika\u2019s reporting process is by design much more robust and less susceptible to individual party\u2019s manipulation thanks to the following features:  Each individual loan in the UK SPV\u2019s portfolio is added to the loan collateral pool and tracked by using a depository smart contract upon approval by multiple independent parties, potentially including a Maker DAO core unit. Multiple independent oracles (real-world sources of truth about the status and performance of the loans), most of which are regulated entities (law firms, chartered surveyors, banks, asset managers) reporting regularly to the depository contract. When establishing relationships with the service providers acting as Oracles, we will formalise their obligations for regular reporting.  Depository contract will automatically update the value of the collateral (individual loans as smart contracts) based on the content and timestamp of the latest oracle reports. The Maker DAO pricing oracle will be able to get the real-time value of the collateral portfolio and automatically control the amount of DAI available for minting in Kredika vault. List of contracts in the First Implementation: For the first implementation of the Kredika platform and minting of Kredika tokens, Kredika intends to use BondAppetit\u2019s audited smart contracts as a technological basis for managing RWA collateral and reporting its value to Maker DAO. Two main contracts are:  a depository contract used to create and manage representation of individual loans and property collateral in the portfolio, and an issuer contract controlling the supply of Kredika ERC-20 tokens as well as calculating and reporting their value to Maker DAO in order to ensure appropriate collateralisation levels are maintained.  Kredika\u2019s smart contracts are written in Solidity language, allowing the protocol to be deployed on any EVM-compatible blockchain, such as Optimism or Polygon, to minimize maintenance costs. Stage 2. Solution scaling - 2023 and beyond. We see immense potential in the ability to scale our solution after the successful completion of the First Implementation. Basic provisions:  All assets in the collateral pool can be presented in the form of NFT tokens with their own contracts, but abiding by a single \u201cstandard\u201d for reporting information about the price of an asset in a depository. This would allow virtually any types of assets (not just RWA) to be accepted as collateral for MakerDAO to be wrapped in an appropriate business process. Onboarding process for certified MakerDAO-approved asset managers, legal firms, surveyors and other participants in the lending process can be automated. A marketplace for approved participants will be created where new asset managers can select all necessary partners / service providers for building new collateral pools.   1600\u00d71115 195 KB  Click to see the full version Kredika\u2019s smart contracts are written in Solidity language, allowing the protocol to be deployed on any EMV-compatible blockchain, such as Optimism or Polygon, to minimise maintenance costs. In this case, the ERC-20 token, which acts as collateral and is used within MakerDAO, can be transferred to the Ethereum network via a blockchain bridge. 3. Provide a brief history of the project Kredika project was conceived and developed as a collaboration between experienced loan portfolio managers, structured finance professionals, and blockchain and DeFi specialists who share a common vision of building a robust, transparent, and compliant ecosystem for credit market participants incorporating best practice of traditional finance and new technological capabilities offered by blockchain and decentralised finance infrastructure. The \u201cbig idea\u201d is using the power of DLT to enable full transparency and traceability on individual loan level as well as portfolio and funding tranche levels for lenders investors with different mandates (junior and senior wholesale lenders, block discounters, hedge funds, etc.), allowing multiple debt product types, abilities to easily mix and match exposures and access secondary market for otherwise illiquid assets. With emergence of Maker DAO and its decision in 2020 to include RWA as an eligible collateral on the platform, and on-ramp of a number of projects via Centrifuge platform over the course of 2021, the development of the legal framework and technological platform on Kredika side was accelerated and pivoted towards catering to MD\u2019s ambition to provide senior funding against RWA portfolios with junior funding provided by TradFi funds. One of the main questions was a choice of jurisdiction, legal form, and banking relationship for the entity, which would face MD and draw DAI from the vault. The challenge was to find a legal environment catering equally well to DeFi and TradFi in a fully compliant and transparent manner. With Switzerland adopting its new DLT Regulations in early 2021 and two Swiss banks receiving licences to operate in the crypto and RWA tokenisation space, the choice of jurisdiction for the MD-facing SPV became clear and we have since been working with UK and Swiss law firms, regulatory consultants, and other service providers optimising the framework. In 2021, YesGrowth started working with BondAppetit on a staged build-out of Kredika solution bringing together finance and technology expertise required for realisation of our vision. BondAppetit protocol was launched on April 5, 2021. In its first year of operations, the protocol reached the TVL of $10 million, built a vibrant community, launched on Binance Smart Chain, Waves Exchange and Swop.fi, established its first partnership with EAST.Finance, acquired bonds to fully back the USDap (it\u2019s RWA-backed stablecoin), raised the first investment round from the Digital Fortress investment fund and started distributing profits among BAG token holders. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Whitepaper and website are under development, we will update this section once it\u2019s completed. 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract-focused audits. Kredika intends to use BondAppetit\u2019s smart contracts as a technological basis:    github.com   bondappetit-protocol/contracts at master \u00b7 bondappetit/bondappetit-protocol master/contracts The BondAppetit On-Chain Protocol. Contribute to bondappetit/bondappetit-protocol development by creating an account on GitHub.      BondAppetit was audited by HashEx and MixBytes. Both firms are well-known in the crypto space. Prior to the deployment of the vault, Kredika\u2019s smart contracts and broader platform will be also audited by security auditors and legal consultants. 6. Link to any active communities relating to your project. Kredika is yet to establish its social media presence. BondAppetit, however, is present on all key social media platforms: Twitter Community chat Discord 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? We intend to build a new portfolio of property-backed short term (up to 2 years) loans for the purposes of bringing them as RWA collateral into our first MD vault. YesGrowth has a successful track record originating and managing portfolios of such loans utilising a TradFi funding structure. Key historical metrics of the property-backed loan portfolio:  Total lending: 442 day one loans, 665 loans including drawdowns at \u00a3223 million Total redemptions: 245 loans at \u00a3139 million Current loan book: 196 loans at \u00a383 million Loans extended: 66 loans extended with agreement Loans defaulted: 14 loans defaulted without agreement Loans to/in receivership \u00a30 capital loss/\u00a30 interest loss  Each loan is first underwritten and packaged by the originator team, and then underwritten and approved by YesGrowth credit team. The loans are accumulated in a UK-based special purpose vehicles (SPV) funded by senior and junior lenders with senior lender being a financial institution and junior lender being a specialised fund or HNW individuals. Junior lender contributes up to 15% of the principal amount of each loan providing further credit enhancement to the senior lender through a deed of subordination. 8. Does one organisation bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organisation reside in? Kredika tokens locked in the Maker DAO vault will be recognized as security under Swiss law (see Section 11). The tokens will be self-issued by the special purpose vehicle incorporated in Switzerland (Swiss SPV, Kredika Switzerland) and pledged into the vault. Legally the tokens encapsulate the claim of Kredika Switzerland against the UK SPV (Kredika UK) under a senior loan agreement secured by the portfolio of loans. Kredika UK will hold the portfolio of loans secured by first legal charges over the real estate assets pledged as collateral under the individual loan agreements. (see Section 13). It is envisaged that both Swiss SPV and UK SPV will be managed by independent trustees / directors and will appoint YesGrowth, a UK-based FCA-regulated firm, as their security agent for the purpose of enforcing and realising collateral in case of defaults. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? The Kredika tokens issued by Kredika will be used purely to gain financing from Maker\u2019s vault and will not be traded on exchanges, thus, there will not be \u201cexchange for the asset.\u201d 10. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Yes, we have received a legal opinion in Switzerland with regard to the validity of the structure and regulatory standing of the token, which we are happy to provide to all interested parties in the MakerDAO community for the purposes of evaluating this proposal. 11. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. According to the legal opinion we received from a law firm in Switzerland, Kredika tokens should be recognised as negotiable securities (papier-valeur) under Article 965 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (\u201cCO\u201d), and ledger-based securities (droits-valeurs inscrits) under Article 973d of the CO. Under FINMA regulations, Kredika tokens will likely be recognised as self-issued uncertificated securities and given they will be locked in the Maker DAO vault as collateral without being offered to the public or traded in the secondary markets, their issuance under Swiss laws is unregulated from a financial markets law perspective and subject to private law. Loan agreement between Swiss SPV and UK SPV is not regulated as a bilateral business-to-business loan agreement. Given this fact and the fact that the entities are not financial institutions, no KYC requirements will be applicable. However, it should be noted that the KYC procedure on both SPVs will be handled by Swiss Bank for the purposes of DAI-GBP exchange transactions. It is also worth mentioning that Yes Growth LTD as the FCA-regulated business conducts full KYC in respect of the borrowers. 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type   Law firm involved in documentation of the loan, checking the availability, clean title, status of the collateral. Law firms are usually licensed and their representations to the validity of the executed loan documentation will be a requirement for loan\u2019s eligibility as collateral.   Surveyor/Valuer - a company valuing and checking the physical condition of the property, which is pledged as collateral in the individual loans granted by the UK SPV. Surveyors are regulated individuals or entities in the UK adhering to established standards. Surveyors are involved in valuation and ongoing monitoring/revaluation of property collateral in all TradFi structures.   OpenBanking Oracle - an API directly to the bank account of the lending SPV or Asset Manager confirming disbursement of the loans as well as servicing and repayment. When data from Openbanking Oracle is compared to the Asset Manager\u2019s data, loan delinquencies, prepayments and other irregularities are flagged that affect the value of the collateral.   Other Oracles - other sources of truth will be added in future further enhancing transparency of the collateral portfolio.   Provide (a) proposed legal structure for transaction including, type of legal entities, (offshore/onshore, form (trust, corporate, other)) and jurisdiction(s) of legal entities, and (b) likely funds flow (DAI => Fiat => DAI).   Legal structure for Kredika\u2019s first vault with Maker DAO:  Diagram Description automatically generated1380\u00d7732 167 KB  Kredika tokens will be issued by a Swiss SPV and will encapsulate the Swiss SPV\u2019s claims under a senior secured loan agreement between the Swiss SPV and UK SPV holding the portfolio of loans. The loan from the Swiss SPV will be secured by floating charge over the UK SPV\u2019s assets, which would primarily consist of property-secured loans to individual borrowers in the UK. CB Growth Fund will act as a junior lender providing 10% junior capital to the UK SPV. The subordination of CB Growth Fund\u2019s loan to the senior secured loan from the Swiss SPV will be outlined in the tri-party Deed of Subordination. In terms of funds flow, the Swiss SPV will receive DAI from the vault. Further, Swiss SPV will then convert the DAI into British Pounds and will lend to the UK SPV the British Pounds, which will be used for the purpose of granting business loans to borrowers located in the UK. The DAI-GBP exchange transaction will be handled by a Swiss Bank, this bank also will be engaged for the deposit (custody) of fiat. The reverse transaction will be arranged in the same manner.  1600\u00d7838 133 KB  DAI will be minted only upon all oracles confirming status of the loan as \u201capproved and documented\u201d and the value of security at all levels of collateralisation (<70% LTV on individual loan level, 90% LTV on the inter-SPV loan level) as sufficient. Repayment of DAI to the vault will happen when loans in the portfolio repay to the UK account of the UK SPV. UK SPV will repay the Swiss SPV and junior lender and the Swiss SPV will purchase DAI and repay to the vault. In the unlikely scenario that UK SPV does not make a payment under the loan between the Swiss SPV and the UK SPV, and the Swiss SPV is unable to meet its obligations to the vault, the Kredika token holders (or their appointed agent) can enforce the charge over the portfolio of loans held in the UK SPV and put it into a run-off mode recovering all interest and principal within 18-24 months ahead of the junior lender. 14.

Passionate about building businesses in the highly uncertain legal environment, Artem founded Tokenomica (a regulated exchange and tech platform for issuing security tokens) in 2018 and BondAppetit (decentralised collateralised lending protocol) in 2021. Vlad Komissarov: With more than 20 years of experience in software and web development, Vlad has launched and managed a number of major ICT products and services. Vlad is a Founder and CEO at DeFiHelper, and a CTO at BondAppetit. The team also includes 8 developers, 2 underwriters/credit officers, 2 bookkeepers/portfolio managers and is supported by a 40-strong team at the origination partner (covering origination, packaging, underwriting and collection management functions). 15. Provide detailed summary of the proposed economic terms of the transaction, including, without limitation, commitment term, principal amount, interest rate, frequency of principal and interest payments, disbursement schedule, equity amount, funding ratios (equity/debt pro rata, equity first, etc.), collateral security, coverage ratios, currency (if not DAI) and other material terms. The quality of the proposed economic terms will be a consideration for the prioritization process. We propose the following key terms for the Kredika vault in Maker DAO:     Dimension Request     Size Initial Amount: USD 25M. 3 months: Additional USD +25M = Total 50M USD. 6 months: Additional USD +50M = Total 100M USD   Collateralization Ratio 90% loan-to-value of the loan portfolio, 67.5% loan-to-value of the property collateral. (see Section 2 of this MIP)   Stability Fee 2%. This stability fee would make the overall cost of funding via an MD vault comparable to the cost of senior funding in the TradFi world. YesGrowth currently funds a similar loan portfolio at the same LTVs at 4%. Transaction costs of borrowing and converting DAI amount to roughly 1% with the costs of setting up and maintaining the legal structure amount to another 1+% per annum assuming we utilise a \u00a3100m vault.   Legal Structure Kredika token is an ERC-20 token issued in compliance with Swiss law by Kredika Switzerland, a Swiss SPV and encapsulating claim over the UK SPV holding a portfolio of loans secured by UK properties. See Section 13 for the Legal Structure   Collateral UK-based diversified portfolio of property-secured loans   Credit Protection Maximum Loan to Real Estate Value 75%. Of the 75% Loan: 10% provided by Junior Credit fund: CB Growth Fund Limited (\u2018CBGF\u2019), 90% provided via MakerDAO Vault. First charge over UK property secured loans   Borrower Credit Box Property-backed loans of between 6 to 18 months; Maximum MD Vault exposure circa 67.5% of the property collateral value; All loans are secured by first charges over UK property; Collateral value confirmed by third-party professional valuers/surveyors (RICS); Due diligence carried out on every loan by Yes Growth Ltd which has over 5 years experience of property-backed (real estate) lending for clients with zero capital losses.   Portfolio Construction Broad geographical spread across the UK; Loan sizes between \u00a3250,000 GBP and \u00a31,500,000; Max amount per loan: GBP 1,500,000 GBP; Loans will typically be short term (up to 24 months) bridging loans, for example for a borrower to purchase and refurbish a property and sell on or let and remortgage    16. Identify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address, without limitation and to the extent relevant, market risks, commercial risks (e.g., diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc. Legal risks: notwithstanding anything said in this MIP (and based on the legal opinion provided by the lawyers in Switzerland) we acknowledge that there might be risks related to the legal and regulatory treatment of the Kredika token. The relevant authorities may claim that the token shall be deemed to be a financial instrument and regulatory requirements of the financial market shall apply. Tax risks: There is a small risk that the tokens will fall under Deemed Swiss bonds qualification, which would attract a 1% Bond Issuance Stamp Tax and 35% withholding tax on interest (and potentially stability fee) paid. This risk is however minimal since the tokens are self-issued and are not offered to the public. We will seek tax ruling from Swiss authorities on the tax treatment of the entire structure before issuing the first tokens. Infrastructure risk: notwithstanding the arrangements and discussions with the banking provider we believe that it is reasonable to mention the risks related to banks as based on the internal risk policy bank may refuse to handle the DAI-GBP exchange or transfer of funds between the SPVs. We consider this risk as very low as we have already presented the structure and funds flow to the bank. FX risk: Loans in the portfolio are denominated in GBP whereas borrowing in DAI is pegged to USD therefore there is a risk of collateral value deteriorating in case GBP devalues against the USD over the lifetime of the vault. Managing FX risk is not new to YesGrowth as some of the funding for existing books came from international institutions and was denominated in USD and EUR. YesGrowth uses a number of counterparties to hedge FX risk through the use of FX derivatives. Credit risks: individual borrowers may not repay their loans to the UK SPV. In this scenario, UK SPV will engage its security agent (YesGrowth, an FCA-regulated portfolio manager) to enforce the security under the loan, i.e. take ownership of the property provided as collateral under the loan agreement and liquidate it in the open market. Due to collateral value being significantly higher than the loan amount, and general stability and liquidity of the UK property market, the risk of not recovering loan principal amount is extremely low as evidenced by track record of the existing portfolio - zero capital losses on \u00a3223 million disbursed. Credit risk is further reduced through diversification - individual loans will not exceed two percent of the target portfolio size (\u00a3100 million for the first vault). Interest rate risks - none. The loans are disbursed at fixed interest rates. 17. Outline the applicant\u2019s underwriting guidelines/policies, origination strategy (marketing, sales, channels), servicing strategy (charge-offs, collections) and historical asset performance. Provided in Appendix [1] to this application. 18. Outline the applicant\u2019s risk monitoring and operations guidelines/policies (e.g. charge-offs, collection, recovery provisions, data collection and technology, etc). Provided in Appendix [1] to this application. 19. Describe the regulatory regime applicable to the underlying asset (if any) and the applicant\u2019s legal and compliance program relating thereto. Loans to limited companies and limited partnerships in the UK are not regulated. The debt relationships between UK (borrower) and Swiss SPVs are based on loan agreements which are also secured by business loan agreements granted by the UK SPV to borrowers located in the UK and secured by charges over UK based real estate assets. There also will be an agreement between UK SPV, Swiss SPV and YesGrowth as a regulated security agent, which will ensure that the rights of Swiss SPV are protected. The loan between UK SPV and Swiss SPV shall be considered as \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d, thus no licensing or regulatory requirements shall apply. The part of the project related to tokenization of the claim itself shall be considered separately. The rights under the loan agreement (with the applicable law being Swiss law) between the UK SPV and the Swiss SPV will be encapsulated into the tokens by making specific reference to the loan agreement between the UK SPV and the Swiss SPV, the reference will be arranged by hash establishing the connection between the tokens and the mentioned loan agreement. Additionally, the parties of the loan agreement will indicate the tokenization aspect in the loan agreement itself in order to ensure that the rights against UK SPV are enforceable. The tokens from the regulatory standpoint shall be recognized as negotiable securities. Swiss laws allow issuing uncertificated securities, i.e. securities in a dematerialized form including issued as tokens. For regulatory purposes, uncertificated securities will be self-issued (meaning that the title over the securities will be with the issuer) and MakerDAO will hold the pledge over the tokens. Given that tokens will not be offered to the public, no regulatory approvals or licences of financial intermediaries will be required. Prospectus obligations also should not be applicable in respect of the issued token as there are certain exceptions under Swiss law allowing the issuer not to prepare and approve the prospectus with the regulator. Instead of the prospectus, the issuer will prepare and publish an investment memorandum indicating the set of rights and obligations attached to the tokens. 20. Identify any 3rd party persons likely to be relied upon by applicant to implement the transaction (legal, accounting, servicers, trustees, etc.) A Swiss bank - banking relationship for converting DAI into GBP and effecting both GBP and DAI transfers between the Swiss SPV and the UK SPVs. Bonnard Lawson - Swiss law firm providing legal and tax advice on the Swiss part of the structure and issuance of Kredika tokens. UK law firm \u2013 to be appointed. UK Trust for SPV ownership \u2013 to be appointed. Cross Border Growth Fund - a fund regulated in Mauritius and reporting to the FCA in the UK, which will provide junior capital in the transaction.

The 4% example is an all-in GBP cost from an existing senior facility obtained from a bank against similar collateral (UK property-backed loan portfolio) with the same credit enhancement: 75% LTV on individual loans plus 10% junior capital on a portfolio level. If Maker provides senior funding for this first vault at 2%, we would probably be in a slightly worse position cost-wise considering all the set-up, conversion, and hedging costs, but we are in it for the long haul: once we test and finetune our platform with this first vault, we hope to open it up to larger asset managers, grow volumes, and hopefully become one of the arrangers for MD for onboarding RWA in a sustainable and compliant manner.

First of all I would like to emphasize that BA is a separate project and with the Kredica we\u2019re using part of the technology stack and of course the priceless experience that was recieved with the BA. BA is still on the MVP stage and from a technology and operations perspective it works perfectly fine, the major issue is go2market strategy and solid usecase for the new stablecoin. Initially we were relying on a few potential partnerships that was intended to solve this issue, but to the moment it\u2019s still pending. Every issued USDap is backed by the corresponding amount of bonds - from this point of view, USDap is pretty viable as a stablecoin. The major reason for depeg is a pretty tiny market with a few large holders that don\u2019t allow standard arbitrage mechanics. In a few weeks, we\u2019re planning to launch a redemption option that would allow users to receive fiat against USDap on 1on1 ratio. ",

                    "content": "Hello @flipflopflapdelegate, and thank you!  Let me pick up on the first half of your question relating to the assets.  For this first vault, we are looking to finance a portfolio of short-term (12-24 month) property-backed loans (a.k.a. bridge loans) rather than mortgages, which would typically have much longer maturities.  The bridge loans are usually provided against properties purchased for business purposes (e.g. light refurbishment and sale or refinance into a buy-to-let rather than prime residences) at lower LTVs (60-80%). These loans are much easier to enforce in the UK and taking ownership of the collateral in case of the borrower\u2019s default is a robust and straightforward process.  Furthermore, due to their short term, bridge loans are less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations and long-term property price movements.  Yes Growth has a successful auditable track record of originating and managing a portfolio of such loans in the last 7 years through quite some turbulence.  We would be happy to share the data with the RWF unit and other relevant parties.  We have the team, system, credt policy, processes and origination partnerships in place ready to build up this book in a timely and controlled manner. Some of the existing book can be put into the structure on \u201cday one\u201d to accelerate the ramp-up if required. With regard to the interest rate risk specifically, our product is fixed-rate, our junior funding is fixed-rate as well, so provided we have a fixed stability fee on the vault, we are not running a significant IR risk. FX risk is another matter as our portfolio is in GBP, but we do have hedging partnerships in place, which we used for our TradFi credit lines denominated in USD and EUR. ",

Furthermore each loan and collateral will be vetted and (where applicable) monitored by independent parties (oracles) responsible for different aspects of the lending process:  law firm confirming validity and completeness of the documentation, surveyor confirming the state of the collateral, open banking data  confirming the movement of funds, etc.  All these checks and approvals will be reflected on the platform giving senior and junior lenders visibility into the quality of the onboarded RWA collateral as well as its ongoing performance and value. Junior capital provider Cross Border Growth Fund (a self-managed fund) will take the 10% first loss position. They will make their own investment decision based on the recommendation from Yes Growth and in any case before the loan is fully approved and any DAI is drawn from the vault. In future, as Kredika platform develops, we will hopefully add other asset managers, products, senior and junior capital providers, and oracles creating an inclusive compliant platform for tokenising and onboarding RWA to Maker DAO vaults.

Thank you in advance.     max.chmyshuk:  For this first vault, we are looking to finance a portfolio of short-term (12-24 month) property-backed loans (a.k.a. bridge loans) rather than mortgages, which would typically have much longer maturities. The bridge loans are usually provided against properties purchased for business purposes (e.g. light refurbishment and sale or refinance into a buy-to-let rather than prime residences) at lower LTVs (60-80%).   Thank you for providing more clarity. Personally I did admittedly misread the title indicating that these are bridge loans\u2013sorry about that. Typically in my neck-of-the-woods, bridge loans are short-term (as you described) and they range from prime rate (4%) to north of 9% to 10% in the United States. Looking at your-neck-of-the woods, its currently 2% in the UK. Can you please provide at what rate bridge loans in the areas you\u2019re looking to service top-out at?     max.chmyshuk:  We would be happy to share the data with the RWF unit and other relevant parties. We have the team, system, credt policy, processes and origination partnerships in place ready to build up this book in a timely and controlled manner. Some of the existing book can be put into the structure on \u201cday one\u201d to accelerate the ramp-up if required.   Has this data been shared with the RWF team?     max.chmyshuk:  With regard to the interest rate risk specifically, our product is fixed-rate, our junior funding is fixed-rate as well, so provided we have a fixed stability fee on the vault, we are not running a significant IR risk. FX risk is another matter as our portfolio is in GBP, but we do have hedging partnerships in place, which we used for our TradFi credit lines denominated in USD and EUR.   Interesting enough makerDAO has a Core Unit called @Deco-Core-Unit that\u2019s working on implementing fix-rate vaults. And glad to hear you have an FX hedging strategy in place and it can be review by the RWF CU.     max.chmyshuk:  Junior capital provider Cross Border Growth Fund (a self-managed fund) will take the 10% first loss position. They will make their own investment decision based on the recommendation from Yes Growth and in any case before the loan is fully approved and any DAI is drawn from the vault.   What is the composition of the first loss position? Does it have elements/tranches of mezzanine debt, cash flow loans, secured term debt, etc. And since these are bridge loans to properties for business purposes and not mortgages\u2013can the Orderly Liquidation Value (OLV) be raised to 20% first loss?

Property secured bridge loans in the UK are primarily provided by funds and alternative lenders rather than high-street banks. The rates depend on risk levels and typically range from 6% to 14%.  We operate in the 8-10% range with up to 75% LTV.  There are some offerings on the market at cheaper rates (e.g. 5%) but for much lower LTVs (40%).

Junior debt is structured as a subordinated credit facility provided by Cross Border Growth Fund (CBGF) to the UK SPV in the amount equal to the 10% of the total loans deployed. This is actually a second line of defence for Maker DAO as each loan in the UK SPV is already secured by a property at 75% LTV or lower and is highly likely to recover full principal in case of a default under the loan.   Please refer to the diagram in Section 2 of the MIP where we provide an example of Maker DAO lending \u00a3675,000 against the property value of \u00a31,000,000. This 67.5% overall LTV is achieved by a combination of the 75% LTV on the loans and the 10% further credit enhancement through CBGF\u2019s first loss position. We look forward to speaking on Wednesday. ",

                    "content": "Dear Code Knight, Thank you for your question. I believe that in order to achieve its objectives of scale and stability, it is in Maker DAO\u2019s interest to create a very well diversified collateral portfolio underpinning DAI. That way DAI peg stability would not be vulnerable to adverse events on individual markets  - be it crypto, German equities, or Swiss bonds. We are not suggesting that Maker goes all in on Kredika, and  there should not be a need to choose between investing in US Treasuries vs. providing senior funding to us.  We hope to be one of many sources of RWA collateral for Maker as it grows. UK property (real estate) market has shown great resilience throughout its history including Brexit and COVID recently.  We provide a well-structured and compliant mechanism for Maker to scale through adding loan portfolios secured by the UK property where Maker vault would only fund 67.5% of the underlying property value in a super-senior position. The first and second loss positions will be essentially with the borrower (first 25% - because we would only lend up to 75% of property value) and the junior lender (10% of required funding) respectively.  This is a very secure position for Maker and is not particularly correlated to the US government debt as well as many other risk assets. Yes Growth, an FCA regulated portfolio manager who will build and run this portfolio on Kredika platform has been lending in the UK short-term property-backed space since 2018 with over \u00a3300 million deployed in loans with zero loss of capital and interest even through COVID. Currently, these lending activities are funded by a bank in a very similar structure (but without tikenisation part of course). We are therefore bringing a bankable transaction, not a speculative trade. The cost of the senior tranche from a bank would be very comparable to the cost of borrowing DAI from Maker and converting to GBP and back. There are other features of the Kredika platform that enhance transparency and auditability of collateral value we described in our MIP (like independent third party oracles - regulated law firms, property surveyors, bank data), which make us believe this is a right type of collateral, legal structure and technology for Maker to onboard.  Happy to discuss further here or on the call. ",

If not able to, are the assets being mark to market?   There are three types of oracles on Kredika:  Oracles sourcing independent open data that exists and can be accessed regardless of the lending transaction happening or not, e.g. land registry, companies house, credit reference agencies; Oracles sourcing independent third-party data relating to the transaction - confirming whether the obligations documented in the loan agreement and encoded into the respective smart contract are actually being met. The best example here is the scheduled interest payments obtained through open banking.  By comparing third-party payment data to the terms&conditions, the platform can determine whether the loan has been disbursed in the first place and whether it is being serviced according to its payment schedule. Service Provider Oracles: these are operated under contracts by licensed firms (law firms, property surveyors, chartered accountants, auditors) that put their reputation, livelihood and even existence on the line when making representations with regards to the status of collateral, documentation, accounts&audits, etc. These companies usually have professional indemnity insurance in place as well. The data will be compiled into dashboards and also fed into the mark-to-market calculations ultimately controlling the supply and value of Kredika tokens passed to MD. The first two types of oracles can and will be decentralised / automated in due course as they are essentially APIs to third-party \u201csources of truth\u201d.  With the third one \u2013 we\u2019d need to look into developing further control mechanisms if deemed necessary, but the nature of data provided here requires a legal or natural person to be responsible for it. The key here is that MD does not need to trust the asset manager/originator to tell the community whether a particular loan is 100% on track, but instead has direct access to  the third-party \u201cgreen lights\u201d during an approval process and any \u201cred flags\u201d raised against the deal during its life. In that sense, Kredika makes the asset management process more transparent and decentralised.  ",

The \u201ctokenization\u201d of the loan agreement between Loan Book SPV (UK) and Issuing SPV (Swiss) in the form of an ERC-20 token is interesting and may be worth further exploration. How Maker liquidates such ERC-20 token and in return for what is another question, but this question arises in nearly all real world assets. LTS will need to better understand how Maker, as holder of the Kredika token, then interfaces with Issuing SPV (Swiss). The same question applies in respect of the \u201ctri-party Deed of Subordination\u201d. These are standard diligence questions. Kredika\u2019s proposal for independent oracles is a useful addition and may be worth exploring \u2026 both from the perspective of independent confirmation of the assets in the underlying loan pool and the on-going status of the loans. For instance, the \u201cOpen Banking Oracle\u201d would, in my mind, be a useful technology piece for many transactions. LTS will defer to @collateral-core-unit as to any technology issues. Incubating LTS will defer to @Real-World-Finance on the credit, underwriting approach, over-collateralization ratios, and initial counterparty review (Yes Growth experience, team, etc). Incubating LTS does note that a \u00a3100M vault is a measurable upsizing of Yes Growth\u2019s current portfolio (\u00a3250M). LTS does note that the FX risk will need to be further explored and understood. From an LTS perspective, any Kredika transaction will probably require considerable time to diligence and implement. However, the time to diligence and implement may be partially mitigated by the completeness of Krediak\u2019s responses and a high-level of professional interaction with the applicable core units.

                    "content": "Hello Christian, Thank you very much for looking at Kredika. We are happy to share with you a write-up on the legal and regulatory treatment of the tokens. With regard to the recovery process:  The first line of defence for Maker DAO lies with the UK SPV and the real-world legal charge enforcement process. If an individual loan in the UK SPV\u2019s book goes into default, the security agent for the SPV will enforce the legal charge over the property, take possession and sell it via auctions. Given the 75% LTV, full recovery of loan principal and interest is very likely. Even if we have to sell at 10-15% discount to market value, we still have enough to satisfy the claim. The second line of defence is the senior-junior funding structure on the UK SPV level with the junior lender absorbing the first 10% of the loss on the loan portfolio. This only ever gets triggered if the SPV is not able to recover value under multiple defaulted loans, which in itself is very unlikely. The key documents solidifying Maker\u2019s position here will be:  Senior secured loan agreement between the Swiss SPV and the UK SPV including a full legal charge over all UK SPV\u2019s assets. Junior loan agreement between the Junior lender (CBG Fund) and the UK SPV Deed of Subordination establishing the seniority of the Swiss SPV\u2019s claim and the rules of engagement in the event of default. Essentially the Swiss SPV can take control over the portfolio of loans, cash, and other UK SPV\u2019s assets in case of its default, sell the book or run it down to satisfy its senior claim before passing the balance to the junior lender.   The third line of defence, as you rightly noted, will be in establishing a clear process for Maker DAO\u2019s interaction with the Swiss SPV as the issuer of Kredika token. There are different ways how this can be structured, but they would all have a few common themes:  MD as a Kredika token holder will become the beneficiary of all assets and receivables of the Swiss SPV. Under normal circumstances, the Swiss SPV\u2019s only asset is the claim under the loan agreement with the UK SPV mentioned above. MD can choose to:  Sell the tokens to another investor and step out of the deal completely Hold on to them and delegate the running down of the entire structure over the course of the following 12-18 months collecting interest and principal payments as they come until its claim is satisfied. Here MD would be interacting with the trustees and directors of the Swiss SPV \u2013 independent professional service providers specialising in managing securitisations and similar orphan structures. We have a few ideas on how make this process work with Maker DAO\u2019s governance mechanism and are happy to work with core units on the legal and technical aspects when the time is right.      With regard to FX risk, there is a liquid market for GBP-USD forwards and swaps, so we do not envisage difficulties in setting up and dynamically managing the hedge. The cost is of course another matter and we are accounting for that in our pricing expectations. I would like to note that Yes Growth has experience in managing non-GBP denominated senior facilities funding GBP portfolios and hedging FX exposure. This is also something I was involved in as part of my earlier career in structured finance. We will need to choose the right link in the chain to take on and manage the risk \u2013 either on the UK (most likely) or on the Swiss SPV level. Something to look at during the post-community approval DD phase. We agree that implementing the structure and making it work will take time and effort. From our side, we are very committed to professional and thoughtful interaction with all relevant core units and teams within the Maker ecosystem. ",

(Collateral Onboarding Call #44 | Kredika AMA) You can meet the management team behind Kredika, hear about our vision and plans for building a platform for transparent and compliant onboarding of the real-world assets (RWA) on Maker DAO, learn about Yes Growth, an FCA-regulated UK investment and portfolio manager behind the first \u00a3100m vault application from us, and hear us answering questions about different aspects of the project. We strongly believe that for Maker DAO to maintain its leading position in the asset-backed stablecoin race while maintaining the stability of peg for DAI and sustainable economics for MKR, it is important to create mechanisms for onboarding large volumes of well-diversified collateral, including overcollateralised portfolios of RWAs across markets, geographies, and asset types. We are asking for a green light to work with Maker core teams on making this happen in a staged process. Our plan in summary is:  for Stage 1, to bring one of the safest asset classes (diversified portfolios of short-term UK property-backed loans) into the first \u00a3100m vault managed by a regulated portfolio manager, implement a robust legal structure designed with the UK and Swiss lawyers and wrapped into a tech solution allowing for transparent and partially decentralised collateral management, use this portfolio to develop and optimise all the necessary tech modules, processes, uncover and address \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d, demonstrate the performance and importantly prepare for Stage 2. Stage 2 \u2013 to open the platform to established institutional asset managers interested in leveraging performing RWA portfolios.  The main idea is to give the managers operating in the traditional finance space a solution that would be intuitive to them and compatible with the regulated environment they live in on one hand, and seamlessly work with Maker DAO on the other.  This would allow Maker to scale up rapidly but in a controlled manner being able to pick and choose best products, managers, security structures, monitor performance on the individual asset and portfolio basis supported by relevant information from independent oracles. Our proposal is currently active on the voting portal (https://vote.makerdao.com/polling). We are happy to answer any additional questions directly or through the forum and sincerely hope that we could take this project forward with Maker DAO.  Please vote for us! )  ",

To address your concern, we are open to discussing economic terms on the vault and we fully expect such discussions to happen with the RWF unit once they study our track record, credit policy and process, management controls, and dd the legal structure properly.  We derive the rate by looking at where real-world institutions would price a senior secured facility collateralised by a portfolio of well-collateralised loans. Another good reference point would be senior tranches of property backed loan portfolio securitisaitons.  Additionally, we have to consider costs of conversion from DAI to GBP and back, FX hedge costs, service providers charges (e.g. independent trustees and directors for SPVs) and cost of junior capital taking the first loss. We are not really making money on this vault. Our game is long as outlined in my previous post. We hope to build something great and scalable for Maker and help to keep it in the lead in the years to come. ",

The Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE - currently in incubation) has reviewed the information provided here as well as in your recent AMA and feel this is an interesting opportunity to potentially expand Maker\u2019s push into Real-World Asset lending. Tokenized off-chain loan contracts backed by hard assets (real estate) presents an especially unique collateral type. We see many potentially value-adding attributes in Kredika, including overcollateralized hard asset lending, short term real-world loans, multiple distribution channels, and an experienced team to name a few. We are very interested and endeavor to proceed as appropriate with the request following a more thorough analysis and assessment. However, as exciting an opportunity as this may be, we do not feel we have enough information nor have we spent enough time discussing directly with the Kredika team in order to make a recommendation at this stage. If the support of LOVE, as well as RWF, is considered valuable by the team, we would kindly ask that you go back following the methodology and process of submission that has been approved within MIP67: Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions. Per its definition, MIP67 outlines \u201cthe methodology and high-level process to evaluate structured finance transactions made under the MIP6 application process\u201d. MIP67 is specifically tailored to real-world asset companies and provides Maker\u2019s Real World Asset Core Unit with the information needed to fully analyze an opportunity.

                    "content": "Dear @August , @luca_pro , We prepared all the answers for the MIP67 questions some time ago.  I am posting them below for the community\u2019s benefit and will also email them to the members of the RWF unit we have been in touch with. We have a legal opinion on the structure and will share it with the relevant units as well, however we are not at liberty to publish it openly here. We are very happy to engage with relevant teams and in fact had a call with the RWF team in early mid-April. Our understanding was that MIP6 submission was a clear next step and that was what we did. Answers to MIP67 questions: Is the asset tokenized, if so, which standard does it conform to, and on which blockchain infrastructure is it deployed? Kredika token is an ERC-20 token issued on the Etherium mainnet  by Kredika Switzerland, a Swiss Special Puprose Vehicle (SPV) and will be delivered into Maker DAO vault by the issuer as collateral. From legal and regulatory perspective, Kredika token is recognised as a self-issued uncertificated negotiable security under the Swiss law and encapsulates the claim under a senior secured loan facility from Kredika Switzerland to Kredika UK, a UK SPV (the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d). The Loan Facility underlying the token is provided for the purposes of funding a portfolio of RWA and is secured by a floating charge over the UK SPV\u2019s assets \u2013a highly diversified portfolio of 12-18 month bridging loans to UK SME borrowers in turn secured by UK properties. Kredika token holder therefore has a strong verifiable legal recourse to three layers of underlying claims:  the credit-enhanced senior claim under the Loan Facility (90% LTV); the charge over the underlying portfolio of secured bridge loans; and the properties provided as security for the individual bridge loans. In each loan, the value of the property is at least 33% higher than the loan amount.  For the first implementation of the Kredika platform and minting of Kredika tokens, Kredika intends to use BondAppetit\u2019s audited smart contracts as a technological basis for managing RWA collateral and reporting its value to Maker DAO. Two main contracts are:  a depository contract used to create and manage representation of individual loans and property collateral in the portfolio, and an issuer contract controlling the supply of Kredika ERC-20 tokens as well as calculating and reporting their value to Maker DAO in order to ensure appropriate collateralisation levels are maintained.  Kredika\u2019s smart contracts are written in Solidity language, allowing the protocol to be deployed on any EVM-compatible blockchain, such as Optimism or Polygon, to minimize maintenance costs. In future development, we are looking at on-chain representation of individual loans on Kredika platform, which could be structured as a permission-based private Etherium sidechain or deployed on other EVM-compatible blockchains. Can the total supply be updated? If so, how? The total supply of Kredika ERC-20 token can only be updated when: a)\tapproved loans are added to the UK SPV\u2019s portfolio and UK SPV borrows more senior secured debt from the Swiss SPV. The Swiss SPV will then mint additional Kredika tokens, deliver them in the vault and mint DAI against this new collateral. b)\tsome or all of the loans in the UK SPV portfolio are redeemed, the Loan Facility is partially or fully repaid to the Swiss SPV, which converts GBP into DAI and delivers into the vault. Some or all of Kredika tokens are then released and burnt by the Issuer \u2013 the Swiss SPV. c)\tUK SPV faces a default, which it will cure through the sale of the properties pledged against the defaulted loans at no more than 75% LTV. YesGrowth acting as a security agent for the UK SPV will enforce the charge over property and sell it in the open market. Proceeds will be used to partially repay the Loan Facility, convert GBP into DAI and deliver into the vault in order to release some Kredika tokens for burning. In a highly unlikely event, the property sale does not recover the principal of the loan, first 10% losses on the portfolio are absorbed by a junior debt provider. We believe it is extremely important for a good RWA platform to regularly report an up-to-date status and value of the collateral to MD in the most transparent manner possible. Such an approach is inherently difficult with non-tradable loans, however Kredika\u2019s reporting process is by design much more robust and less susceptible to individual party\u2019s manipulation thanks to the following features:  Each individual loan in the UK SPV\u2019s portfolio is added to the loan collateral pool and tracked by using a depository smart contract upon approval by multiple independent parties, potentially including a Maker DAO core unit. Multiple independent oracles (real-world sources of truth about the status and performance of the loans), most of which are regulated entities (law firms, chartered surveyors, banks, asset managers) reporting regularly to the depository contract. When establishing relationships with the service providers acting as Oracles, we will formalise their obligations for regular reporting.  Depository contract will automatically update the value of the collateral (individual loans as smart contracts) based on the content and time stamp of the latest oracle reports. The Maker DAO pricing oracle will be able to get the real-time value of the collateral portfolio and automatically control the amount of DAI available for minting in Kredika vault. Is the asset controlled by a central actor or group? Kredika tokens locked in the Maker DAO vault will be recognized as self-issued uncertificated negotiable securities under the Swiss law (see Section 11 of the MIP). The tokens will be issued by a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Switzerland (Swiss SPV) and pledged into the vault. Legally the tokens encapsulate the claim of the Swiss SPV against the UK SPV under a senior loan agreement secured by the portfolio of bridging loans secured by first legal charges over the real estate assets pledged as collateral under the individual loan agreements. It is envisaged that both Swiss SPV and UK SPV will be managed by independent trustees / directors and will appoint YesGrowth, a UK-based FCA-regulated firm, as their security agent for the purpose of enforcing and realising collateral in case of defaults. Given the above, it should be noted that different parts of the structure are controlled by different entities and independent directors fulfilling control functions: \u25cf\tcharges over the real estate assets pledged by the borrowers under the individual loan agreements - are controlled by the UKSPV and its trustees; \u25cf\tclaims under the loan agreement between the Swiss SPV and the UK SPV - controlled by the Swiss SPV as the lender and its directors/trustees; \u25cf\tthe token being self-issued uncertificated security and pledged to the vault - from the legal standpoint is owned by the Swiss SPV but legally pledged to Maker DAO and locked in the vault limiting its further circulation. Can balances be arbitrarily modified by a central actor or group? Kredika plans to use BondAppetit infrastructure, which means that the governance model embedded in BondAppetit will be in place. BondAppetit uses a standard Compound governance contract so governance token holders have an opportunity to vote for different decisions that can affect the protocol. Issuance of the new Kredika tokens is possible only if a sufficient amount of underlying collateral is in place and all additional requirements (like audit reports, surveyors reports etc) are met. Does the asset have KYC requirements? According to the legal opinion we received from a law firm in Switzerland, Kredika tokens should be recognised as negotiable securities (papier-valeur) under Article 965 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (\u201cCO\u201d),  and ledger-based securities (droits-valeurs inscrits) under Article 973d of the CO. Under FINMA regulations, Kredika tokens will likely be recognised as self-issued uncertificated securities and given they will be locked in the Maker DAO vault as collateral without being offered to the public or traded in the secondary markets, their issuance under Swiss laws is unregulated from a financial markets law perspective and is subject to private law. Considering that there is no distribution of the token to the market no KYC requirements should apply. A loan agreement between Swiss SPV and UK SPV is not regulated as a bilateral business-to-business loan agreement. Given this fact and the fact that the entities are not financial institutions, no KYC requirements will be applicable. However, it should be noted that the KYC procedure on both SPVs will be handled by Signum Bank AG for the purposes of DAI-GBP exchange transactions. It is also worth mentioning that Yes Growth LTD as the FCA-regulated business conducts full KYC in respect of the borrowers. Does price feeds or market data for the asset exist? List any possible oracle data sources: \u2022 Law firm involved in documentation of the loan, checking the availability, clean title, and status of the collateral. Law firms are usually licensed and their representations of the validity of the executed loan documentation will be a requirement for the loan\u2019s eligibility as collateral. \u2022 Surveyor/Valuer - a company valuing and checking the physical condition of the property, which is pledged as collateral in the individual loans granted by the UK SPV.  Surveyors are regulated individuals or entities in the UK adhering to established standards. Surveyors are involved in the valuation and ongoing monitoring/revaluation of property collateral in all TradFi structures. \u2022 OpenBanking Oracle - an API directly to the bank account of the lending SPV or Asset Manager confirming disbursement of the loans as well as servicing and repayment. When data from Openbanking Oracle is compared to the Asset Manager\u2019s data, loan delinquencies, prepayments and other irregularities are flagged that affect the value of the collateral. \u2022 Other Oracles - other sources of truth will be added in future further enhancing transparency of the collateral portfolio. How can the asset be sold in case of a liquidation? Individual borrowers may not repay their loans to the UK SPV. In this scenario, UK SPV will engage its security agent (YesGrowth, an FCA-regulated portfolio manager) to enforce the collateral under the loan, i.e. take ownership of the property provided as collateral under the loan agreement and liquidate it in the open market.  Due to the collateral value being at least 25% higher than the total loan amount, and the general stability and liquidity of the UK property market, the risk of not recovering the loan principal amount is extremely low as evidenced by a track record of the existing portfolio - zero capital losses on \u00a3223 million disbursed. There is a further credit enhancement provided on the Senior Facility level of MakerDao where 10% of the loan portfolio of the UK SPV will be funded by a junior loan facility from a partner fund. Therefore Maker DAO is explicitly protected from the 10% first loss on the loan portfolio. Credit risk is further reduced through a high level of diversification - individual loans will not exceed two percent of the target portfolio size (\u00a3100 million for the first vault). Interest rate risks \u2013 lowered as the majority of loans are disbursed at fixed interest rate with interest paid upfront and stored in a segregated account with the lender (UK SPV). ",

As you might know, Lending Oversight (if voted in during the current voting cycle) intends to:  Provide a second opinion on the risk assessment completed by RWF-001 Help the counterparty and RWF to structure the best possible deal to bring forward to the token holders Make sure that no gate-keeping or any preferential treatment is applied to the counterparty by other Core Units  We have not received nor reviewed a complete risk assessment of the opportunity by @williamr and RWF-001, hence we don\u2019t have the ability to complete a second opinion on it. In case the result of the ongoing Greenlight Poll will be positive, the Core Units will have received a strong indication of prioritisation for the onboarding of the collateral. In case the result has been negative but you believe that something more should have been done by RWF and other core units, or that MKR holders haven\u2019t received a fair representation of the opportunity, please feel free to contact me directly here on the Forum and we can arrange a call to understand how things can be improved for future interactions. I hope this has been helpful, regards, Luca ",
