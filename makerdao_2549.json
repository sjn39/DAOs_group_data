USDC-A debt ceiling to be increased from 80 to 140 million. USDC-B debt ceiling to be increased from 10 to 30 million. W-BTC debt ceiling to be increased from 20 to 40 million. BAT debt ceiling to be increased from 3 to 5 million.  Additionally, there was a discussion to continue to go straight to executive votes for further increases should the above amounts prove to be insufficient. ",

Increasing the ETH-A debt ceiling could have slight effects to restore the peg right now, but increasing USDC-A debt ceiling and W-BTC debt ceiling could have some more immediate results (Bitcoin holders want to have a slice of DEFI, and W-BTC brings that, USDC-A permits to do 10x leverage right now, if we see those Vaults growing too fast, that would be a very likely reason, and it will have immediate effects in DAI price). Increasing ETH-A debt ceiling gives less immediate result, but it will help (and it is needed) for the next weeks (probably) I\u2019m not sure @bit if there were 2 people only in the meeting, as far as I know, there was a notification here in the forum for anyone who wanted to participate to be able to (or wasn\u2019t it for every one?). And the decisions taken and the current executive action aligns a lot with what I consider the best we could do to restore the peg this week (and not having to wait 1 month to take the decision on some complex schema while the DAI value grows higher and higher). My vote for this executive vote is YES. ",

There were quite a few people in the meeting also, much more than 2, but I understand the point you\u2019re making.That said anyone was welcome to join the meeting. The reason this swift action was taken is because the price of dai broke through 1.035 today, after being fairly close to peg just a few days ago. We are trying to prevent emergency shutdown rn as the current demand situation becomes more difficult to deal with every day. No one wants a large percent of dai supply collateralized by usdc over the long term, but increasingly it is seeming like this is necessary in the short term. ",

With yields on savings accounts and government bonds at record lows, earning rewards on stablecoins like Dai and USDC stands out as an alternative way to passively generate income using crypto held on Coinbase.   I assume they are trying to compete with DeFi systems for deposits. I would expect other centralized exchanges to follow suit.  We\u2019re going to need more DAI.     ",
