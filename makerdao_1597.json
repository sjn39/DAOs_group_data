I am specifically interested in DeFi, decentralized governance, and the broader regulatory paradigm for emerging technologies. \u2022\tFrom private practice, I have experience advising large corporates and organizations about a range of strategy and legal issues relating to technology. I am a problem solver by trade and a moderate by temperament. \u2022\tI am a long-term small MKR holder, having watched the project evolve since 2019. I deeply care about Maker, and believe in its potential to sit at the heart of a thriving DeFi ecosystem. I want to dedicate my time, knowledge and skills to help bring that vision about.  My Values and Priorities  An emphasis on long-term strategy and growth. \u2022\tMaker is at a critical juncture. There is a real opportunity in this market to cement DAI\u2019s place as the leading decentralized stablecoin, and Maker\u2019s place as the standard-setting protocol in DeFi. Given the huge scale of that opportunity, I believe that Maker should keep the big picture in mind and double down on growth. \u2022\tGrowth does not and should not mean the wanton squandering of resources during a bear market. Instead, it looks like Maker proactively developing internal capabilities and external integrations. It looks like generating revenue from idle assets by monetizing our balance sheet, continuing with the work of relationship-building with top-tier RWA partners, and taking early market share on L2s like StarkNet, Optimism and Arbitrum. \u2022\tOne of my motivators for becoming a Recognized Delegate is to combat the myopia that tends to pervade the crypto world during a bear market. It always bears repeating that the TAM for Maker is ridiculously large. To capture that opportunity and maximise value for MKR holders, we must continue building, scaling, and hardening the protocol with an eye to the future.  Improving governance and organizational decision-making. \u2022\tWhile Maker is light years ahead of other DAOs, we have a long way to go to build a truly effective organization and governance system. As others have variously pointed out, we have several structural issues at Maker: a lack of cohesive strategy, too much complexity, broad apathy on the part of MKR holders, etc. \u2022\tI support shrinking the governance footprint, particularly with smaller MKR holders in mind. It is self-evidently impossible for most MKR holders to keep up with the forum, let alone make informed decisions on complex governance decisions. The spiral of complexity also makes it harder for delegates to effectively size and weigh decisions, and for other stakeholders to understand how Maker works. I welcome initiatives like this recent proposal from SES, for instance, to help combat these problems. \u2022\tBalancing meaningful decentralization with operational effectiveness is in many ways Maker\u2019s primary challenge. These are difficult questions, particularly in a complicated protocol like Maker, and I do not think that one-dimensional or maximalist perspectives help resolve them. We have lessons to learn from the corporate governance literature, and things to figure out on our own about how to craft the right incentives for effective decentralized governance.  Providing an independent voice and fact-based scrutiny. \u2022\tI think it is pivotal to Maker\u2019s governance that delegates can apply a critical and fact-based lens to each vote, without pressure to vote in a particular way. For that reason, I want to make it clear that Frontier Research will be participating in governance as a fully independent delegate. \u2022\tIn terms of the Endgame, I support the general goal of ossifying core functions and making them more resilient. However, the Endgame Plan is a complex proposal with many moving parts that each merit individual scrutiny. I have a track record of asking some unpopular but important questions on this and other topics (see here, here and here as examples). MKR holders deserve independent representation, particularly on protocol-defining shifts such as the Endgame. \u2022\tFinally, I see part of the value I can bring as an independent delegate is that of a bridge-builder and pragmatist. I am concerned about the increasing politicization and polarization of Maker and do not want to see the community fractured into \u2018sides\u2019 or \u2018teams\u2019. Much more unites us at Maker than divides us, and crafting a long-term vision should help to underline that reality.  Conflicts of Interest \u2022\tETH and MKR are my only significant (>5% total value) crypto holdings. \u2022\tI have no investments or interests that should impact my role as a delegate. \u2022\tI have been contributing research and analysis to GovAlpha, largely applying political science theory/analysis to Maker\u2019s governance systems. This work was strictly ad-hoc, limited in scope and I was not a member of the GovAlpha CU. I have ceased my contributions to GovAlpha and will not seek paid work at Maker beyond my role as a Recognized Delegate. \u2022\tI have read, agree with, and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct.  Waiver of Liability By delegating to Frontier Research you acknowledge and agree that I will not be held liable for any damages or losses caused by my participation in the Maker Protocol or because of any votes cast or actions taken while acting as a delegate. I do not have a fiduciary or any other obligation to you as a result of your delegation of MKR to the Frontier Research delegation contract. By delegating your MKR you accept the outcome of votes made on your behalf by Frontier Research, and specifically agree that at all times you have complete control over the delegated assets by adding or removing your MKR from the delegation contract.

Notwithstanding some of the hiccups on the Maker RWA side at present, I support initiating and greenlighting the process for this well-thought-through application. I also appreciate the effort BlockTower has gone in order to align its incentives and interests with Maker\u2019s in its longform application document. Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer)  Happy to accept the recommendation of RWA to not greenlight this proposal. The risk-adjusted return here does not appear attractive for Maker and given some of the background complexities for the RWA team, it makes sense to focus and prioritise the highest quality applications and partners. Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer)  As above, the risk-adjusted return is not appealing and it makes sense to prioritise and focus on only the highest quality RWA proposals at this point in time. Executive HVBank (RWA-009) Drawdown - August 24, 2022 Voted: Support  Supporting this executive and the general process being undertaken with HVBank. Happy to see these compliance issues resolved.  Footnote These were the first votes cast for Frontier Research and I just wanted to give a shoutout to some of the considerable effort provided behind the scenes to make the delegation systems work at Maker. My thanks to @prose11 for walking me through the process and being patient with a series of pedantic questions; and thanks too to @dux-core-unit for producing a pretty seamless and accessible UX for delegating and voting! Much appreciated. ",

Option 2 represents a worthwhile experiment to try to drive more decentralized collateral at Maker. It makes sense to sacrifice some revenue in order to try lock in more market share, and develop a stronger decentralized base to boot. This course of action aligns with my platform\u2019s emphasis on growth, and I\u2019m keen to watch the DAI supply tick up over the rest of the year. Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) - August 29, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  I support this legal domain work, and think it is vital we onboard Backed Finance and get access to US treasury yields. I understand internal workstreams at Maker are congested, and appreciate various people\u2019s efforts to get this across the line. This poll with a 50k spend strikes me as an example where  a formal governance process such as this poll may be overkill - comprehensive due diligence on a strategically important onboarding is a must.

The MIP6 application was just a request to onboard collateral from the applicant. Domain work are all the implementation reviews Maker does for its own behalf. All of the spend we are contemplating to conduct independent legal due diligence would have otherwise come out of the RWF budget. To work around the current paralysis, we agreed at earlier collateral meetings that SF would shepherd through MIP65 and the Backed Finance MIP6 work. Any funding dedicated to this domain work will correspondingly not be spent by RWF, and will only be spent for this legal work.   This has more to do with internal processes than with anything else: linked reply for more details.  Either we updated the original ask in our SPF request or we proceeded step by step as we are doing now depending on final cost estimates, rather than pad the ask and draw more than we really need (even if we return it after) We took a more cautious approach with the funding request at the expense of potentially one more SPF request.    The estimates are as follows:    MIP55c3-SP6: Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund    12-16k CHF from top-tier Swiss legal firms to cover compliance with Swiss law max. 20k USD from North Lakes Legal to coordinate project 40-60k USD from a white-shoe US firm to cover US implications    We had been working off ~15k Swiss, ~15k US and the rest NLL. Top tier US firms came in more expensive than we expected. The high-end estimate could come in as high as $96k. The low-end in the $70k range, sizing a second SPF in the $20-46k range should it come to that. It could still well prove to be unnecessary as all legal work in this area is highly innovative and difficult to evaluate time estimates.     ChrisBlec:  No, the DAO shouldn\u2019t just be allowing CUs to grab whatever money they need. It needs to be approved.   Fully agreed. Any request for SPF, including this one, has to go through governance. Understanding that the above estimates are a fair assessment of the high-end extent of this request. The net of it is:  If you do not want to engage with the RWA domain but you do not want to obstruct work being done, you should abstain on all SPF requests including this one If you do not wish domain work to be funded independently by SF you should reject all SPF requests including this one If you wish domain work to be done you should approve this SPF request but also be prepared to approve a potential second one to close the gap  ",

We planned/estimated lower for US lawyers and decided to go ahead to start work rather than upsize the ask and potentially risk having to make a new ask anyway   This approach makes sense to me. I did see that note of possible further spend in the thread and appreciate the advance warning.     ChrisBlec:  No, the DAO shouldn\u2019t just be allowing CUs to grab whatever money they need. It needs to be approved   Yes, but there needs to be a balance struck - MKR holders and delegates can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t micromanage all CU spending decisions. I understand that this is a SPF so governance approval is appropriate, but as you point out yourself, it seems strange to have this spend as a standalone vote and not bundled with anything else (though I appreciate the internal and idiosyncratic reasons why this was the right procedure in this particular case).

We need to update the terms so HVBank can fully deploy, and the changes seem reasonable. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Reasoning: There are multiple reasons to support these contributors being compensated with pro-rated MKR. They have made a substantial contribution to the DAO through their RWA work, and we have a strategic interest in incentivising them to continue their involvement with Maker. There is also precedent within TradFi (as @Llama points out) for this kind of pre-cliff exception in certain situations. I appreciate the argument that this kind of request is suboptimal (being an ad-hoc exception for specific team members), and agree with that, but feel that on balance that Maker should provide pro-rated comp in this particular case - given the unusual circumstances. Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Reasoning: Given some of the current issues around RWA at Maker (and the unclear status of the prospective Legal and Transactional Services CU), this seems like a reasonable amendment to broaden the language and scope. Having a facilitator (already with responsibilities entrusted by governance) to validate the verification strikes a fair balance. Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Reasoning: Voting in support of this SPF to continue this strategic legal work (or more specifically, reimbursing SF for providing the upfront funding for that work).

Happy to vote in favour of further preparatory work on that basis, while still noting some of the issues raised about TVL, trading volume etc. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: No (Defer)  Unlike the other proposals, the cost-benefit proposition here does not make as much sense for Maker. It is not apparent what the strategic interest for Maker would be to prioritise this collateral. We also note some of the Risk team\u2019s concerns with increasing our exposure to RenBTC. Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Greenlight)  Maker has a strong relationship with Gnosis, and a strategic interest in DAI remaining the flagship stablecoin on Gnosis Chain. Those clear synergies justify this proposal advancing, though there are still some reasonable questions around volume and liquidity that we will watch. Executive Core Unit Budget Streams, SPF Funding, HVBank Legal Update, MKR Stream Accounting Cleanup - September 14, 2022 Voted: Support  Supporting this executive that funds the Oracles CU, the DAI Foundation CU, two SPF processes and cleans up some on-chain accounting.

With that potential conflict flagged, this amendment (as well as the Delegates MIP Set) is worth supporting as an improvement to a governance system that everyone recognizes as a work in progress. The example of Hasu earlier this year demonstrates how just a few missed votes can scar a delegate\u2019s metrics (and, accordingly, their compensation) into the future. While there is a balance to be struck, as the protocol needs delegates to be active and engaged, this amendment improves that balance on the margins. Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Similarly, this MIP set represents a series of substantive improvements to the delegate system, put together by GovAlpha. As above, this vote affects Frontier Research into the future, to a greater extent than the participation metrics as it changes the compensation mechanic and adds MKR vesting. For that reason, I was close to abstaining on this poll. However, GovAlpha have been meticulous and comprehensive in their development of this MIP set and I endorse that independent process. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  I am abstaining from this poll, having completed some research and analysis work as a contributor to GovAlpha earlier this year (this is flagged in more detail in my delegate platform above).

Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  An easy decision to support this initiative. As I have written about on the forum before, the LATAM community is a vital area of growth for Maker particularly where DAI can provide the real-world stability that a given fiat currency cannot.

However, with that said, this still seems to be a proposal that genuinely merits the signalling of interest. At the least, we can send a positive signal to the applicant themselves, and also highlight some of the possible benefits for Maker: diversifying RWA exposure (to Canada, specifically); the prospect of RFA as a promising institutional partner; and access to a large market. Hopefully we can continue to explore this opportunity.

The Oracles CU has confirmed that this contract accesses our oracles securely. Hopefully end users make the most of rETH as new collateral on Maker. Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  This is a competitive and helpful proposal from Gemini that will hopefully drive some decent revenue for Maker as well as diversify our centralised stablecoin exposure away from USDC. GUSD\u2019s fundamentals at present are not fantastic with poor liquidity, but maybe this partnership can help turn that around. End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Mixed emotions about this vote and the ending of SourceCred, as set out in a more lengthy post here: [Poll Notice] Signal Support for Ending DAI Funding for Sourcecred. As set out in that comment, it does seem like SourceCred is not effectively serving the purpose of improving forum discourse as it once did. On a meta level, continuing to improve the level of governance discourse at Maker is of critical importance. While SourceCred was cost-effective, it was always vulnerable to being \u2018gamed\u2019 and that looks like what is now occurring. We look forward to alternative ways of incentivising strong contributions from Maker\u2019s broad community. MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Happy to support removing the yield and liquidity incentives from the bar calculation and appreciate MOMC\u2019s analysis. MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Option 1 - 0.5%  As a preliminary comment, it\u2019s great to see Maker experiment more with approval voting. In this particular case, we are happy to see the spread at 0.5% and have voted accordingly; rather than also express approval with a prospective drop down to 0% at this time (particularly as the revenue difference between the two is minimal).

While it is true that the opportunity cost for these funds is not quite \u2018zero\u2019 as it was just a few months ago (given the plethora of competing proposals for our PSM USDC), as I set out in the thread itself this is a large-scale opportunity in the immediate term to monetize a chunk of our balance sheet. Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  Agree with other delegates\u2019 comments that Maker should be wary of concentrated exposure to Monetalis, and this is not the only additional proposed Monetalis deal either (it looks like two more are soon to follow). The DAO needs to be mindful of these potential counterparty risks, which seem under-appreciated in the context of Monetalis relative to other entities the protocol integrates with. With those concerns in mind, voting to abstain from this proposal. Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Of course, the greenlit BlockTower deal needs risk assessment and legal review. Happy to see Christian and Teej fill this role for us once more given their experience and expertise. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Appreciate @CodeKnight\u2019s effort on this one. This proposal makes sense and provides governance with more flexibility in the future if there is a rogue CU facilitator. Executive Enable DC-IAM for RWA-007-A (Monetalis Clydesdale), GUSD PSM Parameter Changes - October 13 , 2022 Supported  Supporting this relatively simple executive to change the parameters for the GUSD PSM and add a new debt ceiling instant access model.

                    "content": " Endgame Position Statement Frontier Research might be a newish delegate platform, but I have been following the development of the Endgame Plan right from ideation by Rune to this current vote for the Prelaunch MIP Set. While our views about the Endgame Plan have shifted quite a bit (particularly as the plan itself has morphed, sometimes - encouragingly - in line with community feedback), there are still some outstanding concerns. The main points factoring into the Frontier position at this stage are:   Organizational complexity and complication. Despite some simplification, the Endgame Plan is hugely complex and the learning curve is beyond what 99% of DeFi community members could surmount. This would not necessarily be a decisive blow except that the Endgame is relying on the development of bespoke communities for MetaDAOs; it is not clear why those will develop beyond the current Maker community, outside some less-than-compelling token emissions.   The tokenomics of MetaDAOs still seem unclear and unconvincing given it is unclear how MetaDAOs will each develop sustainable revenue or business models, and it looks like they will need to be financed by Maker Core for a considerable period of time. I spelled out some of these concerns here, which in fairness Rune responded to at length. I understand his case in favour but it seems reasonably speculative at this stage.   On the other hand, seeing the proposed launch of numerous clusters has been heartening. There are strong, technical teams being put together to make the Endgame a success and this is what the best-case scenario for a post-Endgame Maker looks like: decentralized, autonomous units all building under the aegis of Maker.   Overall, while it is abundantly clear that Maker could use the shake-up and reinvigoration that Rune\u2019s plan will undoubtedly deliver, too many critical mechanics remain unspecified and unclear. In the hope that Maker will continue to develop the Endgame Plan atomically and incrementally, we vote to abstain at this stage rather than cast a vote for or against. If the Endgame is passed by governance, we will of course abide and look to work to make the transition as successful as possible; including by continuing to point out opportunities and potential areas of weakness.  Votes Cast October 22 2022 Accordingly: Polls Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Happy for offboarding to occur on Rune\u2019s terms as opposed to the previous proposal. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  The Events team have done some great work and have not been treated particularly fairly by Maker governance. However, signalling agreement with the terms of the Golden Parachute set out in this proposal. Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  The only realistic option at this stage given the tumultuous period for RWF. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  As above, the prudent option at this point in time. ",

We don\u2019t think the issue of bad debt, given its small scale, presents any significant problems and it\u2019s more important that Maker focuses on more pressing questions in terms of the protocol\u2019s stablecoins (namely, optimising and monetising idle balances). Relevant CUs can eventually get to this item on their \u2018to-do\u2019 list but in governance we should look to better prioritise the DAO\u2019s needs. One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022 (thread) Voted: No  Our first reaction to SHCU\u2019s proposal was tentatively positive, in the sense that if a CU has genuinely pre-paid business-related costs this should be factored in by governance in an offboarding context. On the other hand, other delegates rightfully point out the iffy precedent about providing bespoke funding to offboarded CUs, and the fact that SHCU is already receiving a relatively generous golden parachute. In addition, the extra MKR was unrelated to the pre-paid costs incurred by the CU. Overall, the case for procedural fairness is stronger for voting \u2018no\u2019. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - October 31, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  We support the Open Market Committee\u2019s proposed course of action with respect to COMP, MANA and YFI and appreciate the characteristically thorough analysis provided by @monet-supply.

Maker has the potential to genuinely excel as a wholesale lender, particularly to other DAOs, and operate as a core financial engine of the broader DeFi industry. Compound is one of the most trusted and secure protocols in DeFi and makes for an ideal next step towards that long-term vision for Maker. Looking forward to the (responsibly paced) scaling of this integration, and the growth and yield that should come with its success. ",

                    "content": " Votes Cast November 22 2022 (Strap in for a big day at the polls!) Polls Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Facilitator Onboarding (MIP41c4-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Psychonaut/Pritkin, for all intents and purposes, is the facilitator for IS-001 - at least, he is performing that role in the absence of the titular facilitator. There are clearly some concerns about this particular facilitator onboarding but we should also consider the bad precedent of having a facilitator who seems more or less AWOL in that role. On balance, we support this change. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBase  2nd choice: Approve existing budget only 3rd choice: Approve reduced budget - NewBear DUX have done some outstanding work in the last year and (as previously noted in earlier posts) their work on UX for delegation and voting is particularly top-notch. This work will only become more important in the next year or so with the changes that the Endgame Plan will bring. That said, prudence given budget cuts across CUs is appreciated and so we have accordingly preferenced the \u2018NewBase\u2019 option (followed by \u2018existing budget\u2019 and \u2018NewBear\u2019). Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No  It is concerning that CoinShares has significant ($30m) exposure to FTX, amounting to 11% of net assets per CoinShares\u2019 post here. and there appears to be some uncertainty about other market participants at this (calamitous) period for the industry. In light of that uncertainty, our preference is for caution. This is a shame as CoinShare\u2019s proposal was comprehensive and the diversification of yield would have been healthy for Maker - this poll should by no means be the end of CoinShares\u2019 possible collaboration with Maker. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: No  We take Risk CU\u2019s recommendations and analysis seriously, and their laundry list of issues with this MIP and the OUSD proposal is more than enough to reject this ratification poll. Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  These changes to IS-001\u2019s mandate make sense and seem to reflect what is generally happening with that CU (as an aside, though, this is the kind of change that in an ideal world would not have its own poll - we should be trying to reduce governance overhead where possible). Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve reduced budget - BearMarket   2nd choice: Reject budget The aggressive cuts proposed by the CU to their own budget seem appropriate in the circumstances, and it is worth asking the question whether a bug bounty program should be administered by a separate CU as opposed to a broader CU or an external provider. For now, however, happy to vote to approve the significantly reduced budget. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget  Again, it is important to recognize that the CU has looked to cut its own budget at first instance in the context of broader cuts across the CUs. I actually don\u2019t know if Recognized Delegates are particularly well-placed to assess whether GovComms is doing a good job at facilitating internal collaboration/aligning stakeholders etc among the CUs, but from the outside it appears that this is what is happening. It\u2019s also worth noting that the total budget for this CU is relatively small - notably, a significantly smaller outlay than the following CU. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Reject budget   It is not at all clear that the DAO is getting value for its annual spend of $1m for this CU (or $950k for the proposed bear budget). That is a lot of money to spend for an interface for Maker\u2019s auction systems and it is hard to justify that level of spend for the output. While it is true that Maker\u2019s auctions have worked very well, it is difficult to quantify the contribution of SAS-001. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Approve Budget  TechOps support Maker\u2019s underlying infrastructure, including critical infrastructure, and that work needs to be valued highly by governance. The spend here ($2.4m annual) is significant but so too is the breadth of the work this CU needs to support - including 24/7/365 support with contributors based around the globe. TECH support the front-line work of other CUs and also seem to have reduced infrastructure costs through their efforts. Their proposed budget should be approved. Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Abstain  This vote seems to mostly be about winding back the very recent vote among the Endgame MIP set about approving the POVE. While I am sympathetic to the concern here and some of POVE\u2019s risk, it is not appropriate to try to essentially handicap a key vote that governance passed just last month. Accordingly, we cannot support this poll. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  It is true that the protocol\u2019s concentrated exposure to Monetalis is a concern (and we have previously abstained from the Appaloosa ratification poll for this reason). These counterparty risks remain a concern, obviously with regard to both the Friesian and Andalusian votes. However, calls/a strong presentation by the proposed Viridian Cluster have prompted a bit of a rethink: these vaults represent reasonable yield for Maker, but more importantly, the cluster model represents the path forward for RWA under the Endgame Plan. With governance having now voted in favour of this direction, it\u2019s important to provide the nascent Viridian Cluster with a chance to establish their operating model. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Similar explanation to the previous vote, with an addendum on this specific proposal that the Viridian Cluster\u2019s emphasis in their presentation and writing about climate-aligned collateral is really promising. As I have written about previously, Maker has a huge opportunity here and I endorse efforts to advance the protocol in a greener direction. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Approve standard option budget  SES play an important role within Maker and their proposed budget should be approved, but it is noteworthy that the budget here is not small ($2.7m). The budget cutting is appreciated and so we prefer the smaller budget (ie, the standard option budget). Add GNO (GnosisDAO) as a new Vault Type - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  There are some liquidity questions around GNO and it may not be likely to drive much revenue for Maker, but on balance it is still worth voting to add as a new vault type. Maker\u2019s relationship with Gnosis goes beyond GNO and we have a strategic interest of course in supporting DAI as a flagship stablecoin, with which Gnosis is also aligned. The parameters here (collateral liquidation ratio of 350%) are conservative too which reduces risk. Hoping to see others get in behind this vote as well. Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Have previously supported Maker working with BlockTower as a high-calibre partner and continue to do so, particularly to drive protocol revenue. There are also some cool and innovative things going on in this proposal with Centrifuge that we will watch with interest. As a final point, some of my comments about the Viridian Cluster above are also relevant here to the long-term direction for the Spring Cluster. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Yes, for sure. Ren Protocol is being sunset and needs to be offboarded promptly. Proceed with Pre-Implementation Work for the Deal Outlined in MIP90 (BlockTower Liquid AAA Structured Credit and Money Market Fund) - November 21, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes (Proceed)  Yes, this pre-implementation work needs to be done, we are glad to see SF take the lead, and approve their proposed plan in this instance.

As I spelled out in this thread, Maker has a pretty unique growth opportunity given the conflux of FTX/CEX disaster and our own increasing revenue. The DSR represents a way to return value to existing DAI holders and change the value proposition of DAI for prospective new users and any capital currently sitting on the sidelines. That has clear positive ramifications from the broader perspective of Maker\u2019s competitive positioning, including by encouraging more integrations. For anyone on the fence, it\u2019s worth reading this thread and I would highlight @monet-supply\u2019s point here: (emphasis added)    Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 24 November 2022   For example, if Maker set DSR to 1% and Aave v2 and Compound integrated it for idle liquidity, this would increase supply rates by ~0.42% for Aave (from 1.3% to 1.72%) and ~0.48% for Compound (from 1.92% to 2.4% including COMP rewards). While still below tbill rates this would make DAI a more attractive asset to integrate for defi protocols   @hexonaut\u2019s argument here also resonates: (emphasis added)    Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 24 November 2022   In general I find Maker can sometimes move too slow on these sort of opportunities due to the very human need to move slowly into uncharted territory. I completely understand and sometimes feel similarly, but would like to stress that existential exposure to a single counter-party is existential no matter if we are at 1b or 5b exposure. We might as well dial it up and get the benefit if we must have it.   Let\u2019s put a stake in the ground for DAI and for decentralized growth, and get the DSR going. PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Generally support the MOMC\u2019s proposed parameter shifts and this vote is no exception. Each change makes sense and the justifications are characteristically sound. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase the NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50 Million DAI - November 28, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Good to evaluate this opportunity and of course the risk and legal assessments are necessary (as the title suggests). Happy to see the success of the NS-DROP vault and the voluntary suggested increase in stability fee (to 4.5%). ",

On balance, we have voted not to support this proposal as it is not obvious how Maker will get $50,000 worth of value from the modelling exercise. While the input from Risk CU was not definitively influential on this conclusion, this post was pretty compelling. It is not clear that there is any glaring or urgent hole in Risk CU\u2019s approach which this proposal would address. Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  It is more than reasonable that CUs winding down should be supported by Maker. @Davidutro is doing everything and more that he should be in his position, and it\u2019s important for Maker governance after a rejected budget or offloading poll to offer basic bridging support. Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  Similar reasoning applies here to supporting SAS-001\u2019s winddown. Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Daimon-Law   Both candidates boasted relevant experience, helpful legal skills and a strong pitch. On balance and after reviewing both candidates\u2019 experience, Daimon-Law seemed like a better fit for the DAI Foundation. As a side note, both candidates made some excellent contributions on the last few months on the forum about legal aspects of the protocol. For delegates and community members yet to vote, I recommend reading those historical contributions. Change of Ownership of the Ambassador\u2019s Program Multi-Sig - December 12, 2022 (thread) Voted: Yes  This seems like a straightforward replacement and change in light of Kat stepping down. ",

Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: 1st choice: Do not burn any MKR   2nd choice: Burn 0.5 million DAI worth of MKR 3rd choice: Burn 1 million DAI worth of MKR While the technical work going into DssKiln is appreciated, this is not the right time to burn MKR, particularly to the tune of 500k (let alone multiples of that!) While symbolism can sometimes be valuable, this is a treacherous bear market where we cannot afford to throw away large sums of money - literally, in this case, by burning it. For community members (not unreasonably) disgruntled about the price of MKR, it is important to note that there is little evidence that Maker burning some of its MKR will do anything to increase the price. We would be better off holding onto the resources we have. There are better ways to deliver value to MKR holders. Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  This is an unfortunate scenario, and it is fair and just to approve a one-time distribution to plug the hole that has clearly been left. CES\u2019 current members, of course, should not pay the price for actions taken by past facilitators - governance needs to ensure those currently owed amounts are fulfilled.

The debate and rigour around this issue has been good to see (it is worth acknowledging the Gemini team and Tyler himself for engaging with the community both in the forum and in Discord). It seems plausible, as Tyler claims, that the Earn issues do not impact any other Gemini products like GUSD. Considering the broader constellation of points raised both by Gemini and its critics, we find it reasonably assuring that the GUSD reserves are segregated from Gemini (a company subject to New York Banking Law). The critical question is whether GUSD would still be redeemable in the event of a Gemini meltdown, and that those reserves are out of reach from the company (or its creditors). The endless volume of centralized meltdowns in crypto means we need to take this contingency possibility seriously, but neither should we overreact and attempt to end an integration that has been productive for Maker given most factors suggest the GUSD reserves are sound. At this point in time, on balance, we support staying the course with GUSD. Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) - January 16, 2023 (thread) Voted: No  In addition to the above comment, it is not necessarily clear that decreasing the GUSD PSM fee would  actually provide Maker with meaningful protection or optionality as some voters seem to be suggesting. In practice, the 500m is not going anywhere in a hurry. If the community decides that GUSD presents a catastrophic or existential risk to Maker, that is the prerogative of MKR voters: this proposal, however, does not move the needle meaningfully in either direction.

I agree with Rajiv that there is some confusion as to overlap and competition with SF CU. It is not immediately clear, as other delegates (particularly GFX) have pointed out, why the SPF should fund the cluster\u2019s monitoring of RWA  given the scope of SF CU as it stands currently (and, generally, the need for Maker to have its own monitoring). As we have outlined in vote commentary last year, some of the Viridian Cluster\u2019s plans for RWA going forward are genuinely exciting. But in lieu of clarity around the cluster\u2019s role in the broader context of Maker Core, it seems imprudent to support this particular SPF.

Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Given the massive role that SF now plays across the protocol, it is critical that they have budget for completing commercial risk and legal domain work. This is crucial spend. Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  This is a RWA monitoring proposal we can get behind: developing a robust and comprehensive risk monitoring solution for Maker Core is an important medium-term goal and we look forward to the solutions that might be offered as a result of this push. Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Abstain  This is a complex issue. There is no denying that there is a clear need for Maker to think through how it should respond/support responses to legal and regulatory actions, including reimbursement of expenses for individuals. However, as a Recognized Delegate, we do not feel comfortable voting in support of a proposal with the explicit objective of reimbursing legal expenses for key stakeholders (delegates being the first group cited in the proposal): that veers uncomfortably close to a conflict of interests, whether perceived or actual. This is not a vote against the notion of a dedicated fund or legal resource per se, and the work going into the proposal is appreciated. Nevertheless, for the reasons above, we abstain. Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  These are logical and commonsense improvements to MIP63. ",

Again, while the motivation for this amendment is understandable, on balance it creates a worse set of incentives for recognized delegates and Maker governance. There is no evidence that mass abstentions are actually a problem for our governance systems at this point in time (most delegates, like our platform, abstain rarely). Happy, on the other hand, to see the weighting for executive votes go up along with more stringent participation requirements: given the pivotal operational and pseudo-constitutional role of executives in the system, there is no excuse really for delegates not to be all over those particular votes. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No  This was a tricky vote. The idea that Maker should retain flexibility in the month of December is reasonable, though it\u2019s also true that governance could push urgent votes through if needed (arguably making the point moot). Overall, in recognition of the risks of burnout it seems reasonable to continue to earmark December as a break in the monthly governance cycle. As Derek mentions in the vote thread, the break is also designed to give developers a rest over the end of December. It seems worthwhile to continue to earmark that break in the cycle structure. Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: No  While it is true that MIP14 has not exactly been a high-use MIP since inception, we agree with GovAlpha that there is utility in MIP14 filling in a gap for certain funding requests that don\u2019t fit other structures. In fact, as another vote this cycle (\u201cMIP4c2-SP32: Remove MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling\u201d) highlights, the Endgame might usher in a series of increasingly substantial funding requests through MIP14 - this is not the time to repeal it. Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  This is a commonsense pruning process for obsolete MIPs. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  As above, it\u2019s clear that MIP14 is coming into more use and that a 250k ceiling could prove to be an annoying handicap on funding/budgeting processes. Removing that ceiling makes sense in that context. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Really happy to see Chainlink Automation onboarded to the keeper pool, which should help bolster the  performance of essential protocol services as well as further improve Maker\u2019s protocol decentralization. Decentralization in this context offers particularly valuable benefits like extra redundancy protection in the event another keeper network goes down. Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Supporting this vote in line with our platform\u2019s emphasis on growth and yield as important priorities. While there is merit in some of the arguments raised against this proposal (the yield (2%) is not high; we could just implement certain strategies ourselves, etc), this particular proposal offers a way to test out a DeFi-native mechanism of earning yield beyond our significant RWA streams. It also helps that Yearn is offering to share fees with Maker. Overall, while yield farming will never be the path for Maker to generate massive growth, we support Yearn\u2019s proposal for the reason Rema notes in that thread (emphasis added):    MIP92: Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield   While the current on-chain yield environment is suboptimal especially when compared to traditional financial benchmarks, we believe that such a module is valuable enough to justify allocating resources towards it, as risk/reward profile will most likely improve in the future   ",

Is it still important to maintain access to vaults for smaller users, which a broad reduction of dust helps achieve, or is it better to lean into the wholesale model and assume that users will end up on L2s in any case? In general, our platform sees the latter as the likelier path of travel. However, with respect to this particular vote, there does not appear to be much harm in adjusting the debt floor to offer more of a carrot to small users. We can always review and readjust these settings if there is a significant swing in the gas market that makes it uneconomic to liquidate small users (while that isn\u2019t the best user experience, it beats pricing those users out of vaults altogether). Offboarding Parameters for USDC-A, USDP-A, and GUSD-A - January 23, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Given that we have cleared out all positions on these vault types below the liquidation ratio, there is no real reason to keep them on the books.

As set out in a prior post,  organizational complexity and complication is a serious obstacle that the Endgame will need to surmount over the next year or two: while some aspects have been simplified since, many have not, and the plan remains in a state of flux and development. This really matters in a context where SubDAOs/MetaDAOs will need to build communities outside the tiny Maker intelligentsia in order to thrive. On that basis, starting the process of developing a bespoke knowledge portal makes sense (it will be hard to drum up mass enthusiasm for the Endgame by directing people to the Maker Operational Manual - we need simple explainers more than anything else). I\u2019m not sure if $10k will be enough to attract a sufficiently high-quality proposal, but it\u2019s worth a shot, and testing out new decentralized voting systems (ie, JokeDAO) is also worthwhile for relatively low cost.

This is explicitly a symbolic gesture, and while symbolic gestures can sometimes be worthwhile, anything tokenistic should be put on pause for the next few months or likely more as the Endgame comes into focus.

Ratification Poll for Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process (MIP4c2-SP30) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  The existing interim facilitator appointment process has shown to be a bit slow and cumbersome. This is another set of logical procedural changes, in this case to better maintain business continuity with a more tightly conceived interim facilitator role where the need arises. Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) - February 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  It is difficult to overstate the importance of RWA revenue to Maker in its present state and likely into the future. While there are bottleneck issues given capacity demands on the Maker workforce, this proposal with Cogent Bank ticks a lot of boxes. Like with Huntington Valley Bank, Cogent represents a way for Maker to finance real economic activity and double down on its value proposition for community banks. Cogent is FDIC regulated and relatively well established. Scaling the protocol\u2019s revenue must continue to be a priority for governance, and Cogent (based in Florida) also helps us diversify our integrations. While we respect the views of other delegates that the Endgame constitutional processes should take priority at this point in time, we should still continue to look to grow Maker\u2019s footprint and revenue. Audit and Review Work for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  In a similar vein, we think it would be a mistake for the lack of fully defined Endgame frameworks to get in the way of genuine product innovation and protocol expansion. While constitutional discussions are important and ongoing, nobody should forget that the Endgame will only be successful if SubDAOs help expand Maker\u2019s utility and drive innovative new products. To that end, dedicating resources towards a proven team like Phoenix Labs should be seen as a helpful building block for a successful Endgame transition. Engineering Resource for Phoenix Labs - February 20, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  As above, this is a helpful signal for governance to send in favour of what a successful Endgame transition requires in practice. The effort from Derek to clarify governance\u2019s intent is more than reasonable in the confusing circumstances of that transition, and hopefully governance can respond with a clear signal in support. With the Endgame in an embryonic state, this is a particularly important time for the protocol to double down on growth through innovation. Remember that the team have committed that Maker will own and benefit from every product that Phoenix Labs creates: this is a no-brainer bet for governance, and one worth supporting in full. ",

It seems more prudent to focus on the lower-risk and higher-scale opportunities for Maker for now. Return Excess MIP65 Funds to Surplus Buffer - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Supporting this initiative to return excess funds to the SB, also in line with our usual position on growing the protocol. Increase the MIP65 (RWA007-A) Debt Ceiling - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Per our usual position on low-risk methods of generating revenue for the protocol, supporting the increased debt ceiling to deploy into a 6-month US Treasury ladder strategy (with bi-weekly roll-over). The adjustment mechanics seem reasonable and this is a good opportunity to continue to grow Maker\u2019s RWA revenue. Remove the DC-IAM from MIP65 (RWA007-A) - March 13, 2023 (thread) Voted: Yes  Similar reasoning to the above explanation and think the opportunity cost is significant enough to justify the greater flexibility that this proposal allows. Executive Emergency PSM Changes - March 14, 2023 Supported  Again want to acknowledge various CU\u2019s very speedy and ultimately effective actions over the last week. The context of the turbulent broader market risks and threat to DAI\u2019s peg more than justifies the emergency PSM changes passed by this executive. ",
