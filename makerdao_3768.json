                    "content": " Replaced I replaced this Signal Request with this one: [Signal Request] Offboard unprofitable collateral types I think it makes a lot more sense to first find out which ilks the community wants to offboard and then later on build a plan on how to execute on this.  Overview I want to follow up on the topic raised by @NikKunkel in the G&R-Call on 2021-05-20 about unprofitable ilks. Since MCD we onboarded a pretty decent amount of collateral types, and it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that not all of them got the adoption we hoped for. We already have a couple of collateral types where the gas we pay to keep the oracles running exceed the SF we collect. There are a couple of steps that we could do before actually stopping the oracles for the ilks we want to offboard. I really believe we should start doing something ASAP so with this Signal Request I want to focus on the easiest steps:  check if the community is fine with offboarding specific ilks if yes, as a first step:  set the line/DC to 0 set a SF high enough to motivate vault holders to unwind    All other (potential steps) afterwards like even more raising the SFs, fiddling with the LR (which is debatable) to force liquidations or at some point just shutting down the oracles to not further update the oracle prices are not part of the Signal Request - but I would be happy to hear your ideas and thoughts about the next steps.  Pros:  less gas-costs for updating the oracles less complexity for oracles team less complexity for PPGs    Cons:  fewer ilks \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af    Increase the SF for TUSD-A  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     no change set line to 0 but don\u2019t change the SF set line to 0 and increase SF to 5% set line to 0 and increase SF to 10% set line to 0 and increase SF to 15% set line to 0 and increase SF to 20% Abstain     0 voters      Set line for UNIV2-AAVEETH-A to 0 and increase the SF  UNI-AAVEETH is one of the least succesfull collateral types so far, we never even reached a supply of 50k DAI.

That we don\u2019t have a standard process for this needs to change, though it\u2019s understandable why it wasn\u2019t done this way originally.

Our users are risk-managing whales and institutions, so small market cap probably isn\u2019t worth our time. All the more reason to look outside the crypto universe for business, as there\u2019s not much left for us unless we attract greater market share of ETH and WBTC.   Agree, and that\u2019s why we should be careful by removing the bottom one. There are not the best but we should be able to make them profitable.     PaperImperium:  So\u2026 let me know when you\u2019re a supporter of taking some profits in off-chain fixed income. Crypto, RWA, and financial instruments as a three-pronged approach would give us a much higher margin and more safety   I am supporting the RWA. As said before, we don\u2019t have the choice, we have to go the RWA way. After that, it is our weakest point and 0.1% is probably not worse the risk. I would prefer an eth-c at 0.5%. ",

Since MCD we onboarded a pretty decent amount of collateral types, and it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that not all of them got the adoption we hoped for. We already have a couple of collateral types where the gas we pay to keep the oracles running exceed the SF we collect. There are a couple of steps that we could do before actually stopping the oracles for the ilks we want to offboard. I really believe we should start doing something ASAP so with this Signal Request I want to focus on the easiest step:  check if the community is fine with offboarding specific ilks  All other steps like raising the SFs, fiddling with the LR (which is debatable) to force liquidations or at some point just shutting down the oracles to not further update the oracle prices are not part of the Signal Request - but I would be happy to hear your ideas and thoughts about the next steps.  Pros:  less gas-costs for updating the oracles less complexity for oracles team less complexity for PPGs    Cons:  fewer ilks \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af    Shall we offboard USDT-A?

This means coins that have at least 50M caps and ideally we want stuff like 500M and above. We want to start at the top and work our way down was ignored and here we are - basing getting rid of things based on oracle costs and completely ignoring the other costs associated with bringing these on.    Really want to urge Core groups to focus on the low hanging fruit vs. just going after everything as manpower is limited. While I won\u2019t touch USDT with 10 ft pole personally I don\u2019t think MKR ever gave USDT a fair chance at a 8% SF.  Up the LR and reduce the SF and see if we can capture any part of that huge market. I pretty much said YES dump everything except ZRX and USDT for above reason.   I don\u2019t know why I think ZRX should stick around vs.  AAVE or BAL.    So if I were to be consistent I\u2019d say dump ZRX and see if anything can be done with USDT to get some activity.   I have felt since the beginning USDT with the high fees would never get a single deposit. ",

Loopring (LRC): the team is using the vault, and also during late Q4, they will launch EthPort, which will provide cheap L2-L1 composability. This will allow users to interact with Maker directly from Loopring L2. Once integrated, LRC holders (as well as ETH, USDC, and WBTC) would be able to open a Maker vault, increasing LRC vault usage. Brave (BAT): we are still in conversations with the Brave team. They are interested in maintaining BAT as collateral but are defining the best way to use Maker Vaults because the BAT in their treasury is used to support the brave campaigns Decentraland (MANA): In the following days, DCL Foundation will open a 1M MANA vault, and we are discussing with the Decentralan team how we could improve this vault usage  Our suggestion is that we should not offboard the LRC, BAT, and MANA tokens as collateral. Their teams have shown great interest in working together to find strategies to increase vault usage. The Loopring and the Decentraland team opened (or will open in the following days) a vault to show the Maker Community they want to use Maker Vaults. ",
