Motivation Web3 users sometimes get attacked due to vulnerebilities in web2 systems. For example, in Nov 2022, Curve.fi suffered a DNS attack. This attack would have been prevented if there was a standard way to allow dapp developers to disclose their official contracts. If this was possible, wallets could have easily detected un-official contracts and warned users. An added advantage to this approach is to predictably find the the official contract addresses of a dapp. Most dapp\u2019s docs are non-standard and it is difficult to find the official contract addresses. More details: eip draft This is work in progress. Sharing to get community opinion. ",
