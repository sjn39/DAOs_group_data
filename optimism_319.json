Some other projects are researching broader DAO Health (TalentDAO) and there\u2019s a number of basic analytics dashbaords for Web2 (Orbit.love, Common Ground) and Web3 (non launched yet but some in early stages) communities measuring number of messages and other vanity metrics Is/will this project be open sourced? All the research is open source and the data collection tool too. Optimism native?: not applicable Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: we\u2019re ready now Ecosystem Value Proposition: Like many others, Optimism depends on the health of its community and its vibez\u2014yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging. Today, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of \u201chomemade\u201d surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable. Perhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.). Specification For the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience (myself) to bridge both theory and practice. We\u2019ve reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member\u2019s wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too. For the data collection tool, we\u2019re going beyond traditional surveys. This research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point: Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools. Pulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They\u2019re also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. The data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we\u2019re exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused. Rationale The techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long survey e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give. Although our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. The combination of ONA and pulse surveys offers unprecedented actionable insights in real-time. Some of the potential applications and insights for Optimism DAO and Optimism-based DAOs are:  Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy) Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL Help new contributors find context-rich mentors outside of the existing pool of well-known but time-poor candidates  In addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above (and others to be found) can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities. This research also helps reduce the tooling gap in DAOs compared to the employee and stakeholder experience at traditional corporations. Benefit to Optimism: As part of the grant we\u2019ll deliver a full community health report on Optimism\u2019s community and a workshop with the team and/or community members to share the findings and discuss initiatives to further improve the community.

I read the rndao report, my takes: Interviewing 30 individuals seems like a small scope but depends on the DAO size you are researching. While the talk about DAO units it\u2019s nice, specially for those who never worked on a DAO, for this experiment it\u2019s some how basic in content. I don\u2019t want to disrespect all the work you guys did here. I put myself in a position where if this was the Optimism report you do, I don\u2019t have actionable items to promote engagement, active delegation, marketing actions wtc, I\u2019ll just have an idea of \u201cdo DAO units, it works\u201d. On the other hand I feel you will need to create a baseline study and come back in a month or two, redo the study and check the differences and what did worked and what not. The OP amount it\u2019s good, and the proposal it\u2019s different from everything we have. Is the OP distribution, use and accumulation part of your study?

Also, we\u2019re not suggesting to interview 30 people (the proposed research uses more scalable methods than interviews). And not sure what you\u2019re referring to with the talk of DAO Units. Is it about the research we did in partnership with Sobol? (that led to these two articles: Top 9 Challenges of DAO Unit Success and Why and How we SubDAO ) Or is it about the talk I did for the governance learning sessions? Or something else? To clarify, none of those are related to the Community Health Project. RnDAO operates as an incubator for multiple Project Units, with this proposal specifically being made by the Community Health Unit (called TogetherCrew). The Research into SubDAOs was from a different Unit and had a specific scope for the needs of Sobol at the time, and the talk I gave for the gov learning sessions was more of an informal sharing of ideas we\u2019re exploring in how we structure RnDAO internally, not our formal research. Hope that makes sense. To get a taste of the depth of the research we\u2019re carrying out related to this proposal, this is perhaps the best example: What is a DAO Community and when is it healthy: a working paper by RnDAO In the above working paper, we have created the baseline framework. The grant will help us put it in practice, assessing Optimism and validating/refining the framework. We\u2019re also automating a lot of the processes, so running the study again will be a lot easier in the future and we can even think of a higher frequency (near real-time insights into what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not)  As for the OP mount, maybe I\u2019m confused, but the idea is to use it to compensate our researchers and builders (who\u2019re creating the tool we need for the project) for all the work executing on the proposal.
