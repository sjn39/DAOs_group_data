These include a general lack of vision and strategy as well as low accountability to MKR holders.

Contributors: @adcv @Aes @hexonaut @teej @luca_pro @Nadia @MarianoDP @SebVentures @Eumenes @Hasu Hello, Next week, an informal group of colleagues would like to share some views around governance and propose specific alternatives for reform to strengthen MakerDAO and enable it to build a world-leading lending platform and a world-changing decentralized stablecoin. Some of these views already exist in various forms throughout the DAO. We are trying to kick-start a process to give them shape and turn them into actionable items for governance to enact. Community and especially MKR token holder feedback will be crucial to shaping a coherent view. We have a great possibilities ahead of us but a robust structure must be in place to capitalize fully on the opportunity. Our aim is to maximize attention towards token holders, create systems of accountable supervision of Core Units and empower an effective cadre of delegates who are responsible for a coherent direction. First principles, common sense governance.  Call Details On this call, we would like to talk about the principles that are driving the initiative, gather early feedback as we continue formulating a coherent set of governance proposals and share next steps.

And at the same time large MKR holders that might be relevant but that we know might not live on forum were informed. Unfortunately I do not have the emails of all community members. I have operated professionally and in good manners for this protocol over many months, and have been put under unpleasant pressure in several occasions, also during the ongoing voting window. I would kindly ask you to stop doing it, or at least to concede me a break so that I can dedicate more mental energy to my mental wellbeing. Thank you ",
