Welcome to the 194th MakerDAO weekly Governance & Risk meeting. My name is Payton; I go by Prose11 online. I am a Governance Facilitator at MakerDAO. Today is Thursday, June 9th, 2022.  I want to thank everyone on this call. We have a couple of unit members, delegates, and other interested parties, people who are curious about how Maker is doing, as well as the issues we are grappling with as a DAO.   As always, this is a recorded meeting\u2013Hello, if you are watching on YouTube!\u2013. Attending to that, let us try not to speak over each other. There are a couple of facilitation tools I would appreciate you using if you can.  If there is something you would like to add after the current speaker finished talking, you can use the raise hand feature on Zoom, under reactions.  If you are unable or unwilling to hop on the mic, you can leave your comment in the chat, and we will be happy to go through it once it is conversationally appropriate.   That, more or less, settles it for rules. Let us kick things off with our agenda.

Here is what we have been doing so far.   Maker Brand Team Update - Twitter1280\u00d7719 196 KB   Maker Brand Team Update - Twitter Metrics1278\u00d7717 202 KB   These are some of the metrics. Consider that the last tweet of the Foundation times was around August 2021. We started tweeting near February, and you can see the impact.  We remained silent on Twitter for too long. We lost a lot of the engagement we had in the past, and we have surpassed the number of followers by other accounts.  Still, we are working hard to provide good content and generate a high engagement rate.     These metrics are simplistic. We are working on another set of metrics and OKRs for social media, and we will be sharing that with you soon.   Maker Brand Team Update - Twitter Department1277\u00d7718 170 KB   This is how we manage the Twitter account.  We have a public Announcements Table. We believe that transparency is fundamental for our DAO. For each of these announcements, there is Content Creation. If you click on any, you will see them treated as projects. We then share that with our PR and Comms agencies and strive to extend the message to other media outlets as we keep improving it before posting it on Twitter.    22:00  Maker Brand Team Update - Twitter PR &amp; Opportunities1279\u00d7718 309 KB   Regarding PR & Opportunities, we did a brand analysis to gauge how are MakerDAO and DAI received in the media. We are crafting stories, currently working on one called DAI is a different Stablecoin.  We commissioned research and academic articles around MakerDAO to start having different content. We provide support in events. We have been doing something neat in Permissionless.  After the Terra fiasco, we pushed to have Sam there. Since Do-Kwon was not going to attend, we got that slot for free.   We set up plenty of interviews for Luca Prosperi, Sam, and others.   Maker Brand Team Update - Special Initiatives1279\u00d7717 252 KB   Maker Brand Team Update - Special Initiatives - Nature1276\u00d7718 207 KB   With the Nature Initiative, Vaults can claim a POAP. In doing so, said POAP will plant ten trees.  Since launching the initiative, 36 Vaults opened, and we planted 116 trees. We will soon be posting a dashboard showing updates such as how and where the trees were planted or how many km2 we reforested with this initiative.   Special initiatives keep the conversation going on about MakerDAO. This is a neat, inexpensive, and fun thing for the whole scene. Stay tuned for our next big project!   Maker Brand Team Update - Web and Research1278\u00d7719 350 KB   If Growth\u2019s budget is approved with the Brand option, we believe we should do brand research and start implementing the findings on our website.   Maker Brand Team Update - Visual System1279\u00d7718 310 KB   We want to develop a visual system for all of these assets to be accordingly represented, have their logo, and standardize how we talk about these things.

All of these need to be done in the context of branding research, defining a holistic visual concept and message for the protocol.     Maker Brand Team Update - Visual System Implementation1279\u00d7717 177 KB   After the branding research, we need to work on visibility for our assets.  If you go to our website right now, you will notice things are not up to date, and a lack of proper guidelines.     Maker Brand Team Update - Advertising1277\u00d7717 287 KB   Once our website is updated, we would like to explore what traditional and digital advertising can achieve for us in terms of cost and results and gauge the impact those can have on DAI circulation.   Maker Brand Team Update - Thanks1277\u00d7717 204 KB   Those were the updates of the Brand Team. If you have any questions, go ahead.  29:05   Payton: I did see one from David in the chat. He wondered about the Brand Team and how it plays into the broader CU structure.  Nadia: Growth is the Core Unit. Inside Growth, we have two teams: Business Development and Brand.  We decided to incubate Brand inside Growth to provide a solution for the lack of a branding narrative for our Twitter account.  The long-term goal is to incubate them as Core Units, but for the time being, we believe it is better to nest these two teams inside Growth.      Payton: Appreciate that, Nadia. It seems like we have a question from Max.  Max: That was a marvelous presentation. You are doing an incredible job! I am excited to see the results of all of your fantastic work. Would it be appropriate to bring up the deal and set of terms worked out between Growth and Glass Entertainment Group? Maybe we can let some people know that that might be in the pipeline.  Mariano: Last time I talked with GEG, we were waiting for the contract draft.  Max: Yes. We have been trying to clean it up and make it a good agreement for everybody.  Nadia: We also have to remember that our budget proposal is currently up for voting, and depending on what MKR Holders decide, we might or might not be able to continue with the Brand incubation efforts.  Max: I hope MKR Holders see the value in everything you do and support your budget. Thanks for taking my question.   Makershire Hathaway  Mark 32:40  Makershire Hathaway960\u00d7540 164 KB   Mark here, also known as Aes from Strategic Finance. Since we are close to our voting period next week, I want to do a brief update on the Makershire Hathaway SPF and embrace the opportunity to discuss the proposal in more detail.   Disclaimer  Disclaimer960\u00d7540 122 KB    This report is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute financial, investment, legal, regulatory, or tax advice. I will kick things over to Adrian to walk you through our balance sheet status.   Makershire Hathaway - Balance Sheet960\u00d7540 95.6 KB    Adrian: We discussed managing Maker\u2019s balance sheet more productively on several occasions. Particularly in an environment with rising interest rates.  In the real world, when interest rates are zero all around, this becomes less urgent, but structurally, it is still necessary.   The framework shown in this slide conceptualizes Maker\u2019s business model, which is essential and akin to a bank. We tried to divide the assets we are holding into two big blocks: Stablecoin Collateral and Surpulss Buffer. In Makerspeak it is just an accounting difference. Nevertheless, it still represents the equity of the protocol.  There is a third block we are not showing here: all the collateral locked away on top of the DAI issued. But that is beyond the scope of, probably, Maker altogether, and we decided not to get into that.   There are several proposals on the forums about managing the stablecoin collateral.  Since we prepared this slide, MIP65 has been approved. We are glad to see that. There is intense work to deliver a return on this and manage the net interest spread between what we earn on our assets and what we due on a liability.   This presentation will focus on the surplus buffer and the equity side.  Makershire is willing to, in the first step, provide a proof-of-concept by looking for low-risk strategies that do not compromise the principle invested but aim to generate some amount of conservative return on the equity and will seek to eventually roll out all of the permission aspects to turn it into a fully permissionless system.    36:46  Makershire Hathaway - Overview960\u00d7540 189 KB   Makershire Hathaway - Overview I960\u00d7540 108 KB  41:14  Makershire Hathaway - Allocations960\u00d7540 74.1 KB    Jun: Our focus for the Networks we will be operating on will be primarily on mainnet, L2s, and sidechains already proved safe. Other chains can provide asymmetric returns at times. We will evaluate them per chain, with less significant positions relative to mainnet and L2s. Security is an utmost priority for us. We will be only going into protocols considered DeFi blue chips, have transparent teams, a good community reputation, and are fully audited by top auditing firms. Thank you all for coming. We would like to open the floor up for questions.  Kianga: There are three topics on which I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear your opinion as a team.  Regarding the use of these other protocols: what enhanced capability should we have, or do you foresee we would have to engage, participate, or follow along within their DAOs as part of our risk management? How would we manage to receive governance tokens as a result of any of these strategies? How do you envision meta-governance combining with the overall treasury management approach?    44:40   Mark: In terms of Makershire, any unrelated tokens to the ones approved through this proposal\u2013ETH, MRK, and, primarily, stablecoins\u2013will be sold and reinvested into the strategy.  Some bridges will provide their native token as well as protocol fees. A few LPs will have boosts for liquidity mining incentives. Those will be sold and compounded to maximize yield. If there is a particular asset that the DAO thinks is worth acquiring and accumulating, we can have a signal request to evaluate that possibility rather than sell it and reinvest it in the yield strategy.  Although, from a risk perspective, it is more conservative to sell those tokens and not consider their valuation; therefore, making a bet that said token would appreciate relative to the Dollar.     Meta-DAOs is something I have spent plenty of time thinking about.  When we got the ENS airdrop, I initially thought we should dump it because, at the moment, it was spiking, and I did not know anything about the business of ENS or how their tokenomics work. I assumed most MKR Holders were in the same boat. If there is a cross-DAO type of entity that manages those sets of relationships able to help us do partnerships and figure out different ways we can collaborate, if it is beneficial for Maker, we should pursue that.  If a protocol that we own tokens of is helping with, for example, DAI liquidity or if they are willing to integrate Maker Vaults or somehow leverage them through their treasuries, that could be attractive for MKR Holders. Nevertheless, it is a complex and relatively new issue for DAOs as opposed to traditional companies.     I see MakerMan saying \u201cinvest in LP airdrops\u201d.  We have thought about putting a proposal into LP ENS: If we are not going to sell it, we might as well earn some yield on it. Despite this, we still have not done the math to gauge how attractive that opportunity is. Although, it is something that we can research.    47:48   Payton: Do ask what happens if there are any losses due to these operations.  Mark: We are exposed to ETH and MKR\u2019s price. Even so, we believe historical yields are exceedingly attractive compared to the risk of unfavorable fluctuations. We also get the benefit of providing liquidity for DAI and MKR.  I will reiterate that the goal is to earn yield and provide liquidity for DAI, especially as we are seeing more traction on L2s.  If you check L2s at the bit.com website, you will see that more and more ETH and assets are moving to L2s over time.   If you look at DAI\u2019s liquidity and Optimism relative to Arbitrum, you will see we have little usage and liquidity there. One of the things that Makershire aims to do is help bootstrap liquidity in areas where DAI is not present.  From that perspective, we will trade off yield for liquidity to get DAI bootstrapped in some situations.      Payton: There is some debate around what we should do if we receive or become eligible for airdrops.  Mark: I think MakerMan\u2019s idea of LPing the airdrop, as long as it is with ETH or DAI, could be attractive. Especially with DAI. But it depends on Maker\u2019s strategic interest.  Is this a token that is directly supporting DAI in some way or not at all? If it is the latter, we should decide whether we should sell. But let\u2019s think that selling will remove Maker from future airdrops lists. We should consider making that decision as something that could become of strategic importance for DAI beyond the financial perspective.    Payton: Someone asks if you have considered integrating with makerburn or daistats so the community can keep track of these assets.  Mark: 100%. We would like to have this on makerburn. He has been great to work with, helping us with different things. We will build a Dune dashboard to monitor all the positions until that is up and running. You can check on it just like you can our financials and see it in real-time.  51:28   Payton: I see Tim raising his hand. Tim?  Tim: How does the chain of custody look after using the surplus? Other folks emphasized this as well. I guess you could phrase it as checks and balances. For the call, Strategic Finance could set an example for transparency, but if you want to talk about making sure you will be accountable, that would be helpful.  Mark: The first step will be modeling and assessing the various position options we have. We started building a framework we hope to share with the community. Some people might have seen a draft release that leaked ahead of time in the Strat-Fin Discord.  After we build the allocation for the initial deployment, Risk and Lending Oversight will evaluate each position. Everything will kick off once we understand and assess the risk and return.  The only eligible positions will be those on networks and protocols in which we have extremely high confidence. Blue chips like Uniswap, Curve, Gelato, etcetera.   The primary checks and balances will be Risk and Lending Oversight. The community can also decide to change the allocation if there is something they consider too risky.   In terms of deploying the positions, there is the 5-of-7 multi-sig using MIP47.  53:39   Payton: Another question in the chat was about the potential time risk for locking and unlocking on L2s and having the funds unavailable for a frozen period if anything were to happen and we needed those funds.  Mark: Maker Teleport will soon be deploying. There are several bridges that we could move across to return funds from L2 as well.  Generally, these will be long-term, passive positions that will require little active management. It could be months, even a year, that we could LP into a USDC/DAI LP and hold it for the entire iteration of the SPF.   In the long run, we see many traditional financial instruments moved on-chain. We see DeFi growing tremendously over the next 5+ years. Ergo, we can leverage some of these innovations that automate these positions.  I can see a future where we have a master treasury framework that allocates the surplus buffer into predetermined percentages based on several factors driven by risk and our asset-liability management, such as the lending book portfolio. Then, processes can be fully automated using DssKiln and these other intelligent contracts.  Even if we are stepping in early and do not necessarily have the resources to prioritize this level of automation today, I have spoken with our engineers, and we feel this is possible.      Payton: David is phisically raising his hand, as I can see on camera. David?  David: Quick question regarding the 10 million Dollar fund to do all of this: how do gas costs eat into the yield? If you have too many strategies and conditions that require you to adjust positions, do you foresee gas as a frequent cost to maintaining this, or is it more passive in practice?  Mark: It is passive in practice. Since we will be holding positions longer-term\u2013especially in crypto terms\u2013and not looking to rebalance, the gas cost will be insignificant, even more on L2s.  If you think about the Uniswap V3 positions, particularly in these volatile pairs, we will be setting conservative ranges to avoid that. At the same time, we need to fully understand the yield and the permanent loss trade-off that comes with setting those positions.  There are several models that you can use to quantify that. Even so, crypto markets can be unpredictable. I would not have thought that ETH would be where it is today, a couple of months from the merge.      57:47   Payton: I am thinking of a similar question as we asked the Brand Team: how does this play into the CU structure? Will this be entirely overseen by Strategic Finance?  Mark: It will be a partnership between Strategic Finance, Risk, and Lending Oversight. Nevertheless, we want to source community input on the LPs.  If an attractive opportunity comes up and someone mentions it\u2013MakerMan, for example, who has plenty of experience with LPs and has thought deeply about protocol on liquidity\u2013and the community shows interest, we will hear them. We are looking for this to be a community-owned type of project. That being said, we will be strongly biased towards safer positions.    Payton: In the short-term, does that mean an increase in full-time hires for any of these groups, or will it be managed under existing\u2026?  Mark: No increase. Just management of the existing team.  Payton: This seems to generate a lively chat, some of it related to the topic and some of it, perhaps, branching into other areas. It might be a good time to cue it off for a more open discussion.  Mark: To close out: if anyone has further questions, feel free to message us publicly in our Discord channel and make it official or, otherwise, send us a DM. We will happily talk through these questions. Thanks.   Discussion  Open Mic  David 1:00:20  Open Mic960\u00d7540 14.8 KB   We set up this Open Mic because we realized that having a dedicated topic every week can get exhausting and feel forced, especially if the theme is unclear and there is no well-structured conversation. Today, we are giving the community a break, even though we spent plenty of time talking through the initiative updates\u2013which I loved\u2013.  Today\u2019s Open Mic is loosely centered around initiatives at Maker. Period.  If you are curious about any specific initiative, you can ask. They will gladly give you a brief update if the lead is here. If you have burning questions about specific initiatives, now is the time to discuss them.      Payton: The chat keeps bringing up different LPs and DAI liquidity. I do not know if we would like to explore those topics, but if you have a question, comment, or update you would like to give\u2026  David: I am interested in hearing an update about the self-insurance fund proposed a while ago by layerzero. Layer, are you willing to give a quick update on how that has been going?  1:02:15   layerzero: Sure. As you probably recall, one of the flagship projects for SES is setting up a self-insurance fund. We want to achieve something similar to D&O insurance in the traditional corporate world.  D&O is for top-level managers, legal counsels, etcetera. This insurance reimburses managers or employees subject to a personal lawsuit. At DAOs, we are much more exposed. We lack a legal entity. The biggest threat for us as an organization is to be considered a general partnership, which implies unlimited liability.  Simply put: anybody can get sued. Not only because of one\u2019s actions but because of the actions of others as well.   Since I see this as the highest legal risk for us as a DAO, I have decided to make this project my top priority. It is inadmissible for us, people who are spending our energy and time and pouring heart and soul into the organization, to bear such a risk while working on this project. We hired an insurance broker and a risk management company out of our grant budget. They are elaborating on a feasibility study for us. The first phase is crucial. We are assessing the overall legal risk exposure for MakerDAO.  We are going to conduct interviews with CU Facilitators and Delegates. In this phase, we will cover the legal cost of defense for around 130 permanent contributors we have in our workforce and the Recognized Delegates.   These are the first steps of a long-term risk management strategy for MakerDAO. Later on, once we have the fund set up in place, we can extend it. We can go to the insurance market and place some risks there.  In later stages, we can consider developing this fund to cover other areas such as, for example, claims from third parties. Traditional companies have captive insurance, which works as an insurance company owned by the organization. We could develop that as well. The idea is to provide a comprehensive risk transfer strategy for MakerDAO, and the self-insurance fund is the first phase.   We are currently preparing a survey which we will start conducting by the second half of next week.  We have prepared a questionnaire to understand which are perceived risks, as well as real risks for contributors and Recognized Delegates. Probably, some of these contributors and delegates already have liability insurance, protection, or even D&O. That is why we want to assess the overall risk exposure.   The next milestone would be to determine the legal vehicle or structure.  It could be trusted. Nevertheless, part of the feasibility includes legal analysis to gauge the best course of action to carry this on and determine how large this fund should be.     Please, stay tuned. I will start contacting you by the second half of next week. I am at your disposal if you have further questions.  1:08:37   Payton: Last week, we talked about the prioritization framework that is now up on the portal. We got feedback from delegates saying it is somewhat confusing or overwhelming. I am curious if anyone has had a chance to look over the descriptions\u2013they are helpful\u2013. Is there any feedback or questions on that initiative?  David: My question about that initiative is what has been the most poignant, negative criticism for it? Now that you had one run of it\u2013even if it was not entirely successful due to technical difficulties\u2013, what is the biggest problem with it?  Payton: The worst issue would be if it did not push us in any further direction. Some of the feedback stated that, perhaps, the options were too specific on direct and technical work.  In terms of the most poignant criticism, it is just the idea that we are adding more complexity. Another vote is to take place. Another thing for CUs to consider. Does this push us towards our goals, or does it just give us more to talk about rather than do? To me, that is the most poignant criticism. \u201cThe system is not working. Let us add another element to the system and see if that helps\u201d.  Whether or not we get something worthwhile out of this initiative remains to be seen.      David: Did you receive any positive feedback? Did you see any excitement or people thinking how it might create impact or make a case for that?  Payton: I hear the problem repeatedly in some of our CU coordination calls.  We are all independent CUs. What do we spend our time working on? How do we do that without becoming a smoky back-room, where a group of stakeholders is making all the decisions? That is the opposite of the core value of the DAO. The hope is that having this transparent, free-flowing snapshot of where MKR Holders are sitting will make it easier for us to align resources and to have purpose-driven meetings rather than syncing up over anything that two CUs can have in common.  With priority input in place, we can determine the most important things to strive for and start working together to achieve them. That is the hope and the vision, and it seems like it is much needed. The question is if this is the right tool to help us get there or not.      1:12:36   Payton: Do you feel the same way, David? I do not want to monopolize the talking time.  David: This might be helpful. I prepared these draft slides to spark a conversation if people are willing. They explore different levels you can find at MakerDAO.   Open Mic - Level - CUs960\u00d7540 107 KB   We have 20 different Core Units working on various products and initiatives.   Open Mic - Level - Products960\u00d7540 54.5 KB   This is the product level of the DAO. It is incomplete because L2 is much deeper than just L2. There are nuances to all of this.   Open Mic - Level - Initiatives960\u00d7540 32 KB   I have been struggling to understand the initiative level. People also seem to have different opinions about initiatives and how they group.   Open Mic - Level - Initiatives I960\u00d7540 42.5 KB   Also incomplete, here are some of our main initiatives. It is something to look up if any questions get inspired. Many of us have been exhausted from the number of calls today. It might be worth it to end the call early today and give people back some time and let them enjoy the Thursday.  Payton: Seems reasonable.   Conclusion  Payton 1:15:55  Appreciate the lively discussion around Makershire and the update of the Brand Team. Thank you for joining us live, and if you are watching the recording, excellent job getting to the end! There are threads for everything we discussed today in the forums. We are thankful for you taking the time to put your thoughts up somewhere where they will persist rather than being forgotten in just a minute. Please remember to keep the conversation fun. We will be here same time, same place, next week. Thank you! See you next Thursday!

Welcome. My name is Payton; I go by Prose11 online. I am pleased to host the 196th Governance and Risk call at MakerDAO. Today is Thursday, June 22, 2022. On our weekly call, we discuss what is going on in the Protocol, the risks, and the challenges we face.  A group of awesome people who care about Maker, work in the ecosystem, or are interested in what we do are joining us today.   We are recording this meeting. Try not to speak over one another. If someone is talking and you wish to speak after they finish, you can use the raise hand function in Zoom, found under reactions; Thomas and I will put you in the queue. Otherwise, if you are unable or unwilling to hop on the mic, you can leave your comments or questions in the chat, and we will try to address them when appropriate.  This is an open meeting. Be respectful of each other. Nevertheless, we want you to ask questions, comment, and engage if you please.   That covers the ground rules. Let us go ahead and get into the agenda for today.

Cash Flow Update1004\u00d7696 291 KB   There has been confusion and mischaracterizations around Maker\u2019s financial position over the past few weeks.  The key takeaway I would like everyone to have from this is that compared to the broader crypto markets, especially C5 services, MakerDAO\u2019s financial discipline has left it in a position of relative strength, with nearly 100 million of Dai equity between the surplus buffer and operating reserves.   The decrease in recurring net protocol income, which we call rNPI for short, necessitates an evaluation of our cash flow runway.   The table on the left-hand side shows the last six months of our income statement, with December on the far left and through May on the right.  As a reminder, our CU expenses and financial statements are measured as Core Unit wallet outflows. This is equivalent to cash-based accounting. We also request the CUs self-report their expenses and consolidate them manually to report more accurately the real monthly burn rate of CU expenses. Using this methodology for tracking expenses, our rNPI has fallen from 9.2 million in December to 1.6 million in May.    Highlighted in green, we estimated the main expenses. We were still collecting outstanding expenses from CUs.  If we look at the approved CU\u2019s budgets and modeled out rNPI, assuming they spent the max budget, we would have gone from 8.5 million rNPI in December to breaking even in May.    On the right side of the table, we broke out the income statement of three different scenarios based on the current run rate as of yesterday.  A bear market scenario is ETH at around $500 per token. A giga-bearish scenario is with ETH at around $290 per token.    On the far right side, we annualized these scenarios\u2019 entire runway in years under each stem scenario.  Importantly, this forecast does not include any incremental revenue streams.      22:13  Cash Flow Update - Cash Burn1005\u00d7695 319 KB   As many here are aware, Seb has been working on making investing in PSM assets into short-term treasuries and corporate bonds a reality since his days in the RWF CU. Today we are working with Alan from Monetalis to bring this to fruition. For clarity: by the end of Q3, we are targeting 500 million dollars of deployments into these assets.   Cash Flow Update - Call for action1004\u00d7699 257 KB   Despite our position of financial strength, StratFi CU calls for action and recommends the following steps to strengthen our position, not only to survive in the bear market but to thrive. We recommend a surgical approach to our current spending budgets over a broad-based cut.  The reason we recommend this is because if you look at the DAO\u2019s revenue over the past year, this business is cyclical and tied to the cyclicality of the cryptomarkets. We went from a high of 200 million dollars and annualized revenue down to around 26 million in the past six months.  We need to reassess these budgets holistically for the new market realities.     With that said, we will take any questions.  26:01  Robert: Going back to the last slide, it makes sense to look at the individual performance of the CUs. My question is to the community: since we talked about doing something surgical, it is fair to say that it is a subjective conversation when we talk about performance. What I would like to understand when we do option three, if we do it, is how exactly we will measure the CUs based upon performance. There is common knowledge of strategic objectives inside of the DAO. There have been some focus objectives that, for example, Rune has posted to the community. There are a variety of other ones that happen as a result of individual mandates. I would like to understand how we measure the CUs as a community.  Mark: Ultimately, we want to create a framework to help guide this discussion. It is not different from a traditional corporate performance review, function, or negotiation for one\u2019s budget. When some budgets pass, sometimes they pass with operating margins over 70%, or 80%. Some are even higher. We want to reallocate capital to where we need it most. We have to go through a process like this, despite the challenges that are part of it. We will have an extremely inefficient capital allocation if we do not have any performance reviews. Frankly, it is not sustainable. I am more concerned about going through the process rather than striving for it to be perfect. And we have to start somewhere, and somewhere is better than nowhere.   Robert: I would agree with you, Mark. But you said something specific. There are multiple ways to do evaluations; you mentioned one that I am familiar with. To be as objective as possible is the key to deciding how we would measure CU performance.  Mark: It will be up to the Delegates and MKR holders to decide the terms of what makes it on any framework. In my perspective, it is on the Facilitator to argue why they should have a certain amount of capital allocated for the business and what value they are delivering. It is on them to explain to MKR holders and Delegates what value they are creating for the Protocol. The design is solely on the framework and just checking off boxes. It will be on each Facilitator to make their case for why they deserve to have their budgets, whether they deserve expansion or, if they do not, how much their budget should be set up.   Robert: I hear you, and again, I have to go back to the fact that value is a subjective measure. If we have strategic objectives defined, it would be a simple exercise. The only thing we have to go on for each of the CUs is how well we achieved our mandates as we have them listed for CUs. I have been through many of these cycles before. I have experienced both bull and bear markets with many companies. When done correctly, it can be a fruitful exercise. Although, I rarely have experienced that. That is my concern.  30:35  Luca Prosperi: Yes. It is hard to assess performance, needs, or CUs from the outside. We might suffer the risk of what sometimes happens in a DAO, benefiting those that are better lobbyists than executors. One idea was to suggest several budget reductions across the board and have the CU\u2019s Facilitator decide how to allocate them. Given that everyone can have a different view on how to do that.  Mark: There is some merit in such an approach. But frankly, some CUs have plenty more room to cut than others. Broadly, CUs that requested much more than they needed have been effectively rewarded by governance over those that forecasted what they needed. Now that many CUs are in a part of the cycle where they question the next phase of their budget, those who are under-promised and then delivered are held accountable for people that spent or requested far in excess of what they needed. Robert: Mark, that is a different exercise. At least in my opinion, because of what we are asking CUs to do. My CU has been ratified since October. I have much more data now than I had before. We could use our best efforts to update our initial forecast; that is a reasonable request for any CU. It is also a simple process to go through. That alone might yield enough results for us to stop there. I am not saying we have to. I am saying that there are probably other steps that we can take that are non-invasive, easy, and realistic for us because they require very little or no oversight. Every CUs would be responsible for the process, and if they feel it is not aggressive enough or still thinks there is more to trim, potentially, they could step into a much deeper process. I would like to see this happen. Baby steps because we do have a runway. And I am not saying we should leave fat in the budgets. I am saying we should be smart about the way we go about this.   Luca Prosperi: I agree both with Mark and Robert. But, in general, it is hard. We should also try to understand what kind of behaviors some procedures incentivize. If CUs start fighting, trying to demonstrate who has more fat to cut or who needs more money, we might have to spend our time lobbying and in politics within the DAO, even more than we currently are. Instead, if we are going for a more homogeneous request of best effort, we might find ourselves in a position where all the CUs start a negotiation between MKR holders about the number they would have to stick to. I know this is imperfect, but we should consider the ramifications of behavior that some mechanisms might trigger within the DAO.  34:48  Chris: The surgical approach will be an intractable political mess if we try to do that across the entire DAO. Although, there might be a good hybrid approach. Suppose MKR holders say they would like to reclaim 10% across all CUs. You could either find that 10% and send it back or decide on the surgical approach. CUs could have a say in what is viable for them with this hybrid approach. Thus, not having to be bogged down in politics and micromanagement\u2013which are things that the DAO does not do well\u2013. If any given CU believes they have done a considerable amount of optimization or have a very aggressive roadmap, they could consider taking the surgical approach, where they would be required to justify their budget or make a valid argument to keep it, and MKR holders can vote on that. That is all I wanted to add. Maybe we do not have to choose option one or option three. We can do both.  Mark: I believe we should do the right thing, regardless of how hard it is.   The process one would typically follow in a regular corporation is better dictated by hierarchy. In that hierarchy, top executive teams make the hard choices. Then, those hard choices trickle down through the organization. Given the structure of a DAO and how decentralized it is, we would need an approach where the garden weeds itself. It would be better to have a target and everyone behind that trying their best. And if we cannot, we will have to go through a hierarchical approach. Today, at our scale, maybe we could pull off the more complicated option. But I do not see it possibly working when the DAO is widely spread and has either CUs or meta-DAOs all over the place following their incentives. We will not be able to operate the DAO this way. We might want to innovate on how to do this. Like I said: find an approach for the garden to weed itself, where the incentives are set so that CUs are already optimizing for their budget.  38:14  Nadia Alvarez: I do not know if I will call it CU performance because that gives the sense of hierarchy; it is a little weird in the DAO; we need CU feedback because the only time I receive feedback is when I post about a proposal. That is too late. We may need quarterly reviews where other CU delegates, Maker holders to the community, can give CU feedback. Feedback will also help us reorganize priorities and initiatives inside the CU; with that in mind, we could cut expenses. I will use my CU as an example; when I was thinking about the new budget proposal, I proposed different budgets based on the initiatives that I would be able to run with each one of these budgets. If Maker holders wanted growth to do branding and marketing, then this is the budget we need. This is the part I need if it is business as usual without marketing, Moreover, if it is like we have to go crazy with marketing, that is a priority: this is the budget that I need. All CUs - we have to go through that exercise by understanding where the DAO is going, what the priorities are, and the pining, the initiatives that we want to do with our budget, and then let them make our holders decide. We all should be able to do that; with this budget, I will be able to do one, two, and three. With this one, I could add this foreign initiative, and Maker holders decide if a bear market is a good moment to do that or not. Just cutting 10% of all budgets is possible; that is the easiest solution. It will be a good exercise for all of us to start thinking about our budget for these initiatives. Is this the right moment to do that? Or maybe we should wait a couple of months and redefine the budget and initiatives. I would like all of us to start thinking about a feedback framework and communicate; what are the budgeted initiatives to help us plan and execute?  Chris Blec: Just one comment I had was as kind of fresh eyes on all this. It does not seem to me, and correct me if I am wrong, that each CU does not have what I have seen; maybe it exists; maybe it does not like a metric that governance, the community expects it to achieve over any specific period. When each CU is created, it should not have some goal that it needs to achieve; whether it is the return on investment or some other KPI that it needs to hit to be measured against because the idea I gave in chat just now as if we had each CU present its proposed metrics that it needs to aim for and try to satisfy. Then those are voted on by governance individually. What does it need to achieve as opposed to whether this should exist? There will be push-pull on how far out hard we should push each CU, but then it would give us something to measure performance by but just based on like, this idea of just delegates, reviewing subjectively, it does not seem to match up with reality as far as what I might expect from like RWF versus what somebody else might expect from RWF. There are no hardcore metrics that I feel I could use. I want to throw that one idea out there, I see in the comments that there might be some metrics we could use for that, but that is not something I have seen consistently.    42:54  Robert: Chris, one of the things I will respond to with that is that yes, that is the goal. One of the challenges that we have, and I will use something very simple. For example, we unveiled a new piece of collateral; as collateral engineering services, we have a key role in that, but we are dependent upon many other CU. People are most likely to have touched that deal before coming into the pipeline. As it moves through the system, certain specific or granular metrics can be set, for example, throughput, but again, yet dependent upon many other CU. In the early stages of the current US form, CU created a tremendous amount of dependencies just because that is the way it was because of the bifurcation of responsibilities. In the context of a CU, performing well also has to look and ladder up to; yes, they have the mandate to perform certain activities, but did they achieve goals based upon what was Dai generation the key objective for the DAO? Was diversification the critical objective? What was the key objective? How did we each ladder into that? And we are missing that.  Chris Blec: I would want to add to what you just said, in a traditional company, from my experience, when you have departments of a company that do not have their responsibilities, independent of other departments, it is a pretty clear indication that that department should not exist independently. There are independent metrics that throughput and things like that. If there is no way to separate that from other units, then it is an organizational problem, but you are correct in that reviews of a unit that cannot control its throughput, its results would be counterproductive, as opposed to looking organizationally at whether that unit is positioned correctly.   Robert: We will see. Now, what you are talking about redundancy, if each CU was truly independent, which I think is the direction - that a lot of the proposals that would like with MetaDAOs, and other things that I think will be proposed, is to have autonomy and independence, not autonomy truly. We can do whatever we want to do; it is obvious what this CU does, so here are the inputs and the expected outputs. That is where I have been building my CU to be more and more independent, not independent from the community, but the ability to execute, which is critically important. If you look around the ecosystem we have created by CU, find one CU that can execute independently and hold those metrics, and it would be hard to, it would be hard to find one. Maybe there is one, I do not know, but that is an organizational design we have due to the Dao being the Dao, at least currently. I am not saying it should stay that way. I would love to have specific objectives and goals and share how I delivered those goals with my CU.  Chris Blec: It seems like MetaDAOs would worsen this. If everybody is expected to act independently on their own, I do not see how; if they cannot do it now, how will they do it in that structure? That is a side chat, I guess.    46:59  Payton Rose: Awesome. There is a lot of good chat here. There is a lot more to cover on this topic. Rather than just cash flow effects and how decisions are being made. A forum is a great place to take a lot of these conversations that are going on. We will have a new signal request related to the presentation you just saw; I encourage everyone to get to the forum and write their thoughts down in a more long-lasting manner. Mark says that more delegates wish to weigh in on this topic. We did hear from Chris. I will show you the results of this poll. I was unsure if I should share the first one because I did not want to distract the presentation. I think that is about as many people participated in the first one. I will end it there and share the results. As far as the Delta, we can go into that later. However, it moved up the understanding ladder a bit, which is nice. We might be doing these more targeted in the future. I just wanted to test it out today to go as far as engagement and feedback for us as presenters.   Discussion  Prioritization Poll  Payton Rose 49:39  Key Points from last week1920\u00d71078 195 KB   Technical Resource Deployment - Priority Sentiment Update1920\u00d71084 284 KB   We pointed out last week that limited options are being rated by voters, which was good feedback because that means we should only prioritize a few items rather than trying to plan up a longer list of them. On the technical side, Compound D3M was a clear leader, and core crypto collateral, if I can get that tongue twister app was a strong leader in the collateral class sentiment poll. We also saw Maker teleport rank pretty highly as a technical resource and noted that reward assets were absent from many votes in the class sentiment poll. Let us look at what is changed from last week to this week. Number one, we have this awesome tool that you will get to see a little more from data insights that can show if we run the right choice simulation out to the very end rather than stopping, and 50%, you can see all the options stack up there. You will notice abstain crept into there; there was a good post by Kianga from Maker Invest about why they were abstaining and the feeling that delegates should not be making these decisions. I recommend checking that out; that is valuable feedback for us and the CU. We saw quite our onboarding, still very highly ranked, even though it is in fourth there. That is because the rank choice format prioritizes the top option, so it is worth calling out that it is still people\u2019s and their top three for many voters due to how ranked-choice works. As I said, you only get down the ladder of your list as your first choice becomes removed from voting, which does not happen if your first choice happens to be the most popular. We saw more participation, mainly in line with what we reported last week, but still good to get more voters\u2019 inputs, and still, most people are ranking very few options. Overall, I would say that on the technical resource side, not much has changed.   Collateral Class - Priority Sentiment Update1920\u00d71074 146 KB   Let us go for the Collateral Class - Priority Sentiment Update. We saw some more voters here, perhaps even a response to my call last week that RWA was missing from many of the top voter\u2019s rankings. We also had some delegates and regular voters come in weighing RWA. You notice they are still down in fifth due to the bias I discussed earlier. The other item that did pop up in a few people\u2019s lists but may not reflect on the outcome is the Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral, featured in several votes in the top five. Again, because it did not capture the top one or two for most of the large voters, those results were not very impactful at the end of the IRV simulation. Again, more participation, but we saw a difference here: we want to highlight how the votes are going. The people here in the call and on the forums may disagree with how that votes; we can voice their sentiment or change the rankings if they have been convinced based on our discourse. That does it for my rundown. I want to make sure today has plenty of time to share this tool they developed. It is worth noting that this was made with the priority polls in mind, but it will work for all IRV votes as well, which is great because obviously, the voting poll wants to show which option is winning, and the valuable information sometimes is how other options are ranked and how close those rankings become, which is not always super apparent if you are looking at the list of submissions on the portal there. Again, this is no criticism of DUXs because their job is to display the winner. Whereas if you are into the data or the changing sentiment, you want to dig deeper into how people\u2019s rankings are going. I will ask Thomas to stop sharing your screen that way, Tadeo can take it over and show us this tool that they designed over data insights.  54:40  Tadeo: As Peter mentioned, the intention was to help with the sentiment polls, but the same application can help with any other rank poll. We have left the scope open, but we will be happy to separate the applications if they are further requirements or just for sentiment polls. When you enter the page - ranked-polls.herokuapp.com, you can select the poll, and here I will just use one of the actual sentiment polls to demonstrate what this little simulation tool can do. I hope everyone around here knows that with instant runoff voting, every voter orders their options in preference. Those provinces get some jobs, and then in every round or cycle, we eliminate the option with the least amount of support. We do that to be really up to the point where we get the winning option; as mentioned previously, there are two sub-conditions. One is whether there is a single option remaining, which is what we see here on the right-hand side. The other is that the simulation should stop once an option has gotten more than 50% of the votes. In our case, to show you the full work there, we let it run, which means that in some cases, some of the options down the list might flip a bit up and down. However, again, the winning option will always remain the same. For example, Peter mentioned that Compound D3M was initially selected with 27,000 MKR sports. Then the next up was Maker Teleport with 7000. As we can see, offer the rounds, these options at the bottom start disappearing to the point where we arrived here where the Maker Teleport is only up with the Compound D3M. Then finally, in the final round, this Maker teleport disappears into the discarded votes, especially mentioned described votes. This is nothing negative; we want to show people whenever they order preferences, and maybe let us say they only add to preferences. On the third, when the second preference disappears, your votes essentially are, in a way, discarded. While if you add more preferences, you get a voice in other options. I see the lovely thing about this is that you cannot only see this, but you can also stimulate your thoughts. If you click here, we load your preferences; you can select them, and in this case, I will say that I want this as my first option, then the Teleport, and finally, the Compound D3M, and just for a sec here, you can put any amount of MKR, I will put 5000 just to show you a little example, I have already tried to remove a bit around them the routes. As you can see, the only big differences are my votes coming in here, and this is clean, which stays in the running up and round six, where it disappears because it is the least favorite option. My votes get transferred to Maker Teleport, which remains there, and to the last round where Compound D3M wins, and Maker Teleport loses. In this case, because I added the Compound D3M, my vote gets transferred into Compound D3M, but then there is another vote, for example, here that they chose Maker Teleport solely. This vote essentially goes down into the discarded votes. Then here, we just have a summary of what we have seen. Various people mentioned that separate from the official implementation, have we considered staying as part of the simulation? So quite correct, we should be just ignoring them altogether. However, we thought it was useful to have it just to see how it pulls against other options. So the app is live. Happy to have everyone play around with it and have some feedback. If you are finding that you need something else that might be useful, something that we neglected to add but to be interesting, it has the final MKR support count here. Anything they might think of here, we will pass it back to Payton.  59:53  Payton Rose: This stuff is cool because I wanted a way to talk about people voting for priority sentiment polls accurately. However, those insights iterated on that and were able to offer much more, and the stimulate feature is particularly interesting, especially if you are a delegate or large MKR holder. You can plug in and see how you are voting or changing your votes, even if you were to shift priorities that would affect the overall poll results. That is cool for prioritization sentiment if you are trying to send a strong signal, but it is also even cooler when real life is, the votes come down, and you are trying to decide: do I support the current budget or the current budget with an increase? Like, does it make a difference? If I put one of those first and the other ones second? Now, you can answer those questions for yourself. Thanks for being willing to showcase that. I think it will be a helpful governance tool for people. Watching the chat is mainly about performance reviews and other things; I will give a chance to anyone who wants to ask either about the data visualization tool or prioritization polling. We will start there if there are any questions or comments. Then, we will probably circle back for an open discussion on some of the previous topics. I saw much tech continuing around performance reviews, MetaDAOs, and others. Typically, at the end of the call or scheduled for another 20 minutes or so here, we tend to open up to discussion, there is a lot of chat, so it would be kind of hard for me to pick one item to go to so if you feel strongly that something should be highlighted. Please do speak up now. Happy to propose something. If you think I picked the wrong thing. Welcome to stick in; tell me otherwise. There is a conflict between deciding on the overall strategy and what we do with the budgets first? That seems to be a pretty potent conversation in terms of decision-making. Which decisions do we make first, and how do they influence each other?   Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:04:51  Thanks for joining. Please continue on the forum. A reminder that next week\u2019s call will be later. That is our second trial run of running these last GNR hours of the month at a later time. We will see how that goes with our demographic polling. Excellent. It looks like the calendar might still need to be updated there. Next week, if you are joining us, it will be at 2100 UTC. Again, this is an effort to make calls later and ensure that other people can access calls. We will see how it goes. We will run our demographic polls and let that inform our decisions for the future. With that said, thank you again for coming out.  Suggestion Box  Credits  Andrea Suarez produced this summary.

The results continue their compression amid the broader market turmoil tied to May\u2019s new Luna/Terra debacle. This month, you can expect more of the same, with Celsius and 3AC creating even more turbulence.  Monthly recurring revenue is down to 4.3M DAI: about 10% down year on year, and about 50M down next 12 months basis on the back of strong declines in the price of ETH and WBTC collateral.  Monthly recurring income is down to 1M DAI, so down 78% year on year. Approved operating expense budgets are about 50M DAI, but based on the reported spend, on a mix of cash and accrual, the operating expense items are about 32M DAI. The overall lending business continues to be driven by the availability of collateral to draw debt from, which is tied to the price of ETH and WBTC. In other words: Maker is a leverage multiplier protocol, meaning that when things go up, Maker goes up very fast; when things go down, Maker goes down very fast. Maker strength and resilience is in managing these transitions smoothly. Maker\u2019s downside is that the operating expenses are based in a different currency than most of the revenues because the DAI generated is tied to the price of a volatile asset. With about 100M DAI in our surplus buffer, the runway for Maker is sufficiently long to weather a number of years. We will propose a structured framework for extending that runway further and help rationalize operating expenses, adjust operating budgets to new market realities, and improve the resilience of the protocol.   1366\u00d7768 137 KB    Here, you have an overview of the monthly results. Top to bottom on the page:  We\u2019re working through a net interest income of 4.3M and a net liquidation income of 4.2M, which brings the overall protocol revenue to 8M DAI.  This liquidation income is highly dependent on overall market conditions.    Workforce expenses of about 3M DAI  Caveat: this is on-chain data, so it may contain multiple months of built-up expenses in one transaction. So one month may be higher, and another month may be lower.   We are still sustaining a 71% return on Equity.     1366\u00d7768 173 KB    In this slide, we\u2019re showing the drivers for the change in recurring net protocol income from one point in time to another. On the left-hand side of waterfalls, on the top of the screen, there is the ending balance (April 2022) recurring net protocol income; at the bottom to the right, the end of the three months (Jan. 2022).  If you walk through each of the different steps, we isolate the different drivers: collateral, price, and yield, for ETH and WBTC. Quarter on quarter, we can see a marked effect of the impact of the price decline on the landing business. To drive higher revenues and profits, Maker needs to add more collateralize and use them.   On the bottom, we can see quarter and quarter drivers in rNPI change.  Optimizations on Oracle gas costs, lower ETH/USD price, and lower network congestion drove more than 1.4M DAI improvements from Oracle utilization.     1366\u00d7768 117 KB    We are showing the monthly income statement by breaking out the different revenue items and lumping all of the CUs\u2019 expenses into one line at the bottom. We can also see the impact of the liquidity income in moments of high market turbulence and the relative amount of net interest income in prior months.   1366\u00d7768 150 KB    Here is the overview of the lending business, the core of Maker. There\u2019s an ongoing slowdown in DeFi lending markets, putting pressure on gross interest revenues.  Lending income of 4.3M DAI, down 31% from last month. We see the distinction between the collateral types. ETH and BTC are still driving the vast majority of our lending income. The return on assets is holding up reasonably well given the environment, but still under a lot of pressure, particularly looking at it from a year ago perspective. The key element is our dependence on these two crypto-assets and, therefore, their underlying price.   1366\u00d7768 182 KB    On this slide, we\u2019re showing an overview of the historical results of Maker over a longer time horizon, trying and trace the performance of those revenues with the price. Our revenues are very high and highly correlated to the price of the underlying assets. In the full May financial report, we have an additional slide that is quite interesting to compare with, which shows the amount of collateral that\u2019s locked in the system as well as the revenues that are generated from it:    1625\u00d71125 231 KB    A reasonably large and consistent amount of ETH and WBTC collateral is locked in. But ultimately, the revenue growth Maker can capture beyond the fluctuation in price is tied to the number of collateral types we can attract and introduce at scale.      Mark 24:02  1366\u00d7768 148 KB   Here, we see the ETH lending market share measured in ETH.  It started to stabilize with ETH deposits increasing by about 200K in May vs. last month, and most of these deposits protect existing positions and not borrow new debt. ETH market share held steady at 43% in May, flat from April.  On a year-over-year basis, Market share decreased by 3%, with Aave being the primary beneficiary.. Aave recently ended its liquidity mining incentive program. Compound continues to provide COMP emissions to depositors and lenders.  If there is any indication of that liquidity management being effective, we should see it in the data in the next few months.     1366\u00d7768 143 KB    This overview of WBTC Market Share shows how the lending market declined by about 2% from last month and was up 27% versus the prior year.  Maker\u2019s market share increased by 3% versus last month, with about 2000 More WBTC deposited in the Maker protocol compared to April..  WBTC deposits increased by 74% from last year, and our market share is flat from last year, despite that big growth.   1366\u00d7768 160 KB   It\u2019s actionable to carry out a budget reduction in the near term. We think the DAO should approach this.   Step one in this process would be returning excess funds that have been drawn from the surplus buffer back to the surplus buffer in the DAO.  We have 16M DAI in CUs wallets right now. And the burn rate is about $2.65M DAI a month.  The next step is determining what we want to achieve with the budget reductions. We can shoot for profitability, target a break-even, or set a fixed or moving cap based on our recurring revenue. Once we decide what our goal is, there are a few different options:   Option A is a broad-based cut across the DAO with no layoffs. This would probably be around a 10% cost reduction.  Option B is a more broad-based deeper cut, targeting around a 20% reduction in the burn rate and could involve layoffs.  Option C (in my view, the best option but more complex) is a targeted budget reduction based on individualized CU performance budget reviews executed by the delegates. This is more akin to what is performed in traditional corporate finance and many companies. And this allows us to take the first step as a DAO to more reasonable and targeted capital allocations decisions. We can start posting Signal Requests to see what direction the DAO wants to take.       Nadia 29:04  I think it\u2019s something that we have to think about altogether. I like this initiative Dennis and David are running about how to improve the way we handle communications and our calls. I want a small group where people from different CUs, the community, and delegates can think about the different ways to solve this challenge or how to manage it. Going straight to the Forum with Signal Requests is complicated: a lot of drama, people pointing fingers, and conversations on the Forum that probably are not productive.   MakerMan 31:22  It looks like our real cash expenses to revenues are net positive So, if you think that our net expenses are something more like 3M a year, if we have cash revenues of even 20M, we\u2019re sitting on 80 million and the surplus, so you have 7 to 8 years worth of run provided that doesn\u2019t decay. We can look at this more carefully before we get all dramatic about what we will do or how we will cut. We need to think about what we think our revenues are going to look like. We got some good revenue streams potentially coming online, and our cash expenditures aren\u2019t that high; it\u2019s the CUs holding on to a whole bunch of cash. I would like to look at this more carefully and not get dramatic about doing a head twist change when we can smooth out the run here and not do anything extreme.   Unknown Speaker 32:51  We are about to break even on a cash basis, assuming that many of these self-reported CUs expenses are accurate.  It\u2019s a little difficult to see on-chain because many CUs are requesting three months plus the runway and their initial draw from the surplus buffer, which obfuscates the true cash burn of the protocol.   On that basis, we\u2019re about break-even, losing about a million a year at the current recurring stability fee rate, which is not a terrible situation considering the market carnage. We should tighten the budgets a little bit, but we\u2019re not in a dire situation.  Certainly, there\u2019s a risk if the markets continue to deteriorate further, but we should still have plenty of runways.     Discussion  AAVE D3M Response  35:21  Primoz Kordez: I can provide background on what would be the following steps on our site. We posted an urgent proposal to disable our D3M two days ago based on three things. The first thing that happened, and everybody knows, is that Celsius became under stress earlier this week. Once we started digging into long books, specifically into the Dai market, to which D3M is exposed, we realized that Celsius is the biggest borrower of Dai, which means we are apart from our exposure to Celsius. Maker: we are exposed to them on the Ethereum Dai market. The second thing that made us anxious is that they hold many ETH. They are the biggest stated supplier to our with about 400,000 ETH supplied, but they borrow stable coins, which is different from the other. The usual users who mainly supply take the Eth and borrow it. In the Celsius case, the situation is worse because it is not only about staked in the pegging in conflict with its liquidity, but they are short-stable coins, which means they are exposed to its price, which is in the market right now. All of this made us a bit anxious, but we were not convinced to push this proposal through. However, Gauntlet\u2019s proposal on governance forums was the third thing that made us decide on this. They proposed to change three parameters, making sense from the perspective that they primarily mitigate the risk of those positions for long stake ETH and short ETH. Applying this to the Celsius case was way too risky for us. There were three changes, and one of them was very crucial. They proposed to increase the liquidation threshold to 90%. In our terms, you would decrease the liquidation ratio for stake ETH by 210%. This was risky. You have Celsius under stress: they mostly collateralize their stable coin with staked Eath, which is liquid, and you have a 110% liquidation ratio; this was where we decided to disable D3M temporarily. In the other part of the story, we feel this does not create any problems for us; in this case, the exposure of D3M was 50 million. We were earning 1.4% API for this, which is low. We did not see we would impact our revenues a lot with this. Although that is not in our domain and is not the main trigger behind the decision, it was something we also examined. The second one was: Do we impose any additional stress on other markets if we do this? We did not because the exposure was still pretty low. We did not affect the rates there. After the vote passed, 50 million were withdrawn instantly, and today it is increased by 30 basis points.  39:59  As expected, we also tested the mock contract: the instant unwinding, which is great for 12. Regarding our next steps, we have monthly rates meetings at the end of the month and in about two weeks, a bit earlier. We will reassess the situation on our end and propose any further changes. We will be looking at three things. First, the situation with Celsius, but now also with Three Hours Capital, because we saw a considerable contagion risk. Whales keep failing, it seems, but who knows who is next. Thus, we will be looking at this; I am pretty optimistic about this. Currently, it seems they are protecting their positions; they unwind that both of them yesterday, not sufficiently. They are still struggling with liquidity because they do small tops-up, basically repayments. The situation is improving. The second thing we are watching is staked ETH liquidity or staked ETH recursive positions, which are also improving. That is also good to know. The third most important thing we will be looking at is the governance proposals. This proposal that went online is currently not passing. That is good news, but it is still live, so it can still pass in theory. We hope this proposal will not be live at any moment or a similar one. If there is a different one, we will evaluate it. These would be the next steps.  Prose11: the changes have already been enacted. That is because the mock setup for the D3M does not need to wait for our GSM delay, which is usually our 40-hour pause on regular executive actions. This is one of the safety measures of the protocol, one of the things that we can do to respond quickly. It is so cool to see that in effect, as mentioned. Another thing worth highlighting is that the Open Market Committee will be looking into these rates in a couple of weeks. The regular governance processes are available to everyone. Anyone could write a signal to undo what we just did with that executive vote if they think the risk has passed. As the team has committed to looking into the issue and posting what they talked about for the Maker Open Market Committee parameter proposal group. They are the people that look at our rates and periodic changes for our vault types. The only thing I wanted to add is on the governance, and this was cool to see happening quickly and effectively. We had an urgent signal process, so we had 24 hours over 70 voters from the Forum on that signal, then put up an exec and had it executed instantly within a great couple of hours. I wanted to post the emergency response map here so you can see the rules we have set up for when something is urgent or out of cycle: the critical takeaway was that this could have been an emergency which would have been one higher. Talking to the other mandate actors, everyone was okay with it being an urgent request which is why we had that daily time before the exec went up.    44:25  Chris Blec: I wanted to rattle the cage on the above a topic. In addition to the reasons we have been discussing for this response, the Oracle situation is not something we should ignore. The initial risk assessment of Aave mentioned that Aave relies entirely on channeling price feeds with no double-check, no sanity check, no circuit breaker, and channelings price fees are secured by four of nine multisig. Many risks come along; I do not feel it was properly vetted over the discussions. We should consider that when we are considering bringing the Aave D3M back. The compound D3M, on the other hand, Compound does have a sanity check; they check against Uniswap v2, I believe, prices for other markets. They hit an emergency pause if there is too much deviation from Chainlink. They are already accounting for that. I want us to keep that in mind when we think about bringing it back to the Aave D3M, capitalizing on this safety situation, and bringing awareness to it.  Prose11: As you mentioned, one of the things mentioned in the risk assessment: risk assessments are extended, and we do not always discuss every part.   ElPro: A follow-up question for Primoz. Are you guys monitoring Three hours capital? I heard there is possibly a liquidation at 993 ETH. I am not sure if that is true. I wonder if you were monitoring. The second part of my question is, you, Primoz, as a head of the risk facilitator: When do you think you tell the MOMC team that you believe it is safe to turn it back on the D3M for Aave?  Primoz Kordez: We are monitoring the capital account; I monitored it the whole morning yesterday; I cannot even follow this now. The Chainlink price feed, I think it makes like, a couple of dollars. Otherwise, they would get liquidated. It was insane how close they were. Moreover, they did not react. After that, the price rebounded, and this started repaying. Their health rate was close to one, which is barely above one. Now it is at 1.14. so it improved. You can see that improved, but with the minor repayments, so the situation is improving with both of them, but you can see they are still struggling with liquidity: that is what we will be monitoring in the next couple of weeks. That is one input we will use when deciding about it. I would say the most important one is also what will happen with staked ETH, as I said: liquidity. Regarding the situation with Celsius and how it evolves, there was a letter of intent that it might take them over next time. It is too early to say what it will look like in two weeks; maybe we are not even at the end yet. Maybe this contagion is more significant. We need dust to settle.   Prose11: Much work for the risk department in a bear market.  49:58  ElPro: What I thought about because I saw this through some of the TG chat rooms: some were unhappy that this was turned off. I was wondering what we are doing regarding communicating that this is just temporary and it is nothing against Aave? I think a lot of us are Avi token holders, probably. What are we doing as far as getting the word out there? This is temporarily for those folks that want to be knuckleheads.  Prose11: I know Nadia thought about that on Tuesday. I do not know if you want to speak to that.   Nadia Alvarez: Yes, when these four went live, he told us that he wanted to prevent Maker from being more into Celsius. We thought putting the debt ceiling on zero was a good idea. At the same time: to prevent users from thinking that Maker was not trusting Aave. We decided to try to manage it through a Twitter thread explaining why we were doing this. It was to reduce our exposure to Celsius and not because we were not trusting another. In a couple of weeks, we will see how the situation goes; depending on that, we could like to increase the debt ceiling again. That is on the communications plan. I have to check if the Twitter guy already posted that.  Prose11: Good question, Frank. Managing columns is a big part of these urgent situations. We were fortunate to do our mandate actors\u2019 meetings on Tuesdays. We are already planning to convene. At a different time, we would have to call a separate meeting to discuss our response. It is quick, Chris. They can handle their PR. We work with them for many things. We will keep that in mind; bear markets do get pretty crazy.   ElPro: I want to point out that the debt ceiling is unchanged from a technical perspective. There should still be a debt ceiling outstanding on the Aave D3M. Only a certain amount of Dai gets pushed into it by the D3M. If the bar were to be reset to something, we would not have to manage the debt ceiling unless we wanted to de-risk it slightly from what it was before. Prose11: We use that failsafe mechanism whenever we set the bar or change it again. We will react accordingly to that and to the DC, which I believe was 100 million. You can correct me if I am wrong.   Conclusion  Payton Rose 53:53  Thank you, everyone, for your time today. Nice having a lively discussion and a few topics from many different people. We will be here next week.  Suggestion Box  Credits  Andrea Suarez produced this summary.  @Harrizko  produced this summary. Larry Wu produced this summary.

This is episode #193 of our Governance and Risk call at MakerDAO. My name is Payton Rose, and I am a facilitator at the GovAlpha CU, one of the governance facilitators for the organization. I go by Prose11 online.   We are at our weekly G&R call. This is being recorded. So hello, if you are watching from YouTube later. This is a meeting where we get together, talk about what is going on with Maker, have some open discussions and dialogue, and try to keep everyone updated and informed.   A few ground rules. Before we get started, let us try not to talk over one another. There are a couple of useful facilitation tools that will help me out with running the meeting. One of them is the raise hand feature on Zoom. You can find that under reactions. If you would like to add a comment or question after whoever is speaking is done, go ahead and use that raise hand function, which will let me know I can call on you. Likewise, if you have something you would like to add but either cannot or do not want to come on the mic, you can always drop your comment in chat. We will also go through those. There is an agenda that we will be showcasing shortly. I will try to keep us to that agenda; if your comment or question does not quite fit in, we might have to wait till the open discussion section. We will try to get everyone\u2019s comments, questions, and concerns.   Our Agenda Today:  We will start with our governance roundup that includes the votes that have taken place. We will go on to the Maker improvement proposals and what is happening on the forum. We have a quick initiative update from me about Propritization Sentiment Polling. You might remember that being introduced a few weeks ago, and there has been an update. Finally, we have a pretty broad discussion topic today. Hopefully, it should be good to get a lot of different voices and opinions. That is going to be on visions for MakerDAO.

Patrick posted the link on there; thank you. It has already got some great discussion. Maybe some of that will carry over to today, but I did not want to spend too long on this unless there are many questions, just because we introduced it briefly a few calls ago.   Motivation1920\u00d71087 198 KB   As introduced a few weeks ago, the problem we face is that the governance can pass many things. Over 100 items have been passed and not actioned on if you count all the individual green light bulbs and sentiment things and the very soft balling we do. This is one way for MKR holders to tell CUs what they think they should be working on. But the problem with it is that you cannot define the prioritization. It basically just adds another one to the list, and the CUs try to figure out what we are capable of doing, what we feel would be a good use of our time, and then they come back and communicate that to the community. CUs have many methods for communicating their priorities. They can do it in informal updates and say what they are working on this week, this month, and this quarter. They can do it when they submit budget updates. They can say what they are going to use the funds for. And they can also do it in cross Core Unit and other Initiative Update calls. MKR holders do not have that option currently. All they can do is pass or reject items as they get put up for vote and governance. That is why this was a focus of GovAlpha, and we wanted to roll out this first trial.   Implementation1920\u00d71090 152 KB   The implementation will be in the form of month-long polls on the voting portal. They will be taking the rank choice format asking all MKR holders to rank their preference in terms of what items they would like to see prioritized. Then their voting weight will be applied just like it normally would in a poll. One slight issue with doing it this way is that rank choice polls are hard to visualize. You can imagine a long output list from a bunch of different delegates. You can look at them individually and see what individuals want to prioritize. But when it all comes together, at least traditionally, you are left with a single result. And that is the winner once a 50% plus consensus has been reached. As a way of counteracting that, we will display and break down the winner on a 50% basis and run to the natural conclusion of the instant runoff vote format. For those unfamiliar, the way that works is that a vote takes place each round. Everyone\u2019s top preference is included in their vote. And then the last item is dropped off on each round. Again, traditionally, this is until you get to a point where at least 50% is in support of the top candidate. But in addition to doing that, we are going to run into the end with running the instant runoff choices dropping the last one. And that will give us a reverse order of how delegates and other voters rank their priorities.   Technical Resource Deployment Poll Options1920\u00d71082 193 KB   The other important point is that we will be using multiple polls. So that way, we can pull on specific items. The first will be the Technical Resource Deployment. This is essentially the idea that in terms of ideas and things we want to implement, some are soft or on the social layer, and some are perhaps on the procedural layer. But we will start with the technical layer because there are only so many people that can work on items that will be implemented into the code base. What should they be spending their time on? We came up with this list of 12 items from things that have either been proposed to the community formally through a vote or the ideation phase and have captured sentiment or tend to pop up in one way or the other, as well as some input from relevant CUs. To quickly go through the list:  The Flapper Distributor/upgrade to the flapper is the idea of splitting funds. And its revenues coming into the protocol go straight to the Surplus Buffer. Or, if the Surplus Buffer is full, they will go into the burner. Flapper Distributor could say distribute 25% to the burner, well 75 goes to the surplus. That is just a random example. You can set up several things, I am sure. The Sagittarius Engine, which is the tokenomics framework Rune proposed. And then a broader category of Collateral Onboarding, which we will discuss later. The Compound D3M is probably the D3M implementation we are the closest to in terms of CUs and what has been voted in and worked on so far. Then, there is MIP43, the Term Lending Module(TLM). That is another fixed-rate option. Remember that we have the Deco CU working on a fixed-rate solution, but MIP43 was passed first but never implemented. Then there is Maker Teleport which is the idea of a hopping dive between L1 and L2 and, eventually, between other L2s, which is a prerequisite for other L2 deployments of MCD. Next, we have DssKiln, the mechanism for using a stagnated buy. You can set for token swaps that can be used for buying the protocol ETH, used as a different way to set up buybacks of MKR, essentially just a module that would allow the protocol to swap one asset for another over a predefined period. There is DssSnog which I was happy to see came up in the Discord today. That would be a method for pushing some of the Oracle maintenance outside of the executive spells. Next, we have DssGate as a mechanism for establishing a sandbox, an area where people could develop with limited Dai exposure for specific costs. We have seen that with Deco, their experience in iterations on the fixed-rate side can be applied to many things. Next, we have the Vox: Target Price Adjustment Module. This is ideal for negative rates. That has not come up for quite a while, but it is one of the older technical MIPs passed in. We have ESM Simulations, and this is the idea that we have this mechanism called Emergency Shutdown. People can submit to it. However, what would happen in an Emergency Shutdown? We have a pretty good idea of what we have yet to simulate. So that would be a technical load for figuring out how that process would work. And finally, we have a Technical Solution to Returning \u201cLost\u201d DAI. Similar to the signal David brought up a little earlier today, this idea that people tend to send tokens to contract addresses, coming up with a technical implementation for fixing that can be quite helpful.   That is a long list of items. I do apologize for that. But hopefully, that gives you an idea of at least what they are and why they were included.   Collateral Class Sentiment Poll Options1920\u00d71074 105 KB   With the actual function of how the poll works. In this individual poll, we would have voters rank their options. They would only like the ones that they support and would like to see prioritized. At the end of the month, we would drop off the underperforming bowls, essentially the last two, and any work that could reasonably be considered complete. And then replace them with new ones. Earlier, I said: remember to put a little pen in the collateral onboarding. And that is because this is our first attempt to test these nested poll options. In the first poll, you can rank where you want the collateral onboarding prioritized. And then, on the second poll, you could express sentiment on what types of collateral classes you would like to see prioritized. The idea is that if collateral ends up being at the top of the list, you would want to know which collateral you want to work on. We have Broader Market Demand-Based Solutions (Aave D3M is a good example). Then Real-World Assets Vaults: you can think of New Silver or some of the traditional vaults like 6x we have not placed now. 6x might be slightly more of an arranger, so that I will stick with the New Silver option. Real-World Asset Arrangers, we have seen the arranger model, the idea of lending to a group, and further lending. We have Core Crypto Collateral (BTC and ETH implementations and derivatives). Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral, so anything that is not ETH, but that is an ERC20. Crypto Collateral from other chains. This could be L2s or other side chains. You name it. Traditional instruments (Bonds/Treasuries). And finally, Peg Stability Solutions. The idea is that this will give MKR holders a way to input their preferences, and then CUs will have some data to say: well, voters tend to wipe this solution, or they tend to think we should be focusing more on this. And then they can either say: we agree, and we will start working on that, or we disagree, and we are not going to work on that, and here is why. So it is important to note that these are nonbinding. It is simply a way to gather data and have the MKR holders communicate some of their sentiments toward people building on the protocol. Are there any questions that have not been addressed? Feel free to hop on the mic if someone wants to cut one out.  29:17  David Utrobin: Something that Kianga brings up in the chat is a feeling of being overwhelmed by all of the choices. So it is challenging to keep up with actual votes and communicate the reasoning. But then, on top of that, trying to rank priority on technical projects or collateral stuff gives a feeling of overwhelmedness.  29:47  Joshua: You just went through the slides and described the background for each item. It would be helpful to have maybe that transcribed and expanded to inform the voters so they can make intelligent choices in the polls.  Payton Rose: I agree. The short descriptions will be what is there for the actual vote. But the text of the polls that we are putting up will have broader descriptions and links to things to describe this. I think it is important to address the feelings of overwhelmingness. Perhaps we have too many options, or we could limit it to shorter polls in the future. This will be our first code to see how this is working. And if this is a viable model to continue to deploy some resources towards. On the flip side, for CUs, the overwhelmingness is shared. Because these are all things that have been talked about, advocated for, or even passed by the community, part of this goal is to get a little more focused input on what is important from all the things discussed.    31:22  Tim Schuppener: I think the list is not overwhelming. I get why Kianga is coming from that point. Honestly, I would have been in the same situation two years back. More important is that effective CUs that have a particular interest in some topic being pushed forward, or maybe even put down from the list or put lower to list, advocate for the decision and point out why they think this needs special treatment or attention. The context is more visible for those voting on that stuff. Let us take an example if Nadia would advocate for something really important from her growth perspective. And the delegate is saying: I am pushing more on topics that are helpful for growth than security, for example. It is a bad example. But you get my point. This is going to influence the decision-making process there. This is vital because those items are not necessarily the perfect items. But we have some space where the people affected by this voting can make their point and advocate for that. Maybe there could be some consolidated format. Somebody will have a good idea of how this could be visualized. But the list is pretty decent. I would be able to work with that.  Payton Rose: I appreciate that feedback. Just to briefly respond, I think CUs can communicate. We organize these calls. We can hop on and say: MKR holders are right now supporting this option. But we think that is a bad idea because we feel this is more important. Hopefully, the voting and these topic categories will spur further discussion. And then we will be able to work from there.    33:28  Wouter: This is a great experiment. In our discussions that we have had, one of the things that came up the most is the CUs looking for clear direction and what the priorities should be. This is a very useful and needed experiment. There is one thing I am wondering about, which is the question of resource allocation. It is quite a technical question as a technical planning question. For example, the kind of questions that came up in the chat, which is the priority of a certain item, depends on what is on the critical path, when it is needed, how much work it is, etc. And one way, I think there are good ideas to ensure that the people who need to execute the work can provide the necessary context. But still, maybe one thing we should consider, instead of prioritizing technical solutions, is to prioritize challenges, problems, and opportunities that we should focus on. And then what a technical solution is the most efficient one. What a critical path is, whether useful or not, to allocate resources for it today. That is more of a technical planning question. To take the example that was given in the chat, let us say Deco is the absolute priority for MakerDAO; if people want that, then still, it could be that it does not make sense to work on DssGate next week because maybe they only need it in six months, and maybe there is some audit work that will push other important work aside, while it is pointless to do it now. Instead of leaving that technical planning puzzle to the voters, one thing to consider might be to select a collection of high-level challenges, opportunities, and problems that we need to focus on and poll on that level. And then leave it to our organizational framework to devise the right resource allocation mix to prioritize a certain challenge or opportunity to work on.  36:25  Payton Rose: That is a great suggestion, Wouter, and definitely one we consider. It would probably be appropriate if I could provide a little context on why we went with this implementation. Essentially, it was to get feedback as quickly as possible with actionable solutions. One worried about doing the broader categories for direction, and that sort of thing was that let us say, Dai generation is the winning option. There are ten different ways we could generate Dai. Having that poll may not necessarily help CUs allocate the resources. That said, it would probably spur the discussion to get to that answer. That is probably a great starting point for the polls for our second run. Another intentional design decision was to make the technical role as specific as possible and then have the collateral poll, which we chose to be collateral class to be much more general. And that was to get feedback and say, both CUs and voters, do you like the more specific or broader list? And that will also help us set up for future iterations of this. The only other thing I wanted to add was that since these polls are ongoing, the nice thing is we can respond to them in real-time, people can shift their sentiments as work gets completed or more information becomes available, then voters can respond to that. The idea is that this is hopefully like a living feedback mechanism, rather than just a static one.  38:23  Tim Schuppener: This holds even for the approach that Wouter is putting out. Not voting on particular items on a to-do list, but on the direction we want to go. I would also favor the ( )(38:39) that Wouter is bringing up. But we can evolve to that at some point in time.  Wouter: I wanted to add one more clarification there. The point about prioritizing challenges and problems is that this does not give instruction about which solutions should be built. To a certain degree, that is a very valid point. But even on that level, there is a big difference between highlighting a high-level opportunity or a solution and not specifying a specific implementation. This is often complicated because it is a gradient. Some items on the list are already more high level than others. And also the interpretation of the vote. That is the level of detail as a valid discussion. I hope that we can push it to a high level as possible. But then the other thing is the interpretation of the outcome of the vote. I do not think the best outcome would be that the expectation is that now everyone drops what they are doing and they start working on number one on the list. Because of the critical path problem I mentioned, it is not smart to work on some items if you do not need them soon enough. For example, you might be very ineffective because the information is unavailable. Or it might just be something you can build now but will only be able to use in six months. Maybe we should think about the intended interpretation of the vote and how CUs are supposed to work with the outcome. I want to interpret if we have an outcome that gives a list of priorities to ensure that the critical path is executed as fast as possible. That, for example, is already a more nuanced interpretation. It leaves a lot more room for optimizing the plan.    41:38  Payton Rose: Again, the goal is to spur conversation and let this be a data source for CUs to do but not say: voters express their sentiment, why are not you following the list? Because there might be a mismatch in information. Something really important to voters, maybe the CUs have not realized that and have not explained why they have not been giving updates or putting priority on that.  Chris (42:13)(x?): It is granted that we can do whatever for this iteration. But the nice side effect of Wouter\u2019s approach is that we document across CUs and MKR holders and all the stakeholders what we think the problems and opportunities are, in general, even if we do not rank them. There is an enormous benefit in just understanding that list. Some of you, in private conversations, have probably noticed me talking about generalized problems that Maker has, and I have been pushing the problems I see into your heads so that when you are out reading research papers are seeing things in DeFi, that might be the perfect solution for one of those, like, it pops up and then you can surface it. That can happen that wide if we sort of push these major problems out. It is a nice side effect that we all get to think abstractly about that sort of problem/solution space. Then ranking would be like a bonus on top of that.    43:42  Tim Schuppener: A few points about this interpretation of this thing. So the correct amount of anarchy in every system is above zero. If something is losing and the poll position goes to place number three, that does not mean that anybody should stop working. If you are top of the list, let us say we have DssGate on the top of the list, and it is not on the critical path. And at some point, Maker would have some material for a discussion and say: hey, now it is going to the critical path. And since it is ordered on top, we have a pointer into a fast-forward mode with this topic. We should not be dogmatic about the interpretation of this thing. It is more about the temperature check and some justification that somebody can discuss between a different CU focusing on a different problem or challenge. That is the biggest thing; that would be good enough for now. But we should not be dogmatic, and nobody should stop working on topic number two just because topic number one is there. There is still some common sense to be applied.  Payton Rose:  Awesome. All this feedback is super valuable. We will learn a lot from just trying to give this a go and seeing what results from it. I appreciate the community\u2019s willingness to experiment. We have a big discussion topic following this. I did not want to take too much more time. However, if there are urgent questions or concerns, I will give one more chance for them to be brought up.    45:25  Eric Rapp: I like this. But when people think about Collateral Class Sentiments, and there will be voting, if you do not present, what is the total addressable market, what is the risk, what is the technical implementation, what is the timeline, it feels a little too idealized and abstract. Because ultimately, these are all potential actions, they will have economic upsides or downsides. And they are competing in a certain sense. If I were a big Maker holder, I would say, \" Oh, this is great, but you need to guide me on the pros and cons and start lining them up and ranking what you think is the best bang for your buck for the protocol.\" However, \u201cI like Real-World Assets better than Core Crypto\u201d does not say much. I need to have an investment thesis around effort in both, or I am talking randomly. It needs to be an informed set of alternatives. If it is not, I do not think you are doing much favor to anyone. It is like, what is today\u2019s flavor? I go to the store and am excited by a flavor, but I do not have a deep insight into the pros and cons of the various choices. That is a fundamental problem. Because at the end of the day, the DAO must allocate resources and capital. You can just think of capital period: human capital, or financial capital, whatever it is, across competing projects and priorities. How do you decide what is in the best interest of the community? But how do they make informed decisions? Maybe I like this one word better than another word. That is not a great way to vote? People need to provide meaningful guidance to the community and our voters on this, or I do not think it serves much help. The idea is good, but it is got to be informed. Or it is not helping with the spiraling complexity. Let me put it that way. There is a whole other discussion that you will probably need more specialized delegates and voters because not everyone can be an expert on everything. Some delegates might know half of the dead cold. Maybe they can help explain it. But ultimately, there has got to be a way to make informed votes, or we would end up being idiocracy, which I do not think is a great way to clap the future.  Payton Rose: I appreciate this point. Thanks for jumping in. I do not want to present this as a silver bullet. Hopefully, this is the start of better prioritization input, and it will be made better thanks to all your feedback. Thank you. We will start to move on. So we can get to all the cool stuff David has prepared. There is the forum thread. Please visit that and drop additional or reiterate these thoughts if you want to continue the discussion.     Discussion  Vision for MakerDAO  David Utrobin 48:38  Hello to everybody. Today, I want to ask, what is a vision? Vision is typically a picture of an achieved end state. It is something that aligns people. It is something that acts as a guiding principle. Vision produces inspiration and motivation and drives coordination in organizations. Visions are dynamic, and they end up changing with context often. Many of us in the room today have been inspired by one of Maker\u2019s many visions over the years. But the question is, which vision am I talking about? Because Maker has had several. Today, judging by the conversation in the community, it seems like there is not a clear vision anymore that everybody is captured by. During this segment, we will be taking a very basic look at Maker\u2019s vision over the years, intending to explore which of Maker\u2019s historic visions are still in play, which have we already achieved, and where are we heading? A part of that will be just a series of three short polls, asking people some of the foundational questions that were very important to the early days of Maker. Discussions are invited to align us on the greater context of vision at Maker. Understanding its history is the first step to understanding how we should try to drive the vision forward from this point on. Let me go through a short history from my perspective. The very first vision was to solve volatility on the blockchain. Rune\u2019s classic e-dollar post on the Ethereum subreddit kick-started that back in March 2015. And then it turned into not only do we solve volatility? That is the stablecoin vision. Now, we want to do it in the best way. We want to create the best stablecoin, a trustless stablecoin that is asset-backed, censorship-resistant, and a hard currency. That was Sai into Dai. That was 2017 into 2018. And then, as MCD came about and the DSR came about, the vision became, not only are we solving volatility in the blockchain, and we are in this great stablecoin, but also Ethereum\u2019s decentralized central bank with retail-accessible risk-free rate. We serve the underserved. We are financial services available for all. We were this permissionless financial primitive in the landscape of the global economy. Then, the vision was simplified because we realized, previously, that it was a little hard, especially with rising gas costs. Dai is an unbiased world currency. This was towards the tail end of the foundation\u2019s life. This effort was to re-align everybody around the Maker protocol\u2019s central product, Dai. After that, there was Rune\u2019s Case for Clean Money, which also supported the idea that this is the best stablecoin not only is this something that solves volatility, not only is this asset-backed and censorship-resistant, but it is something that actually can have pragmatic, positive effects on the world. There was this vision of more RWA, not just real-world assets, but more like ESG and Clean Money Assets. This was not super Central or macro, but it was an interesting and important vision. That leads us to where we are today. Since then, all of these visions have been fulfilled, and some have not been fulfilled to their full extent. And some are just in straight-up research and development like RWA, ESG assets, and even getting Dai to become that trustless, truly decentralized stablecoin is a lot. What we are seeing in the conversation around the centralization of governance power right now and wanting more delegates like we want the management of the protocol itself to be decentralized. That brings us to where we are today. This was a helpful context for me to understand where we have been and where we are today.     Vision1920\u00d71077 220 KB   In the next part of this, I want to ask three questions. The first is: Is Maker\u2019s primary goal to make DAI the #1 stablecoin?   Poll 11920\u00d71074 74.5 KB   How do we define number one? That is super subjective. I am just curious from the highest level. Is this a goal? Does your mother think, \u201cI will not use my credit cards today? I will use Dai.\u201d We have 27 responses. Thank you all for participating. Keep it up. We have about 50 people on the call, so shoot a quick answer. It looks like 60% are yes, about 20% are no, and another 20% abstains.   Poll 21920\u00d71078 105 KB   Let me move on to the next poll. Poll 2: Should Dai remain decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless, borderless money? It is okay if you are mixed about any of these. They are meant to be high-level and subjective polls. Here it is 92% yes. So far, with 27%, we do not know yet. They are meant to be loaded. I am curious about the no\u2019s here. Who says no? There is one person and about 32 responses. Give it maybe ten more seconds, and we will close it up. An overwhelming majority still believe that Dai should remain a decentralized censorship-resistant permissionless and borderless money. Almost unanimous.   Poll 31920\u00d71081 77.4 KB   Poll 3: Should MakerDAO focus on the unbanked as a primary user? One of the visions over the years has been to serve the underserved and utilize DeFi as this permissionless global financial tool. So far, of 25 people who responded, about 80% are saying no. The way that the question is asked needs to be put in context. The unbanked cannot be a primary user right now, just by Ethereum. I should have probably asked the same question a couple of ways. It might be an interesting way we could play around with the utility of these polls. Although they are not MakerDAOs primaries now, it might still be valuable in the community to prioritize them as a very important user group in the future when we scale to retail products, L2s, and stuff. Here is 12% yes. Then 70% no, and 18% abstain. I want to open it up from here. You guys have seen the vision so far. Maybe it would be good to focus on maybe one of the more interesting polls. Between two and three, those had the most interesting results. Poll 2: Should Dai remain decentralized censorship-resistant permissionless, borderless money; that was an overwhelming yes. At the same time, some aspects of the Maker protocol are not decentralized, which are permission like the RWA. How does this fit into MakerDAO\u2019s vision for the future? How does it coexist with the permission side of the protocol?  1:01:33  Mariano: I am more interested in Poll 1. It is a long discussion that I have been having with a lot of MKR community members. Dai as a stablecoin, a byproduct of the protocol, is not the main thing we should push. I have been working here for almost five years. In every Dai use case that you could imagine, one of the first things I saw that is a total lie is serving the underserved. Probably in all little places of Latin America, the underserved do not have the financial literacy to understand what an application internet is, even less what a cryptocurrency is. Serving the underserved is a total lie. That thing does not exist. Dai, being a stablecoin, or us trying to compete against USDC or USDT, does not have any sense. They are on RAMPS. We are a technological operative system for stablecoins. It is a completely different thing. We are an over-collateralized thing. USDC and USDT are just on RAMPS. They are financial companies. We are a technological entity. They are financial companies. And they have a growth rate and pace that we will match anytime. Then, do you have to understand how the financial market works. This is one of the things that sometimes amaze me that not many people know, but when you talk about OTC companies, with banks, with financial companies, they sell their model for one basis point of rebate. We cannot compete with USDC and USDT in that regard. We will always be more expensive. We will always have less supply than USDT and USDC. It is way different what they do from what we do. That is why I always said that our main focus is not to make Dai the number one stablecoin but to make the Maker protocol the easiest and the cheapest way to get credit. Then we can fill the world with Dai. That stablecoin level is a liquidity game, not a demanding game. No one demands stablecoins. No one demands, only emerging markets. Here in Argentina, we had the shittiest economy in the world. We demand that because our peso is shit. If you talk about volume and the things that matter, no one in the world demands stablecoins. There is only liquidity, not demand. And liquidity is just a thing of time. If we make the Maker protocol and Maker vault the best thing to get a decentralized credit, we will fill the world with Dai. That is our goal, not to make Dai the number one or whatever thing that people would choose because it is decentralized. No. No one is choosing decentralization over liquidity. It is always gone, first liquidity and then decentralization. As a community, we have to be all together in this idea. Because if not, we will have all this first effort thinking or acting in a wishful way, saying Dai is the best thing when it is not. The best thing needs to be the Maker vault.  David Utrobin: Thanks for that perspective, Mariano. That resonates with me. I have always considered the Maker protocol to have three main lines of products: stablecoin, Dai, vaults, and Oracle\u2019s. I thought: \u201cThese are the three verticals that MakerDAO has.\u201d Payton Rose: It circles back to user experience. The people using your product care about how smooth it is. We see these adoptions of chains that have some fundamental problems, that do not lack decentralization but cannot stay up all the time. And we still have users flocking to them because they are cheaper, quicker, and easier to understand. The complexity is probably not just present for CUs in our organization but also falls to the end-user.    1:07:14  Chris: I do not disagree with everything that was said there. I care very much about Dai being the sort of the number one global unbiased world currency. Because I have certain conjectures about where I think the future is headed. We get little snapshots of exactly what is coming. The future will be littered with central bank digital currencies, and there will be some of the worst possible things humanity has ever experienced regarding liberty and freedom. Our ability to transact is essential to exercising our rights. And you can already see with many of the movements with sort of global sanctions regimes where exactly things are headed. At this particular moment, I agree Dai may not have that use case. In the longer-term vision, that is exactly the type of user we should be targeting. Probably other technical problems on the way there make it not viable. We should be looking for technical solutions that make things cheaper for end users. Specifically, I care very much about users that are non-technical altogether. Some of you have heard me talk about creating a system where users can print Dai notes on their home printers and then exchange them with their neighbors. There is much innovation. The world is going to need a solution to that problem. But the bigger problem in the short term is that you need to balance the equation. You cannot just have insane amounts of Dai adoption without being this sort of decentralized permissionless credit facility for people. You need to increase supply. You cannot increase supply without increasing demand. There is this double helix dance that we have to do with supply and demand on the way there. We cannot immediately start minting all kinds of Dai for RWA and dump it on the market. We would break the peg. We would not have the capability of balancing that supply and demand. I am maybe adding color to it. This is a good conversation to have. Because maybe our visions are not aligned. Or maybe we have to talk about timeframes when discussing vision alignment.  David Utrobin: The question is mostly timeframe. Focusing on the vault is a very important or even central product. At this stage of the protocol might not be the worst idea in the world, improving the user experience on every level at the Maker protocol, governance, auctions, drawing Dai from a vault, etc. The actual vaults that we have everything might be leading up to the day that a permissionless decentralized, trustless; the world needs all that censorship-resistant currency. Which is that feature you are foreseeing, Chris.    1:11:31  Eric: It is a fair question: Do we want Dai to be the number one stablecoin? Or do we want Dai to be the number one decentralized stablecoin, which is a different question? Having spent too much time in different ventures over the years, I want to stress that these cryptocurrencies have a substantial economy of scale and network effect. People know this. Let me say it anyway. I do not see that you will have dozens of currencies at scale. They will probably be a handful, but the bigger ones will dominate. Other ones will die on the line. When I look at this, we should be promoting active Dai demand growth and organic demand growth. However, we do that. When I look at our risks, I sometimes think that one of the biggest risks is not growing fast enough. I am not saying grow stupid. But if we are safe and conservative and do not grow Dai demand aggressively, some other folks will grow demand for their currencies, and we could just shrivel on the line because we never really hit scale with huge network effects. So much of what we want to do in the long term depends on having a business at a scale that works well. It is great to have all these other visions, and I like them, but when you are still trying to get to scale, I think it is premature to focus on too many other things. You want to work on becoming the number one, some type of coin. Is it a number one DeFi coin? We can argue about that. But if we do not have a vision of how to build this big and hit network and economies of scale, there is a real risk; that it will not make it to scale. It will not be able to do any of these broader visions if it does not get big into scale.  1:14:02  David Utrobin: Judging by the sounds, let us move on to poll number two. Should DAI remain decentralized, censorship-resistant, permissionless, borderless money? This one had almost unanimity? But the feeling in the community has been that some aspects of this are being sacrificed for growth. Does anybody have thoughts on that?  1:14:38  Someone: Maybe I can constrain the discussion a little bit here. Because Dai and the token itself, let us say these end-users that will have all this demand for the token that they exchange is the thing that it specifically should have these attributes. There is an argument that we should probably also have these attributes for Dai generation, so for vaults being the thing that creates Dai. But the technical reality is that it is pretty much impossible. It is not impossible, but it would mean the protocol goes completely immutable today if we were to yank governance permissions on the core of MCD. Maybe in a longer-term vision, we can talk about that for vaults for having these attributes. But in this case, we are just talking about Dai. Does anybody see any future compromises or anything that would compromise these attributes on the Dai token itself?  1:16:13  Kianga Daverington: It is maybe connected or an answer to Chris. I love this as the core value or vision. But, what is the strategy? And then what are the tactics? To Eric\u2019s point, in anything we decide, any timeframe, let us check to make sure that in the future, we are protecting this attribute at the core of what will exist in the world? Then think about, can we iterate different models, different types of Dai? Maybe it will be Dai that is clean or Dai that is permission to serve a particular market, but can we evolve that while still providing this central function to the world of permissionlessness? If we dominate in permission, centralized coin, that is not necessarily the kind of network effects or moat that maybe we want to achieve. But perhaps some strategy or timeline says different versions of Dai or different versions of business lines will help us get there. This is a great conversation. We need to take the vision, then back to kind of tactics and strategy. For me, Poll 2, this idea that if we all disappeared tomorrow, would there be something in the world that is operating and serving humanity? If that does not sound too absurd?  Eric: This is the critical issue, honestly. I have been digesting the struggles at Maker. I see us wanting to grow dramatically, and I also see various elements of centralization dramatically creeping in. It is one of the reasons I wanted to focus on my growth vision: let us do a dramatic change with Maker 3.0 and use multiple Maker incarnations to achieve different goals and synergize so that we could have the decentralized Maker that does the stuff here in number two. And we can synergize it with a Maker 3.0 that has centralized stuff. To grow massively and drag Maker to with it. We have been struggling with this core question: fighting to maintain this and doing much growth. It is a really important discussion to have. We need to solve it. Otherwise, we will continue to struggle. We need to solve this core issue and resolve it so that we can drive forward with the strategy and goals to get to what we are trying to achieve. If we have two sets of goals, two sets of makers might work for that, right? They can synergize with each other. I do not know. It is just an idea. Chris: I wanted to add some context. Dai itself is a fungible token. We all know that that is a little bit of a lie that we all tell ourselves with Bitcoin and Dai and all the other ERC20s that are perfectly privacy-preserving coins because you can always determine where the source of funds is. As long as Dai is open, introspective, and transparent, there will be markets that may pop up where all the participants in that market, let us say, our KYCed, or institutions that have gone through this sort of rigor of KYCing. And it is certainly possible that for that market, we can allow pristine Dai to be minted, that is such that no counterparty would need to be kind of KYC. We get at least this narrow focus of if there is a market that requires sort of permission actors, you have the flexibility to make either a vault or some Dai generation mechanism for those markets, where the Dai itself still has those attributes, where it is permissionless, censorship-resistant and decentralized. But it would be injected directly into those markets. That might help. That starts to answer maybe both of those previous discussions, but where Maker itself does not have to compromise on those values for Dai, which I do not think it ever should. But where we can also possibly have a role in those markets. Eric: I think Chris has a spot on point where the principal is we want permissionless. But we have not seen the regulatory actions by the big countries yet. And this is very theoretical until we see the EU, the US, or someone, make a big change. And we can be presented that we are out of the market completely if we stay 100% pure. Chris suggested a way where you split the difference? Do you find a way to still be relevant in that market? Or do you stay true to your underlying principles and leave that market? That is a really good question. I would tend to want to find a way to work with that market if it is a big one. Because I think if you start to move away from big markets, you start losing relevance, as long as you are not giving up your core values. That is an important question. Chirs: I do not think where the markets are headed in the future, at least in the traditional sense, is anything anyone will want to participate in. We are much better off trying to build a better financial system, even if that means we might need to languish in irrelevance for some years. This entire thing will get so captured that it will be such a blight on human liberty, especially as we give centralized powers the ability to determine what you can and cannot spend money on and whom they do and do not take money from. Who can and cannot exercise their rights. For the most part, we need to be building the escape hatch. When they lock that cage around everyone, Maker should be firmly outside of it. David Utrobin: It is like the whole value prop of crypto. It is a really good context for Maker.    1:24:52  Payton Rose: To your point, kind of kicking off the conversation, Chris. There are a lot of different vectors where we could come under attack not only from the collateral but from our organizational structure, smart contracts, and social entanglements. So it is something we have to stay vigilant on. And I appreciate conversations like this for aligning vision and helping bring up some of those risks.  If anyone wanted to watch a great talk from the early days of ETHDenver in 2019, Andreas Antonopoulos gives a great talk on the difference between \u201cCan\u2019t and Won\u2019t.\u201d The TLDR is that we have to be able to say we cannot do something, as opposed to we will not do something. Eventually, the pressure will get so great that the \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d is not going to cut it. At least for Dai, it comes down to answering those questions and sticking to them. We are certainly in a \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d scenario for vault generation. But there are several technical strategies you can also employ to be an account scenario. David Utrobin: We are at a point where we have to define the core and lock it down.    1:26:30  Eric: I got a key question. I think that should go to the Maker voters. That will be a hotly debated question. There will be a lot of big Maker holders who will see that as profit minimizing and might not be on board. I am a bit agnostic myself. I think that needs to be well debated and fully voted on. That has strong implications for short, and medium-term growth and profitability.  1:27:30  Payton Rose: Things are quieting down, and I feel bad for going over. I appreciate all of the discussion that went into today\u2019s call. You could go there using polls before and after. This was for our very fun experiment that seemed it helps spur engagement. Please do consider leaving feedback both on the forums and our Discord. We will continue to iterate and hopefully make for even more engaging and better feedback loops for these calls.  David Utrobin: I already sent some of the stuff I prepared for this call to a handful of people. If you are interested in playing a more active role, giving feedback, and improving the slides. GovComms has a budget for contributors. And if you want to take an hour out of your week and help us ask better questions around pertinent topics, please contact me.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:28:44  Awesome. I think we will wrap up there. Thanks for joining us. We will be around the same time, the same place next week. Please continue the discussions and feedback. And thanks, everyone, for giving us some of your time today. Thank you.
