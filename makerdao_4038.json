For some selected time frame calculate.  pools offered executives offered  for each wallet calculate % of pools voted on, % of executives supported.  Then for the wallet of interest and over the time period specified give a %pool vote participation number and %executive participation number.  Make graphs of these with weekly or monthly bin periods.  Or even per governance pool/executive cycle (as a number vs. date). Then what would be nice is to use the above data to calculate over the period something like a %MKR participation rate as follows. Amount of MKR that did vote on a poll/Total of MKR that could. Sum this up over all polls and divide by the number of polls to normalize it as a %MKR voting per poll Do the same for executives. ",
