Is one cheaper overall? Will I get more $UNI for my money if I just purchase it directly? Is maxing my amount of owned $UNI even a good idea? I am thinking maybe mining is good because you get the interest + $UNI. Buying $UNI would be good to maximize owned $UNI? Any thoughts/insight appreciated. ",

It most likely depends on how much liquidity you provide in the pool & how much is provided in total, as rewards will be distributed evenly. There\u2019s some good info under \u2018liquidity mining\u2019 here: https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/. Myself, I\u2019m looking to purchase more $UNI in the near future. Most likely around $2-2.5, I\u2019m expecting this to hit shortly as many people immediately try to cash out their \u2018airdrop\u2019. I can\u2019t tell you which provides you better returns, can tell you that mining is most likely less risky as you\u2019re not directly putting your capital at risk. You\u2019d only be able to lose out on the swap rates (e.g. if you provide liquidity on USDT/ETH and ETH goes down in value). ",
