                    "content": "Recently, Oracle CU has posted an interesting proposal for the community:    MIP40c3-SP75: Modify Oracles Core Unit Budget, ORA-001   Budget Cost-Cutting The Oracle Core Unit recognises the active discussions being had in the community around cutting costs. Therefore the Oracle Core Unit is proactively reducing its budget by 10%. There are however several parallel initiatives in the community for slashing core unit budgets. It is unclear at this point in time whether these cuts will target specific core units, specific initiatives, or just a universal haircut across all core units. The Oracle Core Unit needs to balance being a good citizen and proactively reducing its budget with the real risk that further cost cutting initiatives could place it in \u2018double jeopardy\u2019. Therefore, the Oracle Core Unit is adding the clause to this budget renewal that should the proposed reduced budget be approved that the Oracle Core Unit is exempt from further budget reductions for 12 months. Should voters find that compromise unfavourable, they are able to vote for the previous year\u2019s budget and reduce it through the DAO-wide cost-cutting initiatives which are underway.   Considering many of the community recognizes that the budget adjustment is needed but at the same time, prefer flexibility and also certainty. It might be a good compromise between different opinions as both some hawk and dove delegates seem to agree. The following comments were made by dove @flipflopflapdelegate and hawk @JustinCase  image1274\u00d7228 47.5 KB   Pros:  Cutting cost Give CUs freedom to choose where to cut within their budget More certainty (and thus better planning) at least for a year (if the cut rate is the same across CUs) More fairness as all CUs get the same cut percentage   Cons:  As this functions as a budget cut and a budget freeze, CUs\u2019s function might decrease Might be unfair for CUs that run lean budget requests compared to CUs that requested a lot above actual spendings. (if the cut rate is the same across CUs) some CUs that could have cut more spending now have less incentive to cut more than the uniform rate. (if the cut rate is the same across CUs) some CUs might not be able to take such cut rates as their initial budget might be very tight.   Next Steps The following informal poll will run for 1 week. If a majority of forum voters (excluding abstain votes) are in favor, I will work with interested community members to try to prepare formal proposals.    Is Voluntary Budget Adjustment in exchange for 1 year guarantee a good idea to pursue?  Yes, it\u2019s a good idea to pursue No, it\u2019s not a good idea to pursue Abstain     0 voters        What should be a minimum budget decrease to qualify for Voluntary Budget Adjustment in exchange for 1 year guarantee?  10% 20% 30% 40% Abstain     0 voters        Should such rate for minimum budget decrease to qualify for Voluntary Budget Adjustment in exchange for 1 year guarantee apply uniformally to CUs?  Yes, the minimum qualifying rate should be the same for all CUs No, the minimum qualifying rate should not be the same for all CUs Abstain     0 voters     ",
