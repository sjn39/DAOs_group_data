This amendment broadens the D3M to external protocols that allow users to deposit / withdraw DAI. The targeting mechanism was amended to make it more flexible. Details that were restrictive were removed. MIP50c1 was amended to describe the three components that make up the D3M:  D3MHub: the primary manager component D3MPool: an adapter that withdraws/deposits Dai on the external protocol following D3MHub instructions D3MPlan: it determines the target debt and communicates it to the D3MHub so that action is taken to reach this target debt as soon as possible.   This amendment does not include an onboarding component. Protocols wishing to utilize the D3M will continue to be directed to the established collateral onboarding process. This amendment has been assigned Medium-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  ",
