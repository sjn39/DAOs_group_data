                    "content": " Introduction In an effort to decentralize and explore new options for sustainably incentivizing work on the Maker Protocol, the Foundation tried using SourceCred to identify and reward meaningful contributions to Maker\u2019s forum. The following summarizes the results of the trial, presenting objective and subjective success metrics laid out in SourceCred\u2019s original proposal, as well as observations from the SourceCred team and plans for the next phase of the trial.  Executive Summary The trial has been a success. Both the objective engagement metrics on Maker\u2019s Discourse forum, and the subjective feedback in the form of user surveys from the Maker community seem to indicate that the SourceCred algorithm will be a valuable tool for rewarding contributors in a decentralized and incentive-compatible way. As a result, the Maker-SourceCred working group has decided to extend the trial for an additional three months. If the trial continues to be successful, a MIP will be put to MKR holders to decide whether SourceCred should be used to pay contributors directly from the protocol.  Objective Metrics The original proposal placed importance on the engagement metrics available in the Discourse Admin Panel. It was agreed that an overall increase in these metrics would serve as a good indicator of success. Conversely, decreases in engagement and/or overt gaming would be grounds for cancelling the trial. Our dataset consisted of a CSV file output by a Maker Discourse admin (@LongForWisdom) which provided daily numbers for every relevant engagement metric in the Discourse admin panel. The table below shows the percentage change for the most relevant metrics we analyzed. Note that this is using a 1st order linear regression model, which provides only a rough estimate.     Metric % Change (6/1 - 9/1)     Visits + 28%   Topics + 88%   Posts +120%   Likes +130%   Daily Engaged Users +70%   New Contributors +55%   Signups +2%   Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) + 2%    Below are charts showing a subset of these metrics. The raw CSV file with the full dataset, scripts for generating the tables and charts below, and additional charts can also be found in the Appendix.  Daily Engaged Users  1600\u00d7972 233 KB   Topics Created  1600\u00d71062 222 KB   Post Created  1600\u00d71027 201 KB   New Contributors  1600\u00d7974 205 KB  In addition to these metrics from Discourse, the amount of Cred created over time can also serve as a proxy for overall activity. If there is more Cred minted, there are more contributions that the SourceCred algorithm finds to be meaningful within the community. Below is a chart of total Cred created over time for the history of the Maker forum, which again shows a marked increase.  Total Cred  1600\u00d71041 112 KB  In general, we see an increase across all engagement metrics. There was also a slight growth in new users, though this was less pronounced.  Subjective Feedback To gauge subjective feedback, participants were sent a short survey at the end of the initial phase of the trial. Of the 24 contributors that opted into the trial, 17 responded. While the survey was opened up to the community at large, the only responses were from community members who had opted-in to the trial. Below are the survey questions and summaries of the responses.  Contributor Survey  How familiar are you with how SourceCred works (parameters, how to earn Cred, etc)? 1 = \u201cnot at all\u201d and 10 = \u201cvery familiar\u201d  RESPONSE: (17 responses) 5.5/10, General vibe is \u201csomewhat familiar\u201d but cloudy on details, might be good to follow up individually and offer links/information  How satisfied are you with the Cred scores assigned to contributions and contributors on the forum? 1 = \u201cscores were terrible\u201d and 10 = \u201cvery satisfied\u201d  RESPONSE: (15 responses) 7.1/10, General vibe is that it seemed ok enough, no red flags but some concerns about volume being rewarded over quality  On a scale of 1-10, how positive an impact has SourceCred had on the Maker Community? 1 = \u201cno positive impact\u201d and 10 = \u201cvery positive impact\u201d  RESPONSE: (15 responses) 6.6/10, General vibe is that it\u2019s a bit early to tell, some references made to a lack of SourceCred related buzz on the forum  How would you feel about expanding the use of SourceCred within Maker to other platforms such as Github and Maker Chat? 1 = \u201cterrible idea\u201d and 10 = \u201cgreat idea\u201d  RESPONSE: (16 responses) 6.2/10, General vibe is quite polarized for and against, Github raises the most questions and possibilities, some view chat as a valuable addition but some view it as more socializing that shouldn\u2019t be rewarded, a reference was made to directly rewarding MIPS  Do you, or would you prefer to receive MKR through SourceCred rather than DAI?  RESPONSE: (16 responses) 3 for MKR, 3 for DAI, 10 for No Preference, of those No Preference votes 3 advocated for 50/50 allocation, and several references made to leaving it up to users  Do you have any additional feedback about the SourceCred trial or ideas to improve SourceCred generally?  RESPONSE: The general vibe is \u201ckeep on doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d, but several ideas may bear surfacing: UI/UX/Dashboard improvements, several references to a need for FAQ/s ELI5\u2019s and general introductions, plug-ins for RocketChat and other social media platforms and IRL meetups, expand Cred to participation in Polls on the forum and Governance Voting in general  On a scale of 1 to 5, How was your onboarding process for receiving DAI through SourceCred? 1 = very difficult and 5 = very easy  RESPONSE: (16 responses) 4.6 , several references to UI/UX improvements and potential privacy concerns  Did the amount of money you received cause you to contribute more to the Maker forums?  RESPONSE: (15 responses) Most said it caused them to contribute some amount more, though a couple said it did not, due to simply not having time due to other commitments, or their primary motivation not being related to money. Contributors higher in the ranks (and thus paid more), were more likely to report contributing more. Highly paid professionals said it did not approach what they typically get paid hourly, and therefore contributing full-time was not viable at current payout levels. Some report slight changes in behavior; 1 person reported \u201cconsciously liking more posts\u201d, and another reporting, \u201cI would say it helps for more tedious posts.\u201d). Some want to experiment with higher payouts, while some think current levels are fine.  Do you feel the time you spend on Maker Governance is adequately rewarded through SourceCred?  RESPONSE: For highly paid professionals, the amount was not particularly material, though were generally appreciative of the \u201cpocket change\u201d or \u201cside gig\u201d. Some thought the reward was adequate, a few thought a pay bump would increase participation.  Conclusion We saw a clear increase in engagement and activity on the forum. It is not clear how much of this was attributable to SourceCred however. The trial period saw a boom in DAI demand due to the yield farming craze, leading to issues with the peg and an increase in governance work overall. This may have driven much of the new activity. We did however have several survey respondents report increasing their contributions due to the payouts, and the trial was generally well-received by contributors. In any case, it is a reminder that MakerDAO\u2019s governance will only grow over time as the DeFi ecosystem expands, as illustrated by the post by Planet_X which inspired SourceCred\u2019s initial engagement with the community.  1261\u00d7712 25.8 KB  We believe SourceCred has scaled the amount of work it can compensate contributors for while also furthering MakerDAO\u2019s goals around decentralization. Instead of increasing the workload (and potentially headcount) of Foundation employees engaged in a more centralized process, SourceCred has decentralized the valuation and compensation of contributions to the governance community at large participating on the forums.  Next Steps In the next phase of the trial, SourceCred will continue working with the Maker-SourceCred working group to tweak the algorithm and parameters as necessary, improve the Maker SourceCred instance UI, create documentation and educational content to make SourceCred easier to understand, and design a technical integration to propose to MKR holders via the MIPS process. Our next step will be gathering additional feedback from the Maker community and scoping out a technical integration. If you have any thoughts or opinions on the trial thus far, plans for the trial extension, technical integration, or anything else, please let us know by filling out the survey on the forum, messaging us privately at @sourcecred-trial-adm, or dropping by the SourceCred forum or chat!
