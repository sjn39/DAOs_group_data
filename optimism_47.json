                    "content": "Enabling $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network!    The  $OP token can be used to pay gas fees on the Optimism Network!. This is a major addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption and usage of the Optimism Network!. ETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change to $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount! Benefits The Optimism token already has significant utility on the network, and this improvement will unify usage of $OP as the fees token for all Optimism Networks. Currently, $OP is used for voting and delegating votes in the Optimism Network. This can incentivize bridging since we can airdrop a small amount of  $Op for first time users of the network. It will also prevent the need to bridge both ETH and  for Optimism Network usage. Additional benefits: Increased trading volume for $OP Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass Increase the price of the $OP. $Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets. Increased user choice on the network. Makes it easier for bridging. Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage Technical Details Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers, The Graph indexing, wallets, the gateway, and overall developer and user experience. We are proposing an opt-in strategy where users can, if they wish, pay for fees in $OP. This fee choice will be recorded in an L2 contract. Changing the fee token will require interacting with this feeChoice contract. To reduce friction points for new users, a second system of contracts will be built that allows users without ETH on L2 to change their fee setting to $OP, using a MetaTransaction, in which Optimism Network pays the ETH to change their fee token setting in return for OP from the user. This means that for new users, they will only need to bridge OP to Optimism to then use its full range of services, contracts, and DAPS What Does this Mean for User experience? If you want to continue to use ETH to pay for transactions on the Optimism Network, you don\u2019t have to do anything.If you want to pay for transactions in $OP, select $OP, and confirm the transaction. After that, all future transactions will be charged in $OP. Users will be able to switch between $OP and $ETH as the fee token.

You can see my general response to this idea over there - Change the use of OP tokens from a governance token to the main network token for gas payment - #13 by MinimalGravitas As for:     ApePrince:  using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!   This is impossible. Fees collected on Optimism are used directly to pay for writing to Ethereum mainnet. If you charge less fees there just wont be enough OP to sell for the ether the rollup needs to post it\u2019s proofs. The fees aren\u2019t arbitrary.     ApePrince:  Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers,   It would also destroy Ethereum equivalence, which is one of the main reasons that Optimism stands out against other optimistic rollups.

The prosperity of L2 depends on the prosperity of the user ecology, including investors\u2019 profit expectations, the profitability of the project party, and the complexities in the future. If the L2 token can only be used as a vote, what is the significance of the L2 project token? Where is the motivation of investors or participants? Buying or selling tokens is a real gold and silver transaction. In the end, the unsupported tokens will fall, and the profitability of the project side in the ecology will also become very lacking, because the L2 level fee is very low and can be ignored. , the only source of profit for the project party is to issue coins and earn money from investors, which is a very bad and unsustainable situation. The status of ETH at the L1 level is unshakable. Any ecology that operates in the L1 has achieved good development and sustainable momentum. ETH itself has also appeared a lot of content that maintains the currency price and investors\u2019 income. For example, defi/gamefi/nft, and pledge income, etc., if L2 projects have no such income, and lack of expectations for project growth, then everything will not develop. ",

Optimism could take a page out of Arbitrum in terms of pricing fees, using a moving average and a correction factor and an inbuilt dex aggregator, the sequencer can have a store of ETH as a buffer and all incoming $OP are swapped for $ETH for L1 posting fees. When the L1 fees spike, the L2 fees would slowly move upwards, eating into the buffer while the correction factor adjust to recoup the buffer. Similarly, in the far distance future, when sequencers are decentralised, the option of using their own choice of swap (AMM, OTC, Order Book style DEX) can be handed over to each individual sequencer.

                    "content": "These questions are in discord over here. Replying to both over here. First I\u2019m not advocating this point to happen or not to happen. I\u2019m advocating a possibility that can lift the $Op token price and bring more value to the network rather than sitting on the MC of below 300 Millions shamefully. This forum and other social media platforms are where we find solutions and create a dialog and make others aware of the possibilities or otherwise. Also, the community can talk on behalf of the topic and I don\u2019t have to answer each and every question too. There are plenty of Pro tech guys here and they can pitch in too. We are a group of individuals who are trying to find the best road map for optimism and this topic was posted for that not to evaluate the knowledge individuals have. Optimism\u2019s core principles are community governance and it speaks for itself. Also remember this is a free speech forum where we get feedback and discuss on topics again, remember I don\u2019t own this above process. This is created by Zukabba on Boba network due credits has been given. This process has been already discussed in the Boba Network forum and won with a majority of community votes and now Boobs network has implemented it. Technically I have no idea how to do it since I\u2019m not a tech guy but more of a  business analyst. If I knew how to code and fighter all this out by myself then  I wouldn\u2019t be writing here other than writing the code and creating my own Eth rollup. Boba network is a folk of Optimism and they had the same problem like we do with $OP token and they are trying to figure out what is the best path forward and they came up with this idea and Boba Network had already implemented this above process right now it\u2019s working according to information. For your 1st question -     MinimalGravitas:      ApePrince:  using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount!   This is impossible. Fees collected on Optimism are used directly to pay for writing to Ethereum mainnet. If you charge less fees there just wont be enough OP to sell for the ether the rollup needs to post it\u2019s proofs. The fees aren\u2019t arbitrary.   Answer - 25% fee discount  plan This has been done and now it\u2019s working in the booba network. Booba Network the first Layer-2 to enable a dual token fee option.  It\u2019s a copy of optimism. If booba network has done it then the Optimism team may be able to do it too. Those who are  pro coders from our community can dig deep and let us know about this. So, since this has already been done in a Eth rollup network it\u2019s not IMPOSSIBLE to implement. Check this video out!     2, Question -     MinimalGravitas:      ApePrince:  Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers,   It would also destroy Ethereum equivalence, which is one of the main reasons that Optimism stands out against other optimistic rollups.   Answer - Competitive intensity - very high The competition between Rollups is very high. Optimism competes not only with other Optimism Rollups such as Arbitrum, but also other scaling solutions such as Polygon\u2019s PoS chain and ZK rollups such as Starknet. Vitalik Buterin expects ZK Rollups to outperform Optimistic Rollups in the medium to long term as they provide a better experience. ZK rollups are proven to have better security through validity, and there is no long waiting period for withdrawals. New entrants will have to make significant improvements to current solutions in order to capture a significant market share. It will take years of development, and other than Celestia, no such promising technology has emerged. The threat of alternative options is high, and monolithic and interoperable blockchains are a real threat. Monolithic architectures also have the advantage of a consistent complete experience compared to modular architectures. Parachains on Polkadot, Appchains on Cosmos, and Subnets on Avalanche are also working to increase adoption. Application developers can be considered Rollup\u2019s suppliers. Demand for developers is very high, giving it significant bargaining power. Developers must be incentivized by multi-million dollar ecosystem grants. Users can be considered customers here. Users are scattered and do not have much bargaining power. But in a highly competitive industry, new platform solutions purchase user wallet share inorganically through airdrops and incentive programs. EVM equivalence Optimism goes beyond simple EVM compatibility to EVM equivalence. On an EVM-compatible chain, developers still need to modify their Web3 applications to use a different architecture. Additionally, tools built for Ethereum over time may not necessarily work on other EVM-compatible chains. EVM equivalence on Optimism solves this problem by being almost equivalent to executing on the Ethereum mainnet, allowing one-click porting of applications and all tooling work. This approach will help Optimism grow the developer community faster and with fewer bugs than other scaling solutions. 3, Question form the discord - \u201cThis is impossible. Fees collected on Optimism are used directly to pay for writing to Ethereum mainnet. If you charge less fees there just wont be enough OP to sell for the ether the rollup needs to post it\u2019s proofs. The fees aren\u2019t arbitrary.\u201d Answer - income model There are two types of income: explicit income and MEV. The Optimism Foundation runs a single centralized sequencer that is solely responsible for generating Layer 2 (L2) blocks and adding transactions to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 (L1). The sorter fee consists of two parts, the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee. L2 execution fees are similar to Ethereum gas fees. The amount of fees to be paid depends on the complexity of the transaction, i.e. its computational and storage requirements. That\u2019s about 1% of what users pay. The L1 data fee is the cost of publishing a batch of transactions to Ethereum. The sorter uses a cost-plus approach, charging users a price higher than the L1 cost. It currently charges 1.24 times the sum of the gas required to submit a transaction and 2,100 gas. This generates surpluses that will be used to fund the growth of the ecosystem. It\u2019s worth noting that 99% of the fees charged by Optimism are L1 data fees. So far, these fees paid by users have brought in $24.5 million in revenue for Optimism. Sequencers can also capture maximum extractable value (MEV) in the future. To recap, MEV refers to the value that privileged participants (such as miners, validators, or sequencers) extract by including, reordering, inserting, or ignoring transactions in the blocks they produce. Since there is only one sorter on Optimism, only it can capture MEVs. The Optimism team proposed a system for MEV auctions, under which they would sell other parties the ability to reorder or insert transactions in a block. Proceeds from the MEV auction will also flow back to fund Optimism\u2019s public goods. Again I reiterate that this is not a competition about knowledge , this is a community discussion where community can pitch in and make the best out of this topic. We have so much of Pro coders in this community and they can pitch in on technical part of this. Thanks for contributing to the discussion and we need more community players like you to have a healthy environment. MAKE $OP GREAT AGAIN !    ",

                    "content": "Morning ApePrince, thanks for the replies. Like you I of course agree that this forum should be for open and free discussion, however I do also think it should be as robust as possible. With regards to the 25% fee discount I\u2019m not sure the relevance of the video, but I didn\u2019t know the amount of excess that was collected so the following is very useful info:  It currently charges 1.24 times the sum of the gas required to submit a transaction and 2,100 gas. This generates surpluses that will be used to fund the growth of the ecosystem.  If this is the case then for every $100 needed to be spent on L1, Optimism currently collects $124. If the fees to pay with OP were discounted by 25% then were everyone to pay in OP only $93 would be collected per $100 required. How would this discrepancy be paid for? I assume you\u2019re not suggesting making up the difference with Optimism\u2019s reserves?  So far, these fees paid by users have brought in $24.5 million in revenue for Optimism.  Using these figures the biggest possible discount you could apply without going into debt would be about 19.3%, but doing so would mean that Optimism was no longer building up it\u2019s reserves. I suppose whether you think that is worthwhile is a separate question. Another relevant point here is that I don\u2019t think you are correct that:  I\u2019m advocating a possibility that can lift the $Op token price  The price of a token relates to the relative buying and selling pressures. If we were to use OP as the token of Optimism, the OP would need to be sold straight away in order to buy the ether needed for L1. This would create a sell pressure that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re factoring in. Using our ongoing example\u2026 If we need $100 to spend on Ethereum Mainnet and we collect $100 of OP (utilizing the 19.3% discount) then users have bought $100 worth of OP and Optimism has then sold it. There is no net effect on the buying/selling pressure. In fact, as many of us have just been airdropped a bunch of OP I would argue that the net effect would be negative as not every user has to buy the token. If some of the OP spent on gas comes from users who didn\u2019t have to buy it, while all of what is collected needs to be sold for ether then the price of OP would be pushed lower, not higher. Finally, with regards to EVM equivalence, I think from your response that we are on the same page. You\u2019ve expanded on my point about how important a feature this is to making Optimism stand out, so do I take it that you agree this is not worth sacrificing? I can\u2019t imagine a possible way that gas on Optimism could be payed for with anything other than ether without losing this key advantage, and this is fundamentally the most important reason in my eyes why we should not make changes to the gas mechanism.  Also, the community can talk on behalf of the topic and I don\u2019t have to answer each and every question too.  Completely agree with this sentiment BTW, I hope no one reading this takes it as a conversation just between the two of us, everyone who wants to should always be welcome to jump into any discussion on here. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of factors both of us are missing here!  Again I reiterate that this is not a competition about knowledge  Of course, but equally you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to explain stuff that no everyone may be familiar with. Surely part of the purpose of these discussions is to help people learn how Optimism works and why people have different views and opinions on it\u2019s structure. I posted a collection of links yesterday that might help people get to grips with rollups generally and Optimism in particular:     Links to help understand Optimism (maybe useful before considering changes to it)       What is a Rollup; how do they work; what\u2019s an Optimistic one?        What makes Optimism special?        \u2026  What else should go in this list?     If you\u2019ve got more resources that would be useful there please do chick them in that thread! ",

This is a major addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption and usage of the Optimism Network!. ETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change to $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount! Benefits The Optimism token already has significant utility on the network, and this improvement will unify usage of $OP as the fees token for all Optimism Networks. Currently, $OP is used for voting and delegating votes in the Optimism Network. This can incentivize bridging since we can airdrop a small amount of $Op for first time users of the network. It will also prevent the need to bridge both ETH and for Optimism Network usage. Additional benefits: Increased trading volume for $OP Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass Increase the price of the $OP. $Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets. Increased user choice on the network. Makes it easier for bridging. Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage Technical Details Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers, The Graph indexing, wallets, the gateway, and overall developer and user experience. We are proposing an opt-in strategy where users can, if they wish, pay for fees in $OP. This fee choice will be recorded in an L2 contract. Changing the fee token will require interacting with this feeChoice contract. To reduce friction points for new users, a second system of contracts will be built that allows users without ETH on L2 to change their fee setting to $OP, using a MetaTransaction, in which Optimism Network pays the ETH to change their fee token setting in return for OP from the user. This means that for new users, they will only need to bridge OP to Optimism to then use its full range of services, contracts, and DAPS What Does this Mean for User experience? If you want to continue to use ETH to pay for transactions on the Optimism Network, you don\u2019t have to do anything.If you want to pay for transactions in $OP, select $OP, and confirm the transaction. After that, all future transactions will be charged in $OP. Users will be able to switch between $OP and $ETH as the fee token. Conclusion $OP Token Receives Utility Boost, Use for Gas Fees on Optimism Network Credits goes to - Zukaboba   its such a good  idea . i had suggested it a month ago ",

None of those other networks you listed are a rollup, so that\u2019s a significant difference. Optimism inherits the security of Ethereum and must pay in ETH for that security. Therefore the transaction fees collected on Optimism should be in ETH. Secondly, if you are a small token holder, you can delegate your votes to anyone else so that you add to their weight and they represent your opinions. You can put your vote anywhere you want, and see it register within the system. That\u2019s better than you can get anywhere else for the time being. Thirdly, blockchain governance is not worthless. Some tokens like ETH are designed to accrue value, others are meant for different purposes. OP at this point is for grants and for governance. ",

The  $OP token can be used to pay gas fees on the Optimism Network!. This is a major addition to the utility of the $OP token, and will help increase adoption and usage of the Optimism Network!. ETH remains the default gas token, but all users will have the option to change to $OP. Users preferring to stick with ETH gas payments do not have to do anything, but using $OP will result in a 25% gas fee discount! Benefits The Optimism token already has significant utility on the network, and this improvement will unify usage of $OP as the fees token for all Optimism Networks. Currently, $OP is used for voting and delegating votes in the Optimism Network. This can incentivize bridging since we can airdrop a small amount of  $Op for first time users of the network. It will also prevent the need to bridge both ETH and  for Optimism Network usage. Additional benefits: Increased trading volume for $OP Increase the total market cap with the usage of $Op tokens as Gass Increase the price of the $OP. $Op will be traded in Eth and L1 markets. Increased user choice on the network. Makes it easier for bridging. Eliminates the need to bridge both $ETH and $OP for network usage Technical Details Adding a second fee token to a live Mainnet is a major technical lift with many ramifications for security, convenience, documentation, message-relay, fraud-detection, block-explorers, The Graph indexing, wallets, the gateway, and overall developer and user experience. We are proposing an opt-in strategy where users can, if they wish, pay for fees in $OP. This fee choice will be recorded in an L2 contract. Changing the fee token will require interacting with this feeChoice contract. To reduce friction points for new users, a second system of contracts will be built that allows users without ETH on L2 to change their fee setting to $OP, using a MetaTransaction, in which Optimism Network pays the ETH to change their fee token setting in return for OP from the user. This means that for new users, they will only need to bridge OP to Optimism to then use its full range of services, contracts, and DAPS What Does this Mean for User experience? If you want to continue to use ETH to pay for transactions on the Optimism Network, you don\u2019t have to do anything.If you want to pay for transactions in $OP, select $OP, and confirm the transaction. After that, all future transactions will be charged in $OP. Users will be able to switch between $OP and $ETH as the fee token. Conclusion $OP Token Receives Utility Boost, Use for Gas Fees on Optimism Network Credits goes to - Zukaboba    : [/quote] yes We need more application scenarios to enhance OP value ",

                    "content": "As a builder on Optimism, I have a different view and I think it would be a mistake to enable $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network. Reason is the following: regulatory uncertainty. As of now, there is no regulatory clarity around the securities or non-securities status of tokens in the USA. Optimism is a US based project and, to my knowledge (I could be wrong), they did sell tokens to finance the development of Optimism (which is still on-going), they also hired the service of a market maker (Wintermute) etc\u2026 I don\u2019t blame the team at all, they did it for good reasons but, from a legal standpoint, all of these good intentioned moves could backfire at some point, depending on the SEC\u2019s mood and judges appreciations of the application of current regulations to the $OP tokens. This is why, as a builder on Optimism (Fairmint is Optimism-native), I greatly appreciate that the $OP token is actually NOT used as a gas token. Because if the $OP was to ever be considered a security by the regulators (and I hope it will never be the case of course), then, if $OP was used as gas token, that would simply KILL the Optimism network. Using ETH for gas is A LOT safer from a regulatory standpoint. And, to be honest, I don\u2019t think we would have opted to build on Optimism had this not been the case. As I am seeing a lot of support in favor of $OP as gas token, I wanted to voice my total opposition as using $OP as a gas token  ",

In the scheme you\u2019re proposing, if $OP were to be classified as a security, it would undoubtedly put more constraints on buying back $OP. This would be an issue if the $OP buyback is done at the protocol level as it would put the protocol under more regulatory risk. I hear the argument of @S4t0sh1 and I tend to agree that we should not let the SEC guide how $OP should be used. $OP has been created as a utility / governance token and the community should be free to design its usage accordingly. But I think we should also \u201cplan for the worst\u201d. The SEC attacking Optimism for unregistered sale of securities would definitely be a black swan event that I hope will never happen (and if it does, we should fiercely fight it) but what is most important in my view is to make sure that, no matter what the SEC does and no matter what happens to $OP, the protocol isn\u2019t affected and continues to \u201cjust work\u201d.

Enabling $OP as a gas token is a huge step forward for the network and will help increase the adoption and usage of the Optimism Network. The ability to use $OP to pay for gas fees is a major addition to the utility of the token and will help increase its value. The fact that users have the option to switch between $OP and ETH as the gas token is great as it gives users more choice and flexibility on the network. Additionally, the 25% gas fee discount for using $OP is a huge incentive to switch over. Overall, this is a great move by the team and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how it impacts the network.
