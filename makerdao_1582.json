                    "content": "It has been a year since I was just about to leave my job as the Global Legal Counsel at the Maker Foundation. Back then, I was very concerned about how MakerDAO would handle legal and regulatory topics moving forward. A month before my departure, in June 2021, I published a forum post about what I considered the regulatory topics of most importance. That\u2019s one of my main thoughts and messages to the community back then:    Mapping out policy challenges and opportunities for Maker   To put it simply, it is not enough to survive and avoid regulatory scrutiny. To grow and outcompete traditional finance, Maker will need sophisticated regulatory thinking embedded in its overall strategy.   Unfortunately, not much has happened since then. Regulatory thinking at MakerDAO is driven almost purely by news headlines, and the recent drama on discord around Tornado Cash sanctions is just an example. MakerDAO is reactive, underinformed, sometimes ignorant, and generally susceptible to superficial analyses. Rare counterexamples like SES legal research do not change the overall picture. Are we seriously thinking about triggering some tectonic shifts in the economic structure of Dai and the Maker Protocol based on hearsay legal views? Don\u2019t worry; I didn\u2019t come here to rant only. I wanted to present my perspective on some legal topics relevant to the current discussions. These are just my (quickly written) thoughts and not legal advice to anyone. It is also not an exclusive list (far from it). Disclaimer: I do not represent anyone and anyone\u2019s interests but just myself. I own MKR, but I appreciate my reputation and integrity more than my bags. Accordingly, I would like to see Maker continuing to be a respected, invincible, invulnerable, world-changing project more than any financial gains. Also, I don\u2019t have anything against anons, but the invasion of anon accounts here has become unbearable, so I may decide not to engage in discussion with them. Here are the relevant topics: 1.\tDai regulation Tl;dr any asset which pegs to fiat currency will be strictly regulated. Any issuer of such stablecoins will be regulated and licensed. Dai and Maker will be outlawed if they don\u2019t follow the requirements. These regulations will be very difficult to comply with without a centralized structure in place. This is the most important topic and yet the most overlooked one. Stablecoin regulations are being cooked all around the globe. In some cases (EU), they are actually ready. Many follow the thinking pattern, \"when there is something certain, we will deal with that.\u201d That fallacy inevitably leads to panic when something finally happens; see Tornado Cash and sanctions. It is sure what is going to happen. Until 2020, one of the strategies I was pursuing in the Foundation was trying to \u201cfly under the radar\u201d and allow the policymakers to regulate centralized stablecoins while not sticking our neck out too much. I dropped this approach after I was invited to a closed meeting of the Financial Stability Board, which consists of senior central bankers and regulators and coordinates global financial regulation. I came out from meetings and dinner with these folks, realizing they would want to have a global, all-encompassing, strict regulatory regime for any stablecoins. That was 2.5 years ago. In the meantime, the FSB issued its report confirming the approach, and individual countries started implementing their regimes largely based on FSB\u2019s recommendations. One of the central premises of the stablecoin regulation, as implemented almost everywhere, is that it usually defines stablecoins as assets that in any form peg to a fiat currency. The exact nature of the peg does not matter. Especially after the UST collapse, one should not expect regulatory differentiation between centralized and decentralized stablecoins. In some places like the US, the debate is ongoing, but please be realistic about it. Long story short, recently Nikolai and Rune explained how the USD peg inevitably leads to the dependence on USD-denominated assets. The same applies on the regulatory front: a fiat currency peg will soon trigger rigid regulations. One difference is that it\u2019s not only about the US regulations (a peg to USD will still trigger the EU regulations, for instance). Maker is enjoying the last months of the unregulated stablecoin wild west, but these times will be essentially over in 2023-24. I am not arguing either way, but Maker should either maintain the fiat currency peg and prepare for complex and centralizing regulations (perhaps impossible to comply with in some cases) or work out an alternative. 2.\tRWA Tl;dr RWAs will bring regulatory troubles and costs on Maker. I\u2019ve been involved in RWAs since the early days. In 2017, just before joining Maker later that year, I was part of a German startup that was tokenizing equity. I was one of the persons working on RWAs in the Foundation when the topic first seriously emerged in 2018. In 2020-21, I led a side project that built a solution for decentralized security token trading and received the EU law green light from a regulator. I don\u2019t believe in RWAs in Maker. More specifically, I believe in small-scale diversification of collateral (let\u2019s say <5%) and RWA experimentation. However, counting on RWA as the main bet and a cure for all Maker\u2019s problems, the primary collateral source, and the source of decentralization (by that definition, almost any bank would be decentralized) was a misconception a few years ago, and it still is a misconception in 2022. The main reasons are that RWAs erode decentralization (which is not appreciated by the users until it is; see TC and Genesis cases) and, even more importantly, that in the current form, they remove the transparency, hence stripping away the critical competitive advantages of Maker. Do we really want to see news articles about \u201cwhat\u2019s actually backing Dai and what\u2019s in the newest reserve report\u201d like the ones about Tether or USDC? That\u2019s not my point here, though. I want to clarify that the legal topics around RWAs are not limited to structuring the deals, which proves difficult enough by the way. Focus on RWAs will inevitably lead to regulatory burdens and troubles, particularly difficult to comply with by a DAO. This is shadow banking business under a pirate flag. Even if we finally sort out all the current issues in 1-2-3 years, the costs to comply with financial regulations will be enormous. 3.\tSanctions and AML/KYC Tl;dr do not enter panic mode over TC. Focus on solving the fundamental problems I mention in this post. Let me keep this one short as there are a lot of discussions elsewhere\u2014just two thoughts. OFAC designation of Tornado Cash was directly related to its use in cybercrime. It\u2019s another chapter in the ongoing war against mixers and anonymity-enhancing solutions in general. The Maker Protocol does not have much to do with these. I do not think a similar thing happening to Maker\u2019s smart contracts is probable. That said, of course, USDC freezing/blocking is a risk. This risk is, however, associated with the inherent censorship risks of RWAs rather than a direct sanctions risk for Maker. This risk is not new and is just one of many other ones (e.g., counterparty risk). This risk should be accounted for and mitigated. For example, Maker is the largest USDC user (3.5 billion USDC) and should not be treated at par with a random 10k USDC holder and Tornado Cash user. There is, however, a real risk associated with the development of AML/KYC regulation. We will see further attacks on self-hosted wallets and forcing KYC everywhere. Maker should double down on its public policy and lobbying efforts in this area. 4.\tDecentralization / DeFi regulation I will keep this one even shorter to not make this post totally indigestible, but I can elaborate later if needed. Ultimately, decentralization is and will be our strongest moat against regulatory risks. It is easy to downplay the inefficiencies it brings, but it is of great protective value, not to mention other benefits. We should treat it with care. The fact that regulators are targeting decentralized protocols like Tornado Cash should not make us think differently\u2014this is the only thing that gives TC a chance to survive. The same thing applies to other decentralized protocols, including Maker. These are my quick thoughts. Happy to discuss. ",

I certainly agree with all of your points. Dai should change focus. The crypto economy needs a decentralized uncensorable liquid stablecoin.

There will be some regulation, likely a patchwork of regulation around the world, and being a stablecoin, whether its pegged to 1 currency or a basket, will inevitably, at some point in not too distant future, face regulatory oversight. Being in compliance may not be too difficult or too onerous, and some jurisdictions already have DAO-friendly laws on their books, but it will require some centralization, an entity, which will be responsible for maintaining that compliance.

There is no need to give up any transparency in regard to using RWAs as collateral. The Centrifuge protocol supports transparency so the community can track RWA collateral in real-time.     jacek:  Focus on RWAs will inevitably lead to regulatory burdens and troubles, particularly difficult to comply with by a DAO.   I would also disagree on this point. In fact, I would argue just the opposite. Investments in Centrifuge pools are in full compliance with securities laws. Our pools are permissioned with all investors checked for AML and sanctions purposes. There is far more potential regulatory risk with using stablecoins as collateral or cryptoassets such as ETH where wallets can be blocked or frozen and liquidity can disappear overnight due to fear of regulatory action.

Don\u2019t feed the trolls. I want to reiterate your first most important point.     jacek:  1. Dai regulation Tl;dr any asset which pegs to fiat currency will be strictly regulated. Any issuer of such stablecoins will be regulated and licensed. Dai and Maker will be outlawed if they don\u2019t follow the requirements. These regulations will be very difficult to comply with without a centralized structure in place.   Can\u2019t agree with this more and it is one of the most under appreciated and misunderstood by MakerDAO. With respect to RWA.     jacek:  Tl;dr RWAs will bring regulatory troubles and costs on Maker.   Absolutely.   I am going to plug for a post I made regarding RWA, USDC basically bringing significant kind of centralization.     Offloading growing Centralization risks to Maker and to DAI. Opening a general discussion Risk       Hello MakerDAO  While I have been working on things in the background.   I have not made much progress and there are a number of concerns springing up that I think are capturing attention but not getting significant traction.  With this post I hope to lay out the issues and to present for discussion what I see as the issues that lay underneath the issues.  Primary issue:  Maker collateral custody centralization.  USDC, wBTC, USDP each account for over 500M worth of collateral.   As far as I know\u2026     One of my favorite lines that really describes Maker.     jacek:  This is shadow banking business under a pirate flag.   One of the vast number of important reasons I put forward my Maker3.0 proposal Proposal: Maker3.0 - The future of crypto lending. (RFC) was to try to firewall Maker2.0 and $$ pegged DAI so that one Maker could focus to work towards compliance while funding research into Maker3.0 and DAI3 (not pegged to USD).   My analysis in the end suggests that all crypto comes under compliance \u2018white\u2019, or basically goes \u2018black\u2019.   DAI3 by going away from a hard currency peg of any kind and seeking to build a completely new protocol and DAI3 could buy some amount of time but AML/KYC compliance I think is going to overshadow everything leading to real issues in the space. Great quotes from you I consider really important:     jacek:  Maker should double down on its public policy and lobbying efforts in this area.   Critical and I will add DeFI needs to focus not just on lobbying but also education.  Really a working group needs to be formed and funded to try to build rails towards a vision of the future that legislators and regulators can get on board with.  But based on other statements it looks like a lot of work has already been done, and it perhaps is likely legislative, regulatory minds are already made up (crypto must follow TradFI even if TradFI launders $1T/yr 99% unhindered)     jacek:  Ultimately, decentralization is and will be our strongest moat against regulatory risks. It is easy to downplay the inefficiencies it brings, but it is of great protective value, not to mention other benefits   Personally I think this whole \u2018decentralized\u2019 issue is going to fall by wayside once regulations finally bite.  It will not matter if you are a decentralized protocol if you don\u2019t follow laws once a sanction is applied and backed by full punishment of the law.  People don\u2019t really have a choice if the choice is to break or not break the law, particularly if the off ramps are going to block based on wallet blacklisting connections.   I honestly don\u2019t have a great answer to how DeFI can live in TradFI in any other way than by following all jurisdictional laws (in all jurisdictions btw) which places some significant constraints on DeFI that are much greater than TradFI btw. Really appreciate the well thought out post and much of your points follow results of my own analysis, both of recent times and up to almost 8-10 years ago now. I think I only have one question. If you thought of MakerDAO having to deal with any single issue, which one is would the least amount of effort yield the greatest results (DAI and regulation or sanctions and AML/KYC) or something else?

                    "content": "Thank you for prompting this discussion here.  I would add a few issues for consideration on this thread. Disclaimer - these are a rough outline of concerns that shouldn\u2019t be taken as advice.  You should discuss any legal questions you have about the MakerDAO ecosystem or any other legal issues with your counsel. Most of my commentary is also from a US perspective, I hope others can weigh in on these and similar concerns from an international perspective (keeping in mind that the US does have a lot of extra-territorial regulatory influence). DAO Entity Status There is an underlying assumption by the community at large that the DAO has no legal entity status.  This assumption is untested, and there is activity from regulators that suggests it might be wrong.  Most notably is the SEC\u2019s Report and Recommendation on the DAO: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf Therein, the SEC asserts that the DAO is an \u201cunincorporated organization\u201d and that \u201c[t]he DAO was \u2018responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise,\u2019 and accordingly, was the entity about which investors needed information material to their investment decision.\u201d Id. at 16.  So at least the SEC believes that DAOs are (or can be) legal entities subject to US securities law.  We have also seen private parties bring litigation against DAOs.  See, e.g., Sarcuni et al v. bZx DAO et al., Case No. 3:22-cv-618-LAB-DEB (Complaint) (\u201cbZx protocol purports to be a so-called DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, that lacks any legal formalities or recognition.  There is another phrase in American law for that kind of arrangement: general partnership.  That means each of the partners is jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiffs and must make good on the full amount of its debts.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Likewise, we have even seen MakerDAO itself threatened with a patent infringement lawsuit: Infringement of TRS's U.S. Patent No. 10,025,797 by MakerDao NB: I am not commenting on the merits of these cases, just that the concern is one that has to be taken seriously. If an entity does exist, additional questions include what kind of entity (state unincorporated association?  General partnership? Something else?), who the members are (all token holders? All forum members?  Core Unit Facilitators? Delegates? Shadow Delegates? Folks that voted their tokens?) , what obligations DAO members have to eachother, what where the entity is subject to jurisdiction, what taxes does it (and it\u2019s members) owe? Securities Treatment of MakerDAO Related Digital Assets Another key topic is what legal kind of assets are related to and issued by the MakerDAO protocol.  The fight is typically framed as a question of whether particular assets are \u201ccommodities\u201d or \u201csecurities.\u201d  At a high level, lots of crypto enthusiasts want tokens to be considered \u201ccommodities\u201d which would be regulated by the CFTC; they have authority over, but (with some exceptions, especially regarding fraud) don\u2019t restrict \u201cspot\u201d trading of commodities.  Securities, on the other hand, are subject to a lot of restrictions on issuance, registration, sale, etc. by the SEC.  This is in part why RWA transactions have to involve a broker/dealer like Genesis. This determination has obvious implications for MKR, and Dai tokens, but this can also have potential implications for CDP\u2019s, Vaults, or anything else that is tokenized.  And not all tokens will necessarily be treated the same way. Again, the Report on the DAO is one of the best official sources explaining the position of the SEC on this.  See also SEC.gov | Framework for \u201cInvestment Contract\u201d Analysis of Digital Assets.  The Hinman Speech is a good overview for non-lawyers on some of the key concepts, but the SEC is now trying to disclaim this in the Ripple litigation. SEC.gov | Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic).  All of these sources reference the Howey test articulated in a 1946 Supreme Court case.  SEC v. WJ Howey Co., 328 US 293 - Supreme Court 1946 - Google Scholar.  The BlockFi case has also highlighted the importance of the Reves test.  https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2022/33-11029.pdf Although they\u2019ve gotten less attention, other important issues include:  Securitization of digital assets\u2013if you pledge digital assets to secure a loan, then transfer them without permission, lender may (or may not) be able to go after the third-party transferee to reclaim them, depending on state law. Bankruptcy\u2013lately, this has been an issue for CeFi exchanges, with users frustrated that they may be treated as unsecured creditors rather than secured creditors with a claim on their crypto deposits.  But this could also become an issue in DeFi; imagine if a vault holder declares bankruptcy\u2013are keepers that move to liquidate their vault breaching the automatic stay?  What if the USD peg breaks and Dai is undercollateralized and a user files an involuntary bankruptcy petition against MakerDAO; is there an obligation to institute an emergency freeze? Money transmission\u2013in addition to OFAC, FinCEN has fined a handful for prominent crypto firms for engaging in money transmission without a money transmitter license, or failing to keep KYC/AML records.  There are also state regimes to consider.  \u2013 Stepping back to your comments, I very much agree that we need long term and not reactionary thinking.  I also want to see Maker continue to be a respected and important part of not only the DeFi ecosystem, but the world more broadly. I have some skepticism of your analysis of the coming stablecoin regime.  My read on proposes US regulation is not that anything pegged to a Fiat currency must comply with a forthcoming regulatory regime for stabelcoins.  Rather, the Lumis-Gillibrand bill limits \u201cPayment Stablecoin\u201d digital assets \u201credeemable, on demand, on a one-to-one basis for instruments \u2026 defined as legal tender under section 5103\u2026\u201d which Dai, even considering the PSM, is not (USDC is not defined as legal tender). https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Lummis-Gillibrand%20Responsible%20Financial%20Innovation%20Act%20[Final].pdf.  We\u2019re still waiting for the text of the Boozman-Staenow bill, but my secondhand understanding of discussions with staffers is that it would only capture redeemable stablecoins, and not algorithmic or collateralized stablecoins like Dai.  Further, the Lumis-Gillibrand bill would likely push Dai towards being treated as a commodity (though the new regulatory framework for \u201cancillary assets\u201d still does not perfectly fit the Maker Ecosystem).  But these bills could also be bad for Maker if Treasury and the SEC decide that the passage of a regulatory framework for stablecoins means its open season to make life hell for any nonconforming coins. I pretty much agree with the rest of the factual information you present, but I\u2019m not sure I understand the conclusion you reach.  You agree that trying to fly under the radar is not a viable strategy, but seem to be against anything that leads to engagement with regulators.  I am not sure how this is a viable strategy.  Maybe regulators can\u2019t touch the protocol itself, but the IRS, SEC, Treasury, DOJ, and swath of state regulators (and I would assume European regulators) can make life hard for the users of the protocol. I also think there is a third option between full regulator compliance and centralization vs. outright defiance.  The SEC wants to make law that will serve them well, and to do that, they are likely to litigate against underfinanced, unsympathetic defendants, that judges won\u2019t hesitate to bring the hammer down on.  But web3 entities with a sheen of legitimacy, that don\u2019t hurt consumers, are less likely to be regulatory targets.  It reminds me of a joke:  a couple guys are walking in the forest and see a vicious bear that starts heading towards them.  The first guy immediately takes a knee and starts tightening his shoelaces.  The second guy shouts, \u201cyou\u2019re crazy!  You\u2019ll never outrun the bear!\u201d The first guy replies: \u201cI don\u2019t have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you.\u201d  A bunch of DeFi projects are eventually going to fall, as regulation drives away capital.  To not get caught and become one of these projects, the Maker community should proactively respond to regulators, dismantling their legal case before they can bring it. The harder question for me to answer is \u201chow does the community do that.\u201d  I don\u2019t have a fully fleshed out idea.  And I don\u2019t think the answer can or should be \u201crelaunch with a blacklist.\u201d But it might involve creating some sort of entities similar to what RWF has been doing to be the point of contact for regulated entities and individuals concerned about regulation.  And in the long term, Dai needs to grow broad enough in adoption that it would be so disruptive to shut it down as to be politically infeasible. ",

To not get caught and become one of these projects, the Maker community should proactively respond to regulators, dismantling their legal case before they can bring it.   Good post with some nice detail and investigation @0xbocaJ I disagree with the above.   While I think engagement with regulators should be undertaken as a show of good faith, I think engagement to \u201cdismantle their legal case before they can bring it\u201d isn\u2019t a viable strategy.  In fact engaging in this fashion will likely put the individual or entity right smack in the line of litigation. Also as others have commented @GFXlabs the likely approach here to deal with a DAO is to treat DAO\u2019s as general partnerships and basically go after the weakest links. I also think the treatment of the issuance of the DAOs (various Tokens they issue) vs. the DAOs themselves creates a greater surface area for regulatory litigation. There are many deep issues to consider here.   One of them is this idea a lot of people have that Maker and DAI be committed to being decentralized and this somehow saves everything from being attacked.  I dispute this assertion and would counter that as @GFXlabs has suggested Maker rapidly figure out the most favorable jurisdiction to home in and then work out all the details of international regulatory compliance \u2018from that jurisdiction\u2019.   Anything short of doing this basically opens the DAO up to the application of ALL regulatory laws, across ALL jurisdictions on each and every party in said jurisdiction. Short of legislators coming around to an idea that a network in effect becomes its own jurisdiction (like it\u2019s own nation state) or some similar special treatment of blockchain networks (both of these treatments highly unlikely to come to pass imo) in absence of a jurisdiction and a legal entity to go with it regulators and legislators are likely to treat DAOs and associated digital assets as they do all other threats to their sovereignty and citizenry. Which is why I have been suggesting that DeFI projects organize and fund a collective to both propose a global legal framework for the space, and then educate and lobby regulators to implement some form of  proposed organizational/leal model internationally.   Anything short of this will leave the space constantly battling on one or more fronts. ",

We should proactively try to assess which direction to take, at this point the direction is less important than actually deciding because if we do nothing we are left in a vulnerable and stressful situation. No-fee PSM Growing DAI adoption and becoming >100B market cap stablecoin giant. At this point, blanket regulation, blacklisting vault addresses and sanctioning DAI holders would be off limits. The impact of trying to contain DAI would create a major community backlash and if its peg and tradability are \u201cmessed\u201d with its ripple effects would impact the entire financial system. Continuing with a no-fee PSM strategy can enable fast growth but its yet to be determined if stablecoin inflows will remain strong in a bull market. To combat a potential slowdown, an attractive yield would be required. To do so, with lower recurring revenues and a stagnant asset allocation situation, the protocol might run at a loss (all else equal).  This strategy is attractive growth-oriented folks but seems to risky and unnatural to decentralization focused folks Censor-resistant Reducing reliance on USDC, RWAs and Bond strategies by setting concentration limits on non-decentralized and censor enabling products. As mentioned on this post, we can not continue to grow PSM/USDC/RWA balances while also investing in USD bonds and expect to fly under the radar of US regulators. Sooner or later they will find find a way to regulate the industry but I would bet they act sooner given stablecoins fast growth and concerns around UST collapse. To build a censor and regulation resistant coin means to set concentration limits or even off-board products. Both routes, concentration and offboarding, would require major internal shifts and actions. The strategies can leverage bracketing fees to make it uneconomical to go above our self-imposed limit. E.g. USDC collateral should be <10% at all times, then USDC-PSM is set to no-fee until 10% of DAI is backed by USDC and any trade above would have a 5% fee. There are pros and cons for both strategies and its not clear which one has more support, it would be great to have MKR leaders have facilitated debates about which direction the DAO will go in. Until a clear winner is decided, we are vulnerable to censorship and falling behind for mass adoption. ",

                    "content": "I think we\u2019re close to the same idea here. To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that we engage with regulators in a hostile fashion (at least where we can avoid it); rather, that one of the happy consequences of setting up an entity that is responsive to regulatory concerns is that it weakens the conclusory analysis that could otherwise be used against the Maker community as a whole. For example, if there is a regulated entity with a BD relationship that the initial issuance of Dai is flowing through, it\u2019s harder (though not impossible) to say that there is an unauthorized securities issuance. (Plus all the other arguments about why Dai is not a security etc.) Having a centralized entity can also shield the community more generally from the sorts of allegations that they are a general partnership. Picking a favorable jurisdiction for incorporation, as you suggest, could be a big part of engagement, as I was using that term. I also think that while we should absolutely be concerned about the general partnership question, because its a critical risk to anyone with substantial capital, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that legal entity status for the DAO necessarily means its a partnership with unlimited liability for all members. First of all, the common law requirement for a partnership is an agreement amongst all partners to carry on a business for profit.  Except for recognized delegates, I\u2019m not aware of a generalized group of community members who have taken any sort of agreement with each other.  And as for delegates, none of what\u2019s contained in their code of conduct agreement necessitates an obligation to carry out the business for profit.  Likewise, discussion of metaDAOs, environmental concerns, clean money, freedom of speech, and other topics demonstrates the non-financial motives driving many of the community members. Second, at least in California, there\u2019s a difference between an unincorporated association and a general partnership liability.  This is nuanced, but for some background reading, see Cal. Corp. Code Sec. 18260 (\u201cA money judgment against an unincorporated association, whether organized for profit or not, may be enforced only against the property of the association.\u201d); Security-First National Bank v. Cooper, 62 Cal. App. 2d 653 (\u201cThe liability of the members of an unincorporated association on contracts 667*667 made by it varies according to the answer to the question whether the association is one organized for profit.\u201d)  There\u2019s also a whole century of case law dealing with unions, and their responsibility for member actions; I\u2019m really now out of my depth, but those curious to learn more might start with this case: Marshall v. INT'L LONGSHOREMEN'S & WAREHOUSEMEN'S U., 371 P. 2d 987 - Cal: Supreme Court 1962 - Google Scholar. Again, the above is not a conclusion that the DAO is definitely not a partnership, just emphasizing that there aren\u2019t clear answers. The Wyoming DAO approach is worth considering, but the center of what that law does is allow certain corporate record keeping and voting to be conducted on-chain (instead of, say, a secretary keeping meeting minutes).  As the article by @MFeinberg points out, it also requires the DAO operating smart contract be mutable.  So I\u2019m not sure the WyomingDAO approach really gets to the core concerns of community members. ",

                    "content": "Great post @jacek  I was wondering why we hadn\u2019t heard much from you at this critical juncture.     jacek:  It has been a year since I was just about to leave my job as the Global Legal Counsel at the Maker Foundation.   I personally hope you will be able to share more knowledge with the DAO in some of the governance debates that are taking place.     jacek:  Unfortunately, not much has happened since then. Regulatory thinking at MakerDAO is driven almost purely by news headlines, and the recent drama on discord around Tornado Cash sanctions is just an example. MakerDAO is reactive, underinformed, sometimes ignorant, and generally susceptible to superficial analyses.   Hopefully smart folks like yourself can chime in more often. For example, there have been some terrible takes regarding the TC situation but this is not helped by the complicated nature of sanctions, even for parties outside the US who happen to be operating in the US market. It is simply not true, for example, that sanctions don\u2019t affect parties outside the US (as anyone who has organised supply chain agreements would know). Sanctions have significant ripple effects and often harm the very same country that issued them. We see that too in the case of TC. It\u2019s an example of what Derrida brilliantly identified as the sometimes destructive autoimmune effects inherent in systems of security and law designed by a body politic to protect itself from \u201coutsiders\u201d and rogues.     jacek:  Stablecoin regulations are being cooked all around the globe. In some cases (EU), they are actually ready.   Back to the main theme here. I agree that the way forward is pretty well set - between FATF guidance and MiCA, more OFAC-type sanctions and the likely stringent regulation of stable-coins in the US, the noose is already tied and slowly tightening. Maybe folks are expecting some form of late-night clemency for crypto but that strikes me as a very weak plan. I\u2019ve assumed that some form of level playing field will be demanded of all DeFi DAOs by nation-states and global organisations (SWIFT, BIS, IMF etc), and it doesn\u2019t really matter if the DAO is fully decentralised or just playing decentralisation theatre. In fact, decentralised theatre acts have a distinct advantage over properly decentralised DAOs. They can respond more quickly and provide undertakings to regulators. They can do deals. They can negotiate. They can compromise. They can simultaneously maintain mutually exclusive beliefs and positions. DAOs cannot do any of these things. A lot of folks forget that most banks and FIs would love to go \u201cfull goblin\u201d with their balance sheet, KYC and compliance. They would love to eradicate pesky regulators, banking laws and taxes. They would love to do business in a laissez-faire, permissionless fashion with shady oligarchs and greasy royal families. And moreover, those same banks often do go full goblin and sometimes even get caught. They pay the fines, throw a few key employees under the bus and move on. Banks are in that sense perfected examples of decentralised theatre that we could learn from: to outside observers, they are beholden to boards and shareholders and subject to strict laws and rules but more often than not controlled by a very small internal cabal of profitable revenue whales who make the law in their own image. Why not accept that this is what will happen to Maker DAO? Sure, we can continue lobbying. The crypto industry will get a few wins and concessions along the way of course. Maybe the EU will tweak the rules to benefit some projects. Or the US will concede securities laws only apply to limited cases. DAOs will pocket the cost saving. But as a minimum, DAO/DeFi protocols and platforms need to be ready for the knowable future and engaged in re-shaping it as well. And that means demonstrating that we\u2019ll play by similar rules to everyone else in finance and prove the business case that we offer better outcomes for end-users of all nations. What would be a much stronger play is therefore to prepare, in a very public fashion, for the incoming regs while continuing to strive internally for greater technical resilience, protection of users and privacy. How DAOs navigate this way of doing business should be part of the overall strategy. To choose just one example, it is illustrative to note how Ripple have tried to bridge the gap I\u2019m talking about here. They appear to be one of the few organisations who have the balance about right (and yet they still got into trouble - FinCEN fines in 2016 and now the SEC litigation). They have fought for seats at the table at the key global organisations while keeping in reserve the latent power offered by a permissionless, censorship-resistant, internet-of-value. They appreciate all too well the transformative power to change finance and social structures. We don\u2019t need to agree with Ripple\u2019s organisation, the XRP consensus model, the leadership or questionable founder allocations. Just watch the way they go about their business. What they\u2019re doing is far-reaching and savvy. They are playing a very long game.     jacek:  Ultimately, decentralization is and will be our strongest moat against regulatory risks.   Maybe this is one area where I will part ways with a lot of my cryptolegal colleagues. If the plan is to integrate and re-make financial primitives using composable, decentralised, permissionless tools, then the moat becomes meaningless given how many draw-bridges and interfaces are required to the centralised, permissioned real world. Having a moat implies some type of perimeter between DeFi and everything else. There won\u2019t be such a clear line. Or better said, a clearly definable moat is a sign of weakness, not of strength because it means, to me at least, that DeFi has become trapped by ideologues within an echo-chamber. For starters, who defines \u201cdecentralised\u201d? By the above reckoning, decentralisation is that which evades and opposes the laws of the military-industrial complex. Is that evasion really a measure of success for DeFi? Is it a goal we should aspire to? Unless the intent is to remain fugitives for eternity, I say not. But I digress. A moat gives nation-states an easily definable target. It not only locks \u201cthem\u201d out, it also locks \u201cus\u201d in. We\u2019ve seen China, India and other large nations concerned about capital flight criminalising crypto transactions and closing on-ramps. We saw the simplest of sanctions against TC, a single protocol, cause chaos across the industry. They are proof of the trivial nature by which crypto can be centrally controlled by nation-states. We need nation-states and their citizens as stakeholders, not enemies. This involves, politics, negotiation and compromise. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m in the business of bridge building. Recently, I\u2019ve heard that crypto will \u201close its soul\u201d as a result of compromise. It\u2019s heart-warming to think digital assets and cryptography have a soul but protecting l\u2019esprit of crypto isn\u2019t a terribly pragmatic or effective strategy. For example, I love vinyl records and tube amplifiers, their warmth and \u201cnatural\u201d sound. No one can track my data when I play them. Their use is extremely private. No email marketing or AI suggestions. But they are not the future.     jacek:  This is shadow banking business under a pirate flag. Even if we finally sort out all the current issues in 1-2-3 years, the costs to comply with financial regulations will be enormous.   Maybe I\u2019m suffering the same Kantian fever-dream of a borderless Welt where citizens of the world can travel freely or in this case, transact freely. But at least I recognise that its ambition would require global organisations with support across the industry to not just lobby on its behalf, but to regulate itself. It will need an internationally recognised charter that builds on existing human rights of freedom of association, freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy and the freedom to participate in public affairs. It needs to develop an ethical framework around which development will occur. It needs to work on its trust quotient. The United Metaverse of DeFi. These are achievable goals. It won\u2019t be pretty and it won\u2019t be perfect. But with some work, it will be allow for safe passage for those who develop in this space. If Maker or any other protocol wishes to uphold the pretence that it could sustain a global reserve currency, these are the questions that will need to be reconciled by our industry. If we don\u2019t achieve these goals then I am confident that this technology will be co-opted by organisations who are prepared to make the necessary compromises. Those groups will ultimately win and they know it. We need to get organised. ",

This is a widely believed sentiment in the community but it is plain wrong. The Tornado Cash example shows quite clearly that on-chain collateral can be blocked or frozen just as easily as off-chain collateral. The more important point is that RWA is already regulated so there is far less chance that there would be any need for a governmental authority to block or freeze it. Unlike Tornado, RWA is much harder to use for money-laundering or sanctions evasion as it is fully KYC\u2019d.

Thanks, @jacek for bringing these thoughts forward.     0xbocaJ:  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that legal entity status for the DAO necessarily means its a partnership with unlimited liability for all members.   Due to the nature of the system, heavily echo this. Regardless, your point of meeting regulators to educate them on permissionless systems is a useful strategy that could use some more collaboration and unification.  Need a few more @PaperImperium s out there grinding the education circuit.     0xbocaJ:  Picking a favorable jurisdiction for incorporation   I don\u2019t really understand this point, though. The maker foundation existed and, as jacek notes, did a good job of interfacing and steering strategy. Eventually, decentralization was the path, so why\u2026do the dance again? Has something significantly changed that would make this advantageous? Genuinely curious.     Daimon-Law:  If the plan is to integrate and re-make financial primitives using composable, decentralised, permissionless tools, then the moat becomes meaningless given how many draw-bridges and interfaces are required to the centralised, permissioned real world.   This is just great prose, had to highlight it.     Daimon-Law:  require global organisations with support across the industry to not just lobby on its behalf, but to regulate itself. It will need an internationally recognised charter that builds on existing human rights of freedom of association, freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy and the freedom to participate in public affairs. It needs to develop an ethical framework around which development will occur. It needs to work on its trust quotient. The United Metaverse of DeFi.

                    "content": "    Eumenes:  many RWAs have been around a long time, address large market needs (housing, auto finance, credit cards, trade finance\u2026) and have significant public support   This is a good point that isn\u2019t raised enough. I read this  press release earlier today from HVB (thanks @teej for linking):  Travis J. Thompson, Esq. Chairman and CEO of HVB commented: \u201cThis is the kind of financial innovation that helps bring stable assets to the Cryptocurrency space and provides real benefits to the U.S. economy by bringing a new funding source to the table that will enable economic growth to continue in the greater Philadelphia market area through expanded commercial lending activities.\"  That latter bit is key. Rather than going down the path of being a pariah, trying to become impervious to any US regulations/sanctions (likely an impossible task in any case), the better defence may well be a good offence: building economic integrations with broad public support. Just imagine if DeFi had another twenty Makers, with twenty more professional RWA teams building integrations with the real world. Twenty more HVBs explicitly saying that crypto is helping drive economic growth! Crypto is an easy target for regulators and politicians when it\u2019s associated with Ponzi schemes, hacks and money laundering. Each successful real-world financial integration helps shift that narrative, a little more each time. Of course (re the original post) that RWAs are not the \u201ccure for all Maker\u2019s problems\u201d, but they don\u2019t have to be, and as a nice bonus they provide us with some diversification away from crypto exposure.

The maker foundation existed and, as jacek notes, did a good job of interfacing and steering strategy. Eventually, decentralization was the path, so why\u2026do the dance again? Has something significantly changed that would make this advantageous? Genuinely curious.   Saying \u201cdecentralization is the path\u201d as a reason for not forming some sort of corporate identity is placing a big bet on the proposition that no court in any jurisdiction will ever decide that Maker is a legal entity.  And the risk is exacerbated given that the SEC and now OFAC have taken the position that DAOs and the smart contract assets thereof are legal entities. That legal risk has a chilling effect on the community because would-be participants don\u2019t know what DAO or DAO member activities they may or may not be liable for, what states or countries the DAO might expose them to jurisdiction in, or what taxes they owe for DAO profits (or what jurisdiction\u2019s tax code applies to DAO activities! Do DAO members owe taxes for every Dai minted?) Further, not affirmatively picking a particular jurisdiction for and form of incorporation gives a would-be plaintiff or regulator leverage to press the DAO towards whatever they think the worst jurisdiction\u2019s laws would be.  For example, a plaintiff could choose to file suit in the state with an active participant in the DAO and the broadest rules for member liability in an unincorporated association. ",

                    "content": "@jacek Stablecoin regulations are being cooked all around the globe. Dai and Maker will be outlawed if they don\u2019t follow the requirements. These regulations will be very difficult to comply with without a centralized structure in place. After the UST collapse, one should not expect regulatory differentiation between centralized and decentralized stablecoins. However, counting on RWA as the main collateral was a misconception a few years ago, and still is a misconception in 2022. Maker\u2019s smart contracts are not subject to USDC freezing/blocking. This risk is associated with the inherent censorship risks of RWAs rather than a direct sanctions risk for Maker. We will see further attacks on self-hosted wallets and forcing KYC everywhere, and this is why we should treat decentralization with care. ",

That\u2019s just another piece of evidence that many closely monitor what\u2019s happening at MakerDAO and our in-house discussions. One common misunderstanding that I saw was that the post describes the overall legal situation at Maker. That\u2019s not exactly the case. My post was prompted by discussions going on in discord at that time. That said, it\u2019s great to see others contributing with their expertise. Thank you for your input. I enjoyed the comments. Another point I wanted to make is that while I expressed my opinions on some of the topics, my main goal was a little different: to highlight that Maker\u2019s strategic decisions will have legal consequences. Some interpreted my post as taking the position that Dai should depeg from USD. Not really; I am not exactly sure if there is currently a market for a free-floating stablecoin. What I meant is that keeping the peg to a fiat currency is going to have tangible regulatory consequences in at least some key markets. At the very least, Maker should be able to predict these consequences. Also, the post wasn\u2019t directly about the Tornado Cash situation. There are many takeaways, but a major one is that we need to be prepared for nasty regulatory developments. Again, it\u2019s crucial to identify them. ",
