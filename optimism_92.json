                    "content": "[DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1] Palm Finance Based on the community feedbacks we adjusted our proposals for Optimism as below: Project Name: Palm Finance Author Name: @chloeee Palm Finance Number of OP tokens requested: 400,000 OP L2 Recipient Address: 0x523EB9cD802990A009816504156C9484cB384dc6 Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.) Palm Finance is 80% completed and hasn\u2019t been deployed on any Chain. Current Valuation of Market Cap: $ 20 Million Target Market Cap:$ 1 Billion Optimism alignment: 1.Nowadays there are emerging many new assets in crypto world, new assets (NFTs, LP, interest-bearing coins) are bringing a large number of new users, especially enthusiasts of NFTs. However, there are still no enough usage scenarios for these assets, Palm is designed to resolve this. If deployed on Optimism, Palm will contribute by connecting group of new users. 2.Palm accepts LPs, interest-bearing tokens as collaterals, and can realize up to 21x leverage, multiplying mining profits of users holding these assets, will help to boost the TVL growth of other protocols in the ecosystem. 3.Stablecoin is one of the most important ecosystems in every chain. Palm accepts collaterals of $OP and some DEX\u2019s tokens on Optimism, allows users to deposit them & generate stablecoin $PUST, which can play a positive role in stabilizing $OP price. 4 .Palm is highly composable . Like we can see in the Ethereum ecosystem, the cooperation among FRAX, MIM, LUSD and various protocols have so much positive impact on the entire ecosystem. We believe that if PALM can cooperate deeply with other protocols in Optimism, it will certainly better promote the development and stability of the ecosystem . Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? &How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? 200K of the OP tokens will be used for liquidity incentives , to reward the users who deposit LP tokens of PUST/USDC for farming. Will be distributed in 3 months 100K OP will be used for project auditing. 100K OP will be used for marketing and launch events. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Palm provides creative usage scenarios for new assets of NFTs, LPs, yield-bearing assets, users benefit from it by holding and earning. Borrowing stablecoins at 0% interest and getting leverage can multiply users profits, protocol can survive even without incentives. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Over 3 months How much will your project match in co-incentives? We will match 1:1 to the OP tokens.

The proposal explains how the project will contribute to the Optimism ecosystem and how the OP tokens will be distributed.

We just updated a better incentive program in proposal Total 500K OP will be distributed in this way: -300K will be used as liquidity incentives (100K/month, will last for 3 months) -100K for auditing -100K for marketing The liquidity incentives will bring higher APR for the trading pair PUST/USDC, Palm will be more competitive & attract more attention than competitors on other chains, which will help the TVL growth of both Palm and Optimism. In the 3-month incentive period, we will cooperate with more protocols in OP ecosystem, increase our exposure and traffic, these incentives will give us to bigger space for cooperation and marketing, very important for us to grow. We believe once Palm is combined with enough protocols partners, it will keep working smoothly and healthily even when the incentive period is ended. ",

As we added in our proposal, the benefits Palm will provide to Optimism are:  -Palm accepts LPs, interest-bearing tokens as collaterals, and can realize up to 21x leverage, multiplying mining profits of users holding these assets, will help to boost the TVL growth of other protocols in the ecosystem. -Palm accepts collaterals of $OP and some DEX\u2019s tokens on Optimism, allows users to deposit them & generate stablecoin $PUST, which can play a positive role in stabilizing $OP price. -Palm is highly composable. We believe that if PALM can cooperate deeply with other protocols in Optimism, it will certainly better promote the development and stability of the ecosystem.  When the liquidity incentives run out, we will have continuous liquidity mining rewards in $PALM. What we\u2019re different from USDC, or DAI, is that we\u2019re not only stablecoins, but also a yield aggregator. Through the leverages it will amplify the mining incomes for depositing LP tokens or interest-bearing tokens. Borrowing against the assets portfolio instead of single assets, will realize a up to 22x farming yield. Palm protocol realizes an innovation of integrating the functions of YFI+Alpha+MIM+BendDao. For Defi users who want to increase their asset efficiency, Palm proposes a better solution for accelerating asset yield. ",

The reason this project seems worthwhile to me is that Optimism doesn\u2019t yet have a native stablecoin, obviously things like DAI are available on Optimism, but the Maker infrastructure that lets you mint DAI is only on L1. Having a stablecoin that can be minted directly on OP seems like a useful addition to the ecosystem. On the other hand, it would of course be nice to see the project deployed before we start offering liquidity incentives, so I\u2019m open to the idea that this proposal might just be being submitted a bit early?
