I would expect it to ultimately leave some sort of way for Maker to integrate with US crypto markets and remain decentralized. The requirement to \u201cregister\u201d or disclose stuff may not necessarily mean full scale backdoor centralization. But on the other hand some kind of blanket ban / attempt to take backdoor control of defi is something we have always expected and should be prepared for. Maker will should always choose decentralization at whatever the price. Dai is entrenched enough that it wouldn\u2019t be a death sentence to have it banned from US exchanges, or even all centralized crypto exchanges, and most of our tech is in place to the point where we could move to a world where all core units and contributors are anonymous. Ultimately there are some powerful tools we have available to deal with a US/EU de facto ban of decentralization: Staked ETH, Dai generated from MKR, MetaDAOs with decentralized frontends and decentralized business models, crypto friendly jurisdictions like UK and UAE, and finally, if it comes to it, depegging from USD by implementing TRFM. I think it is obvious we should break the USD peg before we irreversibly centralize the Maker protocol, if it ever comes to that. We\u2019re here to create unbiased and decentralized money and can never betray that goal. ",

Another thing that\u2019s gonna help is to show regulators and more important regular people (i.e. voters) that DeFi and Dai can provide real value to the world, not just be big ponzi. This is where Clean Money and paying off with tangible and verifiable impact such as renewable energy funding can make a real difference if we can establish a narrative that cuts through the noise.

I did not mint the token although I did reach out to see if they were looking for in house counsel. But the idea is to inform the politicians. We have a ways to go but many of us are trying. Once everything shakes out in terms of the legislation in the U.S. I am hoping that we get guidance as opposed to the enforcement first mindset. ",
