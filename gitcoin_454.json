For example, someone that is on a chair for a lot of hours, or is on a screen all the time it is possible to have some health issues that may affect his productivity and in general, have a lower quality of life. Do you think there is possible to create a health service for the gitcoin community that helps these people? Is it possible to create a social security system that helps people with their health problems or provides financial support to them? ",
