It will ensure that new client features are adopted much faster than it is the case now (e.g. Parity recently introduced improvements to their block propagation algorithm which should decrease the network uncle rate, but as long as not all miners update their Parity nodes, we won\u2019t see any significant improvement). A 9 month cycle seems a bit long and might cause lots of changes to be introduced in a single fork. Going for a 3 or 6 month cycle would allow to generally only roll out forks that focus on a few new features which are easier to test & adopt. ",

How does this EEP-5 Harkfork Process fit in with the steps described in EEP-1 for Consensus-related forks? And will we leave lesser kinds of releases up to individual client devs, perhaps defining an EEP-10 which they can generally follow? Probably the key thing that stands out is the coordination of testing and testnet-ing.  smoke testing testnet rehearsal testnet rollout mainnet rehearsal mainnet rollout postmortems  Are perhaps the rehearsals not necessary in EEP-5, or is there another flow you would propose for the more general Hardfork Process? Perhaps there is a sort of inheritance from EEP-5 into EEP-1, in which EEP-1 adds some steps because it involves changes to the consensus protocol? Also, it might be good to list out the likely changes going into non-hardfork and hardfork releases, w/ tags we can all agree on across repos, then describing which EEE applies. e.g.  data, p2p, les, json-rpc, rlp-encoding, evm \u2026 or evm-opcodes?, consensus ",
