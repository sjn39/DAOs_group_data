Suggested Solution: I was thinking to implement an arbitrable smart contract that is secured by Celest protocol in a way in which the bounty creator is forced to lock the reward into the contract so in case of a dispute Celest court can decide for the reward. I also want to implement it in a way so that the locked money will be pipe into a yield farming protocol ( like 88mph ) so the locked money won\u2019t be idle. The generated profit from 88mph will be distributed between bounty owner and GTC stakers. ",

Welcome on the GitcoinDAO forum  I think it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask, are \u201cThese Bounties\u201d sustainable, from the developer perspective but also from the bounty creator \u201cvision\u201d. It\u2019s not the first time I can see or read a user or dev \u201cNot Complaining\u201d but simply demanding inquiries about the payments following his work on a particular bounty. What is the definition of sustainability: Good Coordination, Good Communication, Supportable, Viable, Livable and feasible\u2026 I think you bring a good point that we could discuss further with the community. Cheers!  ",

It\u2019s actually a private repo hosted at https://artisticalintelligence.art/  and Happily, the owner started to communicating again, and everything is fine for now.
