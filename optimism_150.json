                    "content": "Project Name: Interest Protocol Author Name and Contact: GFX Labs; governance@gfxlabs.io I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes Number of OP tokens requested: 31,764 OP L2 Recipient Address: 0xa6e8772af29b29B9202a073f8E36f447689BEef6 Grant Category: DeFi Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee? Yes. One of the DeFi Committees. Project Description: Interest Protocol is a fractional reserve, overcollateralized borrowing protocol. IP software allows users to permissionlessly generate USDi stablecoins against their collateral assets. Users may also swap USDC for USDi (and vice versa) at a 1:1 exchange rate through the protocol. All USDi utilize rebasing to report accrued fees. USDi accrues through fees paid by borrowers. Project Links: Website Twitter Discord Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: To avoid forum clutter, this can be disclosed privately upon request. Relevant Usage Metrics: On Ethereum, Interest Protocol ranks 118th in TVL after less than 1 month, and $3.9m in overcollateralized loans (both at time of writing). Competitors, peers, and similar projects: Compound and Aave are both competitors. Similar projects (overcollateralized while also fractionally reserved) are difficult to locate. Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes. Optimism native? No. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Ultimately up to IP governance, but this grant would likely prioritize that deployment to the immediate future. Ecosystem Value Proposition: Interest Protocol plans to support the OP token as collateral on Optimism. Interest Protocol is designed to allow tokens held as collateral to still be able to participate in governance via delegation controlled by the user. This means token holders \u2013 in particular small holders whose governance voice is not particularly loud \u2013 avoid choosing between using their OP to finance on- or off-chain priorities, or participating in Optimism governance. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. But there is a separate grant request for this project for an incentives subsidy. Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? No. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words): How will the OP tokens be distributed? The tokens will be used to partially fund deployment and development costs for an Optimism instance of Interest Protocol. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Interest Protocol would accept OP as a collateral at deployment, and preserve the ability of OP holders to delegate their voting rights. This serves the dual purpose of providing a demand sink for OP that would otherwise be sold, and allow OP holders a venue where they can avoid choosing between liquidity and governance participation. Normally there is an implicit \u201ctax\u201d to pay by retaining governance tokens for voting or delegation, since the opportunity to use it as collateral must be given up. Interest Protocol is designed to avoid this choice. On its Ethereum deployment, for instance, UNI tokens used as collateral can still delegate voting power to be used in Uniswap\u2019s governance.  Screen Shot 2022-07-12 at 12.23.35 PM1094\u00d71048 70.1 KB  Screenshot from Ethereum Interest Protocol highlighting delegation of collateral. We believe this results in a healthier governance ecosystem where small holders in particular continue to participate, since they do not have to choose between financial and governance utility of their tokens. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? This request is to fund deployment and development of a protocol that will provide utility to OP holders and the Optimism ecosystem. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The tokens for would be sold as expenses accrue, since the grant is to fund development and deployment. How much will your project match in co-incentives? GFX Labs and/or Interest Protocol governance will cover the remainder of expenses related to Optimism deployment and all ongoing maintenance. Budget Estimate  Protocol testing prior to production deployment: 56 developer hours Front end multichain support: 10 developer hours Analytics back end support: 10 developer hours Governance bridge contract development & deployment: 38 developer hours Protocol integrations with other ecosystem apps: 48 developer hours  Estimated total: 162 developer hours This request is for an Optimism grant to cover 50% of estimated costs. $OP price of $0.51 (at time of writing) * 81 hours * $200/hour = 31,764 OP ",

We think a major value add is that Interest Protocol would accept OP as collateral, which should improve the utility of the OP token. To date, we are only aware of one small protocol that has onboarded OP as collateral. Note that Interest Protocol does not lend out collateral, so unlike a Compound or Aave fork, OP on the platform could not result in short-selling pressure in times of market stress. Additionally, Interest Protocol is built to allow users to continue to utilize their tokens for governance. On Ethereum, for instance, users who place UNI in their vaults are still able to delegate the voting power and participate in Uniswap governance. This means OP holders can realize both financing against their tokens and participation in Optimism governance. This should result in a healthier governance ecosystem where small players do not abandon governance simply because the financial rewards of collateralizing their tokens are significant. Again, appreciate your feedback! We\u2019ll try to highlight the value add to Optimism more prominently ",

Re: The proposal   Benefits for Op could be very strong: Op as Collateral, Op can still be used for governance, (Co-)Incentives can lead to strong initial & potentially sustained growth with IP efficiency   Risk: Similar to onboarding toxic assets in a lending protocol, Optimism should be cautious of incentivizing projects that potentially add significant risk to users in the ecosystem. We are a bit worried about the fractional reserve model which may lead to locked up user funds (+ bad debt in case of toxic assets, liquidation failures, other protocol bugs).   The size of this dev grant is small and a no-brainer. Despite not being fans of funding development, we\u2019d support the 31,764 OP tokens for deployment.   The size of the other, main grant proposal (240K Op) is also reasonable for a new, value-adding project though we\u2019d prefer to see the initial sale finish, more certainty around the date of deployment & Op distribution as well as protocol risk management before incentivizing growth with Op tokens.

Interest Protocol has decentralized token governance, so that\u2019s obviously just a guess since any token holder with enough IPT or delegated votes could put forth a proposal to prioritize an Optimism deployment over other work.   These were broken into separate proposals to give governance the option to vote on each piece separately, since one is to defray deployment expenses and is quite small, while this proposal is targeted at more traditional co-incentivization and larger in size.  For what it\u2019s worth, I do appreciate the option to consider individual asks separately like this. And I think funding development to move migration further up a project\u2019s roadmap is absolutely the kind of thing we should be doing if our objective is to facilitate growth. @ScaleWeb3  says:  (Not sure why there are 2 proposals on the forum.)  You answered your own question. It\u2019s an opportunity to get the ball rolling with a marginal ask. @GFXlabs reasons: doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for incentives today. But if not having deployed is a nonstarter, the thinking is that splitting up the proposals helps devs get migration across the finish line faster. ",
