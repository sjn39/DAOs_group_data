Furthermore, block rewards will be adjusted to a base of 2 ETH, uncle and nephew rewards will be adjusted accordingly.

                    "content": "Moving discussion to here from PR. Recommend splitting this into two separate EIPs.  One for the Ice Age and one for the block reward.  At the moment, the block reward is per block, rather than per time.  From previous discussions it sounds like there is a desire for block reward to be a function of time instead of a function of block. I have already created EIP 1240 which proposes removing the difficulty bomb all together.  If there is a desire to keep the difficulty bomb, then I recommend creating an EIP that just delays it. Separately, if there is in fact a desire to make the block reward a function of time (which it sounds like there is) then create an EIP that does that. The current system of letting an ice age come (which reduces block reward per time) and then rollback/delay the ice age but don\u2019t rollback the block reward reduction is feels like it is trying to sneak in a block reward reduction.  I don\u2019t necessarily think that is the intent, but I do believe there is value in more clearly defining that the block reward schedule is intended to decrease with time. Personally, I support a block reward reduction with time and a delay (or better yet removal) of the ice age all together.  My only real complaint with this EIP is that it is bundling two concepts that shouldn\u2019t be bundled.  I recognize that perhaps they were bundled in the past and it is easiest to just \u201cbundle them again\u201d but in the past this class of EIP has resulted in a large amount of discussion and that discussion would be easier to have if the two changes were separated from each other and more clearly isolated.

Which calculations do you use to it? (Just want to learn about this process and double check). Maybe a google datasheet or similar with the data would be great! ",
