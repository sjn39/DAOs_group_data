I founded the strangest thing - wallets wich were marked as sybill attackers from airdrop #1 somehow got rewarded on airdrop #2 - for me it seems pretty unfair, isn\u2019t it? What do you think? Also there were some guys selling scripts for Optimism quests and users who used them are pretty obv for me also sybill attackers, and it was rather easy to count them all and exclude from airdrop - but also nobody did it. And I suppose if nobody will highlight that topic they can steal pretty tasty part of latest airdrops from regular, honest users. I don\u2019t like that much, and you? Please write any thoughts and ways how to fix it, if you think that this situation isn\u2019t normal. Thanks ",
