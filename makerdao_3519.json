Which is actually very little probably around 5% of the vault amount max. So overall the max amount would be probably way less than 1m. The current reserve should be largely enough to cover this type of expenses. Even if maker has to pay for the full amount it is probably going to be less than 10m. Then the process should be, I believe. First the judge will give the judgement against the foundation ( as they are the only legal entity). If the judgement is not executed, the defendant will need to do an action to enforce the law. That where it becomes complicated but I do believe we won\u2019t come to it. Governance or the foundation should accept the judgement and pay. But that is my 2 cents. Please feel free to correct me  ",
