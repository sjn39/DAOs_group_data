                    "content": "One of the reasons why I\u2019ve been spending so much time on Gitcoin is that there is a lot of room for growth here. That\u2019s because I think it\u2019s TAM (total addressable market), SAM (serviceable available market), and SAM (serviceable obtainable market) is really really high. These two slides explain these concepts really well.  TAM-SAM-SOM-Explained-what-is1200\u00d7654 38 KB  And this second infographic, which is slightly more complicated, explains the concept further.  b8d393f53ae53155c4b775c5bc2555471920\u00d72484 247 KB   Gitcoin\u2019s TAM/SOM/SAM I think that Gitcoin TAM/SOM/SAM look like this:  Gitcoin Passport How big is the market size for an web3 identity aggregator?     What Size Comment     TAM 5 billion Number of Internet Users per wikipedia    SAM 30 million Number of MetaMask users per decrypt    SOM 30 million The SOM is the same as SAM in my opinion.   Current Traction 188 thousand Number of GItcoin funders per gitcoin.co/results    Current Traction 100 thousand Number of GItcoin Passports per Gitcoin gov forum      Grants Stack How big is the market size for an web3 capital allocation stack?     What Size Comment     TAM $25 trillion/year Amount allocated to public goods per year per giveth    SAM\u2081 $10.8 billion Approximate total size of DAO treasuries per deepDAO    SAM\u2082 $1 trilllion Total Crypto Market Cap per coinmarketcap    SOM $10.8 billion The SOM is the same as SAM in my opinion.   Current Traction $72 million Total amount of public goods funding on Gitcoin so far per gitcoin.co/results      Token Swaps As you can see from this post, I am bullish on GTC doing token swaps (what you call Mutual Grants) with up and coming VC projects.     What Size Comment     TAM\u2081 $1 trilllion Total Crypto Market Cap per coinmarketcap    TAM\u2082 $800 billion VC Investments In 2021 per globaldata    SAM $21 billion VC Investments In Crypto 2021 per coindesk    SOM $21 billion The SOM is the same as SAM in my opinion.   Current Traction $100k Estimated Total Gitcoin Mutual Grants so far per this post      What insights can we derive from this information?  Gitcoin\u2019s Growth will be an S-Curve Many of the graphs in the GTC Financial Model are quite naive because they show an exponential growth (J curve) growth. In reality, Gitcoin\u2019s growth will be limited by it\u2019s TAM, SAM, and SOM.   Room to Grow Gitcoin\u2019s current traction is ~ 1/1000th of it\u2019s SOM in almost all of the market segments that it is in.  That makes me really excited about room for growth. There is massive room for growth in this market!  All that remains between current traction + the SOM is execution and network effects!  Rising Tide Lifts All Boats A rising tide lifts all boats.  The nice thing about Gitcoin is that it\u2019s being lifted by the rising tide of Ethereum\u2019s growth.  We can expect that Gitcoin\u2019s SAM/SOM will continue to grow as long as the EVM continues to gets adopted. ",
