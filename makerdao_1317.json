That is the argument. You\u2019re welcome to disagree, but the evidence is not on your side - not in the world of DAOs, nor in the world of traditional organizations. The size of an organization is not indicative of that organization\u2019s economic impact. You can have a tiny org that makes a huge impact. You can have a huge org that makes a tiny impact.

Show me a chart of some proxy of economic impact against number of people within an org & show me no correlation.  If you want me to come at you with the same type of anecdotal energy, which org has a bigger economic impact: walmart with over 2 million employees or your local family-owned convenience store with 5?

I\u2019m all ears once you have something that suggests otherwise. As a fairly related sidenote: I think it is crucial that the DAO aligns on overall direction: should we focus on instant profitability & cutting down, should we focus on growth & operate at a loss, or should we be somewhere in between?

People fight and when there are too many opinions, politics eventually dominate.  Smart contracts just follow rules and do what they\u2019re supposed to do.  When they fail, they are fixed and rebuilt to be better.  I agree that we shouldn\u2019t forget the vision and promise of this industry. I think @lyt is speaking from a realist\u2019s perspective that we aren\u2019t there yet and that the R&D to get there requires people in many different roles for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m sympathetic to both views and hope we as a community will be able to set aside differences and focus on building solutions to the challenges we face.  But the fundamental question you both ask is important.  Who is truly critical to the protocol?  (would we be performing any worse if we had just stuck with a paid PECU and Risk team?). What roles are unnecessary or of lower value than their cost?  And where might more people be actually causing harm by distraction, conflict, and discouragement?  I don\u2019t expect there to be any consensus on this but we can continue to examine, reflect, and hopefully improve the effectiveness of the workforce. ",

                    "content": "    Doo_StableLab:  I feel the discussion has gone a bit offtopic\u2026   With this I whole-heartedly agree, and will be making an attempt below to get the discussion back on track, as I very firmly believe this to be the only discussion worth having at this moment in time\u2026     Doo_StableLab:  \u2026as this focuses on \u201cMandated Actors Neutrality Discussion\u201d Maybe it\u2019s best to discuss economic impact & number of people in the org in a separate thread.   With all due respect (truly), I humbly yet whole-heartedly disagree\u2026 The original thread was for the \u201cMandated Actors Neutrality Discussion\u201d (I\u2019m quoting you there, but of course that was also the very title of that thread)\u2026 On the other hand, this spin-off thread (titled \u201cA Large Complex DAO: reducing the human footprint\u201d) is very much for \u201c[discussing] economic impact & number of people in the org\u201d\u2026 And this one is only related to that one insofar as that one, and its general tone & goings-on, serves as an example of what this thread is attempting to bring to light\u2026 @ChrisBlec please correct me if the above is wrong, and/or please jump in and reply-to/rebut the following\u2026 I don\u2019t mean to speak on your behalf\u2026  Now, I can see that many Makers (is that what we call ourselves?) seem to be very concerned about this thing we\u2019re all calling \u201cgrowth\u201d, which in the comments above has also been referred to as \u201ceconomic impact\u201d\u2026 I can also see that many Makers think we can grow now, and also that we must grow now, in order to be \u201ceconomically impactful\u201d now\u2026 I submit that this kind of near-sighted thinking (now now now) is not only a case of \u2018putting the cart before the horse\u2019, but that it is, in fact, a disastrous case of it which could do (and possibly/arguably already is doing) irreparable damage to Maker in the mid-to-long term\u2026 Before I begin, I\u2019d like to tag @Eumenes, as I believe this will be relevant to your interests\u2026 Here I present two examples, one \u201clegacy\u201d example (@lyt wants to talk about Walmart, let\u2019s talk about Walmart) and one \u201cmodern\u201d (aka \u2018digital age\u2019) example\u2026  Walmart https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart Walmart started with one store in the early 1960\u2019s in a small region of Arkansas. After nearly a decade, Walmart had grown to 38 stores and one regional distribution center to service them. At that point, they had 1,500 employees total (HQ employees, yes, but also in-store sales associates, warehouse workers, etc) and sales of $44.2 million\u2026 Which in today\u2019s dollars would be roughly $333M\u2026  Aside: To reiterate, that\u2019s one-third of a billion \u2018today dollars\u2019 being managed/overseen at the time by maybe, what, 150 people? (one-tenth of the above-stated 1,500 employees)\u2026 So there\u2019s your example of a small/agile group with an outsized \u201ceconomic impact\u201d\u2026  Now, yes, Walmart went on to be a globally recognized powerhouse of a retail brand worth hundreds of billions ($331B in the U.S. alone in 2019 \u2013 aka pre-pandemic), but they didn\u2019t just pop into existence that way\u2026 It took them decades to get there, and here\u2019s the really really very important bit: In those early days I described above, they stayed small, relegated to a small region of the deep U.S. south, and grew themselves organically\u2026 It wasn\u2019t until they had a solid business model and a well-functioning system in place (a few dozen stores and a regional distribution center to support them) that they were then able to really expand (aka \u201cgrow\u201d) to have the super-charged \u201ceconomic impact\u201d we see today\u2026  Facebook https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook Spoiler alert: I\u2019m about to make basically the exact same case for Facebook in the 2000\u2019s that I just made for Walmart in the '60s\u2026 In fact, I\u2019m also just copy/pasting the same text I used for Walmart as a starting template for this Facebook example\u2026 Facebook started in the early 2000\u2019s at one university. Now, where Walmart took nearly a decade to build and prove their economic model, Facebook would only take about a year (welcome to the digital age!) to increase from one ivy league school to four, and then to all the ivy league schools, and then to most colleges in the U.S. and Canada\u2026 But it would still be another two years before they would open the platform to the general public, and another year after that for Microsoft to buy-in at a roughly $15B valuation\u2026 Or $21B in today\u2019s dollars\u2026 So, not quite early-days Walmart money, but still not bad considering they did it in about one-third the time\u2026 And of course Facebook went on to be a globally recognized powerhouse of a social brand worth hundreds of billions ($200B in 2014), but they didn\u2019t just pop into existence that way\u2026 It took them about a decade to get there, and here\u2019s the really really very important bit: In those early days I described above, they stayed small, relegated to just colleges in North America, and grew themselves organically\u2026 It wasn\u2019t until they had a solid business model and a well-functioning system in place (a website for college kids to socially interact with each other) that they were then able to really expand (aka \u201cgrow\u201d) to have the super-charged \u201ceconomic impact\u201d we see today\u2026  So what\u2019s your point, MWOW? My point is this: Maker launched very late in 2017, so we\u2019re now only four and a half years into this thing (and only a year from the Foundation handing the whole thing over to us BTW!) and we\u2019re at, what, $7B today counting both MKR & DAI\u2026? And if you account for the recent macro economic downturn (Facebook was born during the dotcom-bubble recovery, lucky them!) and the fact that the blockchain and DAOs in particular are/were still quite new (meaning Maker has had to largely pioneer the concept for themselves*) then we have to grade this on a curve and say that we\u2019re still very much in the early days here, like Facebook during (arguably near the end of, to be sure) its \u201ccollege years\u201d\u2026  * Versus Facebook, where all they did was build a website (not a novel concept in 2004) focused on teens / twenty-somethings interacting with each other socially (not a novel concept in all of human history)\u2026  Meaning what, exactly? Meaning: Calm down and get some perspective, dang it!!! Also meaning: We need need need to take the time, right now before it\u2019s too late, to do what Walmart and Facebook and many many other \u201ceconomically impactful\u201d global entities have all done: Build something really great on a relatively small scale first, get it perfect while it\u2019s still a manageable size, then grow it to massive scale\u2026 And I\u2019m sorry, but I think anyone else here* calling for \u201c[Maker] to spend all available resources on growth [right now]\u201d are just plain wrong\u2026 It\u2019s near-sighted and, frankly, unhealthy for the ecosystem\u2026and, also frankly, kinda greedy\u2026  * I\u2019m looking at Makers like @krzkaczor @superTricycle & @Hasu from the latter comments of this discussion\u2026 And please know that I\u2019m tagging you to get your eyes on this, and so I can hear your rebuttals\u2026 I can see the surrounding paragraphs may come across as a bit standoff-ish as I read this back, but I\u2019m sticking with it as I think the reality of the situation may be that we\u2019re all in a bit of a standoff at the moment\u2026  I mean, think about it: You all want to make decisions about \u201chyper-growth\u201d (or anything else) right now using a fledgling, somewhat ill-defined, clearly not-entirely-healthy decision-making process\u2026? What?? If you\u2019re walking on a path and see that you\u2019re likely headed off a cliff in the distance, you don\u2019t start sprinting forward! You\u2019ve gotta stop and assess the situation, and seriously consider whether maybe going back and taking a different fork in the road somewhere might not be the better option\u2026 And yeah, I recognize that Maker is no longer profitable right now, and tightening one\u2019s belt is never a fun prospect\u2026 But can we please prioritize stabilizing economically while growing governance participation, codifying the governance structure, and generally just getting our ducks in a row first? Get the DAO into a strong, healthy state before we start sprinting into the future? I mean, time really is on our side here\u2026 At least, that\u2019s how I see it\u2026 Thank you for reading, whoever read this. I appreciate your time and attention. ",
