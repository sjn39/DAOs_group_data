For a review of the draft documents, please see the below links  Downstream Agreements Transfer Instructions  Broker Dealer  To / From   US Bank  Custody Agreement     Credit Agreement Security Agreement Trust Agreement  Please review all of the documents and provide any feedback in either the associated thread or to me directly at [email\u00a0protected] Important note: All of the documents above, when executed, will require a legal enforceability opinion in the relevant jurisdiction(s). In addition, Wilmington Saving Fund Society (www.wsfsbank.com) and the RWA Senior Lending Trust are both represented by Richards Layton & Finger (www.rlf.com) in Delaware, so the focus should be on the salient business points. As downstream transactions continue to build-up, I am requesting the community to provide comments / feedback for possible integration within 10 calendar days after the last document is posted (which is presently looking like it will be the Trust Agreement). I will provide plenty of guidance as that time approaches. Once draft documents are posted, I will be scheduling conference calls multiple times per week to give the community multiple opportunities to ask questions to both become familiar with the structure and ask related questions. While I will do my best to recommend that all applicable feedback be integrated, I cannot guarantee it. All feedback must be within the framework of still being able to be blessed by legal counsel for the Trust and Trustee, as the legal opinion is essential for both the Trustee and the community in general (so the only assurance will be a commitment to try). After the community has provided its comments, we will integrate comments where possible and then go into closing mode. At that stage, all operative documents will be executed (less the downstream documents as those are reserved for each closing). Final versions of all applicable documents and form of legal opinion will be uploaded and referenced below with conformed signatures (e.g. /s/name). The final executed version with signatures will be shown to the mandated actors only. In parallel, we will be working with WSFS to get the custody account for the CayCo setup and then integrated with the Broker/Dealer. We will work with the Mandated Actors and the community as a whole to setup \u201ctest transactions\u201d to demonstrate the flow of funds. Thereafter, we will follow the process established to raise the associated debt ceiling from the current 1000 DAI to the initial debt ceiling of 15MM DAI and get rolling! We have plenty of deals waiting to be financed.

The short-answer is yes\u2026 BUT it would then be an investment company which pulls in a bunch of well intended securities laws (e.g. the 1940 act) that would then govern the structure. However, putting \u201cloans\u201d (as a defined term) in the structure would not be a \u201cbond\u201d and possibly / probably not be governed by the same laws. That said, securities attorneys are worth every dollar to ensure compliance with applicable laws. ",

As a part of the overall upcoming closing, we are locking down change requests to the underlying transactional documents from the community. As such, all subsequent community change requests will need to get deferred until we have the first amendment of the transactional documents (which for certain will happen, my guess is within six months). This will then follow a similar process of being posted in the forums and getting consensus and then demonstrating to all relevant parties that the \u201caffirmative vote of MakerDAO\u201d approves those amendments before anything can change. The above being said, just like smart contracts, this is an iterative process to improve over time. Let\u2019s roll forward to closing !! ",
