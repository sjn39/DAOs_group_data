                    "content": "Today, we are proud to announce the Dai Foundation, an independent legal entity for safeguarding the Maker community\u2019s intellectual property (IP). This marks another milestone in the gradual decentralization of the Protocol.  Intellectual Property Rights One of the key challenges on the roadmap for further decentralization of the Maker Protocol, is the management and protection of its associated trademarks and other intellectual property, such as open-source copyrights. Since these cannot be decentralized through technology, they need to be held by an independent legal entity that has the best interest of the community in mind. IP management and protection was originally the responsibility of the Maker Foundation, but now the Dai Foundation has been created for this specific purpose. Earlier today, the Maker Foundation has transferred the ownership of Maker and Dai trademarks to the Dai Foundation. Assignment of the open-source copyrights for the Maker Protocol software components will follow in the next weeks and months. Read the message from the Maker Foundation about the IP transfer here.  The Dai Foundation The Dai Foundation cannot seek profits and is only mandated to serve its specific purpose. It was created in Denmark, which has a very strong legal framework for independent foundations and where they have been legally accepted for centuries. The foundation operates solely on the basis of objective and rigid statutes that define its mandate. Its purpose is to safeguard what cannot be technologically decentralized in the Maker Protocol, i.e. certain intangible assets that underlie the protocol. The Dai Foundation helps to ensure that these intangible assets are used for sustainable growth of the Maker Protocol, and for maximizing the public good thereof in line with a set of fundamental principles. As such, it is important for the Maker community that these assets can never be transferred to any single for-profit entity. IP Protection There could be situations that result in a misuse of the intellectual property, brand assets and goodwill that the community has accrued over the years. In such case, the Dai Foundation will use appropriate tools to ensure that the Maker Protocol remains aligned with its core principles. These principles include:  The protocol must be available free of charge, as open source and without restrictions, on equal terms and for anyone. There must be a high degree of access and distribution to the unbanked and financially underserved. The governance of the protocol must take a sustainable approach, and no harmful centralization of the protocol must happen. Development of the protocol must be in compliance with the legislation in force at any time. The protocol must be operated using scientific governance that optimizes long term stability, assures diversification of the collateral portfolio, and benefit of Dai users.  In practice the intent is that the community can freely use Dai trademarks, but abuse by scammers is prohibited, and that malicious attackers of the Protocol are not allowed to mislead users of the Protocol. Restrictions Last but not least, it is important to note a few elements that do not fall within the mandate of the Dai Foundation:   It does not influence or press any personal agendas. The Foundation\u2019s statutes define board of trustees\u2019 responsibilities, and determine strict procedures for appointing new board members.   It is not involved in emergency shutdown procedures. However, the board of trustees aims to be prepared and plan for edge-cases where the Dai Foundation may need to offer support with answering related IP questions.    The Initial Board of Trustees Initially, half of the Dai Foundation\u2019s board comprises external and independent board members, whilst the other half of the board is made up of private individuals related to the Maker Foundation.  S\u00f8ren Peter Nielsen, Chairman, Head of Product at Maker Foundation Jacek Czarnecki, Deputy Chairman, Global Legal Counsel at Maker Foundation Hans Henrik Hoffmeyer, Co-founder of Coinify Michael Dunworth, Co-founder of Wyre Payam Samarghandi, Attorney at Law at Horten Law Firm Wouter Kampmann, Head of Engineering at Maker Foundation  As such, the Dai Foundation is initially set up to ensure that the independent board members have the necessary understanding of the Dai system and its mechanisms. Over time, the board members affiliated with the Maker Foundation will be replaced by independent board members.  What\u2019s Next What\u2019s been the most urgent agenda item? Quite literally, getting this announcement out to the community so that we can make sure that we\u2019re actively discussing what we\u2019re not taking into account. To be upfront, we don\u2019t even know what we don\u2019t know yet. The more eyes, thoughts, and contributions are brought to this conversation moving forward, the more aligned our preparation becomes. This community is aligned exceptionally well, and that is because it has grown organically over time with like-minded people. This fact is proven by its mode of governance. Moving forward We\u2019re guessing that there are a million and one questions to be answered, and we want to find those answers together as fast as possible. Having an active discussion surrounding edge-cases, considerations, and all things in-between is going to ensure things are following what is important to MakerDAO, which is all of us in the community. We would like to start the discussion by being actively present in this forum and going rapid-fire on everything or proposing updates/community feedbacks weekly or monthly as part of the governance process through the transition period until the necessary information and understanding are well documented and readily available to new community members. Kind regards, The Dai Foundation board ",

The vision of the MakerDAO system is to create a decentralized, autonomous, open, accessible and price stable payment system and a financial infrastructure based on blockchain technology. The Foundation must safeguard certain intangible assets that underlie the MakerDAO system, which should not be taken over by or transferred to a single for-profit entity, but rather be used for sustainable growth of the MakerDAO system and for maximizing the public good thereof in line with the fundamental principles that are expressed below. The core MakerDAO system shall be made available free of charge as an open source and without restrictions, on equal terms and for anyone who wants to use the MakerDAO system, both citizens as well as companies and other organizations. The MakerDAO system shall ensure a high degree of access and distribution to the unbanked and financially underserved, and the system shall consider negative externalities and ensure the sustainability of the activities and a positive environmental impact. The MakerDAO system must be managed in such a way that the appropriate checks and balances are considered to ensure no harmful centralization of the protocol. The development of the MakerDAO system must be in accordance with the legislation in force at any time. The MakerDAO system should use scientific governance that optimizes long-term stability and protects Dai users. The MakerDAO system must further diversify the portfolio of assets used as collateral in the MakerDAO system\u2019s CDP. The MakerDAO system should be sustainable and ensure that the existence of the MKR token is for the benefit of Dai users. The Foundation is set up as an independent and non-profit-oriented entity to assume ownership of certain intangible assets in the MakerDAO system, to ensure that these assets are used solely in line with the principles laid down herein, and to maintain, develop and communicate the MakerDAO system and its capabilities as well as virtual currencies and blockchain technology more generally.

One of the practical goals on the road to gradual decentralization is that the Maker Protocol can continue to thrive after the Maker Foundation is dissolved. While there still is a lot for the community to discuss and decide around collateral onboarding, DAO teams, monetary policy, etc., the decision to create a safe place for the Maker trademarks hopefully is non-controversial. We will now engage with the community on how to handle controversial decisions around rights to use the trademarks, and we are certainly ready to put the resulting rules or guidelines up for a vote. What is the responsibility of this Foundation to the Maker community? The Dai Foundation engages with and takes advice from the Maker community. It must always act according to the principles in the Trust Deed. Does the incorporation paperwork include the objective and rigid statutes? Yes, please see the preamble in my other answer. ",

I would also be interested to get any answer to this. As the Dai Foundation gets set up with its own web site a list of the IPs that are in the possession of the Dai Foundation will be published. On a high level the IP consists of primarily trademarks for Maker and Dai, Open Source Software for the Maker Protocol and a bit further down the road the makerdao.com website and social media handles for MakerDAO. @sorenpeter A few questions from me: The Dai Foundation is a very generic name for something with a specific purpose (holding Maker and Dai IP.) Are there plans for this purpose to evolve in the future? The Dai Foundation activities can in theory evolve in the future as long as it is aligned with the purpose to protect the MakerDAO intangible assets, and therefore not engaging in activities that might raise questions about the objectivity of the board in pursuing this primary purpose. Regarding the general name: remember that the Dai Foundation will be the only \u201cofficial\u201d entity that won\u2019t be decentralized in the future (because by definition it can\u2019t be decentralized.) So yes, on the one hand we want the purpose to be as limited and specific as possible, because what can be decentralized should be decentralized. But on the other hand, this will be the only official MakerDAO / Dai entity in the space and its name seems therefore fitting. One issue I\u2019ve noticed is that there is no good \u2018owner\u2019 for certain domain registrations. Open source tools created by the community are available in multiple places on the internet, but the domains tend to be owned by specific community members or the Maker Foundation. Could the Dai Foundation also take ownership and responsibility of domains of this nature (with the owners permission?) This has not been discussed by the board yet. I think the Board is positive towards this if we can find a way to scope what falls within the DeFi and Maker Protocol ecosystem and what does not. Moving forward I think this is an area where we shall solicit input from the community. That said, the Dai Foundation will likely acquire those domains which basically represent the trademarks safeguarded by this entity. Will the financials of the Dai Foundation be open to the MKR community as a whole? Yes, the financial statements for the foundation will be made public. What is the long-term plan for funding the Dai Foundation? The foundation will seek donations from donors that want to support open financial systems. How will new board members be appointed to the Dai Foundation? Will this require a MKR Token Vote (should it?) The board of trustees will elect its own members for a three-year period. Re-election may take place. ",

People here are over-qualified for this so it would not be a problem i think to get a hand on domain-name and such. There is great people on here, just a small ( ).  ",

Also let\u2019s say that through the ownership of this IP said company would have control and power over the DAI credit system. In order to avoid centralization around this community members legal monopoly would the DAI Foundation enter discussions with this company on taking control of its IP so as to avoid centralization?
