The risk team determines the maximum amount we can raise the DC for that particular token and we offer to create that space for them and assist them in creating a strategy to earn yield based on their risk tolerance. Can present multiple options like, direct DAI yield on Compound, Curve deposit, TOKEN/DAI pair on Uniswap, using some portion to buy more TOKEN or ETH, etc. Coming to these projects and showing them they\u2019re leaving money on the table can be a good way to generate more DAI. It could even be a community initiative to reach out to various governance channels/forums. ",
