                    "content": "There hasn\u2019t been a huge push for the introduction of negative rates, instead people seem comfortable having MKR holders continue to subsidize an ever increasing amount of risk in the protocol. We have also seen USDC and WBTC back a significant portion of the outstanding DAI. While I personally have no issue with assets that carry counterparty risk being included in the protocol, I do believe diversification to reduce blow-up risk is needed. So my question to the people still not on board with the introduction of negative rates is two-fold:  How much demand do they see realistically? Do they envision a scenario where supply manages to outpace this demand (only using 0% SF and not introducing negative rates?)  Here are my proposed answers to those questions:  I think that DAI is targetting the entire addressable stablecoin market (13B USD) and beyond. That said, because of DAI\u2019s inability to hold the peg it is unsuitable for uses as a Quote currency in trading, so we might not need to scale to compete with Tether just yet (but we should definitely aspire to). We\u2019ve had zero interest rates for a while now and while it has increased the supply of DAI, it has done little to truly fix the peg. I would also be very concerned to see billions of DAI issued and Maker holders still not being able to extract any stability fees. I also see the demand for stablecoin continuing to grow into the coming months and years.  DAI is one of the most attractive stablecoins on the market today, so it seems only natural that users will be willing to purchase at some premium in perpetuity. I would argue that subsidizing DAI holders is the riskier path when compared to introducing negative rates on DAI holders (via target rate adjustment). As a piece of anecdotal evidence, I plan to purchase DAI at $1.01 or lower due to its utility in the current yield farming craze. If we don\u2019t introduce negative rates, a lot of confidence in DAI\u2019s ability to return to its peg will be lost. This will cause a reduced number of people to be willing to arbitrage DAI when it leaves its peg range, further hurting the system. ",

This is similar to how government treasury bonds may be available at higher-yields during times when the government has urgent need to raise capital. Can you say more about how you arrived at the figure 13B for the entire addressable stablecoin market? If this is the total market cap of all available stablecoins, including DAI, then you appear to be assuming that DAI could conceivably obtain a monopoly of the stablecoin market if it achieved certain properties. However, the desirability to reduce risk of, e.g. losing a peg, or a 51% attack of governance tokens, seems to guarantee that DAI will never have a monopoly. However, DAI is much more in demand in the various pools on Curve (cCRV, yCRV, etc.) and is frequently at 3% compared to 20%-30% of USDT, USDC, and TUSD. Those seem to indicate that using Curve\u2019s low-slippage stablecoin exchange, many people prefer to exchange into DAI rather than out of it. ",

While the issue is DAI liquidity seeking this return with respect to DAI PEG price strictly determined by the $$ value of rewards we know that if more DAI liquidity is out there eventually the returns will drop to the point that it will no longer be attractive to use DAI for this purpose. to the OP     OliverNChalk:   How much demand do they see realistically? Do they envision a scenario where supply manages to outpace this demand (only using 0% SF and not introducing negative rates?    Reverse the first question.  How much DAI to drop the PEG?    My calculations show this number to be north of 1B DAI at this point and my current estimates based on the $$ comp distributions are around 2-3B.   Even then I am not sure how much of this will hit the markets.  My expectation is that the real liquidity markets need is more like 50-100M but given that this liquidity is sopped up based on the return rate for each 50-100M extra DAI that is out there I see the PEG dropping at most on average something .001 for each 50-100M (meaning out of that 50-100M perhaps 2-5% ends up as liqudity in the markets depending on DAI PEG price). I also think we are slowly running out of capital that will deposit to mint DAI here since we have upped the DCs and lowered the SFs and growth of DAI outstanding seems to have slowed. Answer to question (2) above is a NO.   I simply don\u2019t see 2-4B coming into the system to support 1-2B DAI expansion happening in the next 6 months.  It is a higher probability as more COMP comes on the market that the price drops but we need the $$ reward to drop significantly more (factor of 4 at least) and this is going to take a few months at least. Should compound governance change anything that affects this negatively we could see the liquidity here free up and the PEG sweep under 1 quite quickly.   Fortunately we have a lot of DAI price shorters that will pick up a lot of this supply if the PEG drops below 1 which is why it is not going much below 1.01 at this point. I disagree with your proposed answer  DAI is not targetting the entire stablecoin market.   It simply can\u2019t get all of that but will and can capture a significant part of it (1B is a pretty easy mark 5B a little harder at this time).  I agree with your answer (2). I also am coming to believe that whatever form negative rates come in - it will not have enough teeth to fight the farming driver.   Literally 20-50% yrly return on something like 150M DAI is just too powerful to overcome with normal monetary policies like negative interest rates, and assuming a fully decentralized model growth of outstanding DAI could fend this off but currently is too small at 300-400M. Put simply the nature of Maker governance is such that the strong constraints of 1:1 DAI to USD collateral value gives in against another strong constraint of the 1:1 DAI price peg in the face of limited collateral growth and small amount of DAI outstanding.   imo even if there was 1B DAI out there we would have seen a singificant rise in the PEG due to this farming driver. Negative rates are not going to create this 1B DAI given the backing constraints on vault owners.   What conditions will this system need to find 2-5B of collateral to take on the contract/liquidation risks here to mint this 1-2B DAI?    I honestly think this becomes a time/trust/risk issue against a diminishing farming driver issue.    Without the system and governance being creative on how to profit from this situation directly vs. trying to grow markets organically it is my personal opinion that the PEG will likely stay broken to the high side for the forseeable future and will be solely dependent on actions of other players in the space. Governance has pretty much run out of tools here and everyone knows it. Notice how even the talk of the PSM pretty much caused some market reactions both positive on the PEG when initially proposed, then negative when it was shelved. ",

There is only one way for this to happen in this time frame, and obviously that is from ETH deposits and price appreciation. Which seems like a crazy impossibility, but if there is really market demand for that much DAI, it is not that far fetched. Compound and other DeFi services are incentivizing the creation of DAI because they need it for collateral. It is annoying that the DAI is not hitting the market and helping stabilize the peg, but it also doesn\u2019t mean that it is not real demand. These systems need stable collateral and are willing to pay a premium for it. The other side of this is that if this demand unwinds for whatever reason, it can go straight back into Maker to close CDPs without hitting the market and wrecking the peg to the downside. In July 2020 Ethereum issued around 385,000 new ETH. In July 2020, over 800,000 ETH was deposited into Maker CDPs. The price went from $225 -> $335. I know this is pretty obvious to everyone here, but there is a real feedback loop here and the market will solve the collateral problem. What we need to do is make sure we are solving the risk problem. There is a reason why Compound prefers to collateralize their loans with DAI and not ETH. They are outsourcing the volatility risks to Maker, and we need to make sure we are not ignoring those risks. I know this is not a very popular sentiment, but ignoring volatility risk to stabilize the peg isn\u2019t going to mean much if it means the system blows up. ",

There is at maximum 108M DAI not being put as liquidity of something and used as store of value with instant liquidity. Compound doesn\u2019t increase the amount of farming on DAI. Supply only increased 20% since July 17th (ETH price did +68% so ETH vault could expand by +68%). The more crowed the trade is, the less interesting it is. There is 20M$ in YFI farming. Again that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal when supply is at 383M$ (with +100M$ or close in a week). My point is that ETH increase should have enabled vault owner to produce enough DAI to mitigate the farming. What I see is a increasing number of account holding DAI (just at looking at the biggest). Ecosystem building take more and more DAI (Aave, Uniswap, useful pool on Balancer) and they will need a lot more. Finance need a lot of capital in DeFi as there is over collateralization. Policy tools are at their best (or close), they bring us to 1.015 which is halfway. Maybe what is needed now is marketing. Sending someone to Bankless to explain to those farmers that they can borrow for FREE, farm and win an extra 1% while shorting DAI. But again, the big question is who is the marginal buyer of DAI at 1.015. I\u2019m no longer sure it\u2019s the farmers. ",

We just need more DAI minting from other sources to keep pushing the peg down. And if we do have spikes in demand, I think arbers will be more comfortable shorting DAI now. ",

And it was directly due to the fact that we couldn\u2019t/can\u2019t provide enough dai for the demand. I believe, we probably had the opportunity to have a dai as the second stable coin around 2b. This type of opportunity doesn\u2019t happen often. Now compound and other started to think about diversifying with more stablecoin - I saw it on another thread -, we are losing the momentum. ",
