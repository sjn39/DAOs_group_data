If it\u2019s not appropriate please remove it. Since few days/weeks there is a lot of topics regarding compensation or group organization . See 2 examples.   [Discussion] MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm   [Signal Request] Vault Compensation Working Group Payment   \u2026   Those questions are essential in a DAO, if you want people to be involved, and things to be smoothed and organized. I\u2019m active is several other DAO where things are simple. You have a multi-sig,  a treasury, the protocol generates fees which goes in the treasury and then the multi-sig decides (with or without the approbation of the DAO) how to compensate active members. Maker DAO is an incredible \u201cstructure\u201d but it\u2019s very complicated to follow and to understand who is doing what. There is also a foundation. What is the foundation exactly ? How is linked to the DAO. There are pieces of answer everywhere on this forum. But I didn\u2019t find a very clear answer. If I didn\u2019t search properly please let me know. So my question is: Do we have an organigram explaining how it works and how different \u201centities\u201d are linked. And if not, do you think it\u2019s a good idea to make one. It will help a lot to understand, and then be able to answer questions about organization/compensation. Always better to give feedbacks when you really know how it works. And I think it can also be useful for topics like this one (see above). As it can be use in articles presenting Maker to new users. [Informal Poll] Media production for MakerDAO ",

But I also saw that MakerDAO also post some job offers (https://makerdao.com/en/careers/listing?gh_jid=4947213002). So it\u2019s the DAO ? not the fondation ? So who decide to hire someone ? (ps: i applied by curiosity) To come back to my initial question and based on your answers. Do we have a topic or an article, where we can find all people involved in the DAO ( name + role + salary) . Involver = all members, but lets say with an ottficial role. Like faciliators \u2026 Or a table with names and what people receive as a salary ? As Yearn does for exemple: https://gov.yearn.finance/t/recurring-grants-via-ygift/8455 Because I\u2019m personnaly still very confused to have a clear idea of who receive fix salary, who receive grants, who is not able to receive Source cred rewards\u2026  So I personally found it very hard to give feedback on things concerning remuneration/grant if everything is not completely clear . Thanks again for you answer, i have few more topics to read. !  ",

Not that it is a priority currently on our side to have a website to manage. There is no CommDev team at the DAO but there is one at the Foundation. They do CommDev work for the DAO.

                    "content": "@prose11 @SebVentures I have an excel sheet for a contributor directory. It contains contact info so I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing it in public. It has been a side-project of mine for a few months with the intention of releasing it as a tool for contributor relations and to try to map MakerDAO as an org of contributors. The Sheet attempts to map people to their participation in various projects and working groups. This makes it comfortable to have a list of all the different official and unofficial teams that have been forming at MakerDAO. Here is a snapshot of what that list looks like today: image626\u00d7598 35.2 KB The numbers in the active/inactive/unsure columns are inaccurate as they may still be missing people. Currently, I have 65 individual contributors on this sheet with many still missing. The two paths available are:  It remains under private permissions and is used as a tool by the Operational Support Domain Team, or whatever team eventually becomes the equivalent of HR/Contributor Relations. It is converted into a publicly-viewable directory with RC/Forum handles only.  Likely, both paths will be followed eventually but it depends on discussions with the teams and contributors. I would love for a public version of this sheet to exist and be used to generate a potential org chart. For now, this is being worked on rather slowly and is changing often. I am still experimenting with the best way to organize and format this thing. Edit: And to answer @Cryptouf\u2019s original question, yes, I think an Organigram of MakerDAO would be super useful.
