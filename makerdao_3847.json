Although I support the principal of Maker vesting it\u2019s extremely eye opening to see the cost dwarfs all other expenses combined. As a result this situation really does merit the most scrutiny. This whole situation reeks of a huge conflict of interest. I understand we have a need to attract top tier talent and pay accordingly however it seems strange to me that to protect existing maker holders we have not sought independent third parties to review, substantiate and justify these models against crypto industry standards ",

Part of that is due to the bull market we\u2019ve been in but traditionally companies are dilutive for a very long time. Look no further than Amazon for example. There are even public companies which have higher dilution due to share-based compensation. I posted about engaging an independent third party in the PE budget proposal and lobbied for doing so inside and outside of the MKR compensation working group but that direction was not supported.

As far as other protocols though, just anecdotally I would say we are far and away the most conservative with our governance tokens. That\u2019s good! Note that we\u2019re also far more profitable than other protocols and so don\u2019t need to pay as much with equity. Many protocols even pay their customers with their governance tokens. Talk about a bad capital structure. While I\u2019m not fully on board with all of the MKR compensation proposal being made, I will say that I cannot think of another person in the DAO I\u2019d rather have than @Aes seeking out an appropriate balance.
