The intent is to grow token value by reducing its supply as income grows. Buybacks tend to...      Summing up the article: using the earnings of the protocol to buyback $MKR and burn it is not efficient. The idea I propose is to accumulate the stability fee in the treasury and then dispose of it through voting. Governance will find the best way to use these funds. Some examples:  Buyback of $MKR during pullbacks is simple better than buyback at market buy Buy governance tokens of other protocols with the aim of increasing the power of our governance  and IMO most important,  Accumulate $ETH. Reasons: in Ethereum 2.0 purchasing $ETH or staked $ETH will be the same as purchasing hash power. I imagine that before long every protocol will start doing this to protect the network from possible attacks. The better $ETH will be divided between protocols, the more secure the network will be. Also, holding a certain amount of $ETH in the treasury will make the price of $MKR less susceptible to the $MKR/$ETH exchange rate.  ",

IMO is fine to use $USD as unit of account for themselves, but from a protocol point of view using $USD instead of $ETH as unit of account is a big mistake. We should aim to account for our profit in $ETH rather than $USD. Doing so we will ensure the network and Makerdao. IMO it makes no sense to hold MKR and have a downward vision of $ETH in the long term. As written in the article, there are also other ways of managing the treasury in addition to governance, such as making use of a Balancer-type pool. ",

At the same time, I think there are improvements that can be made on the current setup that do not try to \u2018time the market\u2019. Perhaps we can have a productive discussion about those (see my example below). For example: I think buy/burning the MKR as soon as the surplus buffer is full, is not necessarily the best strategy. We had a peak of burning in february (before Black Thursday) and then 0 burning for many months (up to now, November), when the price of MKR was very low. Simple Proposal: I suggest we could buy/burn MKR not as soon as the surplus is full, but following some kind of \u201cmoving average\u201d of sorts, so to smoothen peaks and dips. ",

                    "content": "I think we need to sort terms. Company treasuries usually have - cash - or cash like assets (say bonds that retain value but also earn return) they can have volatile components (often anticorrelated assets that grow when their business sinks or related to supply needs - oil futures for airlines, etc.).    When I first brought this idea of a Treasury or a secondary surplus to Maker I wanted to use it as a direct DAI liquidity control (inject by buying assets, withdrawal by selling them).  Which meant one had to buy other assets to let the DAI in the surplus go out into the markets rather than draining DAI liquidity and having surplus DAI just sitting around doing nothing. We have MANY more choices today with what we can do with DAI to both retain it, generate return, while still allowing it to be out in markets (balancer pools, various liquidity stakes) that we can even use with MKR to boot to earn farming returns.   Literally there are vastly more ways to manage a treasury now than even 6 months ago.   Since one key function of a Treasury is to retain value particularly in bad market situations I urded we should add stablecoins and we can also use those as liquidity pairs to earn extra return for the Treasury via farming. We don\u2019t have to completely STOP the MKR burn as this is something clearly important to MKR holders.   BUT I have urged and will continue to urge governance to stop buying the MKR price up using this burn model and simply set a price floor with some liquidity via limit MKR/DAI or MKR/USDC orders or even using liquidity pairs that are automatically going to buy MKR when price drops and sell it when price rises. As @befitsandpiper suggests:     befitsandpiper:  I like this idea of \u201csmoothing out\u201d the Maker burn. Maybe accumulating funds and burning x% of the total funds each y length time period. This essentially would mimic the investing strategy of Dollar Cost Averaging, which I believe outperforms lump sum investing (or at least is lower risk), especially with highly volatile assets.   we can simply buy market periodically with some randomness and simply dollar cost average the MKR purchase price.  Frankly I think we get a bigger bang for our DAI by putting our surplus into farming returns.  We achieve multiple goals,  a growing return from surplus, diluting farming returns into our own treasury, and still releasing DAI into markets to provide liquidity.   If we do this against MKR itself we also indirectly support price via pair liquidity (I don\u2019t think people really appreciate how price support can work in these liquidity pairs btw) Lets try to separate the concept of a Maker working Treasury which would be used for:     iammeeoh:  1: buy&burn MKR, but only at convenient moments (e.g., when Governance feels that the price is low). 2: fund development (e.g., domain teams) and other governance expenses (e.g., SourceCred, etc).    Operational expenses, ETH for smart contract deployment, oracles, insurance, legal costs, licensing fees, etc.  from a Secondary surplus that could be used to add or remove DAI liquidity by buying/selling assets and growing return component from these to the value of Maker. I think it is a secondary surplus that should have the farming assets as well as MKR purchased to match against DAI to provide liquidity.   I can\u2019t stress the following enough.   Maker really needs to get past this idea of always burning MKR vs. using MKR that could have been burned against DAI in hand to provide farming MKR liquidity in many pairs (DAI, USDC, TUSD, maybe even ETH) in a secondary surplus fund from a treasury that for the most part only contains DAI, and stablecoins to fund operational expenses (that are in ETH, DAI, USDC and possibly MKR via sourceCRED). Last thing I want to point out.   Company value is not just the following:  Market value of the outstanding stock.  It is the other following values.  Cash flows Net profit from cash flows to company bottom line (and hence to shareholders) Total disposable (non-encumbered as well as encumbered) assets. Future contracts to cash flows and hence profit. Growth rate (or contraction) of the above. Speculative value based on the growth in the entire space the company is a part of. (size of markets and growth of them). Dividend return. (i.e. payout to stockholders either by buyback or by direct dividend as a rate of return) Intellectual Property (i.e. enforcable patents) Expense rate vs. cash on hand.  We seem to focus exclusively on (1) and peripherally on (2), (3) and (8) and ignore (4), (5), (6) and (10).  We ignore  (7) we don\u2019t have much control over it, and (9) because Maker is opensource and forkable. ",

This might be a good investment strategy, but I disagree on a fundamental level. In an ideal world, MakerDAO would earn some money (DAI, from SF) and distribute them (proportionally) to MKR holders. This is not practically doable, because thousands of transactions would waste money in fees. This is one of the many reasons behind the MKR-burning system. It is efficient. This said, I think we should not impose any investment strategy on any MKR holder (even little holders). Even if this imposition was democratic (i.e., voted) I would probably consider it an abuse. We should just distribute the revenues (after having subtracted the amount needed to run operations and expand) and then simply distribute (which, as it is implemented now, means burning MKR) the revenues.

The MIP should be limited to this. There should be no other changes to the protocol, for which separate MIPs should be made. For example, there should be no terms specifying how the funds are to be spent. Again, how the funds are administered should be a decision taken after the treasury is established.
