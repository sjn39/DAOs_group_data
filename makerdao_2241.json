Throughout this proposal, the term \u201csecurities\u201d has an equivalent meaning to a \u201cbond\u201d or \u201cbonds\u201d.  Paragraph Summary Under MIP120, up to 500MM of the PSM\u2019s USDC will be managed by one of the entities wholly owned by XBTO Global (\u201cXBTO\u201d), which will invest, on behalf of MakerDAO, the funds in various traditional fixed-income assets according to the ratified Declaration of Intent MIP13c3-SP12: Invest in Short-Term Bonds. All investments will be obtained on the open market through impartial, competitive processes conducted by investment banks and/or broker-dealers. At the end of every quarter, the DAI 500MM RWA vault will remit collected interest coupon proceeds to MakerDAO to provide current cash flow to bolster the Surplus Buffer. Principal proceeds generated from the portfolio\u2019s positions will be reinvested until Maker governance has passed an executive vote to trigger a liquidation of the portfolio. The portfolio will have an average duration of 1.5 years with a max maturity or WAL (weighted average life) of 3.5 years, managed in a laddered approach allowing for active rebalancing and duration management. The portfolio will also be relative value focused across US Treasuries, Corporate and Structured Credit securities, and ESG/Green Bonds seeking to maximize risk-adjusted total returns while remaining confined to prudent risk of issuer and sector constraints.  Motivation Following the ratification of MIP13c3-SP12, MakerDAO identifies a framework to allow a portion of its balance sheet held in idle stablecoins to provide yield while maintaining counterparty risk to stablecoin issuers (e.g., Circle). MIP13c3-SP12 details standards that align with XBTO\u2019s well-established position in the institutional space and an investment framework consistent with the firm\u2019s credit experience. XBTO\u2019s position and motivation are strengthened by the fact that since early 2022, traditional finance assets have offered a more significant risk/reward than current CeFi and DeFi solutions. Investing in CeFi and DeFi Stablecoin Markets has not been easy to scale in the last few years due to the nascency of the space. Furthermore, the collapse of CeFi entities (e.g., Genesis, BlockFi, FTX, and Celsius) has made risk in the ecosystem intolerable. MIP120 achieves the following goals for Maker:  Generate meaningful yield for the Surplus Buffer through Maker\u2019s USDC holdings. Provide a liquid, diversified investment profile well aligned with Maker\u2019s liquidity and risk management needs. Diversify Maker\u2019s existing base of fixed-income holdings with floating and fixed-rate structured credit securities. Diversify the counterparty risk MakerDAO takes when engaging with off-chain real-world asset managers. Establish MakerDAO as a significant player in the traditional fixed income markets, potentially leading to more opportunities for institutional-level acceptance and widespread use of DAI in the traditional finance world.

Specification / Proposal Details  MIP120c1: Presentation of XBTO Credit and Fixed Income XBTO was established in 2015 as one of the first digital asset market makers and liquidity providers. Originally named \u201cXBT Opps,\u201d which stood for Bitcoin\u2019s original ticker, XBT, and \u201cOpportunities,\u201d it was later shortened to simply \u201cXBTO.\u201d As the digital asset market grew, so did XBTO\u2019s market offerings. By February 2017, XBTO was executing millions of weekly trades across dozens of exchanges. By November 2017, XBTO expanded its market offerings to include OTC trading, crypto-mining, and VC investing. Today, XBTO has expanded its services to Market Making, Asset Management, Institutional Trading, Credit and Fixed Income, Mining Solutions, and Venture Capital. The company has transacted over $100Bn USD worth of digital assets since inception and is currently one of the top five largest crypto-options market makers. XBTO provides exceptional technology infrastructure and financial services to traditional and blockchain-enabled financial companies, ensuring their partners and clients can make the most of investment opportunities in the digital assets class. Partners and clients include exchanges, hedge funds, family offices, UHNW individuals, and DeFi protocols. XBTO\u2019s Credit and Fixed Income group combines traditional financial instruments with digital assets and technology to offer innovative products and services to consumers and financial institutions. The XBTO Credit and Fixed Income team have the experience and dedication to bringing traditional credit and fixed income yields to the digital asset ecosystem, specifically for those entities managing extensive stablecoin holdings, such as DAOs and crypto exchanges. The team is led by Behzad Taufiq, the firm\u2019s Global Head of Credit and Fixed Income. Before joining XBTO, Mr. Taufiq held positions at prominent private equity and asset management firms, dating back to 2005. Most recently, he was Head of Credit Trading and a Managing Director at Hudson Advisors (\u201dHudson\u201d), the in-house asset manager of the global private equity firm Lone Star Funds. At Hudson, Mr. Taufiq oversaw the credit trading, analytics, and underwriting teams responsible for one of the more extensive holdings of fixed-income securities and loans within the private equity industry ranks. Through MIP120, XBTO Credit and Fixed Income team can help MakerDAO realize these yields efficiently and safely.  MIP120c2: The Opportunity In a high-interest-rate environment, treasury bills, bonds, and other fixed-income debt investments can offer many advantages as an investment option. One advantage of these instruments is that they provide a predictable and stable source of income since they pay a fixed rate of return periodically. This appeals to investors looking for consistent yield who are less comfortable with stock and crypto market volatility. Compared to investments in the stock and/or crypto market, which can experience significant fluctuations in market value, fixed-income investments generally have lower volatility and are considered less risky, especially shorter-duration fixed-income securities. However, it\u2019s important to note that bonds\u2019 prices and interest rates are inversely correlated: as interest rates rise, bond prices will fall. This price decrease is driven by an increase in competition from newly issued bonds with higher yields, which makes the older bonds less attractive to investors with their lower fixed interest rates. On the other hand, equities and crypto have the potential for higher returns in the long run compared to traditional debt investments, but they also come with higher risk and price volatility. The stock and crypto markets can provide growth opportunities over time, but they also can be subject to market fluctuations and systematic risk. Additionally, stocks and cryptos are not immune from the negative price pressure of an increasing interest rate environment. Following a turbulent year in 2022, the crypto world needs the stability and predictability of TradFi fixed-income debt instruments. The current overall market conditions make these investment opportunities more popular and attractive than we\u2019ve seen in decades. In light of the possible emergence of economic weakness, including a potential recession, it is crucial to exercise careful credit selection and management. The XBTO team\u2019s pertinent expertise can effectively deliver on this front, all the while upholding exceptional standards of transparency and reporting for the off-chain credit asset portfolio being managed.  MIP120c3: Investment Program Objective This proposal aims to generate attractive risk-adjusted income across a variety of short-duration, high-quality (Investment Grade) traditional and Structured Fixed Income products. The key benchmark/comparable return and yield would be the 1-3yr Bloomberg Credit Index. Solution The portfolio will seek to take advantage of the current rate regime where the interest rate curve is inverted (2s/10s -90bps), and many seasoned bonds trade at a substantial discount to par given the current higher yield environment, and newly-issued bonds are being offered at attractive risk-adjusted yields not seen in years. The portfolio will benefit from low overall volatility due to the low duration (and thus sensitivity to interest rate moves) of these assets, as well as the \u201cpull to par\u201d effect that bonds encounter as they near maturity, offering upside convexity and capital appreciation to the overall return profile. The overall portfolio stats will look as follows:   Portfolio Average Credit Rating: A flat  Minimum Credit Rating: BBB-  Yield to Maturity: 4.5-7.0% (Gross)  Modified Duration: 1.5-2yrs  Max Maturity/Weighted Average Life: 3.5yrs  Investment Thesis While 2023 has been a challenging macro environment, it has opened the door to attractive risk-adjusted opportunities for experienced buyers of fixed-income securities, especially those with cross-sector underwriting capabilities. With a looming recession, general corporate downsizing, and a slowly but surely weakening labor market, we are likely to have neared the peak of this Fed rate hiking cycle. As such, with limited upside in short-term rates, we believe now is the best time to be entering the front end of the bond market where returns are attractive both from a risk-adjusted perspective but also objectively, as 2yr treasury yields are the highest they\u2019ve been since 2007 before the Fed implement unprecedented QE. We believe this allocation is a sound and sustainable approach to managing treasury assets and will resemble the allocation made by most large corporate treasuries. The portfolio will seek to invest in Investment-Grade Corporate securities, Asset-Backed securities, ESG/Green securities, and Government securities, focusing on the relative value between sectors, issuers, and individual securities. XBTO\u2019s issuer exposures will be reviewed by XBTO\u2019s team of Credit Analysts, who are assigned by sector to assist the Portfolio Management team in selecting the best-in-class issuers and securities. Process Relative Value focused approach in selecting sectors, issuers, and securities to construct an all-weather, high-quality portfolio with low relative overall risk and diversified exposures. The Portfolio Management team will focus on building a laddered maturity portfolio, providing consistent and predictable cash flow, and offering flexibility to reallocate across sectors based on the opportunity set. The team will be Cross-Sector and Investment Grade agnostic, allowing allocation to the most attractive risk-adjusted opportunities while abiding by concentration constraints. Investment policy   High-Quality Credits: 100% Investment Grade (BBB- and above)  Short Duration (low sensitivity to interest rate moves): Combined overall duration target of 1.5-2yrs, with a max maturity or WAL (Weighted Average Life) of 3.5yrs  Highly Liquid: Benchmark ($300mm+) deals that are either On-The-Run or actively traded and quoted.  New Investments and Redemptions: Funds can be invested or redeemed within 3-4 business days (which includes T+2 settlement times that are standard in TradFi Fixed Income).  Constraints The portfolio will adhere to construction constraints expected for an institutional grade portfolio and broadly resemble a breakdown between the 1-3yr Bloomberg Credit/Treasury Index and 1-3yr Bloomberg Corporate Index.  Average Position Size: 2.5% average (Generally 1.5%-4.0% per position) Max Corporate/ABS Issuer Exposure: 5.0% per security Max Sector Exposure: 25.0% (Unless Gov\u2019t bonds) Average Portfolio Rating: A flat Minimum Security Rating: BBB Max BBB Exposure: 20.0%  Portfolio Management Team Profile Behzad Taufiq - Lead Portfolio Manager & XBTO Global Head of Credit and Fixed Income Behzad has extensive experience in the credit and fixed-income markets, dating back to 2005 and having worked through numerous periods of market dislocation or distress - such as the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, the 2013 Taper Tantrum, the 2016 Hedge Fund exodus, and the 2020 COVID-induced sell off - and market strength, such as the longest bull market ending in 2020. Prior to entering the digital assets sector in 2020, Behzad was the Head of Credit Trading and Managing Director at Hudson Advisors (asset manager of Lone Star Funds, a global private equity firm with $86Bn in capital raised since inception). At Hudson Advisors, Behzad was responsible for the Trading, Underwriting, and Analytics teams that managed Lone Star Funds\u2019 fixed-income and loan assets, which had a peak market value of +$50Bn. Before Hudson Advisors, Behzad was on the original fixed income and credit team at Cerberus Capital Management, a global private equity firm with $60Bn of capital raised since inception. Karim Dandashy, CFA - Treasuries & Corporates PM/Trader Karim worked at Goldman Sachs Asset Management as a Portfolio Manager on the Corporate Fixed Income desk, working on a small team of three managing over $20 billion of Separately Managed Accounts (primarily short duration) for Goldman\u2019s Ultra High Net Worth and Quasi-Institutional clientele. Sundeep Gokaraju - Structured Products PM/Trader Sundeep has 16 years of experience in trading and structuring, including overseeing a $30 billion Legacy Non-Agency RMBS portfolio and underwriting sectors such as CLOs, CMBS, Autos ABS, Student Loan ABS, European RMBS, Credit Card ABS, and Aircraft ABS. Sundeep was a Director at Hudson Advisors (asset manager of Lone Star Funds) from 2014-2020. Spencer Forrest & Mohammad Danial - Credit Underwriting & Monitoring Spencer worked at Fortress Investment Group, providing analytical and asset management support on a diverse portfolio of debt investments, including senior and junior commercial mortgages, mezzanine debt, bonds, and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Mohammad worked at Bank OZK - Real Estate Specialties Group originating and underwriting +$1Bn in development and acquisition senior debt annually across various real estate asset classes. Before his origination and credit underwriting experience at Bank OZK, he specialized in acquisitions and asset management for a middle-market hospitality REIT.  MIP120c4: Terms for Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity XBTO proposes implementing a set of smart contracts accessible only by authorized persons at MakerDAO, simplifying the flow-of-funds process and eliminating possible intermediaries and fees between XBTO and MakerDAO. This set of smart contracts will be used to perform fund transfers between MakerDAO and XBTO. The smart contract will be executable by MakerDAO, which will be able to recover the necessary amounts on demand. The technical implementation will follow specifications defined in MIP21. XBTO will work with Collateral Engineering Services (CES-001) and community members to ensure that best practices around wallet security and separation, transparency, and auditability are followed in implementing MIP120. With regard to the transfer of interest income, XBTO will automatically convert the proceeds from its fixed income portfolio into USDC, which will then be deposited in the smart contract.  MIP120c5: Transparency and Monitoring Like what XBTO provides to their current clientele, and like what other institutional TradFi asset managers provide to their clientele, XBTO proposes to give the Maker community a monthly and quarterly remittance report on the status of the volume of assets managed by them. Considering that regular communication is key to such a partnership, XBTO suggests creating a dedicated Discord channel where members of the Maker community can regularly ask questions to XBTO\u2019s Credit and Fixed Income team. The XBTO team pledges to hold a quarterly public AMA session via the Discord channel. During these sessions, the team will discuss the current state of the traditional fixed-income markets, provide valuable perspectives on the positioning of the MakerDAO/XBTO off-chain credit portfolio, and outline XBTO\u2019s upcoming portfolio management plans for subsequent quarters.  MIP120c6: Proposed Legal Structure Dedicated smart contract The desire for disintermediation and a direct relationship between the Maker community and XBTO is reflected in the establishment of a smart contract serving as a receptacle for funds and the ability for MakerDAO to recover its funds on-chain. Bankruptcy remote framework MakerDAO assets will be segregated from XBTO\u2019s current accounts into a newly created special purchase vehicle (SPV) account held at their custodian, Stablehouse, and/or at one of their prime brokers in a way to minimize financial risk. Fiat/Stablecoin conversion Stablehouse will ensure all conversions from USDC to fiat and vice versa.  MIP120c7: Custody Stablehouse, a Bermuda-regulated institution, offers full-service, fully-customizable custody solutions tailored to their client\u2019s specific needs. Stablehouse offers segregated custody solutions to clients, giving them security, transparency, and exclusive access to their crypto.  Furthermore, through their partnership with XBTO, Stablehouse provides trading solutions to clients, allowing them to execute trades competitively across spot and derivative markets and complete large orders rapidly and reliably. Lastly, Stablehouse offers a white label custodian and trading platform, allowing partners to host a full-service, fully-customizable custody, and trading platform tailored to their specific needs. The Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) is Stablehouse\u2019s regulator. Under BMA regulation, Stablehouse provides digital asset opportunities in one of the world\u2019s most secure environments. Bermuda is a global leader in digital-asset law with a robust legal and regulatory framework under the \u201cDABA Act\u201d 2018. Bermuda upholds strict international standards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bermuda Monetary Authority has active oversight and supervision over every product Stablehouse brings to market. With regards to the custody and securities held on behalf of MakerDAO, they will be under the custody of Tier 1 Financial Services Institutions. Stablehouse will work directly with Circle to convert USDC into fiat to invest in traditional fixed-income assets.  MIP120c8: Collateral Onboarding Legal & Governance Verification A community member with legal credentials must publicly affirm, through a forum post confirmed by at least one Facilitator, that the legal and governance structure is suitable for XBTO to hold a large amount of low-risk RWA asset collateral on behalf of MakerDAO. Investment Program Verification A Facilitator or member of the Strategic Finance Core Unit must make a public forum post to confirm, regarding MIP120c3, that the tools implemented by XBTO provide secure guarantees for low-risk RWAs and that XBTO\u2019s management service for MakerDAO is high quality. Technical Verification The technical implementation will follow specifications defined in MIP21. XBTO will work with the Collateral Engineering Service (CES-001) to ensure technical implementation.  MIP120c9: Fee Structure 0.85% of AUM annually, paid quarterly alongside interest distributions.  Closing Remarks Now is the best moment we\u2019ve seen in years to generate premium risk-adjusted yields on short-duration fixed-income credit products in decades. As there may be forthcoming economic upheaval, it is crucial to have a proficient traditional credit team to navigate through these turbulent and rapidly evolving markets. The global head of XBTO\u2019s Fixed Income and Credit division possesses extensive experience in the fixed-income sector, having weathered through all market conditions throughout the past 15+ years, including the depths of the Great Financial Crisis. If ratified, MIP120 will help MakerDAO generate meaningful yield for the Surplus Buffer, provide a liquid and diversified investment profile, diversify Maker\u2019s fixed-income credit holdings, and reduce counterparty risk in off-chain asset managers. This proposal is well-founded with the backing of an established crypto company (XBTO) combined with the traditional finance expertise of the Credit and Fixed Income team. In the wake of the collapse of CeFi yield products in 2022, MIP120 provides a scalable solution to generating attractive risk-adjusted returns on stablecoin holdings through the acquisition and active management of short-duration fixed income, US Treasuries, Investment Grade Corporate and Structured Credit Securities, and ESG/Green Bonds.

Right now as written becoming an arranger means getting a RWA facilitator to propose a vote to onboard you. Additional instructions for what exactly this requires is still missing, but it will most likely be easy to get such a vote triggered if you can demonstrate a good understanding of the role of an arranger under the RWA Scope.   Right now, the RWA Scope only allows money market funds and US treasuries. However, this should soon be increased to also allow higher risk assets once we can get an independent advisory council member to help us set up the rules and guidelines for doing such collateral deployments.   The fees for acting as an arranger is standardized. Currently its 15 basis points, but it may not be enough to attract the competition we would like to see among arrangers. One possible way to make it more attractive is to also provide a 10% carry on all yield above a benchmark.   In general it would also be interesting to get your input and advice on how to improve the language and the rules as they\u2019re currently written in the RWA Scope framework, so that it can protect maker as much as possible, while also supporting the RWA use cases that makes sense for Maker to engage in.

                    "content": "Thank you for your questions, Doo_StableLab. We appreciate your consideration of our proposal; here are our answers: 1.There is no added risk to having Stablehouse Ltd (\u201cStablehouse\u201d) be a subsidiary of XBTO. Stablehouse is separately regulated, abides by its own independent governance, has separate operations, and has a separate license under the Bermuda Monetary Authority. While there is and may be overlapping management and ownership in the future between the two firms, both are built to have a dedicated and unconflicted risk committee and corporate governance structure, respectively, to deal with any potential issues that may arise from having common ownership and management. Any assets that are in custody on behalf of customers at Stablehouse face no risk of contamination from the activities and or financial health of its parent or sister companies in the XBTO group. For completeness of information, under \u201cBermuda Insolvency Law\u201d the equivalent of \u201cBankruptcy law\u201d in other jurisdictions, companies that are regulated under DABA, the Bermuda Digital Asset Business Act, and are licensed for Custody among other activities, can offer the custody service to customers, in a \u201cBankruptcy remote\u201d fashion, as long as the company complies with the custody code of practice under DABA. This means that any custodied asset is segregated from the corporate accounts, and a failure of either or both companies would not result in the client\u2019s assets being included in any would-be bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, the assets in custody are segregated using an independent technology provider, and all customer accounts are also segregated from company accounts; the assets are never commingled, and, in the event of an insolvency, the creditors cannot have access under \u201cinsolvency law\u201d to customer assets. Under any winding up of Stablehouse under Bermuda law, custody customers will be entitled to return of their assets in accordance with the terms of their agreements. And, the directors of Stablehouse do not have the power under Bermuda law to voluntarily commence an insolvency proceeding in another jurisdiction on behalf of Stablehouse capable of varying the rights of the customers to their assets. Stablehouse, ensures at all times that the terms of the relevant agreement with the customer provide that at all times ownership of the customer assets remain with the customer and that each customer is internally registered or recorded in the name of the customer to whom it belongs. Stablehouse ensures that the customer assets are not hypothecated for use by Stablehouse for its own activities, and the Memorandum and Bye laws of the company restrict the ability of directors to commence insolvency proceedings on behalf of the company without the consent of the custody customers and/or an independent director or shareholder appointed for that purpose. In addition, in conjunction with their regulated status, both firms must undergo regular operational and financial audits to confirm that they operate compliantly. This is critically different from what may have happened recently with FTX, Celsius, or otherwise. 2.We would certainly welcome it, but we do not expect them to vote in our favor simply because they are investors in both. We would expect their governance to rule whether a conflict of interest exists. 3.In 2021, Stablehouse offered a promotional rate that was appropriate for the competitive but unsustainable market environment at the time. Stablehouse\u2019s primary objective was retail growth, and it conducted a CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) analysis to determine a reasonable interest rate to pay, which was 12%. However, in the current environment, Stablehouse recognizes that crypto-native yields are lower and unattainable in size. Therefore, Stablehouse has reduced that rate commensurately to a level it feels is sustainable over the long term for its current customers. Behzad Taufiq ",
