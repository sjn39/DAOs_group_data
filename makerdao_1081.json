There are 262M DAI circulating on BSC from the Binance-Peg Dai Token contract. There is 192M DAI in the Binance: Binance-Peg Tokens bridge contract on Ethereum. I\u2019m trying to find out where the remaining 70M DAI is held that has been bridged to BSC. Thanks for any info. I also have another (less important) question: On Cronos, there is 161M DAI circulating. This has not been bridged from anywhere. Is it really DAI? ",

I recently noticed the same thing happening with TUSD. For the Crypto.com one, there is no way a wallet, or even 3-4 wallets could hold 161M DAI without being conspicuous on the Top DAI Holders list on Etherscan. So will continue searching for that answer. ",
