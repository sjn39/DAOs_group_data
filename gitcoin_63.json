Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!  If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here!   Key actions for this week:  Vote on the proposal to start a Partnership and Mutual Grant with Wonder  Help us improve the GitcoinDAO Digest by answering a couple of quick questions and qualify for a very special POAP!  Jump in to Owocki\u2019s AMA that will run for the month of April!    Meta-Governance    @ceresstation announced the start of Constructing a Mutual Grants Committee as opportunities continue to emerge to align with partners who are committed to a public goods related mission. The committee will fill the current lack of formalization behind mutual grant agreements. Stewards and members of the Public goods funding-Workstream are invited to join a working group   The discussion about a Partnership and Mutual Grant with Wonder now includes takes from several community members and Stewards. Those in favor generally approve of reducing the grant to 50k GTC from 100k and point out that Wonder is being built by KERNEL alumni. Those against the proposal point out that Wonder is not yet open-source, and does not appear to have a clear or special strategy to build a public good.   Huxwell gives an update on the dCompass project nearing alpha release and asks the community for advice on how to continue funding the project. Check out the staging app now!   In DAO Design Best Practices, David_Dyor and Layn describe how Gitcoin does not have an IRP (Incident Response Plan) like the ones used by organizations to respond to emergencies or natural disasters. David encourages Layn to start drafting an IRP for Gitcoin and Layn updates us on their research findings. Few DAOs have IRPs but MakerDAO notably has a well-documented Emergency Shutdown plan.   Bob gives Gitcoin grants advice based on [his] observations that grantees did not have enough information about the status their grant was in and why. He proposes creating additional grant statuses to provide greater granularity and detail to the grantee.
