But say I have the encoded binary data. That is, I want to make do a transaction to a given contract address, with a given value, and given hex data. That doesn\u2019t seem to be possible with EIP-681. That seems to me a huge design flaw in the EIP itself, or is there a different EIP with a different url schema for that? ",
