Need an outlet for all of your wild ideas about where this technology will take us? If you\u2019ve ever thought about podcasting, here\u2019s your opportunity! The Content team currently distributes an audio version of governance updates and would like to expand into other types of audio content. Audio content is uploaded via Anchor.FM, which helps us publish to:  Spotify Google Podcasts Breaker Pocket Casts Radio Public  We\u2019re looking for individuals interested in hosting podcasts featuring different types of content on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. Whether you\u2019re interested in doing news updates, interviewing guests, or have a different format you want to try out, we would like to offer help to hosts interested in producing content. Publishing insightful content offers newcomers a chance to explore DeFi and helps position MakerDAO as an authority on topics relating to DAOs and DeFi. We can offer as much or as little help as needed:  Pre-production  Format & Development   Production  Script writing Brainstorming new segments Tracking analytics Creating promotional materials Scheduling guests    If you have ideas about the types of content that could be useful, without being further involved, please feel free to leave them in the comments. You can also message me here or on rocket (@jerry.g), if you prefer to talk privately. ",
